<p>TechCrunch just hosted its first pitch-off in Detroit and we&#8217;re pleased to announce <a href="https://www.dietid.com">Diet ID</a> won the event. The company, based in Detroit and founded in 2016 by Dr. David Katz, gives users a clinically tested approach to dietary assessment and management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/61f51db4-eafc-45e9-a2f1-6016dcb358e0?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">news roundup from last week</a> was probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had in a few months, so make sure to catch up on that if you haven&#8217;t. That said, here&#8217;s a rundown of what we got into on the show this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">new Clubhouse round</a> has us thinking about what is a good venture-style bet, and what isn&#8217;t. At least you can&#8217;t fault the Clubhouse crew for not having conviction.</li>
<li>UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">as expected</a>.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s an Apple event this week, which caused us to wonder why more startups aren&#8217;t competing with the giant.</li>
<li>Cryptos have recovered from the flash crash, which had us thinking.</li>
<li>Druva raised $147 million as TechCrunch will report later today, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">Razorpay raised even more capital</a> at a newly refreshed valuation.</li>
<li>Finally, DoNotPay had some news, but it&#8217;s corporate ethos proved even more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The week is here, everyone! It&#8217;s Monday! We can do this!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook today announced a new feature that will allow users to export their Facebook posts and notes to a number of third-party services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/transfer-your-facebook-posts-and-notes-with-our-expanded-data-portability-tool/">announced</a> a new feature that will allow users to export their Facebook posts and notes to a number of third-party services. Although the company has long since offered tools that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/facebook-now-allows-you-to-download-your-information/">let you download the information</a> you&#8217;ve posted to Facebook, the tool launching today offers a more practical way of saving that data &#8212; by allowing you to export your notes and posts to popular services like Google Docs, Blogger, or WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Facebook users will find this latest feature under the &#8220;Your Facebook Information&#8221; menu in Settings, where you&#8217;ll then click &#8220;Transfer Your Information.&#8221; A series of prompts will walk you through the process to transfer you data to the one of the available destinations.</p>
<p>To protect the data, Facebook says it will ask users to re-enter their password before the transfer begins, which it also does with other exports. The process will encrypt the data as it moves between Facebook and the other service, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move to support the export of text-based content is interesting, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html">it&#8217;s been reported</a> Facebook is developing a competitor to newsletter platform Substack. The social network aims to capitalize on the growing momentum in the newsletter industry, which has recently seen a number of top writers leave larger publications in order to connect with their audience directly, via paid newsletters. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">also acquired a newsletter business, Revue</a>, to pursue the same goals. While Facebook didn&#8217;t say if it&#8217;s upcoming product would be included in the export procedure announced today, it makes for a good hedge against any sort of anti-competitive claims if and when Facebook rolls out the new service.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s addition is part of Facebook&#8217;s larger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/20/data-transfer-project/">Data Transfer Project</a>, a collaboration between tech giants designed to give users more ways to move their content between services. Last year, for example, Facebook added a feature that gave users a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/facebook-now-allows-users-in-the-u-s-canada-to-export-photos-and-videos-to-google-photos/">export their Facebook photos and videos to Google Photos</a>, as a result of the team-up. Users can now also export photos and videos to Backblaze, Dropbox, and Koofr, as well.</p>
<p>Alongside news of its announcement, Facebook argued for regulation in the area of data portability. It said there should be laws that determine which data should be made portable, and who is responsible for protecting the data once it has been transferred. The company also pointed to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/comments-on-data-portability/">comments it filed with the FTC</a> last year as well as <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/privacy-and-data-portability/">a white paper</a> that explored the privacy questions that surround the development of data portability tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlassian today announced that it has acquired Brisbane, Australia-based <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/">ThinkTilt</a>, the company behind the popular Jira-centric no-code/low-code form builder <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/proforma/forms-for-jira-service-management">ProForma</a>. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The acquisition is meant to help strengthen <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management">Jira Service Management</a>, Atlassian&#8217;s version of Jira that focuses on IT service management (ITSM). Launched in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/introducing-jira-service-management">November 2020</a>, Jira Service Management is meant to remove the barriers between development and IT operations and provide them with a unified platform, but it also enables other teams (think HR, legal or finance) to set up their own service operations.</p>
<p>Edwin Wong, Atlassian&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">head of product, IT, tells me that the company already has over 30,000 customers who use Jira Service Management (though to be fair, Jira Service Management is in part a rebrand of Jira Service Desk with additional ITSM functionality, so a lot of these users were previous Jira Service Desk customers).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One thing that I keep hearing from our customers when we speak to them, is that what makes us different is that Jira Service Management really helps them deliver value quickly, without the cost and complexity of some of the other ITSM solutions that they&#8217;ve used in the past. It&#8217;s just easier to set up, get going and maintain,&#8221; Wong said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140145" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/atlassian_thinktilt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140145" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2140145" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/atlassian_thinktilt.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while at launch, the company&#8217;s focus was very much on bringing developers and IT together, Wong stressed that today&#8217;s announcement is very much about how IT can help other business teams develop services as well &#8212; and cope with the reality of remote and hybrid work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Employees now expect digital experiences from the employers and their colleagues as much as they expect them in every aspect of their consumer lives, as these two things blend together,&#8221; Wong noted. &#8220;Fact is, you can&#8217;t really walk up to the HR team anymore when you&#8217;re working remote and say, &#8216;hey, I&#8217;ve got someone coming in.&#8217; You can&#8217;t go tap on their shoulder and say, &#8216;hey, upgrade that campaign for me.&#8217; That&#8217;s not really going to work anymore.&#8221; </span>But ThinkTilt, Wong argues, helps businesses &#8220;create amazing customer and employee experiences, and allows anyone to do that really quickly and easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, ProForma comes with all the tools you would need to create forms (and there are <a href="https://docs.thinktilt.com/proforma/proforma-features.1646821396.html#">a lot of them</a>) and it is already deeply integrated with Jira and Jira Service Management. It also features over 300 templates for often used business flows like candidate approval tracking in an HR system, for example. &#8220;What we&#8217;re really providing for our customers is not just the features and saying, &#8216;hey, figure it out yourselves,&#8217; but really that practice and the [ThinkTilt] team really brings with them an amazing amount of knowledge with that,&#8221; Wong said about ProForma&#8217;s set of templates.</p>
<p>One neat tool more companies should offer: ProForma features a fully functional <a href="https://proformademo.thinktilt.net/">demo mode</a> that lets you try out the product before even signing up for its free trial.</p>
<p>Jira Service Management, of course, can already build all these workflows, too. That is, after all, what the product is all about. But with ProForma, an HR team could capture all the information they need to capture for a given workflow, with Jira Service Management becoming the backend for those operations. Or they can easily create forms based on existing workflows, too, and enhance the user experience that way.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last five years, Atlassian regularly acquired a company or two per year. Currently, though, it feels like this pace is picking up a bit. Indeed, the acquisition of ThinkTilt marks the company&#8217;s fourth acquisition in the last twelve months. In February, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/atlassian-is-acquiring-chartio-to-bring-data-visualization-to-the-platform/">visualization and analytics company Chartio</a>, while in 2020, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/atlassian-acquires-halp-to-bring-slack-integration-to-the-forefront/">helpdesk tool Halp</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/atlassian-acquires-asset-management-company-mindville/">asset management company Mindville</a>. If anything, I would expect this pace to increase in the next year as Atlassian aims to capitalize on current trends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">Zoom Apps and the Marketplace</a> as a place to sell them last year, it was a big signal that the company wanted to be more than just a popular video conferencing application. It wanted to be a platform, which developers could use to build applications on top of Zoom.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $100 million investment fund to encourage the most promising startups using the Zoom toolset to launch a business by giving them funding, while using that as a springboard to encourage other developers to take advantage of the tooling on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re looking for companies with a viable product and early market traction, and a commitment to developing on and investing in the Zoom ecosystem,&#8221; Zoom&#8217;s Colin Born wrote <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-apps-fund/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s corporate development team with heavy involvement from the Zoom executive team will be in charge of selecting and managing the portfolio companies. The company plans to invest between $250,000 and $2.5 million in each startup in the portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big part of this is helping facilitate those early companies and giving them the access to resources and connections within Zoom, so that they can grow and succeed,&#8221; Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson told me.</p>

<p>While the company wants to invest successfully, a big part of this is using the fund to encourage developers to take advantage of the platform offerings from Zoom. &#8220;We feel we&#8217;ll help [these startups] build these valuable and engaging experiences and by having that and by investing, we&#8217;re helping bring solutions and further expand the ecosystem and our customers should benefit from that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zoom has a number of developer tools that budding entrepreneurs can use to build applications that take advantage of Zoom functionality. In March <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">the company introduced an SDK</a> (software development kit) designed to help programmers embed Zoom functionality inside other applications.</p>
<p>The company also provides tools for embedding an application inside of Zoom, such as one designed for a specific purpose like education or healthcare, and it has created a centralized place to learn about all of them at <a href="http://developer.zoom.us">developer.zoom.us</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is not alone in investing in companies building applications on its platform. Firms like Sequoia, Maven Ventures and Emergence Capital have already started investing in startups building companies on top of Zoom including <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/">Mmhmm</a>, <a href="https://www.dockethq.com/calendar-app/">Docket</a> and <a href="https://www.classedu.com/">ClassEdu</a>.</p>
<p>The fund gives startup founders one more option to get some funding to get their idea off the ground. Ittelson says all of the investments will be seed level investments for starters and they will be providing developer and business resources to help the young startups build and distribute their products.</p>
<p>While he says that the company will be on the lookout for promising startups to bring into the portfolio, interested entrepreneurs can apply directly at <a href="https://zoom.us/fund">zoom.com/fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lawyer and veteran of the startup world (but <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1105859481219616770?lang=en">don&#8217;t call him a VC</a>), Andrew Yang rose to national prominence during his 2020 campaign for president. A hard-fought battle in a crowded field, Yang made a name for himself as an outsider candidate, heavily favoring a technocratic approach to policy that reflected his entrepreneurial background.</p>
<p>His approach earned a sizable following through a self-stylized Yang Gang of supporters. In particular, his “Freedom Dividend” proposal helped reintroduce concepts of universal basic income (UBI) back into mainstream American discourse.</p>
<p>Yang dropped out of the race in February 2020, after failing to crack 3% in the New Hampshire primary. At the time, he told supporters, “we&#8217;re just getting started.” In January of this year, he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York in a bid to succeed fellow 2020 presidential candidate Bill de Blasio. Once again, Yang has entered a crowded field. This time, however, he does so with national name recognition that has helped propel him to the top of polls.</p>
<p>Like the presidential election before it, the New York City mayoral race comes at an unprecedented time. More than a year after becoming the epicenter of the pandemic, the city is still reeling from the impact of COVID-19. It has made for a unique campaign, with candidates relying on social media more than ever &#8212; to sometimes mixed results.</p>
<p>As the United States’ largest city looks to reopen, the next mayor will face unique challenges &#8212; and, perhaps, opportunities. We spoke with Yang over Zoom to discuss his hopes for the city and the role technology might play in getting there.</p>

<p><strong>You are <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1374689935547101186?lang=en">on record</a> as being supportive of the Amazon Union. They were dealt a big blow recently with the vote. In 2021, what do you think is the best course of action for blue-collar and gig workers going forward?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s been keeping up with me knows I am deeply concerned about the impact of technology on blue-collar workers, in particular. If you look at anything from trucking to retail, to even things like butchering and meatpacking, we&#8217;re automating them away, much more quickly.</p>
<p>There are some instances where unions can help, but if you look at the macro-environment, the proportion of American workers who are unionized has gone down by about half. And so, we should do much more for workers who right now don&#8217;t have benefits in terms of portable benefits programs.</p>
<p>I think versions of freelancing and the gig economy are here to stay. And a lot of those workers don&#8217;t have meaningful benefits in terms of healthcare or retirement or other provisions. We essentially are running an industrial-era economy that has transformed, but our institutions haven&#8217;t caught up, and we need to try and get them to catch up as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><strong>We&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of union movement in tech. Kickstarter is a good example. Do you think unions should play a role in both blue and white-collar tech jobs?</strong></p>
<p>I was for the union drive in the Amazon warehouse, because I think it would have created really positive pressure on Amazon to treat workers better in many different environments. I&#8217;m for really rethinking a lot of the things we&#8217;re doing right now, where if you look at top-line, Keynes predicted that by now we&#8217;d be so wealthy that we&#8217;d be working only 15 hours a week. And he was right about the top-line growth. We are as wealthy as he predicted, but our work weeks are getting longer, not shorter. And that&#8217;s having adverse consequences for people of every background, white collar, blue collar.</p>
<p>I think we should be exploring bigger modifications, like a four-day work week, which studies have shown that we can get the same amount done in four days in many, many environments. And then our mental health would improve. Our outlooks would improve. So I think we should be thinking bigger. And right now unions have been a path of the middle class for many, many Americans, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be unions alone that can solve some of these problems, particularly in many environments where unions aren&#8217;t terribly prevalent.</p>

<p><strong>You <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/03/29/andrew-yang-new-york-city-mayoral-race/">recently said</a> that letting Amazon and its 26,000 jobs walk away from New York City was not a good thing in reference to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/amazon-drops-plans-for-new-york-hq2/">HQ2</a>. But you, along with other Democratic politicians, have criticized the fact that they don&#8217;t pay federal taxes. If a company like Amazon were to relocate or bring a substantial number of jobs in New York City, how would you hold them accountable?</strong></p>
<p>I guess there&#8217;s a difference between the local impact and the federal impact. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good thing that a trillion-dollar company doesn&#8217;t pay any federal taxes, but if you are a locality and someone comes along and it&#8217;s going to be good for your community, then you say, &#8220;yes.&#8221; I want to make the case that New York City loves business. It loves businesses big and small that are based here. And it wants more companies to know that New York City is the best place to build a world-class company and culture. So, that would be my stance as mayor, if a large tech company wanted to come to New York, and if there&#8217;s a large tech company that&#8217;s reading this right now or a small one or an entrepreneur, come to New York! Early next year, if I&#8217;m mayor, I&#8217;m going to be doing everything I can to help you.</p>

<p><strong>A lot of the pushback that they were getting were around incentives. Is there a way to bring a company like Amazon into New York without offering that?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good when localities end up bidding against each other to try and bring in various companies. One of my proposals when I was running for national office was that we should actually make it impossible to do so by making any benefits that are provided to a company in that manner themselves taxable, at a rate of a 100%.</p>
<p>So, the entire thing becomes a non-starter and companies then would be based where they think it&#8217;s most advantageous to their organization to be based, not by pitting cities against each other as to who&#8217;s going to bend over backwards the most. I think that would be a better system and people were upset about the level of subsidies that were supposed to be directed to Amazon with HQ2, and that was legitimate concern.</p>
<p>And some of the local impacts were also of legitimate concern. But again, big picture, you cannot let an employer that&#8217;s going to create 26,000 high-paying jobs and probably an additional 100,000 or so service jobs walk away. You have to say New York City is the place for you.</p>
<p><strong>Among U.S. politicians, you’re probably the most closely associated with the concept of UBI. Is that something you see being implemented on a city level?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;ve been dozens of cities at this point that have either already rolled out some kind of basic income trial or are exploring doing so. And I&#8217;ve committed to making New York City the home for perhaps the biggest basic income trial outside of our federal government, sending everyone stimulus checks (which by the way I loved). And I think that cash relief and other measures are the future. So of course, I&#8217;m going to make New York City the site for one of the biggest basic income programs and in the country. And I think people are increasingly recognizing that it&#8217;s the best way to give many people a chance to be healthier, mentally healthier, more stable, more enterprising, more creative, more nurturing.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the pushback against UBI is around the loss of a social safety net. Do you think that there&#8217;s a way to implement it in New York City without getting rid of some of these existing benefits?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The program we&#8217;re looking to roll out in New York targets the extreme poor, and would have no interaction with existing social safety nets. And I think that, again, cities around the country have made this work. And in no case that I&#8217;m aware of, has it actually interfered with someone&#8217;s ability to aid get from an existing program.</p>
<p><strong>Can and should government effectively regulate against the implementation of robotics and automation when it comes to job loss?</strong></p>
<p>I think economy-wide, that would be a completely ineffective strategy. It&#8217;d be almost impossible to implement. There might be an isolated case where you could do something that would make sense, but even then, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the best way to go. I think the better approach is to try and speed up the evolution of our economy so that it works for more and more people, even as technology is advancing. And I do believe cash relief and universal basic income are the first big step. And we all know the pandemic has accelerated many of these trends. Anyone that reads TechCrunch knows that automation technologies have been elevated in terms of corporate priorities.</p>
<p><strong>You tweeted that you <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1359992211186843649">would invest in making the city a hub for BTC</a> and other cryptocurrencies. You&#8217;ve also been pretty vocal about climate change. Is that a hard square to circle?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the cryptocurrencies that are out there, frankly, have already been mined. And so it&#8217;s not like you necessarily are looking at consuming tons of energy, if you say that the world&#8217;s financial capital in New York City is going to be very friendly to cryptocurrencies. And we&#8217;re talking about a trillion-dollar asset class at this point. If you are the financial capital, you have to make sure that your city is among the leaders in developing applications. I&#8217;ve been in touch with various people from the cryptocurrency community about ways that we can make New York City a proving ground for some of the applications that people have been working on.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond cryptocurrency, what role do you see technology playing in bringing people and businesses back to the city, following the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>I was talking to my friend, Eliot Horowitz, who is one of the co-founders of MongoDB, and he&#8217;s starting a new company around robotics. He says that when he&#8217;s trying to recruit people for his new company and says, &#8220;we&#8217;re headquartered in New York City and you would be based here&#8221; they are excited about it. A lot of people want to live in New York City.</p>
<p>New York City has the potential to be number one in technology, in part because I think the next generation of technologies will very much interact hand in hand with other industries, like the way that Peloton is a tech company, but it&#8217;s also a fitness and a exercise equipment company. You can see that New York City remains the hub for finance, but also for culture and branding and tourism and fashion and art and other industries.</p>
<p>This is going to be an incredible time for New York City to take advantage of its stature and the breadth of diversity of our economy to be competitive for any tech company.</p>
<p><strong>For a lot of companies working from home is becoming the standard. When so many tech companies in particular are opening up to remote work, how do you keep people excited about coming to a place like New York when they could potentially work from anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>I think right now a lot of people are still adapting. If, let&#8217;s say, you&#8217;ve worked remotely for a year (and that can mean a lot of different things), but a lot of people want to be able to go outside and experience the food, the culture, the nightlife, the companionship of a place like New York. And one thing that I know that tech companies prize is the ability to innovate and create. And studies have shown very consistently that workers are more creative and innovative when they&#8217;re together in the same office. That&#8217;s even true for academics producing research, that academics in the same physical proximity produce higher-level research.</p>
<p>And technology is the kind of industry where if you have even a tiny, competitive edge, it can be worth an incredible amount. And so if you imagine that Zoom is essentially like an equalizer, like a place like New York City will be a competitive edge and Eliot Horowitz is already experiencing that. I think that there are a lot of other companies that already know that. I talk to CEOs who are champing at the bit to get people back into the office for this reason.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean some form of incentivizing businesses to bring people physically together into offices?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t rule anything out where New York City is concerned, because that is going to be central to our case. New York City is a premium environment, and there are ways that we can help establish that premium by helping people understand just what we can do for companies that are trying to grow and compete.</p>
<p><strong>What are your top cybersecurity priorities for New York?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough because, the fact is a lot of these systems are vulnerable right now. A lot of public agencies haven&#8217;t really properly invested in cybersecurity. So my priority would be to identify, frankly, the elements of New York&#8217;s infrastructure, that if they were hacked, it would be especially crippling and devastating, and invest in countermeasures trying to protect those assets as quickly as possible. Frankly, recognizing that it&#8217;s impossible to be a hundred percent secure in a lot of these arenas, but we can control our risks better than what we&#8217;re doing right now, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>You got <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/04/12/yang-tweets-about-street-vendors-and-ignites-fury-on-the-left-1373504">pushback</a> against the food cart comments on Twitter earlier this week. Do you have any regrets about the ways in which you&#8217;ve used social media during the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>If you look at my social media, the vast, vast majority of it is promoting being out and about New York City, whether it&#8217;s a restaurant that my wife and I are having dinner at, or attending a Yankee&#8217;s game at Yankee Stadium (though I am a Mets fan). when I walked the streets of New York City, people are really excited to see me most all the time. And then I&#8217;ll often take a picture with them, and I posted one today that I think made that person very happy.</p>
<p>So I think that my use of social media is hopefully giving people a glimpse into where New York is heading, and the fact that frankly, we can activate a news cycle based upon social media is something that I think is very positive, generally. And it&#8217;s something that I hope to use to benefit New York when I&#8217;m mayor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gm.com/">General Motors</a> is joining the list of big automakers picking their horses in the race to develop better batteries for electric vehicles with its lead of a $139 million investment into the lithium-metal battery developer, <a href="https://www.ses.ai/">SES</a>.</p>
<p>Volkswagen <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005943/en/%C2%A0QuantumScape-Meets-Volkswagen-Technical-Milestone-Clearing-Way-for-100M-Investment#:~:text=QuantumScape%20Meets%20Volkswagen%20Technical%20Milestone%2C%20Clearing%20Way%20for%20%24100M%20Investment,-March%2031%2C%202021&amp;text=SAN%20JOSE%2C%20Calif.&amp;text=This%20will%20be%20the%20second,a%20total%20%24200%20million%20investment.">has QuantumScape</a>; Ford <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/ford-s-battery-bet-says-automotive-testing-will-start-in-2022#:~:text=Ford%20is%20weighing%20whether%20to,Jim%20Farley%20said%20last%20month.&amp;text=The%20company%20estimates%20its%20first,start%20producing%20cells%20in%202024.">has invested in SolidPower</a> (along with Hyundai and BMW); and now with SES&#8217; big backing from General Motors most of the big American and European automakers have placed their bets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are beyond R&amp;D development,&#8221; said SES chief executive Hu Qichao in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;The main purposes of this funding is to, one, mprove the key material, this lithium metal electrolyte on the anode side and the cathode side, and, two, to improve the scale of the current cell from the iPhone battery size to the size that can be used in cars.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a third component to the financing as well, Hu said, which is to increase the company&#8217;s algorithmic capabilities to monitor and manage cell performance. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that we and our OEM partners care about,&#8221; said Hu.</p>
<p>The investment from GM s the culmination of nearly six years of work with the big automaker, said Hu. &#8220;We started working with them in 2015. For the next three years we will go through the standard automation approval processes. Going from &#8216;A&#8217; sample to &#8216;B&#8217; sample all the way through &#8216;D&#8217; sample,&#8221; which is the final testing phase before commercial availability of SES&#8217; batteries in cars.</p>
<p>While Tesla, the current leader in electric vehicle sales in America, is looking to improve the form factors of its batteries to make them more powerful and more efficient, Hu said that the chemistry isn&#8217;t that different. Solid state batteries represent a step change in battery technology that makes batteries more powerful, easier to recycle, and potentially more stable.</p>
<p>As Mark Harris <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">wrote in TechCrunch</a> earlier earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are many different kinds of SSB but they all lack a liquid electrolyte for moving electrons (electricity) between the battery’s positive (cathode) and negative (anode) electrodes. The liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries limit the materials the electrodes can be made from, and the shape and size of the battery. Because liquid electrolytes are usually flammable, lithium-ion batteries are also prone to runaway heating and even explosion. SSBs are much less flammable and can use metal electrodes or complex internal designs to store more energy and move it faster — giving higher power and faster charging.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-induced lockdowns halted many a home decoration project, but the irony was that our homes became even more important. But where to get ideas to decorate? Home decor experts could no longer visit. Now an LA-based startup is addressing this digitization of the interior design market, but kicking off with a typically LA-oriented, high-end clientele.</p>
<p>The LA-based <a href="http://Theexpert.com">The Expert</a> &#8211; a platform for video consultations with interior designers &#8211; has raised a $3 million seed funding round led by Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Sweet Capital, Promus Ventures, Golden Ventures, Jeffrey Katzenberg’s WndrCo, AD 100 designer Brigette Romanek, and movie star Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p>The Expert offers 1:1 video consultations with leading interior designers, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders consist of Jake Arnold, a celebrity interior designer (who has worked with John Legend, Rashida Jones, and Cameron Diaz among, others) and YC-alumni, Leo Seigal, who previously founded and sold Represent.com to CustomInk for $100m in 2015.</p>
<p>After being “inundated” with DMs during lockdown asking for his advice, Arnold says he realized he didn’t have the business model to help non-retainer clients. So he joined Seigal to create The Expert.</p>
<p>The Expert features 85 designers, so far. CLients click on their profiles to see rates and availability and then click to book. Clients can upload any relevant floor plans, images of the home, inspiration ideas etc for the designer to review ahead of time. They then join a zoom link (the platform uses the Zoom API) to meet with an interior designer and can leave a review afterward.</p>
<p>The company claims it has 700 designers on its waitlist and will hit $1m of bookings after its first quarter, after launching in early February this year.</p>
<p>The startup has some competition in the form of Modsy and Havenly, but The Expert says it is going for a more high-end experience, where clients are willing to pay $300-$2,500 for an hour of a designers’ time. The startup takes a 20% cut of the transaction.</p>
<p>Co-founder Leo Seigal said: “We were able to attract a crazy roster of designers partly thanks to co-founder Jake who is so highly regarded in the industry, and partly due to a timeliness of offering which is far above anything that has been tried in the home space.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Gwyneth Paltrow said: “I’ve always felt that access to great design – and those who create it – is too rare of a commodity. It’s a game-changer for someone without the budget for a full-time designer to have this roster of talent on speed dial.”</p>
<p>Nicole Johnson, Partner at Forerunner said: “We’ve been thinking through new models for the interior design sector for years at Forerunner, observing room for improvement for the trade and consumers alike. Interior design is arguably the ultimate, best-suited source of home inspiration and commerce enablement for consumers, but the trade is a famously walled garden. The Expert solves for this, connecting anyone, anywhere with the world’s leading interior designers via video consultation—allowing Experts to broaden their reach and monetization in a predictable, rewarding, and low-friction way.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The online grocery market is poised to get a little more crowded in the next several months, with the launch of a startup led by a veteran founder who has taken big hits from Amazon in the past, but now hopes to come back swinging with the help of an army of robots.</p>
<p>Home Delivery Services, a delivery startup founded by Louis Borders that plans to sell groceries and general merchandise online using a massive, automated system to power the fulfillment and logistics, is today announcing funding of $3 million to finalize the finishing touches on an AI-based robotic demonstration center outside of Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The plan is for the center to showcase the technology that HDS Global has been building over the last several years (plans first emerged <a href="http://recode.net/2014/04/18/webvans-founder-is-back-and-hes-building-another-grocery-delivery-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as long ago as 2014</a>), robots and other automation under the name RoboFS, that will power a wide fulfillment system extending from stocking, sorting and picking items that will then be delivered, mostly by humans, to consumers, to take on what Borders describes as a $1 trillion grocery market in the US.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The $1 trillion grocery in the US is not well penetrated,&#8221; he said, comparing the opportunity to the one that Walmart seized 20 years ago in physical stores. &#8220;We want to offer a complete selection of groceries and general merchandise in one order.&#8221; The idea is to build warehouses that cover some 150,000 square feet to do $200 million in revenue over millions of SKUs for one-hour deliveries.</p>
<p>A funding round of $3 million &#8212; which is coming from Bob DiRumauldo, the chairman of Ulta and CEO of Naples Ventures &#8212; might sound a little modest, especially considering the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been collectively raised by online grocery players in the last several months &#8212; all of them racing to scale up their businesses in the wake of huge consumer demand for online shopping alternatives to visiting stores in person in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Borders said in an interview that this small round is primarily to kick off the demo center to show off RoboFS to help bring on new investors and new partners with the proof of concept. It already has a few investor partners, Ingram Micro and Toyota, and the idea will be to add more.</p>
<p>And he confirmed that HDS &#8212; which will unveil a different name when it launches commercially, he added &#8212; is also working on a much bigger round of funding, likely to close in the next 15 months, to fuel that wider commercial launch. It has raised $38 million to date, he said.</p>
<p>Borders&#8217; name will ring a bell to many in the worlds of retail and technology: he was the founder and head of the Borders book superstores and later started Webvan, a very early mover in the world of online grocery ordering and delivery. Both companies crashed hard in their times and became case studies, and more specifically cautionary tales, around how to build businesses in the digital era: beware the specter of Amazon, of innovating too early or too late, of being less agile, too inefficient, and of not correctly identifying where the puck was going and skating to it.</p>
<p>This time around, the idea is that he&#8217;s focusing first and foremost on technology to try to head those problems off in ways that his previous ventures did not. This is one reason why HDS has spent so many years on building the technology: automation, specifically in areas like picking groceries, is one area that has foxed a lot of companies to date &#8212; Amazon continues to work on this, and Ocado, a leader in the space, has yet to launch robotic picking although it says this is coming soon. Borders estimates that bringing in automation can bring down the cost of labor by two-thirds, with people instead focused on delivering and selling at people&#8217;s doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we went out to buy the tech we didn’t see what we wanted,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;We&#8217;re tryin to be smart about technology but the tech was just not there when we decided to build this 5 years ago. So we started with building that system. This became our opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interesting opportunity is not just to build services that don&#8217;t quite exist yet, but to provide a set of infrastructure that can be a viable alternative and supply chain to Amazon &#8212; a common goal that brings together players from a lot of disparate yet interconnected areas in the grocery value chain. This is one reason why companies like Toyota and Ingram have come on board to work with the startup.</p>
<p>Given that it&#8217;s been so many years in the making and has yet to see the proof of concept, there will continue to be a lot of factors that could not come together, but it&#8217;s a play that HDS, Borders and their partners are willing to make.</p>
<p>“Ecommerce has become an essential component in people’s daily lives but what many don’t realize is that it can be exponentially better than what is offered today,” said DiRumauldo in a statement. “I was attracted to working with Louis again and to the company’s big idea approach – an all-new robotic fulfillment system purpose-built for ecommerce – which can deliver a vastly improved experience at lower cost. I am excited to be a part of bringing this vision to life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has marked a major milestone in its extraterrestrial exploration program, with the first powered flight of an aircraft on Mars. The flight occurred very early this morning, and NASA received telemetry confirming that the &#8216;Ingenuity&#8217; helicopter it sent to Mars with its Perseverance rover. This is a major achievement, in no small part because the atmosphere is so thin on Mars that creating a rotor-powered craft like Ingenuity that can actually use it to produce lift is a huge challenge.</p>
<p>This first flight of Ingenuity was an autonomous remote flight, with crews on Earth controlling it just by sending commands through at the appropriate times to signal when it should begin and end its 40-second trip through the Martian &#8216;air.&#8217; While that might seem like a really short trip, it provides immense value in terms of the data collected by the helicopter during the flight. Ingenuity actually has a much more powerful processor on board than even the Perseverance rover itself, and that&#8217;s because it intends to gather massive amounts of data about what happens during its flight test so that it can transmit that to the rover, which then leapfrogs the information back to Earth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140219" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ingenuity-flight.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140219" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2140219" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ingenuity-flight.gif" alt="NASA's Ingenuity helicopter in flight on Mars." width="1000" height="557" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140219" class="wp-caption-text">NASA&#8217;s Ingenuity helicopter in flight on Mars.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As mentioned, this is the first ever flight of a powered vehicle on Mars, so while there&#8217;s been lots of modelling and simulation work predicting how it would go, no one knew for sure what would happen before this live test. Ingenuity has to rotate its rotor at a super-fast 2,500 RPM, for instance, compared to around 400 to 500 RPM for a helicopter on Earth, because of how thin the atmosphere is on Mars, which produced significant technical challenges.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of even flying a helicopter on Mars? There are a few important potential applications, but the first is that it sets up future exploration missions, making it possible for NASA to use aerial vehicles for future science on the red planet. It can explore things like caves and peaks that rovers can&#8217;t reach, for instance. Eventually, NASA is also hoping to see if there&#8217;s potential for use of aerial vehicles in future human exploration of Mars, too — martian explorers would benefit significantly from being able to use aircraft as well as ground vehicles when we eventually get there.</p>

<p>Now, NASA will work on unpacking the data to glean more insights from the flight, and get back more photos and video of the helicopter during its ascent, hover and landing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy ‘social audio’ app <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> has raised a Series C funding round, reportedly valuing the company at $4 billion. Clubhouse said the new round of financing was led by Andrew Chen of Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from DST Global, Tiger Global and Elad Gil. This round means Clubhouse has tripled the valuation it attained in January when Andreessen Horowitz led its Series B funding round.</p>
<p>The funding comes as Twitter, Spotify, Facebook, Telegram, Discord <em>and</em> LinkedIn are all prepping similar features to Clubhouse’s live audio streaming rooms, which has attracted attention for hosting live chats with the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Indeed, Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/18/22390742/facebook-podcasts-clubhouse-audio-launch-spotify-zuckerberg-apple">reported</a> that Facebook will announce a series of &#8216;social audio&#8217; products only today.</p>
<p>But, unusually for such a late stage of funding, the company has not revealed the amount raised. Industry sources say that this is probably because the Series C funding round is ‘multi-stage’ and therefore not officially closed. Alternatively, the company is &#8216;hyping&#8217; itself ahead of a sale, as is often the case with &#8216;hot&#8217; startups. Twitter reportedly broke off talks to acquire the startup at a $4 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And despite appearances that this funding round has been timed to coincide with the launch this week of Facebook’s Clubhouse clone, one well-placed source told me “this funding round has been in the works for the last 1.5 months&#8221; and that some offers have been &#8220;above 2x&#8221; the $4bn valuation. On other words, there are some investors out there who think Clubhouse is worth <em>more</em> than $8bn.</p>
<p>So far Clubhouse is demurring on all this, and declining to comment more directly to the media. The company disclosed the news about the funding during its weekly &#8216;town hall&#8217; chat last Sunday night and in a <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/growing-a-global-community">blog post</a>, the company said the fundraising will support a fresh burst of growth for the app.</p>
<p>“While we’ve quadrupled the size of our team this year, stabilized our infrastructure, launched Payments in beta to help creators monetize, and readied Android for launch, there is so much more to do as we work to bring Clubhouse to more people around the world. It’s no secret that our servers have struggled a bit these past few months, and that our growth has outpaced the early discovery algorithms our small team originally built,” said the post.</p>
<p>Noting that “it’s important to us to be building all of this with people who are invested in the community and who represent a diverse set of backgrounds and voices,” Clubhouse has, however, been struck by a wave of problems in the last few days, when Anti-Semitic audio rooms <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=clubhouse%20antisemitism&#038;src=typeahead_click">seemed to proliferate on the platform</a>. Clubhouse has previously been criticized for its seeming inability to moderate extremism on the app.</p>
<p>The year-old platform, which has reported 10 million weekly active users, has thrived during the pandemic while people were locked down and therefore unable to chat easily in person.</p>
<p>Tech news site The Information <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/clubhouse-closes-new-round-funding-that-would-value-app-4-billion-source-2021-04-18/">first reported</a> details on the Clubhouse funding on Friday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the autonomous driving race in China heats up, Didi is rushing to expand its car fleets by picking Swedish automaker Volvo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/uber-orders-24000-volvo-xc90s-for-driverless-fleet/">an old partner of Uber</a>, as its ally.</p>
<p>Didi said on Monday it will be using the XC90 SUVs of Volvo, which has been owned by Chinese auto company Geely since 2010, for its global network of robotaxis in the long term. Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/">created a subsidiary</a> dedicated to autonomous driving last year and the unit has since <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-autonomous-driving/company_financials">raised about $800 million</a> from investors including SoftBank Vision Fund and IDG Capital. The subsidiary now has over 500 employees.</p>
<p>Didi started out as a ride-share app in 2012 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">gobbled up Uber China in 2016</a>. It now offers a range of mobility services including taxi hailing, ride-hailing, carpooling, shared bikes and scooters, as well as financial services for drivers. The company is seeking a valuation north of $100 billion in an initial public offering, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-didi-ipo-banks-exclusive-idUSKBN2BW0TG">Reuters reported last month</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Didi&#8217;s autonomous driving arm has been testing robotaxis for the past two years in China and the United States, but Volvo&#8217;s XC90 model will be the first to adopt Didi&#8217;s freshly minted self-driving hardware system called Gemini, which contains sensors like short, mid and long-range lidars, radars, cameras, a thermal imager; a fallback system; and remote assistance through 5G networks.</p>
<p>Didi said that its Gemini platform, coupled with Volvo&#8217;s backup functions including steering, braking and electric power, will eventually allow its robotaxis to remove safety drivers. If any of the primary systems fail during a ride, Volvo&#8217;s backup systems can act to bring the vehicle to a safe stop.</p>
<p>Didi is competing against a clutch of well-funded robotaxi startups in China, such as Pony.ai and WeRide, which are busy testing in major Chinese cities and California while splurging on R&amp;D expenses to reach Level 4 driving. AutoX, another Chinese robotaxi company, announced last week that it will be using Honda&#8217;s Accord and Inspire sedans for its test drives in China. The edge of Didi, some suggest, is the mountains of driving data accumulated from its ride-hailing business spanning Asia, Latin America, Africa and Russia.</p>
<p>Rising electric automakers like Nio and Xpeng have also joined in the race to automate vehicles, making bold claims that they, too, will be able to remove safety drivers soon. Meanwhile, traditional car manufacturers don&#8217;t want to fall behind. BAIC, a state-owned enterprise, for instance, is adding Huawei&#8217;s advanced automation system and smart cockpit to its new electric passenger cars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a year after the pandemic began, remote work shows no signs of going away. While it has its cons, it remains </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">top of mind for potential employees around the world before joining a new company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while most people in Africa still go to physical offices despite the pandemic, a few companies have nevertheless embraced this concept</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>, a New York-based startup that helps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/andela-a-tech-training-and-development-outsourcer-for-african-coders-raises-40m/">tech companies build remote engineering teams from Africa</a>, was one of the first to publicly announce it was going remote on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is doubling down on this effort by announcing the global expansion of its engineering talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over the past six months, the company has seen a 750% increase in applicants outside Africa. More than 30% of Andela&#8217;s inbound engineer applications also came from outside the continent in March alone. Half this number came from Latin America while Africa saw a 500% increase in applications as well.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Andela, which builds engineering teams tapping African talent, goes fully remote and opens to the wider continent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/andela-which-builds-remote-engineering-teams-tapping-african-talent-goes-fully-remote-and-opens-to-the-wider-continent/embed/#?secret=xWWMJQ9rcy" data-secret="xWWMJQ9rcy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Andela launched in 2014, it built hubs in Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to source, vet and train engineers to be part of remote teams for international companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also tested satellite models in Egypt and Ghana as substitutes to physical hubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company would issue a call </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for applications, select a few (less than 1%), pay them a salary for the first six months and provide them with housing and food</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also helped developers improve their skills via training and mentorship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100,000 engineers have taken part in the company&#8217;s learning network and community, and,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of 2019, Andela had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/what-is-andela-the-africa-tech-talent-accelerator/">more than 1,500 engineers</a> on its payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after noticing that this model wasn&#8217;t sustainable, it began to make changes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it let go of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 420 junior engineers across Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine months later, citing the pandemic, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/andela-ceo-confirms-staff-cuts-as-layoffs-hit-african-tech/">laid off 135 employees</a> while introducing salary cuts for senior staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite the layoffs, the pandemic provided some form of clarity to how Andela wanted to operate &#8212; which was remote, judging by the success of the satellite models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the very beginning, a developer had to be in Lagos to work with Andela. Then it became living in Nigeria. Then Kenya. Then Uganda, Rwanda,&#8221; CEO Jeremy Johnson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Before the pandemic, Andela was opening applications in country after country. The pandemic came and changed that as we opened up to the entire continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shutting down its existing physical campuses and going remote also helped the company focus on getting engineers with more experience to meet its clients&#8217; requirements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experiment, which the company conducted in less than a year, is also part of its mission to be a global company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That went so well and we thought &#8216;what if we accelerated it now that we&#8217;re remote and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enable applicants from anywhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8217; because it was always the plan to become a global company. That was clear, but the timing was the question. We did that and it&#8217;s been an amazing experiment,&#8221; Johnson added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with its global expansion, its clients can tap into regional expertise to support international growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a statement released by the firm, it currently has engineers from 37 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America and Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson didn&#8217;t go into details about how many of these engineers are getting jobs from Andela or even its total developer count</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;s more interested in helping its clients solve the diversity issues that have plagued many Western corporations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela is currently working with eight companies that have hired its engineers in Latin America and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the diversity play, the CEO says that means Andela engineers get to prove themselves on a global playing field in a way the company has &#8220;always wanted to see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela serves more than 200 customers, including GitHub, ViacomCBS, Pluralsight, Seismic, Cloudflare, Coursera and InVision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. GitHub is one company that seems to be benefitting from Andela&#8217;s new offerings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s VP of Engineering, Dana Lawson, in a statement said, “As a business in the developer tool space, a lot of us are trying to enter those areas of the world (Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa) where the emergent developers are coming so we can better understand their needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a local presence there with amazing talent is super valuable to building a global product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its quest to become a global company, going up against competition is unavoidable for the seven-year-old company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since most of these companies are horizontal marketplaces (providing a wide range of expertise), whereas Andela is vertical, Johson believes there&#8217;s enough market share to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be acquired by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are focused on building digital products, and because of that, we&#8217;re able to do more, essentially, for our customers&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s where our focus is &#8212; [building long-term relationships] and around building great digital products,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded by Jeremy Johnson, Christina Sass, Nadayar Enegesi, Ian Carnevale, Brice Nkengsa and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji. It has raised more than $180 million (up to Series D) from firms like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Generation Investment Management, Google Ventures and Spark Capital, at a valuation of about $700 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While announcing the layoffs last year, Andela said it was on an annual revenue run rate of $50 million. But w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen asked how this number has changed over the past year, Johnson said the company is &#8220;growing at a healthier pace as we&#8217;ve ever had</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The future of remote work is global and Johnson believes Andela provides the vital link to talent wherever it is found. The company&#8217;s head of talent operations, Martin Chikilian, echoed similar sentiments regarding the expansion.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen exponential growth and interest from engineers from across Africa who want to work with some of the world&#8217;s most exciting technology-focused companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Growing our network of talent from Africa to include more markets is a unique proposition and we continue to match talent with opportunity beyond geographical boundaries.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The buy now, pay later model, popularized by companies like Klarn and Affirm has been one of the big e-commerce winners in the last year, giving consumers who might be stretched financially another option to pay for things when they buy them online. While that has prompted the UK financial authority to <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-woolard-review-unsecured-credit-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-examine how it regulates the space</a>, an enterprise taking a slightly different approach is announcing some funding as it prepares to expand to the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.payzilch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zilch</a>, a London startup that has built an &#8220;over the top&#8221; buy now, pay later (BNPL) business out of cutting deals directly with consumers &#8212; bypassing the need for integrating anything new into an e-commerce site&#8217;s check-out process, as many of the leading providers have done &#8212; has raised $80 million, an all-equity Series B that values the company at over $500 million.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Gauss Ventures and M&amp;F Fund, among other unnamed investors. The startup has up to now opted to raise from individuals and smaller firms, CEO and founder Philip Belamant said in an interview, although that may change in future rounds as it looks both to bring in a tier-one debt line, not just to fuel growth in its current market of the UK but to expand to more countries, including the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For now, Zilch has financed usage of its service off its own balance sheet: it has more than 500,000 users, Belamant said, and is seeing sign-ups of around 4,000 a day on its app.</p>
<p>BNPL is a payment scheme that has been around as long as stores themselves, but its emergence online has been more a later arrival. It&#8217;s proven to be a very popular one. A recent report from <a href="https://worldpay.globalpaymentsreport.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldpay</a> estimated that in the UK, which is the world&#8217;s third-biggest e-commerce market in its estimation (£192 billion, or $266 billion, transacted in 2020), BNPL will account for 10% of all sales by 2024, when the overall e-commerce market will be worth £264 billion ($366 billion).</p>
<p>Most schemes today are run by third parties &#8212; Klarna and Affirm being two of the biggest &#8212; who ink deals with e-commerce companies and integrate in the check-out alongside other options for payment. Zilch&#8217;s key differentiation has been that it&#8217;s cut a deal with only one other company &#8212; Mastercard &#8212; and created a payment card with it so that when a person wants to pay using Zilch, they use the Mastercard number in the checkout, which then triggers the option to them to either pay in installments or pay as you would with a normal credit card.</p>
<p>As with other BNPL schemes, Zilch doesn&#8217;t charge fees on its service, and instead makes a cut in the transaction from the retailer (part of the fee retailers pay to card companies in card transactions: the deals are all predicated on the idea that these alternatives to paying everything up front increases conversions, and that &#8216;convenience&#8217; is what retailers are paying to have as an option). Its approach is pretty straightforward: it offers installments for paying back that start with 25% up front (so not exactly &#8220;zilch&#8221;) and paying for the item in full in 25% installments over 6 weeks. For those who miss a payment, they are stopped from using the service again until this gets cleared but Zilch doesn&#8217;t charge late fees.</p>
<p>The prospect of bypassing the retailer means that Zilch has been able to scale by making its service more applicable to more payment scenarios, a model that Belamant said was inspired by another killer disaggregator.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;If you look at when Amazon started, many commented on it being a phenomenal bookstore, but they built an infrastructure to sell everything. They could have built that covering different booksellers one by one but Amazon went direct to the consumer and said it would ship any book in a day. How profitable is not your problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn’t want to be beholden to the retailer and wanted the relationship with consumer. We go to them and say, pay over time, and use us anywhere you like. We built this technology plugging them in on one side and plugging retailers on the other. We can now build up any way to play and can use it anywhere they like without being restricted by retailers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p5">Conversely, this has also helped Zilch fend off competition from bigger BNPL players, at least up to now: &#8220;Their main customers are retailers, and they have pre-existing arrangements with those retailers,&#8221; Belamant said of the Affirms and Klarnas of the world. Offering a model similar to Zilch&#8217;s, he said, &#8220;would have to circumvent those services, and that’s a massive cannibalization. Can they do that? Well, it&#8217;s naive to say they can’t. But will they? I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zilch&#8217;s approach of riding the rails of Mastercard &#8212; which may well soon to be augmented by other providers like Visa &#8212; means that it can quickly distribute a recognized payment method, but as Belamant describes it, it&#8217;s Zilch that is still building the algorithms to make the credit evaluations for individual consumers.</p>
<p>Using what Belamant described to me as &#8220;soft credit checks&#8221; alongside <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/customers/what-is-open-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Banking</a> data &#8212; a system used in the UK and Europe that taps into using APIs to share and integrate data from one financial service with another (in this case a way to easily check a person&#8217;s credit and financial history by way of their bank details as they are applying for a new financial service) &#8212; people sign up and automatically get assessed for their suitability for a BNPL scheme.</p>
<p>This has helped the company, as it says, become the first BNPL provider to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial services regulator in the UK that has run an investigation of BNPL companies and appears to be preparing tighter regulation around how they can work, to stave off people inadvertently walking into spending money that they don&#8217;t have and may never be able to repay. Zilch was officially authorized as a consumer credit provider in 2020.</p>
<p>This is not to say that others in the space will not be able to also get the same certification for their models, incidentally, but it might mean more regulatory hoops, possibly slower growth, and perhaps also more consumer wariness as the situation continues to get more publicity. (The UK in particular has a pretty sordid history with other schemes to provide people with financing, specifically around the murky practices associated with payday loan schemes, and that has left a bad taste in many consumers&#8217; mouths.)</p>
<p>One specific advantage also of linking up with a card company is that, in this world of &#8220;everything will soon be virtual&#8221;, it gives Zilch users access to a card, which they can in turn use to also shop using BNPL in brick-and-mortar stores. Tap and Pay-over-time, as it&#8217;s called, means users can integrate the card number into a digital wallet to and use it as they would their handsets to pay with Apple or Android-based payment schemes. Zilch said it&#8217;s the first BNPL do make this leap. (To be clear, for now there is no physical &#8216;card&#8217; although it seems they are considering how and if to offer it.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gett.com/intl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gett</a>, the ride-hailing startup that has been carving out a niche for itself in a crowded and competitive market for on-demand transportation by focusing on enterprise accounts and connecting people with rides in some 1,500 cities leveraging a number of third-party fleets, is adding another partner today as it continues to double down on its business model in the wake of corporate travel slowly coming back online.</p>
<p>Gett has inked a deal to integrate <a href="https://gocurb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curb Mobility</a> to integrate yellow taxis into Gett&#8217;s app, which will now cover some 65 cities across the US. The news is coming at a time when Gett is looking to expand its service to meet more demand: it notes that rides currently at around 80% of the levels they were in Q1 2020, just ahead of Covid-19 really descending on the western world.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the deal does not involve any investment between Gett &#8212; which has raised around $865 million to date (including most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gett-raises-115m-more-for-its-on-demand-ride-hailing-platform-for-business-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing a $115 million round</a>) and was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2019 &#8212; and Curb &#8212; which is a part of Verifone, after the payments hardware company <a href="https://paymentweek.com/2015-10-13-verifone-acquires-curb-expands-e-hail-payments-and-media-business-8545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired it in 2015</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(If you think it sounds odd for a payments hardware company to own a taxi fleet app, this is only part of Curb&#8217;s business and is in fact also a hardware player: in addition to Curb providing a way to hail yellow taxis &#8212; it app covers some 50,000 cabs and 100,000 drivers &#8212; the company also builds hardware for cabs and fleet operations, including metering apps, payment terminals, and those interactive screens for passengers that let them pay for rides, watch news and advertisements and more.)</p>
<p>To differentiate its service from the very highly capitalized Ubers and Lyfts of the world, Gett has been building out a two-pronged strategy that covers both how it scales, and the services that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>On the scaling front, Gett has been moving away from managing fleets of contractor drivers in the US for some years now: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/juno-shuts-down-its-operations-in-nyc-as-owner-gett-signs-strategic-partnership-with-lyft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019</a>, after slogging it out for years against Lyft and Uber in its primary New York metro market, Gett effectively shut down its main fleet operation in the region and instead inked a deal with Lyft. That has become a template of sorts that the company has been repeating in other cities outside of the U.S. where it doesn&#8217;t have substantial market share. (For example, Ola is another Gett partner.) In some cities where it has a larger footprint, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">like London and Tel Aviv, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gett works with drivers directly.</span></p>
<p>Partner fleets made up one-third of Gett&#8217;s business in the first quarter of this year, but as Gett brings on more to its network, it expects partner fleets to cover the majority of its rides by the end of this year, the company said.</p>
<p>On the service front, Gett has made a big bet on building a platform that integrates with businesses at the back end to make it easier to order rides and for them to reconcile more easily with a businesses expense management and accounting software. Gett&#8217;s big pitch to would-be customers is that this software makes it less expensive and significantly more efficient to hail a cab using Gett compared to the alternatives &#8212; for starters users can compare different prices from different providers &#8212; and it gives users significantly more choice.</p>
<p>“Today’s partnership cements Gett’s position as a technology platform focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM), where spend is worth $79.6 billion globally,&#8221; said Dave Waiser, CEO and co-founder of Gett, in a statement. &#8220;In recent years, we have become the GTM category leader, serving over a quarter of Fortune 500 companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the part of Curb, it gives drivers using its software another link through to an app that might bring in more business at a time when riders have more choice than ever before, covering not just other on-demand car apps, but eco-friendly, exercise-ready, and traffic-busting options like e-bikes, scooters and shared rides. As the profile of the average corporate user changes and gets younger, that too will change the expectations many of them will have for what constitutes a preferred set of ground transportation options, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>“As cities across the U.S. prepare for the return of international travel, our partnership with Gett will create new income opportunities for local drivers and ensure Gett&#8217;s business users have access to the same safe, reliable transportation options trusted by locals,&#8221; said Amos Tamam, CEO at Curb. &#8220;By integrating with platforms like Gett, we&#8217;re aiming to make taxis more ubiquitous online by opening up new digital avenues for today’s consumers and businesses to find and book taxis.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct that Gett has shifted Moscow out of direct fleet management and currently operates this model in London and Tel Aviv.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six-year-old Bangalore-based fintech Razorpay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/">topped a $1 billion valuation late last year</a>, becoming the first Y Combinator-backed Indian startup to reach the much sought after unicorn status. In less than six months since, the Indian startup has tripled its valuation and is preparing to launch in the Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Razorpay said on Monday it has raised $160 million in its Series E financing round that valued the startup at $3 billion, up from “a little over” $1 billion valuation in the $100 million Series D in October last year.</p>
<p>The new round has been co-led by existing investors Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund &#8212; GIC &#8212; and Sequoia Capital India. Some other existing investors including Ribbit Capital and Tiger Global also participated in the new round, which takes Razorpay&#8217;s to-date raise to $366.5 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> accepts, processes and disburses money online for small businesses and enterprises &#8212; essentially everything Stripe does in the U.S. and several other developed markets. But the Indian startup’s offering goes much further than that: In recent years, Razorpay has launched a neobanking platform to issue corporate credit cards (more at the bottom of the article), and it also offers businesses working capital.</p>
<p>With the global giant Stripe still nowhere in the Indian picture, Razorpay has grown to become the market leader. And now, the startup plans to replicate its success from the home country in Southeast Asian markets, Harshil Mathur, co-founder and chief executive of Razorpay, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“We are one of the largest payments providers in the Indian ecosystem. We want to take the learnings we have in India to the Southeast Asian market. Before the end of the financial year, we want to launch in one or two Southeast Asian markets,” said Mathur, adding that the new round gives it the valuation to more confidently explore some M&amp;A opportunities to accelerate growth.</p>
<p>More than 5 million businesses in India rely on Razorpay’s technology to process payments. Some of these clients include Facebook, telecom operator Airtel, ride-hailing firm Ola, food-delivery startup Swiggy, and fintech CRED.</p>
<p>Mathur and Shashank Kumar &#8212; pictured above &#8212; met at IIT Roorkee college. The duo realized early on that small businesses faced immense difficulties in accepting money digitally and the existing payments processing firms weren’t designed to tackle the needs of small businesses and startups.</p>
<p>Solving this issue became Razorypay’s goal, and in the early days about 11 individuals shared a single apartment as the co-founders scrambled to convince bankers to work with them. The conversations were slow and remained in a deadlock for so long that the co-founders felt helpless explaining the same challenge to investors numerous times, they recalled in an interview two years ago.</p>
<p>The stories one hears about Razorpay today have changed dramatically. In a Clubhouse room, known for sharp criticism of products, dozens of developers and startup founders recently recalled their early interactions with Razorpay, and how the startup&#8217;s officials helped their businesses start with &#8212; or move to &#8212; the Razorpay&#8217;s system within hours after reaching out.</p>
<p>Deepak Abbot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/former-paytm-execs-team-up-indiagold/">co-founder of Indiagold</a>, recently recalled an incident where his startup had missed an alert, and that coupled with a snafu at the bank, resulted in the startup running out of funds to pay customers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I expected Harshil to pause and think but he said let us add 10 lakhs just to be on a safer side. And while we were chatting <a href="https://twitter.com/shashankmehta05?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shashankmehta05</a> sent me a whatsapp that money has been added to our account 4/5</p>
<p>&mdash; Deepak Abbot (@deepakabbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/deepakabbot/status/1358799358498492416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Last year, Mathur said Razorpay’s core business &#8212; processing payments &#8212; was fast-growing and the startup would focus more on building the two new offerings.</p>
<p>Offering an update, Mathur said Razorpay X now serves about 15,000 businesses, up from fewer than 5,000 in October last year. Razorpay Capital is now annually bandying out about $80 million to clients, up from less than $40 million a year ago. The duration of the loan Razorpay provides ranges from three to six months, and the ticket size is typically between 0.8 million to 1 million Indian rupees ($10,730 to $13,400).</p>
<p>Mathur said the startup will focus on further growing this business in the next three years and then look at taking the startup public. &#8220;If it was just the payments processing business, we could go public right now. But our ambitions are beyond &#8212; to become the full ecosystem for businesses. And on those new sides (neobanking and lending), we are early,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup’s marquee offering has grown 40-50% month-on-month in the past six months. It now plans to process over $50 billion in total payment volume by the end of 2021. The startup also plans to hire a number of people. It currently has over 600 open positions, several in Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement comes at a time when a slice of Indian startups are raising large amounts of capital at a much frequent pace and increased valuations as investors double down on promising bets in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Indian startups social commerce Meesho, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED</a>, e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy, millennials-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">social network ShareChat</a> attained the unicorn status earlier this month. TechCrunch reported last week that SoftBank is in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/banking-tech-zeta-fundraise-sb/">invest in Zeta</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">Swiggy</a>.</p>
<p>*Razorpay offers a number of value-added services such as automating vendor payments, real-time reconciliation and analytics, managing subscriptions, GST invoicing, designing and creating websites. The startup has also developed an app-based substitute for payments terminals (also known as POS) as well as pay-by-link for enabling offline commerce. Its offering is also part of Amazon&#8217;s new Digital Suite focused at SMBs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you accept that VMware is in play, the prospective price tag means that the number of firms that could afford such a purchase are few and far between.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch has spilled much digital ink tracking the fate of VMware since it was brought to Dell’s orbit thanks to the latter company’s epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">purchase of EMC in 2016</a> for $58 billion. That transaction saddled the well-known Texas tech company with heavy debts. Because the deal left VMware a public company, albeit one controlled by Dell, how it might be used to pay down some of its parent company’s arrears was a constant question.</p>
<p>Dell made its move earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">agreeing to spin out VMware</a> in exchange for a huge one-time dividend, a five-year commercial partnership agreement, lots of stock for existing Dell shareholders and Michael Dell retaining his role as chairman of its board.</p>
<p>So, where does the deal leave VMware in terms of independence, and in terms of Dell influence? Dell no longer will hold formal control over VMware as part of the deal, though its shareholders will retain a large stake in the virtualization giant. And with Michael Dell staying on VMware’s board, it will retain influence.</p>
<p>Here’s how VMware described it to shareholders <a href="https://ir.vmware.com/download/companies/vmware/Presentations/VMware%20Spin-off%20Slide%20Deck.pdf">in a presentation</a> this week. The graphic shows that under the new agreement, VMware is no longer a subsidiary of Dell and will now be an independent company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139734" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139734" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139734" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-10.43.25-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Chart showing before and after structure of Dell spinning out VMware.

<p>But with VMware tipped to become independent once again, it could become something of a takeover target. When Dell controlled VMware thanks to majority ownership, a hostile takeover felt out of the question. Now, VMware is a more possible target to the right company with the right offer &#8212; provided that the Dell spinout works as planned.</p>
<p>Buying VMware would be an expensive effort, however. It&#8217;s worth around $67 billion today. Presuming a large premium would be needed to take this particular technology chess piece off the competitive board, it could cost $100 billion or more to snag VMware from the public markets.</p>
<p>So VMware will soon be more free to pursue a transaction that might be favorable to its shareholders &#8212; which will still include every Dell shareholder, because they are receiving stock in VMware as part of its spinout &#8212; without worrying about its parent company simply saying no.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a month ago, Peloton CEO John Foley <a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-">wrote an open letter</a> about the the company&#8217;s treadmill. “I’m reaching out to you today because I recently learned about a tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death,” it begins. “While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”</p>
<p>Today, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning, telling users to stop using the Tread+. Citing 39 incidents, included the aforementioned death, the CPSC writes, “The Commission has found that the public health and safety requires this notice to warn the public quickly of the hazard.”</p>
<p>Peloton followed up with its own strongly worded statement writing, “The company is troubled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission&#8217;s (CPSC) unilateral press release about the Peloton Tread+ because it is inaccurate and misleading. There is no reason to stop using the Tread+, as long as all warnings and safety instructions are followed.”</p>
<p>The commission’s warning includes multiple injuries involving small children and a pet. Specifically, the note calls for users with children at how to cease using the product, a more stern warning than the initial suggestions outlined by Foley back in in March, who at the time told users to keep children and pets away from the system and store the device out of reach after using. Peloton has since added that there have been 23 incidents involving children, 15 with objects and, as the CPSC noted, one with a pet. The company added that it had not revealed the specifics previously out of privacy concern.</p>
<p>“If consumers must continue to use the product, CPSC urges consumers to use the product only in a locked room, to prevent access to children and pets while the treadmill is in use,” the organization notes. “Keep all objects, including exercise balls and other equipment, away from the treadmill.”</p>
<p>For its part, the connected fitness maker adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>Peloton invited CPSC to make a joint announcement about the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided with the Tread+, and Foley asked to meet directly with CPSC. CPSC has unfairly characterized Peloton&#8217;s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC&#8217;s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth. The company already urged Members to follow all warnings and safety instructions. Peloton is disappointed that, despite its offers of collaboration, and despite the fact that the Tread+ complies with all applicable safety standards, CPSC was unwilling to engage in any meaningful discussions with Peloton before issuing its inaccurate and misleading press release.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. If you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning, sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>This week, Scale AI raised a $325 million Series E. The company, as TechCrunch has written, works in the data labeling space. And it has been on a fundraising tear over the last few years. In 2019 TechCrunch wrote about how the company’s then-22-year-old CEO had put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/">together a $100 million round</a>. Then in December of 2020, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">raised $155 million at a roughly $3.5 billion valuation</a>. Now it’s worth more than $7 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Impressive, yeah? Well, as I learned earlier this week, AI startups in general are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">having one hell of a year</a>. From the start of 2021 to April 12th, there were 442 AI-startup deals in the U.S. worth $11.65 billion, according to PitchBook data. And the recent Microsoft-Nuance AI deal may accelerate things even more.</p>
<p>Sapphire Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das?lang=en">Jai Das</a> weighed in on the AI venture market for The Exchange. He answered our question regarding how competitive the space was in the first quarter by saying that “investment activity in AI/ML startups has been absolutely insane” during the first quarter.</p>
<p>Per Das: “AI/ML startups are routinely getting 5-6 term sheets from top-tier VC firms and they are able to raise their financings at 150-250X of current ARR.”</p>
<p>Chew on that for a moment. We’ve seen public software multiples reach new heights in the last year, but even for aggressive startup rounds, those are some bonkers numbers. Imagine an AI-focused startup with $1 million in recurring revenue being valued at a quarter of a billion dollars. <em>Damn</em>.</p>
<p>But what about pace among AI investing? We’ve heard that the time from a round opening to its closing among many startups has been compressed and compressed again. Das helped explain the situation, saying in an email that “most firms are completing their due diligence way before the financing actually happens,” which means that there is “no need to do any due diligence during the financing.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZnnC0mcCQ9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">Expect an even hotter AI venture capital market in the wake of the Microsoft-Nuance deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Expect an even hotter AI venture capital market in the wake of the Microsoft-Nuance deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/embed/#?secret=ZnnC0mcCQ9" data-secret="ZnnC0mcCQ9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That actually makes some sense? If rounds are largely preemptive &#8212; something that Das underscored later on in his comments &#8212; you <em>have</em> to do pre-diligence. Otherwise you’ll always be investing blind or missing out on deals due to other firms moving more quickly.</p>
<p>This week The Exchange also dug into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">broader domestic venture capital market</a>, with a special focus on seed deals, and the super late-stage investments that dominate headlines. A comment on the earlier-stages of venture investing that just missed our piece on the matter came from <a href="https://twitter.com/grabow?lang=en">Jeff Grabow</a>, EY’s U.S. Venture Capital lead.</p>
<p>In his comments on pre-seed, seed and post-seed deals, something stood out to us &#8212; a prediction of sorts. Here’s Grabow:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Q1 2021] was a strong quarter for pre-seed funding when you compare it to prior years, and we expect the overall environment to remain strong given the abundance of capital available and plethora of investable themes that tap into new markets via technological solutions. It paints a rosy picture for the post-COVID environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>That tracks with our internal estimates. Q1 2021 was so hot for at least American venture capital activity (expect more international coverage soon) that it seems likely that the year itself will be a record in many respects. Provided that things don’t slow too much, records will be broken. And here Grabow flat-out anticipates a pretty attractive climate for venture after COVID-19 is behind us.</p>
<p>So, records will be broken. The question is by how much.</p>
<h2>More notes on Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing</h2>
<p>Not to whomp the equestrian deceased too much, but I have a few more notes for you on the Coinbase direct listing.</p>
<p>Public.com, the Robinhood consumer trading rival, helped The Exchange better understand just how much retail interest there was in the stock. Per its ever-present spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/M0Osborne">Mo</a>, on April 14th, Coinbase “was the most popular stock on public,” measured by number of transactions. And perhaps more notably, on the same day “social activity (measured by the number of posts) increased by 70% compared to the day prior.”</p>
<p>I do not know how long the consumer trading boom can last, but that’s a pretty impressive set of metrics.</p>
<p>Similarweb also had a few data points to share, including that visits to coinbase.com reached 86.4 million in January. Hot damn. And during that month new visitors bested returning visitors. That data helps explain how Coinbase wound up with the epic first quarter that it did. Now the question is if it can keep up its bull run or, frankly, if consumer interest in trading in crypto specifically will outlast the equities trading boom or not.</p>
<p>Coinbase Series D lead investor <a href="https://twitter.com/tomloverro?lang=en">Tom Loverro</a>, who we’ve mentioned a few times this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">including on the podcast</a>, said that we’re still merely in the second inning of crypto. So expect these topics to keep coming up again and again. And again.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase’s direct listing alters the landscape for fintech and crypto startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/embed/#?secret=V5H7QnY1tr" data-secret="V5H7QnY1tr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Trying to actually stick to our word count target for once, here are some final notes on the IPO market from the week.</p>
<p>First, the AppLovin IPO did not go according to plan. After modestly pricing at $80 per share, the middle of its range, the mobile-app focused tech company saw its value fall during its first two days’ trading. It’s now worth $61 per share as of the end of Friday.</p>
<p>The Exchange spoke with AppLovin CFO <a href="https://twitter.com/heraldchen">Herald Chen</a> on its IPO day. Chatting with the finance executive, our read from the conversation is that the company could accelerate its acquisition game more now that it is public. Having a liquid stock means that it can be even more acquisitive than before. And AppLovin claims that it can buy companies, run them through its business process, and juice their revenues per its S-1 filing.</p>
<p>If that bears out, the public markets may be giving the company a bit too hard of a time. It was a bit odd to see a software company struggle post-IPO in today’s climate.</p>
<p>Chen also told The Exchange that his firm didn’t see any pushback regarding its multi-class share structure during its roadshow. The multi-class share miasm is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/snowflake-gave-up-its-dual-class-shares-should-you/">something I’ve written about</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">our own Ron Miller</a>. The CFO did note that no single person has complete control of the company, even with several different classes of equity with disparate voting rights. That matters, frankly.</p>
<p>We’ll keep tabs on AppLovin as it trades. (Our earlier coverage of its numbers is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/first-impressions-of-applovins-ipo-filing/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, autonomous trucking company TuSimple <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-self-driving-truck-rival-tusimple-raises-more-than-1-billion-in-ipo-valuing-it-at-8-5-billion-11618495532">went public this week</a>, and Similarweb <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415006093/en/Similarweb-Files-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering">filed to go public</a>. We’re also watching the broader IPO market as UiPath either raises its price range or note. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">have a guess on that score</a>.</p>
<p>And just as the week was closing, Squarespace dropped its S-1. Notes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/squarespace-files-for-a-direct-listing-on-the-nyse/">here</a> with more to come.</p>
<p>Good vibes and nothing other than the best from here,</p>
