										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The only people who truly understand a relationship are the ones who are in it. Luckily for us, we&#8217;re going to have a candid conversation with both parties in the relationship between Ironclad CEO and co-founder Jason Boehmig and his investor and board member Accel partner Steve Loughlin.</p>
<p>Loughlin led Ironclad&#8217;s Series A deal back in 2017, making it one of his first Series A deals after returning to Accel.</p>
<p>This episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down on Wednesday at 3 p.m. EST/12 p.m. PST, just like usual.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to the duo about how they met, what made them &#8220;choose&#8221; each other, and how they&#8217;ve operated as a duo since. How they built trust, maintain honesty and talk strategy are also on the table as part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Loughlin was an entrepreneur before he was an investor, founding RelateIQ (an Accel-backed company) in 2011. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/salesforce-buys-big-data-startup-relateiq-for-up-to-390m/">acquired by Salesforce in 2014 for $390 million</a> and later became Salesforce IQ. Loughlin then &#8220;came back home&#8221; to Accel in 2016 and has led investments in companies like Airkit, Ascend.io, Clockwise, Ironclad, Monte Carlo, Nines, Productiv, Split.io and Vivun.</p>
<p>Not entirely unsurprising for a man who has dominated the legal tech sphere, Jason Boehmig is a California barred attorney who practiced law at Fenwick &amp; West and was also an adjunct professor of law at Notre Dame Law School. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ironclad/">Ironclad</a> launched in 2014 and today the company has raised more than $180 million and, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mary-meekers-vc-firm-bond-invests-in-ironclad-at-nearly-1-billion-valuation">reports</a>, is valued just under $1 billion.</p>
<p>Not only will we peel back the curtain on how this investor/founder relationship works, but we&#8217;ll also hear from these two tech leaders on their thoughts around bigger enterprise trends in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Then, it&#8217;s time for the pitch deck teardown. On each episode of Extra Crunch Live, we take a look at decks submitted by the audience and our experienced guests give their live feedback. If you want to throw your deck in the ring, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your deck</a> for a future episode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dapr.io/">Dapr</a>, the Microsoft-incubated open-source project that aims to make it easier for developers to build event-driven, distributed cloud-native applications, hit its 1.0 milestone today, signifying the project&#8217;s readiness for production use cases. Microsoft launched the Distributed Application Runtime (that&#8217;s what &#8220;Dapr&#8221; stand for) back in October 2019. Since then, the project released 14 updates and the community launched integrations with virtually all major cloud providers, including Azure, AWS, Alibaba and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>The goal for Dapr, Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told me, was to democratize cloud-native development for enterprise developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we go look at what enterprise developers are being asked to do &#8212; they&#8217;ve traditionally been doing client, server, web plus database-type applications,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;But now, we&#8217;re asking them to containerize and to create microservices that scale out and have no-downtime updates &#8212; and they&#8217;ve got to integrate with all these cloud services. And many enterprises are, on top of that, asking them to make apps that are portable across on-premises environments as well as cloud environments or even be able to move between clouds. So just tons of complexity has been thrown at them that&#8217;s not specific to or not relevant to the business problems they&#8217;re trying to solve.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And a lot of the development involves re-inventing the wheel to make their applications reliably talk to various other services. The idea behind Dapr is to give developers a single runtime that, out of the box, provides the tools that developers need to build event-driven microservices. Among other things, Dapr provides various building blocks for things like service-to-service communications, state management, pub/sub and secrets management.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113755" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113755" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113755" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png" alt="" width="1024" height="416" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png 1937w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png?resize=768,312 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png?resize=680,276 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png?resize=1536,624 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/building_blocks.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113755" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dapr</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The goal with Dapr was: let&#8217;s take care of all of the mundane work of writing one of these cloud-native distributed, highly available, scalable, secure cloud services, away from the developers so they can focus on their code. And actually, we took lessons from serverless, from Functions-as-a-Service where with, for example Azure Functions, it&#8217;s event-driven, they focus on their business logic and then things like the bindings that come with Azure Functions take care of connecting with other services,&#8221; Russinovich said.</p>
<p>He also noted that another goal here was to do away with language-specific models and to create a programming model that can be leveraged from any language. Enterprises, after all, tend to use multiple languages in their existing code, and a lot of them are now looking at how to best modernize their existing applications &#8212; without throwing out all of their current code.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o9iDAgYBA8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As Russinovich noted, the project now has more than 700 contributors outside of Microsoft (though the core commuters are largely from Microsoft) and a number of businesses started using it in production before the 1.0 release. One of the larger cloud providers that is already using it is Alibaba. &#8220;Alibaba Cloud has really fallen in love with Dapr and is leveraging it heavily,&#8221; he said. Other organizations that have contributed to Dapr include HashiCorp and early users like ZEISS, Ignition Group and New Relic.</p>
<p>And while it may seem a bit odd for a cloud provider to be happy that its competitors are using its innovations already, Russinovich noted that this was exactly the plan and that the team hopes to bring Dapr into a foundation soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been on a path to open governance for several months and the goal is to get this into a foundation. [&#8230;] The goal is opening this up. It&#8217;s not a Microsoft thing. It&#8217;s an industry thing,&#8221; he said &#8212; but he wasn&#8217;t quite ready to say to which foundation the team is talking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there’s a need for capital, not every startup goes the venture route.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://boast.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boast.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that plugs into business systems and automatically finds them R&amp;D tax breaks, announced Wednesday it has raised a $100 million credit facility from Brevet Capital to advance those R&amp;D incentives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And proptech startup </span><a href="https://www.statestitle.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Title</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced it has closed on $150 million in debt financing from</span><a href="https://hudsonstructured.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HSCM Bermuda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had previously invested in the company. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Title has developed patented machine learning technology that it says reduces title processing time from five days to “as little as one minute” and cuts down the entire mortgage closing process “from a 40+ day ordeal to as little as six days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious as to why these companies chose to go after debt/credit as opposed to raising venture capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Boast.ai, which was bootstrapped until it raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/boast-ai-raises-23m-to-help-businesses-get-their-rd-tax-credits/">a $23 million Series A</a> last December and is profitable, it boiled down to simple economics.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Gyo0Y8XhV9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/boast-ai-raises-23m-to-help-businesses-get-their-rd-tax-credits/">Boast.ai raises $23M to help businesses get their R&#038;D tax credits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Boast.ai raises $23M to help businesses get their R&#038;D tax credits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/boast-ai-raises-23m-to-help-businesses-get-their-rd-tax-credits/embed/#?secret=Gyo0Y8XhV9" data-secret="Gyo0Y8XhV9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Equity is expensive,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lloyed Lobo, co-founder and president at Boast.ai, told TechCrunch via email. “Plus you bring on a range of partners that you have to be answerable to. For example, if you raise capital, you’re paying a return on the capital you raise no matter what you do with it. Credit facility is more like you have $100 million to deploy as you go and we have the option to extend that to $500 million.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s vision, he said, is to automate access to billions in R&amp;D tax credits and innovation incentives to help businesses fuel their growth without giving up equity and dealing with red tape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proving R&amp;D costs to the U.S. and Canadian government to get tax breaks is a lengthy and time-consuming process. Boast.ai’s offering plugs into a company’s business tools to automatically calculate R&amp;D expenses, and then advances money for the R&amp;D incentives. Boast.ai makes money by charging a fee to the company depending on the credit they have to pay once they receive it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For States Title, which raised<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/states-title-closes-on-123m-series-c-for-faster-mortgage-closings/"> a $123 million Series C</a> last March, debt was a more appealing option than raising more equity.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VLzXj6wVah"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/startups-are-poised-to-disrupt-the-14b-title-insurance-industry/">Startups are poised to disrupt the $14B title insurance industry</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups are poised to disrupt the $14B title insurance industry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/startups-are-poised-to-disrupt-the-14b-title-insurance-industry/embed/#?secret=VLzXj6wVah" data-secret="VLzXj6wVah" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic led to record low interest rates, which led to an increased number of people re-financing and/or buying homes. This led to more demand for States Title’s offering, according to CEO Max Simkoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With such an increase in demand, we originally looked at raising equity, but there were ultimately significantly more attractive options for debt,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, Simkoff said, is growing faster than it could have modeled, so it continues to invest “in an aggressive roadmap.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That gave us the confidence to take on the debt facility,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt is finite, Simkoff said. And for States Title, that is a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason many companies don’t pursue debt financing is because they feel they may not have a clear path to profitability in the time frame in which they would need to pay the debt back,” he added. “Equity extends the runway to find that path, but it also means giving away more of the eventual upside, if and when a company is able to convert valuation numbers into actual value.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Title is planning to use the money to accelerate traction of its product roadmap, power new market expansions, acquire and support customers, and help it restructure its cap table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company wants to do more hiring and pay down what it owes to Lennar Corp., which helped fund State Title’s 2019 acquisition of North American Title Company (NATC) and North American Title Insurance Company (NATIC). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>These two startups are prime examples of the fact that while there is plenty of venture out there, not every company is eager to take it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As startups get more broad and stay private longer, the space into which VCs can invest may narrow.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning I covered three funding rounds. One dealt with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">the no-code/low-code space</a>, another focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ally-io-rasies-50m-series-c-as-the-okr-software-market-stays-explosive/">the OKR software market</a>, and the last dealt with a company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">in the consumer investing space</a>. Worth a combined $420 million, the investments made for a contentedly busy morning.</p>
<p>But they also got me thinking about startup niches and competition. Back in the days when inside rounds were bad, SPACs were jokes and crypto a fever dream, there was lots of noise about investors who declined to place competing bets in any particular startup market.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>This rule of thumb still holds up today, but we need to update it. The general sentiment that investors shouldn&#8217;t back competing companies is still on display, as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">saw Sequoia walk away from a check</a> it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/payments-infra-startup-finix-closes-35m-series-b-led-by-sequoia/">put into Finix</a> after it became clear that the smaller company was too competitive with Stripe, another portfolio company.</p>

<p>Does that mean Sequoia can&#8217;t invest elsewhere in fintech? No, but it does limit their investing playing field.</p>
<p>Which is dumb as hell. Nothing that Sequoia could invest in today is <em>really</em> going to slow Stripe&#8217;s IPO, unless the company decides to not go public for a half-decade. Which would be lunacy, even for today&#8217;s live-at-home-with-the-parents startup culture that leans towards staying private over going public.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Mining&#8221; has become synonymous with crypto the past few years in the tech industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/bitcoin-briefly-breaks-the-50000-barrier-as-coinbases-direct-listing-looms/">what with Bitcoin piercing the $50,000 barrier</a> and GPUs and ASICs worldwide scrambling to hash functions in a bid for distributed crypto manna. That excitement belies an increasingly energetic push though to bring VC dollars and entrepreneurial acumen back to Mining 1.0 — actual meatspace resource extraction.</p>
<p>One of the key target resources is lithium, a critical component for smartphones, electric vehicle batteries and nearly every other electric tool of modern convenience and industrial import. China through its mining companies and battery manufacturers is <a href="https://www.voanews.com/silicon-valley-technology/how-china-dominates-global-battery-supply-chain">currently in the lead</a>, thanks to a years-long push to control both the supply of lithium and develop massive new manufacturing capacity to meet global demand. As tensions rise between China and the United States however, companies are racing to find alternative supplies as the world transitions to more electric-based infrastructure systems.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one reason why DuPont is making a push to prove out its extraction technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The water filtration and purification service provider DuPont Water Solutions has teamed up with Vulcan Energy Resources, a developer of lithium mining and renewable energy projects, to test a new process for direct lithium extraction.</p>
<p>Current processes for mining lithium are bad for the environment (to put it mildly), involving heavy use of toxic chemicals and increasingly scarce water resources. This new joint project, which is being developed in the Upper Rhine Valley of Germany, would tap DuPont&#8217;s direct lithium extraction products and filtration expertise to mine and refine lithium in a more environmentally-friendly way, the company said.</p>
<p>Dr. Francis Wedin, Managing Director of Vulcan, said in a statement that &#8220;DuPont&#8217;s diverse set of products, which can be manufactured at scale, are likely to be well-suited to sustainably extract the lithium from the brine.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuPont is hoping to push the technology out across the mining industry and make its portfolio of sorbents, nanofiltration technologies, reverse osmosis filters, ion exchange resins, ultrafiltration, and close-circuit reverse osmosis products available to a wider group of customers.</p>
<p>A push by DuPont to become more involved in the lithium-mining business will heighten competition for startups like <a href="https://www.lilacsolutions.com/technology">Lilac Solutions</a>, which has developed its own technology for lithium extraction. The company has partnered with an Australian company, Controlled Thermal Resources, to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-03-16/lithium-startup-lilac-solutions-bill-gates-salton-sea">develop lithium brine deposits</a> in the Salton Sea, which is among California&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/the-airborne-toxic-lake-event/414888/">most blighted environmental disasters</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, the Oakland-based startup <a href="http://www.lilacsolutions.com/news/lilac-solutions-raises-series-a#:~:text=With%20projects%20under%20development%20across,Lilac%20technology%20around%20the%20world.">announced a $20 million investment</a> led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures (those folks are everywhere), the MIT-affiliated investment firm The Engine and early Uber investor Chris Sacca&#8217;s relatively new climate-focused fund, <a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/companies/">Lowercarbon Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Outside Lilac, there&#8217;s been a stream of VC dollars flowing into the (non-crypto) mining business as software helps extraction companies operate more efficiently. Notable investments include high-tech prospectors like <a href="https://www.koboldmetals.com/">KoBold Minerals</a> (another Breakthrough Energy Ventures portfolio company), which uses big data and machine learning to help pick better targets for mines and <a href="https://www.lunasonde.com/">Lunasonde</a>, which prospects from space using satellites.</p>
<p>Other solutions to the lithium problem are attracting investor attention, too. For Jeff Chamberlain, the founder and chief executive of the battery technology investment firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">Volta Energy Technologies, an alternative may be found in &#8220;urban mining,&#8221; or the recycling of used lithium-ion batteries. </span>For decades, lead-acid batteries have been recycled for their component materials, and Chamberlain expects that the lithium-ion supply chain will evolve to support more efficient reuse of existing materials as well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a slew of companies trying to prove Chamberlain right. They include businesses like <a href="https://li-cycle.com">Li-Cycle</a>, which yesterday announced that it would go public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210216005429/en/Li-Cycle-North-America%E2%80%99s-Largest-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Resource-Recycling-Company-to-List-on-NYSE-through-Transaction-with-Peridot-Acquisition-Corp."> in a deal that would value the company at $1.67 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, privately-held and venture-backed startups are developing other recycling solutions. <a href="https://www.batteryresourcers.com/">Battery Resourcers</a>, a spinout from Massachusetts&#8217; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, is focused on making cathode power converters from recycled scrap. Singapore-based <a href="https://www.greenli-ion.com/">Green Li-ion</a> is another company that&#8217;s opening a recycling plant for lithium-ion battery cathodes, and <a href="https://northvolt.com/">Northvolt</a>, a Swedish battery startup that was founded by former Tesla executives in 2016, already has an experimental recycling plant up and running.</p>
<p>Finally there&#8217;s J.B. Straubel&#8217;s Nevada-based startup <a href="https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/">Redwood Materials</a>, which was one of the first companies to receive funding from Amazon through its Climate Pledge Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately we won’t have to extract lithium out of rock. We can extract lithium from pools and using urban mining,&#8221; said Chamberlain. Call it Mining 1.0, Version 2 — but it&#8217;s just the kind of investment our world needs if we are going to secure a better climate future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The news is awash with stories of platforms clamping down on misinformation and the angst involved in banning prominent members. But these are Band-Aids over a deeper issue — namely, that the problem of misinformation is one of our own design. Some of the core elements of how we’ve built social media platforms may inadvertently increase polarization and spread misinformation.</p>
<p>If we could teleport back in time to relaunch social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok with the goal of minimizing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories from the outset … what would they look like?</p>
<p>This is not an academic exercise. Understanding these root causes can help us develop better prevention measures for current and future platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Some of the core elements of how we’ve built social media platforms may inadvertently increase polarization and spread misinformation.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As one of the Valley’s leading behavioral science firms, we’ve helped brands like Google, Lyft and others understand human decision-making as it relates to product design. We recently collaborated with TikTok to design a new series of prompts (launched this week) to help stop the spread of potential misinformation on its platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113269" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113269" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image001-2.png" alt="warning label for uploaded video" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image001-2.png 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image001-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image001-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image001-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113269" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits:  <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irrational Labs <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The intervention successfully reduces shares of flagged content by 24%. While TikTok is unique amongst platforms, the lessons we learned there have helped shape ideas on what a social media redux could look like.</p>
<h2>Create opt-outs</h2>
<p>We can take much bigger swings at reducing the views of unsubstantiated content than labels or prompts.</p>
<p>In the experiment we launched together with TikTok, people saw an average of 1.5 flagged videos over a two-week period. Yet in our qualitative research, many users said they were on TikTok for fun; they didn’t want to see any flagged videos whatsoever. In a recent earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg also spoke of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374">Facebook users’ tiring of hyperpartisan content</a>.</p>
<p>We suggest giving people an “opt-out of flagged content” option &#8212; remove this content from their feeds entirely. To make this a true choice, this opt-out needs to be prominent, not buried somewhere users must seek it out. We suggest putting it directly in the sign-up flow for new users and adding an in-app prompt for existing users.</p>
<h2>Shift the business model</h2>
<p>There’s a reason <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146">false news spreads six times faster on social media</a> than real news: Information that’s controversial, dramatic or polarizing is far more likely to grab our attention. And when algorithms are designed to maximize engagement and time spent on an app, this kind of content is heavily favored over more thoughtful, deliberative content.</p>
<p>The ad-based business model is at the core the problem; it’s why making progress on misinformation and polarization is so hard. One internal Facebook team tasked with looking into the issue found that, “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499">our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness</a>.&#8221; But the project and proposed work to address the issues was nixed by senior executives.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is a classic incentives problem. If business metrics that define “success” are no longer dependent on maximizing engagement/time on site, everything will change. Polarizing content will no longer need to be favored and more thoughtful discourse will be able to rise to the surface.</p>
<h2>Design for connection</h2>
<p>A primary part of the spread of misinformation is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417718261">feeling marginalized and alone</a>. Humans are fundamentally social creatures who look to be part of an in-group, and partisan groups frequently provide that sense of acceptance and validation.</p>
<p>We must therefore make it easier for people to find their authentic tribes and communities in other ways (versus those that bond over conspiracy theories).</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg says his ultimate goal with Facebook was to connect people. To be fair, in many ways Facebook has done that, at least on a surface level. But we should go deeper. Here are some ways:</p>
<p>We can design for more active one-on-one communication, <a href="https://research.fb.com/blog/2016/01/online-or-offline-connecting-with-close-friends-improves-well-being/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://research.fb.com/blog/2016/01/online-or-offline-connecting-with-close-friends-improves-well-being/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613502235420000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYinUruCNOwkKSr4f11xIYxbPeuw">which has been shown to increase well-being</a>. We can also nudge offline connection. Imagine two friends are chatting on Facebook messenger or via comments on a post. How about a prompt to meet in person, when they live in the same city (post-COVID, of course)? Or if they’re not in the same city, a nudge to hop on a call or video.</p>
<p>In the scenario where they’re not friends and the interaction is more contentious, platforms can play a role in highlighting not only the humanity of the other person, but things one shares in common with the other. Imagine a prompt that showed, as you’re “shouting” online with someone, everything you have in common with that person.</p>
<p>Platforms should also disallow anonymous accounts, or at minimum encourage the use of real names. Clubhouse has good norm-setting on this: In the onboarding flow they say, “We use real names here.” Connection is based on the idea that we’re interacting with a real human. Anonymity obfuscates that.</p>
<h2>Finally, help people reset</h2>
<p>We should make it easy for people to get out of an algorithmic rabbit hole. YouTube has been under fire for its rabbit holes, but all social media platforms have this challenge. Once you click a video, you’re shown videos like it. This may help sometimes (getting to that perfect “how to” video sometimes requires a search), but for misinformation, this is a death march. One video on flat earth leads to another, as well as other conspiracy theories. We need to help people eject from their algorithmic destiny.</p>
<h2>With great power comes great responsibility</h2>
<p>More and more people now get their news from social media, and those who do <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.journalism.org/2020/07/30/americans-who-mainly-get-their-news-on-social-media-are-less-engaged-less-knowledgeable/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613502235421000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2p042PNFnd3wxjJPw3ACsb_r5lQ">are less likely to be correctly informed about important issues</a>. It’s likely that this trend of relying on social media as an information source will continue.</p>
<p>Social media companies are thus in a unique position of power and have a responsibility to think deeply about the role they play in reducing the spread of misinformation. They should absolutely continue to experiment and run tests with research-informed solutions, as we did together with the TikTok team.</p>
<p>This work isn’t easy. We knew that going in, but we have an even deeper appreciation for this fact after working with the TikTok team. There are many smart, well-intentioned people who want to solve for the greater good. We’re deeply hopeful about our collective opportunity here to think bigger and more creatively about how to reduce misinformation, inspire connection and strengthen our collective humanity all at the same time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aeye, a lidar startup that developed its technology for use in autonomous vehicles as well as to support advanced driver assistance systems in passenger cars, is going public through a merger with CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III that will value the company at $2 billion.</p>
<p>The agreement marks the latest lidar company to turn to so-called blank check companies or SPACs in lieu of a traditional IPO process. Velodyne Lidar kicked off the trend last summer when it announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/">planned to go public</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. Others <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/lidar-startup-aeva-to-go-public-via-2-1-billion-spac-merger/">soon followed</a>, including Luminar, Aeva, Ouster and Innoviz.</p>
<p>Under this deal, Aeye said it was able to raise $225 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from institutional and strategic investors that includes, GM Ventures, Subaru-SBI, Intel Capital, Hella Ventures, Taiwania Capital. Other undisclosed investors also participated. Through the transaction, Aeye will have about $455 million in cash on its balance sheet, proceeds that include $230 million in trust from CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III, a SPAC sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lidar, light detection and ranging radar, measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world around the car. The sensor is considered by many in the emerging automated driving industry as a critical and necessary tool. Velodyne long dominated the lidar industry and supplied most AV developers with its products. Dozens of startups have popped up in the past several years aiming to carve away market share from Velodyne, each one pitching its own variation on the technology and business approach.</p>
<p>In the past three years, lidar companies have tweaked their business models as the timeline to commercialize autonomous vehicles dragged on. Startups began to emphasize their perception software or pitched to automakers that the sensors could — and should — be applied to passenger vehicles to provide redundancy and push the capabilities of driver assistance systems.</p>
<p>AEye is one of several lidar companies that have expanded its focus beyond autonomous vehicles. The company said the capital raised by going public will be used to scale the company in key markets. Aeye&#8217;s pitch is that the company&#8217;s lidar technology along with its partnerships with Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers like Continental makes it well positioned to scale and to be adopted by major automakers. Aeye&#8217;s lidar sensor scans the surroundings and then, with help from its perception software, identifies and focuses on relevant objects.</p>
<p>Automotive, specifically to support ADAS in passenger vehicles and in the long-term within autonomous vehicles, is Aeye&#8217;s foundational market. But the company sees wider industrial and mobility applications in mining, trucking, traffic systems, aviation and drones.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the right price and reliability, we believe lidar will eventually be in everything that has a camera today,&#8221; CEO Blair LaCorte said during an investor presentation. &#8220;With expectations for broad adoption of lidar for consumer and industrial applications, we forecast a total addressable market of $42 billion by 2030.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aeye is at the earliest stages of that total addressable market. The company said it expects to generate $4 million in revenue in 2021 and a net loss (EBITDA) of $59 million. Aeye said commercial production of its sensors are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021, which will help increase revenue to a forecast $13 million in 2022. By 2024, Aeye forecasts $175 million in revenue and says it will be positive EBITDA by the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The combined company will be called AEye Holdings Inc. and is expected to be publicly listed on Nasdaq. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. The management team, which includes Blair LaCorte as CEO, founder Luis Dussan as CTO and Bob Brown as CFO, will remain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/final_amazon_covid_summons_and_complaint_2-16_as_filed.pdf">lawsuit</a> alleging that Amazon failed to provide adequate safety health and safety measures in two New York facilities, and that it unlawfully disciplined and fired employees who complained.</p>
<p>James <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/ny-attorney-general-calls-out-amazons-inadequate-covid-19-measures-and-chilling-labor-policies/">opened an investigation into Amazon</a> in March of last year, which her office says initially focused on conditions at a fulfillment center in Staten Island and a distribution center in Queens — collectively employing more than 5,000 people — before expanding to look at the firing and disciplining of employees as well.</p>
<p>In a statement, James said:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>While Amazon and its CEO made billions during this crisis, hardworking employees were forced to endure unsafe conditions and were retaliated against for rightfully voicing these concerns. Since the pandemic began, it is clear that Amazon has valued profit over people and has failed to ensure the health and safety of its workers. The workers who have powered this country and kept it going during the pandemic are the very workers who continue to be treated the worst. As we seek to hold Amazon accountable for its actions, my office remains dedicated to protecting New York workers from exploitation and unfair treatment in all forms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, Amazon preemptively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/technology/amazon-letitia-james-coronavirus.html">sued James</a>, arguing that workplace safety is a federal matter and that she did not have authority to bring her suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care deeply about the health and safety of our employees, as demonstrated in our filing last week, and we don’t believe the Attorney General’s filing presents an accurate picture of Amazon’s industry-leading response to the pandemic,&#8221; said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel in a statement.</p>
<p>Among other things, the suit alleges that Amazon violated state laws around cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as contact tracing, and that it failed to alter its productivity policies to allow employees &#8220;to take the time necessary to engage in hygiene, sanitation, social-distancing, and necessary cleaning practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit also points to the firing of Christian Smalls (who has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/">filed his own lawsuit against the company</a>) and its warnings to Derrick Palmer as &#8220;swift retaliatory action against workers&#8217; complaints.&#8221;</p>
<p>James&#8217; office says that it&#8217;s seeking changes in Amazon&#8217;s policies, backpay/damages and reinstatement for Smalls, damages for Palmer and &#8220;requiring Amazon to give up the profits it made as a result of its illegal acts.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There will be one more robot on Mars tomorrow afternoon. The Perseverance rover will touch down just before 1:00 Pacific, beginning a major new expedition to the planet and kicking off a number of experiments — from a search for traces of life to the long-awaited Martian helicopter. Here&#8217;s what you can expect from Perseverance tomorrow and over the next few years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big, complex mission — and like the Artemis program, is as much about preparing for the future, in which people will visit the Red Planet, as it is about learning more about it in the present. Perseverance is ambitious even among missions to Mars.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along live, NASA TV&#8217;s broadcast of the landing starts at 11:15 AM Pacific, providing context and interviews as the craft makes its final approach:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/21X5lGlDOfg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Until then, however, you might want to brush up on what Perseverance will be getting up to.</p>
<h2>Seven months of anticipation and seven minutes of terror</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2113234" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113234" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2113234" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg" alt="Illustration of the Perseverance landing capsule entering the Martian atmosphere like a meteor." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-descent.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113234" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>First, the car-sized rover has to get to the surface safely. It&#8217;s been traveling for seven months to arrive at the Red Planet, its arrival heralded by new orbiters from the UAE and China, which both arrived last week.</p>
<p>Perseverance isn&#8217;t looking to stick around in orbit, however, and will plunge directly into the thin atmosphere of Mars. The spacecraft carrying the rover has made small adjustments to its trajectory to be sure that it enters at the right time and angle to put Perseverance above its target, the Jezero crater.</p>
<p>The process of deceleration and landing will take about seven minutes once the craft enters the atmosphere. The landing process is the most complex and ambitious ever undertaken by an interplanetary mission, and goes as follows.</p>
<p>After slowing down in the atmosphere like a meteor to a leisurely 940 MPH or so, the parachute will deploy, slowing the descender over the next minute or two to a quarter of that speed. At the same time, the heat shield will separate, exposing the instruments on the underside of the craft.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113235" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113235" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2113235" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg" alt="Perseverance rover and its spacecraft in an exploded view showing its several main components." width="900" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-parts.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113235" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>This is a crucial moment, as the craft will then autonomously — there&#8217;s no time to send the data to Earth — scan the area below it with radar and other instruments and find what it believes to be an optimal landing location.</p>
<p>Once it does so, from more than a mile up, the parachute will detach and the rover will continue downwards in a &#8220;powered descent&#8221; using a sort of jetpack that will take it down to just 70 feet above the surface. At this point the rover detaches, suspended at the end of a 21-foot &#8220;Sky Crane,&#8221; and as the jetpack descends the cable extends; once it touches down, the jetpack boosts itself away, Sky Crane and all, to crash somewhere safely distant.</p>
<p>All that takes place in about 410 seconds, during which time the team will be sweating madly and chewing their pencils. It&#8217;s all right here in this diagram for quick reference:</p>

<p>Other rovers and orbiters have been turning up promising signs of life on Mars for years: the Mars Express Orbiter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/there-is-liquid-water-on-mars/">discovered liquid water</a> under the surface in 2018; Curiosity found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/22/nasas-curiosity-rover-finds-levels-of-gas-on-mars-that-could-suggest-possibility-of-life/">gaseous hints of life</a> in 2019; Spirit and Opportunity found tons of signs that life could have been supported during their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/the-opportunity-mars-rovers-greatest-shots-and-discoveries/">incredibly long missions</a>.</p>
<p>Jezero Crater was chosen as a region rich in possibilities for finding evidence of life, but also a good venue for many other scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>The most similar to previous missions are the geology and astrobiology goals. Jezero was &#8220;home to an ancient delta, flooded with water.&#8221; Tons of materials coalesce in deltas that not only foster life, but record its presence. Perseverance will undertake a detailed survey of the area in which it lands to help characterize the former climate of Mars.</p>
<p>Part of that investigation will <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8549/nasas-mars-2020-will-hunt-for-microscopic-fossils/">specifically test for evidence of life</a>, such as deposits of certain minerals in patterns likely to have resulted from colonies of microbes rather than geological processes. It&#8217;s not expected that the rover will stumble across any living creatures, but you know the team all secretly hope this astronomically unlikely possibility will occur.</p>
<p>One of the more future-embracing science goals is to collect and sequester samples from the environment in a central storage facility, which can then be sent back to Earth — though they&#8217;re still figuring out how to handle that last detail. The samples themselves will be carefully cut from the rock rather than drilled or chipped out, leaving them in pristine condition for analysis later.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113257" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path-gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113257" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2113257" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path-gif.gif" alt="Animated image showing how Perseverance could travel and retravel certain routes to bring items to a central location." width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113257" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>Perseverance will spend some time doubling back on its path to place as many as 30 capsules full of sampled material in a central depot, which will be kept sealed until such a time as they can be harvested and returned to Earth.</p>
<p>The whole time the rover will be acting as a mobile science laboratory, taking all kinds of readings as it goes. Some of the signs of life it&#8217;s looking for only result from detailed analysis of the soil, for instance, so sophisticating imaging and spectroscopy instruments are on board, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/pixl/">PIXL</a> and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/sherloc/">SHERLOC</a>. It also carries a ground-penetrating radar (RIMFAX) to observe the fine structure of the landscape beneath it. And <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/meda/">MEDA</a> will continuously take measurements of temperature, wind, pressure, dust characteristics, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course the crowd-pleasing landscapes and &#8220;selfies&#8221; NASA&#8217;s rovers have become famous for will also be beamed back to Earth regularly. It has 19 cameras, though mostly they&#8217;ll be used for navigation and science purposes.</p>
<h2>Exploring takes a little MOXIE and Ingenuity</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2113286" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ingenuity-perseverance.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113286" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2113286" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ingenuity-perseverance.gif" alt="Animated image showing the Ingenuity Mars helicopter taking off and flying on Mars." width="800" height="453" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113286" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>Perseverance is part of NASA&#8217;s long-term plan to visit the Red Planet in person, and it carries a handful of tech experiments that could contribute to that mission.</p>
<p>The most popular one, and for good reason, is the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/">Ingenuity Mars Helicopter</a>. This little solar-powered two-rotor craft will be the first ever demonstration of powered flight on another planet (the jetpack Perseverance rode in on doesn&#8217;t count).</p>
<p>The goals are modest: the main one is simply to take off and hover in the thin air a few feet off the ground for 20 to 30 seconds, then land safely. This will provide crucial real-world data about how a craft like this will perform on Mars, how much dust it kicks up, and all kinds of other metrics that future aerial craft will take into account. If the first flight goes well, the team plans additional ones that may look like the GIF above.</p>
<p>Being able to fly around on another planet would be huge for science and exploration, and eventually for industry and safety when people are there. Drones are have already become crucial tools for all kinds of surveying, rescue operations, and other tasks here on Earth — why wouldn&#8217;t it be the same case on Mars? Plus it&#8217;ll get some great shots from its onboard cameras.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter wp-image-2113631 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg" alt="Image of the MOXIE device, which will isolate oxygen from Mars's atmosphere." width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/moxie-perseverance.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/">MOXIE</a> is the other forward-looking experiment, and could be even more important (though less flashy) than the helicopter. It stands for Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, and it&#8217;s all about trying to make breathable oxygen from the planet&#8217;s thin, mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t about making oxygen to breathe, though it could be used for that too. MOXIE is about making oxygen at scales large enough that it could be used to provide rocket fuel for future takeoffs. Though if habitats like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/27/nasas-3d-printed-mars-habitat-competition-doles-out-prizes-to-concept-habs/">these</a> ever end up getting built, it will be good to have plenty of O2 on hand just in case.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NASA&#8217;s 3D-printed Mars Habitat competition doles out prizes to concept habs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/27/nasas-3d-printed-mars-habitat-competition-doles-out-prizes-to-concept-habs/embed/#?secret=KLUmP2mgwe" data-secret="KLUmP2mgwe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For a round trip to Mars, sourcing fuel from the there rather than trucking all the way from Earth to burn on the way back is an immense improvement in many ways. The 30-50 tons of liquid oxygen that would normally be brought over in the tanks could instead be functional payloads, and that kind of tonnage goes a long way when you&#8217;re talking about freeze-dried food, electronics, and other supplies.</p>
<p>MOXIE will be attempting, at a small scale (it&#8217;s about the size of a car battery, and future oxygen generators would be a hundred times bigger), to isolate oxygen from the CO2 surrounding it. The team is expecting about 10 grams per hour, but it will only be on intermittently so as not to draw too much power. With luck it&#8217;ll be enough of a success that this method can be pursued more seriously in the near future.</p>
<h2>Self-roving technology</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2113652" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113652" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2113652" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg" alt="An orbital image of the Jezero Crater region of Mars with a potential path for the rover on it." width="1024" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-path.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113652" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>One of the big challenges for previous rovers is that they have essentially been remote controlled with a 30-mintue delay — scientists on Earth examine the surroundings, send instructions like go forward 40 centimeters, turn front wheels 5 degrees to the right, go 75 centimeters, etc. This not only means a lot of work for the team but a huge delay as the rover makes moves, waits half an hour for more instructions to arrive, then repeats the process over and over.</p>
<p>Perseverance breaks with its forbears with a totally new autonomous navigation system. It has high resolution, wide-angle color cameras and a dedicated processing unit for turning images into terrain maps and choosing paths through them, much like a self-driving car.</p>
<p>Being able to go farther on its own means the rover can cover far more ground. The longest drive ever recorded in a single Martian day was 702 feet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/the-opportunity-mars-rovers-greatest-shots-and-discoveries/">by Opportunity (RIP)</a>. Perseverance will aim to cover about that distance <em>on average</em>, and with far less human input. Chances are it&#8217;ll set a new record pretty quickly once it&#8217;s done tiptoeing around for the first few days.</p>
<p>In fact the first 30 sols after the terrifying landing will be mostly checks, double checks, instrument deployments, more checks, and rather unimpressive-looking short rolls around the immediate area. But remember, if all goes well, this thing could still be rolling around Mars in 10 or 15 years when people start showing up. This is just the very beginning of a long, long mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New Space startup Astra, which is currently focused on commercial rockets, but which plans to eventually build satellites, too, has hired one of Apple&#8217;s key engineering leaders to head its own engineering efforts. Benjamin Lyon spent over two decades at Apple, where he worked on everything from the iPhone, to input devices and sensor hardware, to special projects: the department at Apple working on autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;ve looked at what to do next at Apple, it has always been this combination of &#8216;What is the most impactful thing that I can do for humanity?&#8217; – the iPhone was very much one of these,&#8221; Lyon told me in an interview. &#8220;Phones were awful [at the time], and if we could fundamentally come up with a new interface, that would completely change how people interact with devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creating a mobile device with an interface that was &#8220;completely flexible and completely customizable to the application&#8221; was what seemed so transformative to Lyon about the iPhone, and he sees a direct parallel in the work that Astra is doing to lower the barrier of access to space through cheap, scalable and highly-efficient rocketry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Astra me feels very, very much like redefining what it means for a phone to be smart,&#8221; Lyon said. &#8220;I think the Astra vision is this magical combination of fundamentally taking the rocket science out of space. How do you do that? Well, you better have a great foundation of a team, and a great foundation of core technologies that you can bring together in order to make a compelling series of products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foundations are the key ingredient according not only to Lyon, but also to Astra co-founder and CEO Chris Kemp, who explained why an experienced Apple engineer made the most sense to him to lead a rocket startup&#8217;s engineering efforts.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Astra built a space startup and rocket factory in Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/why-astra-built-a-space-startup-and-rocket-factory-in-silicon-valley/embed/#?secret=DQ4OUhx524" data-secret="DQ4OUhx524" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We did not want anyone from aerospace – I&#8217;ll just I&#8217;ll say that out of the gate,&#8221; Kemp told me. &#8220;Aerospace has not figured out how to build rockets at scale, or do anything profitably – ever. So I found no inspiration from anyone I talked to who had anything to do with with any of the other space-related companies. We do feel that there are people that are at SpaceX and Blue Origin who are really good at what they do. But in terms of the culture that we&#8217;re trying to establish at Astra, if you look back at Apple, and the things that that Benjamin worked on there over many decades, he really took on not only designing the the thing, but also designing the thing that makes the thing, which was more important than the thing itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kemp&#8217;s alluding to Apple&#8217;s lauded ability to work very closely with suppliers and move fundamental component engineering in-house, crafting unique designs for things like the system-on-a-chip that now powers everything from the iPhone to Macs. Apple often designs the processes involved in making those fundamental components, and then helps its suppliers stand up the factories required to build those to its exacting specifications. Astra&#8217;s approach to the space industry centers around a similar approach, with a focus on optimizing the output of its Alameda-based rocket factory, and iterating its products quickly to match the needs of the market while keeping pricing accessible.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/why-astra-built-a-space-startup-and-rocket-factory-in-silicon-valley/">Astra&#8217;s definition of &#8216;iteration&#8217;</a> matches up much more closely with the one used by Silicon Valley than that typically espoused by legacy aerospace companies – going further still in questioning the industry&#8217;s fundamentals than even watershed space tech innovators like SpaceX, which in many ways still adheres to accepted rocket industry methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t do the iPhone X at iPhone 1 – you start with the iPhone 1 and you work your way to the iPhone X,&#8221; Lyon told me. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see that with Astro as well, there&#8217;s going to be this amazing evolution, but it&#8217;s going to be tech company-rate evolution, as opposed to an &#8216;every 20 years&#8217; evolution.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Jm4ebRVt8t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/">Launch startup Astra&#8217;s rocket reaches space</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launch startup Astra&#8217;s rocket reaches space&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/embed/#?secret=Jm4ebRVt8t" data-secret="Jm4ebRVt8t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That sentiment lines up with Astra and Kemp&#8217;s approach to date: The company reached space for the first time late last year, with a rocket that was the second of three planned launches in a rapid iteration cycle designed to achieve that milestone. After the first of these launches (Rocket 3.1 if you&#8217;re keeping track) failed to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/12/rocket-startup-astras-first-orbital-launch-attempt-ends-early-due-to-first-stage-burn-failure/">space last September</a>, Astra quickly went back to the drawing board and tweaked the design to come back for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/">successful attempt in December</a> (Rocket 3.2) – an extremely fast turnaround for an aerospace company by any measure. The company is now focused on its Rocket 3.3 launch, which should only require software changes to achieve a successful orbit, and put it on track to begin delivering commercial payloads for paying customers.</p>

<p>Astra&#8217;s rocket is tiny compared to the mammoth Starship that SpaceX is currently developing, but that&#8217;s part of the appeal that drew Lyon to the startup in the first place. He says the goal of &#8220;design[ing] a rocket to match the application,&#8221; rather than simply &#8220;design[ing] a rocket to end all rockets&#8221; makes vastly more sense to serve the bourgeoning market.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just the beginning,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Then you&#8217;ll take the next step, which is if you look at the technology that&#8217;s in a satellite, and a bunch of the smart technology that&#8217;s in a rocket, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of duplication there. So, get rid of the duplication – design the rocket and the satellite together as one system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, that means contemplating not only launch and satellite as a single challenge, but also managing &#8220;the entire experience of getting to space and managing a constellation&#8221; as &#8220;a single design problem,&#8221; according to Lyon, which is the level of ambition at Astra that he views as on par with that of Steve Jobs at Apple at the outset of the iPhone project.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Astra hopes to be able to provide aspiring space technology companies with everything they need so that the actual space component of their business is fully handled. The idea is that startups and innovators can then focus on bringing new models and sensing technologies to Astra, worrying only about payload – leaving launch, integration and eventually constellation management to the experts. It&#8217;s not unlike what the App Store unlocked for the software industry, Lyon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to do something that&#8217;s never been done before in aerospace, which is to really scale the production of rockets, and also focus on the overall economics of the business,&#8221; Kemp explained about additional advantages of having Lyon on board. &#8220;As we become a public company, in particular, we have very aggressive EBITDA targets, and very aggressive production targets, much the same way Apple does. We also want to have a new rocket every year, just like [the iPhone] and so to some degree, we found every aspect of Benjamin&#8217;s ethos aligned with our values, and the culture that we&#8217;re creating here at Astro of relentless, constant innovation and iteration.</p>

It’s one of the Pennsylvania-based metal 3D printing company’s largest government contracts, in service of building a portable 3D printing factory for the front line – essentially a method for troops to fabricate broken and missing parts where the need them the most.</p>
<p>“Over the last two years, we’ve really focused on providing our technology into government-type applications: DoD, NASA, DoE,” CEO John Hartner tells TechCrunch. “Sometimes people talk about disrupting the supply chain and getting decentralized manufacturing. This is decentralized and forward deployed, if you will. Be it an emergency, humanitarian mission or frontlines for a war fighter.”</p>
<p>The money from the grant will specifically go toward R&amp;D and building the first unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The system combines a series of machines with a software layer designed to lower the barrier of entry for use. While some training will be required, the hope is that people will be able to operate the system in the field.</p>
<p>“We’ve ruggedized the products that are going inside,” says Hartner. “There’s an element of software that makes the whole thing easier to use together. You start with scanning. So, there’s a possibility that you print from a cloud-based repository, but that may not be available for whatever reason, so you may have a broken part that you can scan and do some digital repair to the file and print.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devices rely on binder jet printing, the core tech behind ExOne’s machines. The system essentially composites powder, layer by layer to build up an object. ExOne expects to deliver the first system by Q3 2022. If all goes well, the parties will discuss further partnerships going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The day before <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a> goes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-hearings-congress-waters-robinhood/">under the the Congressional hammer</a>, domestic rival <a href="https://public.com/">Public.com</a> announced this morning that it has closed a $220 million funding round at a $1.2 billion valuation. News of the round was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/robinhoods-pain-is-publics-gain-as-vcs-rush-to-give-it-more-money/">first broken by TechCrunch</a>. Further reporting <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fintech-publiccom-valued-at-about-12-billion-in-round-led-by-tiger-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">colored in the lines</a> concerning the investment&#8217;s size and valuation range.</p>
<p>Confirming the funding news today, Public added a fresh metric to the mix, namely that it has reached one million members – over the course of just 18 months post-launch, the company was quick to point out.</p>
<p>That means that Public&#8217;s backers – its latest round was put together by prior investors, including Greycroft, Accel, Tiger Global, Inspired Capital and others – values the company at around $1,200 per current &#8220;member.&#8221; Whether or not that feels rich, we leave to you to decide.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But with rising interest in the savings and investing space – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/there-is-infinite-money-for-stock-trading-startups/">some data here</a> &#8212; and Robinhood&#8217;s revenues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">growing to a run rate of more than $800 million</a> in Q4 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">and looking even better at the start of 2021</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to see why investors are backing Public. It&#8217;s even easier if you believe that Robinhood&#8217;s brand has undergone material harm from its woes during the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gamestopo">GameStop</a> saga.</p>

<p>The pair, along with a host of other fintech services that offer savings and investing products, have been buoyed by a secular shift in banking away from the physical world (in-person shopping, bank branches, plastic cards) to the digital (neo-banks, ecommerce, virtual cards). Robinhood shook up the trading world with zero-cost investing, fitting neatly into the mobile and virtual banking future that is being built. And Public has taken that model a step further <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/">by dropping</a> payment for order flow (PFOF), a method revenue generation in which companies like Robinhood get a small fee for sending their users&#8217; trades to one particular market maker or another.</p>
<p>TechCrunch recently joked that it seems like &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/there-is-infinite-money-for-stock-trading-startups/">there is infinite money for stock-trading startups</a>,&#8221; in light of the anticipated Public round, which has now has arrived. Let&#8217;s see who is next to take home a big check.</p>

<p>Ally raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/ally-raises-8m-series-a-for-its-okr-solution/">an $8 million Series A in August, 2019</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ally-raises-15m-series-b-to-scale-its-okr-focused-service/">a $15 million Series B in October of the same year</a>. The Series C is more than its A and B rounds put together – and doubled.</p>
<p>That Ally raised such a large round really wasn&#8217;t too big a surprise. OKR-software rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">Gtmhub raised a $30 million Series B earlier this year</a>, and companies in this particular software niche reported rapid-fire growth last year. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">collected growth metrics</a> from a host of companies competing in the OKR and corporate goal-setting market, including Ally. In 2020, <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a>, <a href="https://www.perdoo.com/">Perdoo</a>, <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a>, and Ally.io all grew in the triple digits.</p>
<p>In a blog post that TechCrunch saw before publication, Madrona investor and Ally backer S. Somasegar noted that &#8220;nearly $300 million&#8221; has been invested into OKR startups in the last two years. Such rapid growth from so many players in such a competitive space could signal a huge market.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rapid growth in 2020 reveals OKR software market&#8217;s untapped potential&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/embed/#?secret=mbAWonxKXj" data-secret="mbAWonxKXj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ally&#8217;s latest round makes it clear that investors expect similar growth from the cohort in 2021.</p>
<p>For flavor, we got new growth numbers from Ally.io. Previously the startup had shared growth of 3.3x in 2020. Its CEO Vetri Vellore told TechCrunch in an email that Ally.io&#8217;s &#8220;revenue has increased by 5x and [has] added over 600 customers&#8221; since its Series B, which came around 15 months prior. That&#8217;s quick.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the sort of growth that venture investors want to own a piece of. So, even though Vellore told TechCrunch that his company has &#8220;most of [its] Series B money in the bank,&#8221; it decided to take on more capital &#8220;to accelerate further,&#8221; to which we&#8217;d add <em>because it could.</em></p>
<p>Ally did not have to twist arms to raise more. Vellore described the round as &#8220;extremely competitive&#8221; in an email, noting that he had &#8220;started the [fundraising] process in early January.&#8221; It&#8217;s just over mid-February, so the round came together quickly: &#8220;Within two weeks of starting the process, we were able to wrap it up,&#8221; the CEO wrote, adding that the investment &#8220;was heavily oversubscribed due to strong interest from both existing investors and our new investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The market for OKR software, and corporate goal-setting software in general, is proving to be large, and lucrative. Let&#8217;s see which rival player is the next to raise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers throughout the United States will now have the option to pay for street parking right from Google Maps as part of an expanded partnership with transportation software companies Passport and Parkmobile. Google also announced it was extending this contactless payment feature to public transit users.</p>
<p>Google Maps&#8217; pay for parking feature will expand first via Android to more than 400 U.S. cities, including Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York and Washington D.C. The feature will be available through the iOS version of the Google Maps app soon, the company said. The transit feature will include more than 80 transit agencies globally.</p>
<p>The parking feature, which integrates with Passport&#8217;s operating system, launched in Austin last year. The two companies indicated, at the time, that the feature would eventually roll out in other U.S. cities. While the expansion was expected, it&#8217;s still a boon for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/investors-find-a-spot-for-65-million-in-passports-parking-management-tech/">North Carolina-based startup</a>, which is now integrated in one of the most widely used navigation apps. The same goes for Parkmobile, which is also embedded in Google Maps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aim, according to Google Maps product manager Vishal Dutta and Google Pay&#8217;s Fausto Araujo, is to help drivers users pay for parking without having to touch a meter — a compelling feature in this era of COVID-19.</p>
<p>When navigating with Google Maps on iOS and Android, drivers in certain cities in the U.S. will see an option to pay for parking with Google Pay as they approach their destination. This means a user has to set up a Google Pay account, which is linked to a credit or debit card. From there, drivers add their meter number, the amount of time they wish to pay for, and complete the payment via Google Pay. Parkers can also add time to their meter from their Google Pay app without returning to their vehicle.</p>
<div class="article-meta__author-title">
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google said the payment feature has been extended to including transit fares for more than 80 transit agencies around the world. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ll be able to plan your trip, buy your fare, and start riding without needing to toggle between multiple apps,&#8221; Google wrote in a blog post.</span></p>
<p>The transit pay option pops up in Google Maps in the user&#8217;s directions. In places like San Francisco, users will also be able to buy a digital Clipper card directly from Google Maps. Once they&#8217;ve purchased their fare, the user just needs tap their phone on the reader or show their digital ticket.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a>, a low-code app development service, announced that it has closed $150 million in new capital. The round was led by Abdiel Capital and Tiger Global. Notably this is not the largest funding event that the Portugal and U.S.-based software company has raised. TechCrunch covered a $360 million round that OutSystems<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/portugals-outsystems-raises-360m-from-kkr-and-goldman-sachs/"> raised in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>OutSystems was founded in 2001, making it older than most companies that we cover on TechCrunch, and yet it remains privately held. And like many startups, it appears to have caught a tailwind from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">accelerating digital transformation</a> of companies both large and small.</p>
<p>By selling $150 million worth of its own shares at a $9.5 billion valuation, OutSystems parted ways with around 1.6% of itself in the deal. Investors would not be willing to buy such a tiny slice of a company for such a price if they didn&#8217;t have confidence in its future performance.</p>
<p>The new funds put OutSystems on an IPO path, we reckon; the company declined to discuss public market plans with TechCrunch. It could go out sooner rather than later. This round smells a bit like pre-IPO capital, and OutSystems touted its model to TechCrunch as &#8220;efficient&#8221; in a conversation about its new funding, implying moderate cash-consumption at worst.</p>
<p>TechCrunch had asked the company to break down its stated plan to invest its new capital in both go-to-market (GTM) capabilities and product (R&amp;D) work. OutSystems CEO Paulo Rosado told TechCrunch in an email that even before this announcement OutSystems was &#8220;steadily increasing both our R&amp;D and GTM capacity,&#8221; meaning that it was &#8220;investing for growth.&#8221; The company remains &#8220;focused on building scale in an efficient way,&#8221; the CEO added.</p>
<p>OutSystems works on <em>low</em>-code app development, in contrast to the startups and more mature private concerns that are focused on the <em>no-</em>code project; no-code tools do not involve code, while low-code services bring together some coding along with visual programming interfaces.</p>
<p>In an interview with Rosado in late 2020, he explained to TechCrunch the differences between no-code and low-code as both complexity (the ability to tackle heavy-duty internal corporate workflows) and extensibility (the ability to adapt).</p>
<p>In OutSystems&#8217; view low-code is simply better suited to creating material corporate apps. Here&#8217;s how the CEO explained it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is not low-code is worse than no-code. If no-code is very narrow, which most no-code tools are, when you get [a] change request that goes beyond what you can do visually, that&#8217;s it. The only answer that you have for the customer is &#8220;no, we cannot do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With low-code, you can do it. But you have to do it with code. You go, you [add] code, and the code then gets blended into the no-code portion.So low-code means it&#8217;s a no-code capability, with the possibility of jumping into code.</p></blockquote>
<p>No-code fans would argue that as their tools&#8217; ability to avoid code improves, the code-required portion of development that Rosado details will decline. Regardless, the OutSystem&#8217;s method approach to the market appears to be working, if its recent capital raise is any indication.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3OJDGFlmGv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">Subscription-based pricing is dead: Smart SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based models</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Subscription-based pricing is dead: Smart SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/embed/#?secret=3OJDGFlmGv" data-secret="3OJDGFlmGv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back to the round, to better understand of OutSystems&#8217; market position in both competitive and completeness terms, TechCrunch asked the CEO about its relative strength in customer pricing calls. He responded by saying that the OutSystem&#8217;s &#8220;pricing model is based on platform utilization&#8221; over traditional SaaS pricing. We could quibble with the company here – it does have seat limits on lower-priced tiers – but the focus on consumption over traditional SaaS reminded us more of on-demand software over what Salesforce pioneered. Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">the changes we&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS market lately</a>, it&#8217;s a distinction worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>Finally, how competitive is the low-code market that OutSystems&#8217; is now taking on with fresh funding? According to its CEO, their chief competitor is not some other startup, but, instead &#8220;non-consumption.&#8221; A bit like how Netflix is <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition">competing with sleep</a>, instead of HBO.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the no-code and low-code for quite some time. We put words together concerning OutSystem&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/02/outsystems-raises-55m-for-its-rapid-application-delivery-platform/">2016-vintage, $55 million round</a> for example. But lately it seems that the demand for corporate apps – be they no-code or low-code – does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/whats-ahead-for-no-code-and-low-code-startups/">appear to have accelerated</a>. In the last four or six quarters, startups in the less-code market have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps/">consistently reported high-demand to TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if the moment is enough to carry OutSystems all the way to the public markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has a host of big product updates coming this year, and it just detailed a lot of them in a blog post from Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan. Google&#8217;s streaming video site plans to expand its TikTok-esque Shorts mobile video creation and consumption tool to the U.S. (it&#8217;s currently in beta in India), make YouTube TV a more full-featured in-home cable alternative, add customization and control options to YouTube Kids and more.</p>
<p>Many of the product updates detailed by Mohan are expansions of existing tests and beta features, but there are also entirely new developments that could significantly change how YouTube works for both creators and audiences. YouTube&#8217;s focus on monetization and new formats also indicates a desire to keep creators happy, which makes a lot of sense in the context of the platform&#8217;s popular new mobile-first competitor TikTok.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a TL;DR of everything YouTube announced today for its 2021 roadmap:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Expansion of its in-video e-commerce shopping experience beyond the current limited beta</li>
<li>Expansion of <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632365">Applause tipping</a> feature</li>
<li>YouTube Shorts launching in the U.S.</li>
<li>Adding the ability for parents to specify individual channels and videos for their kids to be able to watch on YouTube Kids</li>
<li>New features for user playlists on YouTube Music, and making those playlists more discoverable to others</li>
<li>A new paid add-on coming to YouTube TV that offers 4K streaming, DVR for off-line playback, and unlimited simultaneous in-home streams</li>
<li>Automatic video chaptering for some videos that don&#8217;t have creator-defined ones</li>
<li>A redesigned YouTube VR experience focused on accessibility, search and better navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube has a big year planned, and some of these changes could significantly alter the dynamics of the platform. Making it possible for every creator to turn their channel in a mini shopping channel has a lot of potential to alter what it looks like to build a business on the platform, while YouTube TV&#8217;s transformation narrows the gap even further between that service and traditional cable and satellite provider offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon’s Day 1 Edition program pulled back the curtain ever-so-slightly on the company’s hardware development process. The initial class featured its Echo Frames smart glasses and Loop smart ring. Based on early user feedback, the company only opted to continue production on the former.</p>
<p>But it takes the idea even further. The program is akin to a kind of in-house crowdfunded pre-order program. Amazon presents a handful of concepts and potential customers vote with their pre-order. If the goal is met, they’ll bring the product to market. If not, they spike it. It’s not dissimilar to the “First Flight” program Sony Japan launched a little over five years back.</p>
<p>Clearly Amazon doesn’t wont for resources when it comes to launching products. But while a system like this isn’t necessary, I can certainly appreciate how it will facilitate letting the hardware team get a little weird with it. There have been a few exceptions from the company in recent years, with an Alexa-enabled Big Mouth Billy Bass, but as a rule, big corporations don’t often let really weird hardware concepts get all the way to production.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>There are three products in this first batch, and they run the gamut from straightforward to wacky. The common thread &#8212; at least with this round &#8212; is they all work with Alexa. I’d anticipate that will be the case going forward, but Amazon’s willingness to tip its hand has some very clear limits.</p>

<p>On the more mundane side is a Smart Stick Note printer. Basically you tell Alexa/Echo something and it will use thermal technology to print to an off-brand Post-it. The thermal tech means there’s no ink to replace. The idea is you can print, say, grocery lists and event reminders using voice. That’s up for a $90 pre-order (like Kickstarter/Indiegogo, prices will increase if/when these come to market).</p>

<p>The $35 Smart Scale is designed to work with an Echo Show. You say something like, “Alexa, ask Smart Scale how much sugar is in these blueberries,” or “Alexa, ask Smart Scale to weigh 200 calories of blueberries” and the smart screen will show off the nutritional information for the weighed amount.</p>
<p>The weirdest/most fun of the bunch is the Smart Cuckoo Clock. Following up on the much more mundane Echo Wall Clock, the proposed model adds a mechanical cuckoo to the mix. There’s also a removable pendulum, allowing users to mount it on a wall or stick it on a shelf. That one is $80 in pre-order.</p>

<p>The company isn’t listing specific goals, but each project will show the percentage toward completion (with no numbers listed). If the goal isn’t met, pre-orders won’t be charged and the company will move on to the next project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a> has created an open source observability trifecta that includes Prometheus for monitoring, Loki for logging and Tempo for tracing. Today, the company announced it was releasing enterprise versions of these open source projects in a unified stack designed specifically for the needs of large companies.</p>
<p>Company CEO Raj Dutt says that this product is really aimed at the largest companies in the world, who crave  control over their software. &#8220;We&#8217;re really going after at scale users who want a cutting edge observability platform based on these leading open source projects. And we are adding a lot of feature differentiation in the enterprise version along with 24/7 support from the experts, from the people who have actually created software,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Among those features is a set of plug-ins that lets these large customers pull data into the platform from leading enterprise software companies including Splunk, New Relic, MongoDB and Snowflake. The Enterprise Stack also provides enhanced authentication and security.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dutt calls this product self-managed to contrast it with the managed cloud versions of the product the company already has been offering for some time. &#8220;We have two main products, Grafana Cloud and now Grafana Enterprise Stack. Grafana Cloud is our hosted deployment model, and the Grafana Enterprise Stack is essentially licensed software that customers are free to run however they want, whether that&#8217;s on prem, in a colocation company like Equinix or on the cloud vendor of their choice,&#8221; Dutt explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xkP7JMDwVw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/grafana-labs-adds-a-free-tier-to-its-managed-observability-platform/">Grafana Labs adds a free tier to its managed observability platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grafana Labs adds a free tier to its managed observability platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/grafana-labs-adds-a-free-tier-to-its-managed-observability-platform/embed/#?secret=xkP7JMDwVw" data-secret="xkP7JMDwVw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They can also mix and match their deployments across the cloud or on-prem in a hybrid style, and the large enterprise customers that the company is going after with this product should like that flexibility. &#8220;It also allows them to hybridize their deployments, so they may decide to use the cloud for metrics, but their logs contain a lot of sensitive information [and they want to deploy that on prem]. And since it&#8217;s a composable stack, they may have a hybrid deployment that&#8217;s partly in the cloud cloud and partly on prem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When you combine this new enterprise version with the managed cloud version that already exists, it gives Grafana another potentially large revenue source. The open source products act as a driver, giving Grafana a way into these companies, and Dutt says they know of over 700,000 instances of the open source products in use across the world.</p>
<p>While the open source business model usually only turns a fraction of these users into paying customers, having numbers like this gives the company a huge head start and it&#8217;s gotten the attention of investors. The company has already raised over $75 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/grafana-labs-nabs-24m-series-a-for-open-source-based-data-analytics-stack/">a $24 million Series A 2019</a> and a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/17/2079144/0/en/Grafana-Labs-Raises-50-Million-to-Accelerate-R-D-Investments-in-Open-Source-Logs-Metrics-and-Composable-Observability.html">$50 million Series B</a> in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://edgybees.com/">Edgybees</a>, a company that helps businesses, first responders and military users accurately geotag and augment their aerial video streams in real time, today announced that it has raised a $9.5 million Series A round. The news comes almost exactly two years after the company announced its $5.5 million seed round. <a href="https://seraphim.vc/">Seraphim Capital</a>, which specializes in <a href="https://seraphim.vc/focus/">space tech investments</a>, led this new round. New investors <a href="https://refinery.com/">Refinery Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.lgtechventures.com/">LG Technology Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.kodemgrowth.com/">Kodem Growth</a>, as well as existing investors <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>, 8VC, <a href="http://www.verizonventures.com/">Verizon Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/about/company-overview/ventures.html">Motorola Solutions Venture Capital</a> also participated.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to ensure positive human outcomes during life-saving missions,” says Edgybees co-founder and CEO Adam Kaplan. &#8220;Our new partners will be key to continuing to push our mission forward. With their unique industry expertise, we are poised to expand our global footprint and drive innovation within the industry. We look forward to the next phase of growth, meeting the critical demands of the defense, public safety and critical infrastructure markets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Using the company&#8217;s Visual Intelligence Platform, users can easily register and track assets in video show by a drone, for example. The standard use case here would be to help first responders get an accurate picture of an evolving emergency on top of live images from the scene, with the ability to track all of their assets and personnel in real time. But Edgybees has also shown other use cases that range from tracking and visualizing golf games to insurance and defense use cases.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Edgybees, which had its start in Israel but is now based in San Diego, launches its Argus platform, which makes it easier for users to bring their own drone and other live video platforms to the service&#8217;s geo-registration engine.</p>

<p><span class="il">&#8220;Edgybees</span> solves a huge problem in spatial computing: how do you really know what you are seeing through fast moving airborne or other video feeds? <span class="il">Edgybees</span> brings together the real and virtual worlds and helps first responders save lives, industrial drone users save money, and defense teams get the mission done,&#8221; Ourcrowd CEO Jon Medved explained.</p>
<p>Similarly, Seraphim managing partner and CEO Mark Boggett noted that he thinks of Edgybees as a Google Maps fused with live video. &#8220;Their geo-referencing capability is a breakthrough technology that brings a new level of insight and usability to video streams from space, drones or bodycams. We are very excited about <span class="il">Edgybees</span>, not only for the innovation it brings to public safety and defense, but because its ability to be utilized in a wide range of industries,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv-based <a href="https://spectralops.io/">Spectral</a> is bringing its new DevSecOps code scanner out of stealth today and announcing a $6.2 million funding round. The startup&#8217;s programming language-agnostic service aims to automated code security development teams to help them detect potential security issues in their codebases and logs, for example. Those issues could be hardcoded API keys and other credentials, but also security misconfiguration and shadow IT assets.</p>
<p>The four-person founding team has a deep background in building AI, monitoring and security tools. CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondot/?originalSubdomain=il">Dotan Nahum</a> was a Chief Architect at Klarna and Conduit (now Como, though you may remember Conduit from its <a href="https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/6900-remove-search-conduit-com-redirect">infamous</a> toolbar that was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/10/confirmed-1-3b-mobilebrowser-toolbar-startup-conduit-is-splitting-still-mum-on-perion-acquisition/">spun off</a>), and the CTO at Como and HiredScore, for example. Other founders worked on building monitoring tools at Elastic and HP and on security at Akamai. As Nahum told me, the idea for Spectral came to him and co-founder and COO Idan Didi during their shared time at mobile application build Conduit/Como.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113774" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113774" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png 1853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spectral</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We basically stored certificates for every client that we had, so we could submit their apps to the various marketplaces,&#8221; Nahum told me of his experience at Counduit/Como. &#8220;That certificate really proves that you are who you are and it&#8217;s super sensitive. And at each point at these companies, I really didn&#8217;t have the right tools to actually make sure that we&#8217;re storing, handling, detecting [this information] and making sure that it doesn&#8217;t leak anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nahum decided to quit his current job and started to build a prototype to see if he could build a tool that could solve this problem (and his work on this prototype quickly discovered an issue at Slack). And as enterprises move from on-premises software to the cloud and to microservices and DevOps, the need for better DevSecOps tools is only increasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The emphasis is to create a great developer experience,&#8221; Nahum noted. &#8220;Because that&#8217;s where we started from. We didn&#8217;t start as a top down cyber tool. We started as a modest DevOps friendly, developer-friendly tool.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113773" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spectral</p></div></p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Spectral&#8217;s approach, which uses a machine learning model to detect these breaches across programming languages, is that it also scans public-facing systems. On the backend, Spectral integrates with tools like Travis, Jenkins, CircleCI, Webpack, Gatsby and Netlify, but it can also monitor Slack, npm, maven and log providers &#8212; tools that most companies don&#8217;t really think about when they think about threat modeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our solution prevents security breaches on a daily basis,” said <span class="il">Spectral</span> co-founder and COO Idan Didi. &#8220;The pain points we’re addressing resonate strongly across every company developing software, because as they evolve from own-code to glue-code to no-code approaches they allow their developers to gain more speed, but they also add on significant amounts of risk. <span class="il">Spectral</span> lets developers be more productive while keeping the company secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company was founded in mid-2020, but it already has about 15 employees and counts a number of large publicly-listed companies among its customers.</p>
