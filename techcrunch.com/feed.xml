					<description><![CDATA[Its proprietary fermentation process will enable QOA to scale production by 2035 and be able to price its "chocolate" products the same or below the cost of traditional chocolate.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Munich-based QOA is gearing up to be among the first to bring a chocolate product to market that is 100% cocoa free.</p>
<p>It is also now backed by $6 million in seed funding in an investment round led by Cherry Ventures with participation by 50years, World Fund, Nucleus Capital, Trellis Road, Pioneer Fund and Tet Ventures.</p>
<p>The company kicked off this year, founded by the sister-and-brother team of Drs. Sara and Maximilian Marquart. Sara Marquart is a food chemist with a specialty in flavor formation, while Max Marquart is a material scientist and now three-time entrepreneur.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224542" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1638/chocolate-industry/">global chocolate confectionery industry</a> was valued at over $208 billion in 2020, and is the <a href="https://www.franchisehelp.com/industry-reports/chocolate-industry-analysis-2020-cost-trends/">largest part of the industry in the U.S</a>. Two-thirds of the world’s cocoa supply comes from West Africa, but is at risk — one of the reasons the Marquarts decided to focus on it. Currently, up to 50% of the current <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/in-the-field/global-climate-related-risks-in-cocoa-website-project/#:~:text=Global%20climate%20change%20already%20negatively,diseases%2C%20and%20more%20erratic%20rainfall.">cocoa supply is at risk</a> due to pathogens and climate change, and cocoa is playing a role in both <a href="https://engagethechain.org/cocoa">deforestation</a> and <a href="https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/importing-risk/cocoa/">forced child labor</a>.</p>
<p>“Our food supply is threatened due to the way we eat,” Max Marquart told TechCrunch. “We love chocolate, however, we realized that there are some sustainability risks and wanted to do something about it so we can still have it in the future.”</p>
<p>Companies, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/from-improving-cancer-treatments-to-saving-the-bees-these-are-the-companies-in-indiebios-latest-class/">California Cultured</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/disruptive-new-company-voyage-foods-tackles-the-worlds-biggest-issues-in-food-commoditization-301367787.html">Voyager Foods</a>, are also creating chocolate without the cocoa using different approaches. Meanwhile, QOA developed a fermentation process that uses natural byproducts from other food-making processes for its base material. It then uses proprietary microbactera and flavor formation to create a vegan product that mimics the texture and flavor of chocolate, but without any artificial additives, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fermentation process will enable the company to scale production by 2035 and be able to price its products the same or below the cost of traditional chocolate. In fact, Marquart is predicting that in the future, the chocolate market will have two pillars: one half that is exclusive, expensive products made with normal cocoa, and the other QOA products.</p>
<p>QOA was part of Y Combinator this year and was able to get its product test kit going so people can sample nine options. Marquart expects to have QOA’s first product on the market in 2022, and the new funding will go toward building out its first pilot production facility in Munich to complement one it has in Switzerland and hiring.</p>
<p>The company is in talks with its first business-to-business customers and expects to close some smaller contracts soon, Marquart  said.</p>
<p>“After that, we will go after our Series A so we can build out larger production lines,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap said today it has amassed 100 million monthly active users in India, an impressive feat in the key overseas market where Facebook and Google reach over half a billion people, and is inking deals with a range of firms including Android smartphone vendors, entertainment TV channels Sony and Zee TV and e-commerce giant Flipkart to make further inroads in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>At a virtual event on Wednesday, Snap co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel shared the milestone, highlighting some of the company’s localization efforts that has helped to make inroads in India. The milestone and scores of partnerships today mark Snap’s major shift in strategy for the Indian market, where until two to three years ago it had a limited presence and relevance. (Snap has over 500 million monthly active users worldwide.)</p>
<p>The company has cracked India in recent years after it improved its Android app. More than 98% of smartphones in India run Android. Snap appointing Durgesh Kaushik as its head for the India business has also significantly helped the firm develop and improve relationships with local creators and businesses, many of them have told TechCrunch in recent quarters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We have made significant investments to localize the Snapchat experience for the Indian community. We have added culturally relevant content, developed highly active and creative local creator communities, and invested in local products, marketing initiatives, and language support,” said Spiegel at the event.</p>
<p>“Following these efforts to bring a localized experience to Indian Snapchatters, we now reach 100 million Snapchatters monthly in India. We will continue to anchor our efforts around celebrating local culture and talent, while empowering, growing, and providing resources for our community of Indian creators.”</p>
<p>At the company’s second annual event for India, Snap also announced a number of partnerships it has inked to accelerate its growth in the country. It has formed a “strategic partnership” with Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart to develop AR experiences. The company said this is the first time it has formed a partnership of this kind with an e-commerce firm.</p>
<p>“Through this partnership, shoppers will be able to begin their shopping and e-commerce engagement journey through Snapchat AR, making the process easy from the comfort of their homes!” the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap has also partnered with India’s Sugar Cosmetics and MyGlamm, both of which will now adopt Snap’s AR shopping beta program to offer virtual beauty and makeup try-on experiences to customers.</p>
<p>“Augmented reality is at the core of Snapchat’s offerings in India. Our efforts to stay culturally relevant and offer unique AR experiences have resonated with 100 million Indian Snapchatters. We have worked towards empowering students and youth with essential AR Skills through workshops and lensathons,” said Bobby Murphy, Snap co-founder and chief technology officer, at the event.“We aim to partner with more local creators in India to grow the number of incredible experiences available to Snapchatters. At Snap, our intent is to make AR more accessible, useful and practical than ever before.”</p>
<p>In another India-first initiative, Snap said it has partnered with all top Android original equipment manufacturers (or Android vendors) that together have an install base of over 100 million devices in the country. These firms will pre-install the Snapchat app on their devices. There’s also a partnership with Samsung to offer a “Fun Mode” to bring some Snap’s AR-powered Lenses to Samsung’s India-focused M Series of smartphones.</p>
<p>The company also released a number of Creator Shows including &#8216;What’s On My Plate&#8217; featuring Anushka Sen and Vir Das and The Most Epic Max Show and said it is commissioning 120 episodes of new content overall in India for the next year.</p>
<p>The company said its Discover section has become very popular in India. The section features content from 70 local Indian channels across news, fashion, entertainment, and comedy. It&#8217;s now planning to populate the app with even more curated content it said, announcing tie-ups with leading entertainment channels such as Sony Entertainment Television and Zee TV.</p>
<p>The company said its India business has also rapidly expanded its monetisation capabilities to cater to businesses of all shapes and sizes. It saw an increase of net new advertisers by 70% last year and has worked with firms such as Spotify, Swiggy, LG, OnePlus, and ITC Yippee Noodles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Surveys have long been used by marketing teams and other business decision makers to learn how customers tick. But they can be costly to put together, hard to run at scale, and, at the end of the day, are only as credible as the data that gets put into them. Today, a London startup called <a href="https://www.askattest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attest</a>, which has built a cloud-based, no-code, big-data solution that it believes provides an answer to those challenges, is announcing $60 million in growth funding, in the wake of record business growth in the last couple of years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeremy King, the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, says that its machine learning-based approach is gaining traction against the many incumbent players in the field of online market research &#8212; there are hundreds of them ranging from Kantar and SurveyMonkey through to Qualtrics and many more &#8212; because it provides faster and more accurate results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The dark secret is that most online research has been very low quality,&#8221; he said in an interview, noting that if you took the same brief to five traditional market research organizations, you&#8217;d likely get five different sets of responses, not unlike taking one building brief to five architects. Attest&#8217;s ambition is to move away from that and build a much more consistent, and thus reliable, framework for market research.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224488" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are trying to make it as good as we can get it. It&#8217;s still not perfect but at least we are trying, and most online research frankly doesn’t try at all,&#8221; King said. He also described the company&#8217;s methodology as &#8216;suicidally transparent.&#8217; It&#8217;s a pitch that indeed does sound pretty honest, and yet it seems to have struck a chord with a lot of big names. Its customer list includes <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Microsoft, Santander, Walgreens/Boots, Klarna, Brew Dr. Kombucha, Fabletics, eToro and Publicis, among <a href="https://www.askattest.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The investment is coming from returning investor NEA and Kismet, along with other unnamed backers, and Attest said that it brings the total it has raised to date to $85 million. Other investors in the company have included Oxford Capital and Episode 1 (which co-led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/market-research-tech-startup-attest-raises-3-1m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.1 million round in 2019</a>). </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Attest is not disclosing its valuation, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/market-research-tech-startup-attest-raises-3-1m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> reveals that it was just under $273 million post-money in August of this year, when this latest round appears to have actually closed. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">As you might expect from a startup working in the world of data, Attest has some pretty compelling data points of its own.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The startup has built out a massive database that is aggregated from hundreds of individual panels, user groups and more, altogether totaling 110 million consumers across 49 countries. Its promise is that any user (no tech expertise required) can create a survey within minutes to target any segment of users that it wants out of that bigger pool and will get responses back in 24 hours if not sooner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Within those results, Attest guarantees the data in terms of response numbers and integrity using a complex set of algorithms as part of what King described as a 15-step process that starts with formulating questions, sourcing audiences, processing the data and providing it in visualizations that are useful to the person doing the research. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.askattest.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced</a> on a freemium model, where those on paid tiers basically buy credits that are used based on one credit equalling one response per question. These credits work out to ranging in price between 40 cents and 60 cents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">King said that Attest does not rely on paying users, nor placing surveys in access gates, nor building campaigns that run on social media and are built on asking questions that are indirectly mapped on to your demographic (the dreaded &#8216;Which 1980s Brat Packer are you?&#8217;). These, King says, are gateways to low-quality data, since people usually only click on them to get them out of the way. Instead, it relies on those algorithms, which in part are designed to figure out which kinds of audiences are most useful and receptive to answering the questions you are asking. That being said, those building questions can also opt to work with actual humans at Attest if they need help figuring out useful questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Surveys and the bigger topic of &#8220;consumer engagement&#8221; have been something of a hot-button issue in the last several years, not least because of the roles that they potentially play in areas like data collection and how that data ultimately might be tied to a particular user. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some believe</a> that Facebook, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other social media companies</a> that have built their business models on engagement, have a lot to answer for in how they build experiences and tweak algorithms to surface more engaging content, irrespective of the quality or nature of the media in question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">King says that what Attest does is a big step removed from all of that: although full of complexity and technology at the back end, at the front end they are more old school and direct, aimed at figuring out, for example, whether Bertolli olive oil should finally come clean and admit it&#8217;s not Italian, but in fact Spanish in origin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In what is estimated to be an $80 billion market, as data becomes more of a support &#8212; and in some cases a replacement for &#8212; basic intuition in business decision-making, King said the company has seen a growing demand for more surveying on its platform, and that is why investors are interested, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Today’s investment underscores our commitment to Attest and our belief in their stellar team and innovative technology, which is revolutionising access to high quality consumer insights for brands around the world at such an exciting scale,&#8221; said Colin Bryant, a partner at NEA, in a statement. “In the current climate, the need to tap into consumer behavior has never been higher, and we’ve seen how Attest has facilitated growth for brands across the pandemic. We foresee the demand for consumer data only getting stronger.”</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Attest is on a trajectory to overtake all incumbents in the market research space, and has its eyes firmly on the largest prizes,&#8221; added Asheque Shams, General Partner at Kismet. &#8220;We are a startup investment firm with a mission to help fast-growing tech companies reach their greatest potential, so we are immensely excited to partner with Jeremy and team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://union54.com/">Union54</a>, the first Zambian startup backed by Y Combinator, has gotten another major venture capital firm on its term sheet: Tiger Global</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the VC juggernaut led its just-completed $3 million seed round, coming only two months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/the-first-zambian-startup-to-get-into-yc-is-developing-africas-first-card-issuing-api/">graduating</a> from Y Combinator’s summer batch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture capital firm Runa Capital, Ace &amp; Company, Todd &amp; Rahul Angel Fund and Vibe VC participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zambian fintech also received checks from angel investors such as Babs Ogundeyi, the CEO of Nigerian neobank Kuda; Risana Zitha, managing director of Renaissance Capital; and Gbenga Ajayi, former director of SMB Growth at Wise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union54 is an API that allows African software companies to issue and manage their debit cards without needing a bank or third-party processor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders and couple <a href="https://zm.linkedin.com/in/perseus">Perseus Mlambo</a> and <a href="https://zm.linkedin.com/in/alessandra-martini-zazu">Alessandra Martini</a> started Union54 this year as a spinoff from their previous company, <a href="https://www.zazuafrica.com/">Zazu</a>, a challenger bank they launched six years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card issuing is a space that is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becoming regionalized, owing to different regulations per geography. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at Zazu, the founders found it difficult and time-consuming to issue cards to its customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working on the problem, they identified the skewed incentives when interacting with card issuers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they launched Union54 not only to solve that problem for themselves but other fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since joining Y Combinator, Zazu has been in stealth mode and only went live this month, CEO Mlambo told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that over 50 companies are currently in Union54’s API sandbox environment. They range from digital banks to post-Series A fintechs and “companies founded on the basis of Union54’s availability.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four companies are currently live in production and have begun issuing virtual cards to their customers. Mlambo says 30 more could join before the end of the year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these companies, the average time it takes to start production and begin issuance takes three to nine days, said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its partners include African unicorn Flutterwave and newer companies such as Payday and Plumter (cross-border fintechs) and crypto exchange platform Bitmama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what else has changed since the company spoke to TechCrunch in August? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve realized that there’s such a huge potential for companies who want to monetize their existing customer bases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we didn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a firm idea of how we would do that. Now, we do and we are the only company in Africa to would give you [fintechs] the interchange.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here’s how the interchange works — Union54 onboards a fintech company and it uses Union54’s API to issue a single card to an employee. When the employee uses the card to pay for stuff online, perhaps </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Netflix subscription or AWS invoice of $30, the fintech earns 1% of that transaction, in this case, $0.30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that might look minute, imagine a fintech that uses Union54’s API to issue cards to more than 20,000 customers who use it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s where the Zambian startup hopes to create value: to help fintechs earn significant revenue from interchange without doing a lot of the heavy lifting linked with card management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only are we allowing fintechs to go to market faster than any bank or card issuer could ever dream of doing, but we’re also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing that our incentives are very much aligned,” said Mlambo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only make money when they do and that’s why we’re happy to give a guarantee with that interchange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking about the investment for Runa Capital, general partner Andre Bliznyuk said the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support Union54’s efforts to “supercharge the African fintech ecosystem by enabling their customers to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch new card-based products and deliver tangible value to the consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global declined to comment on the investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s rather interesting that the investment firm is writing its fourth investment in an African fintech startup this year after Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">in March</a>, FairMoney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">in July</a> and Mono, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">this month</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a more impressive fact: Union54 seems to be its first bet outside Nigeria or South Africa, two of Africa’s four most dominant tech ecosystems, including Kenya and Egypt. Tiger Global had invested in Nigerian startups Jobberman, Cheki and Wakanow, and South African e-commerce company Takealot this past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A far cry from Nigeria and South Africa’s bubbling tech ecosystem, Zambia has a relatively quiet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startup and venture capital scene; therefore, Tiger Global’s participation in Union54’s seed round is a massive win for the southern African nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In retrospect, though, Mlambo and Martini’s experience as founders of Zazu, where they raised over $2 million as one of Zambia’s most funded startups, cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be written</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off as a contributor to Union54’s seeming success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mlambo stated that when the company was raising this round, it prioritized speed and looked for a global partner due to the limitations imposed by its primary location in Zambia. And Tiger Global wasted no time proving it was the investor Union54 wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The discussion with Tiger was pretty straightforward; they committed pretty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the process was pretty smooth,” the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Union54,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founders are taking on a pan-African problem, not a Zambian one. Consequently, the task ahead is in multiples, but so is the reward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Mlambo claims that Union54, in less than a month of operation, currently transacts more than Zazu’s volume after its first 10 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mlambo touts Zambia as a solid place to carry out business. However, he says it’s been challenging to convince people to move to Zambia for work, so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Union54 has had to rely on remote work (which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the norm now) for most of its startup life. It currently has a lean team of 10 located in Nigeria, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union54 plans to use this investment to ramp up recruitment across engineering, product, marketing, and sales teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Zambian company will also use the funds to expand its regional customer base.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The purpose of this funding is to help us find the best of African talent, people who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to work on big problems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The investment helps us to be able to go to them and say, ‘hey, we’re a well-funded company, we’ve got customers using us, we’re earning revenue and this is going to be one of the most important companies to come out of Africa.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But conclusively, the goal, Mlambo said, is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">place the company in a stronger position to raise an attractive Series A within the next few months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma, a Ghanaian health startup, has taken a controlling stake in Uganda’s Vine Pharmacy for an undisclosed amount, marking the firm’s entry into its latest market in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma disclosed to TechCrunch that it has acquired a 55 percent stake previously held by  the Abraaj Group, a private equity firm that collapsed after investors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, sounded an alarm over the administration of its $1 billion healthcare fund. Abraaj bought Vine Pharmacy in 2013 when it was the largest pharmacy chain in Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vine Pharmacy take-over comes two years after the health startup bought Kenya’s Haltons Pharmacy for $5 million marking mPharma’s foray into the East Africa region.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vine used to be the biggest pharmacy chain in Uganda. At its peak, it had about 36 stores spread across the country. But with Abraaj as its largest shareholder, the business had to resize once there wasn’t any more capital available for growth. We are buying out the stake that Abraaj held,” mPharma co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockson said that he hopes to take Vine Pharmacy to its former glory, when it held the position of the biggest retail pharmacy chain in Uganda. Vine Pharmacy had 20 branches across Uganda when Abraaj took over and embarked on an aggressive growth plan that involved doubling its branches by 2018 – a feat it accomplished until the PE collapsed leading to the shutdown of several outlets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abraaj also grew the pharmacy’s wholesale business, supplied government agencies and health institutions, and expanded to include personalized patient care through home visits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma was originally founded in 2013, by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Daniel Shoukimas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Finucane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage prescription drug inventory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for pharmacies and their suppliers. It currently runs retail pharmacy operations and provides market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains one of the well-funded startups across Africa, raising over $50 million since inception, including </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Series C round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $17 million, led by the CDC Group, the U.K.’s development finance institution, last year. Other </span><a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/mpharma-raises-6-6-million-in-series-a-funding-463dafda6e0b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include Silicon Valley backer Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, Shravin Bharti Mittal of the Bharti Global Limited, Social Capital and Golden Palm Investments. It also enjoys backing from </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helena Foulkes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S., and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and chairman of Novartis; both are members of the board.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can tell you Vine is a very profitable pharmacy chain. It&#8217;s been a family-owned business for almost 30 years, and so, we are really trying to use this moment to scale the business,” Rockson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a really exciting time for us and fortunately, Uganda is an exciting market. It may be like five years behind Kenya, but we think it is ripe for innovation and disruption,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma’s recently announced that it was rolling out</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">telemedicine services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across its network of pharmacies in the continent in its efforts to bridge the doctor to patient gap by providing all-inclusive services. It plans to use its network of pharmacies to build what it describes as a digital primary care service that will</span><a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/telemedicine-2-0-mpharmas-vision-to-transform-primary-care-in-africa-576fad3152cb"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">offer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all-in-one diagnostics services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year,</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma entered Ethiopia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after striking a franchising deal with Belayab Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary, Haltons Limited. The Ethiopian pharmaceutical firm is part of Belayab Group — a franchisee of companies like Pizza Hut and Kia Motors — in the country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma plans to continue its franchising model when expanding into new markets. This, Rockson said, will help the startup to focus more on building and refining its infrastructure for a seamless sourcing and distribution system that would address the challenges facing the pharmaceutical market across Africa, including unpredictable supply chains, exorbitant prices and low orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, mPharma set-up operations in Gabon after the West African country contracted it to build drug supply chain infrastructure, increasing the startups footprint in the provision of pharmaceutical systems and distribution networks across the continent. Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and Rwanda are the other markets the tech startup has operations in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also partnered with Mt. Meru Group, a gas station operator in Rwanda, last November to establish pharmacy branches within its outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Within less than a year, we&#8217;ve been able to rapidly build the largest retail platform in the country. Today, Rwanda is a very promising market for us,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African pharmaceutical market is expected to grow exponentially as the population balloons, thus providing a space for innovation and a market for startups offering mobile health solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Africa, Deloitte says in a </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-nl-mhealth.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, East Africa is the most promising region in terms of healthcare investment owing to its integration and the growing economy, supported by various sectors, including agriculture and tourism. The increased demand for services and products as consumers gain more spending power will also lead to an increase in healthcare and telecom spend, the report said – opportunities that mPharma hopes to tap.</span></p>

<p>Before starting Finverse in 2020, Lesaffre was senior product manager of financial data integrations at NerdWallet, working with account aggregation APIs like Plaid and legacy player Yodlee.</p>
<p>Plaid won the U.S. market because it was reliable and developer-friendly, Lesaffre said. It did not offer as much data coverage as Yodlee, but “what it did do is a very narrowly-focused set of data very well, and very easy to build. My ultimate learning from NerdWallet is that bad data is really worse than no data.”</p>
<p>Finverse wants to do the same thing for the Asia-Pacific region by building dependable APIs and data integrations. “At the core, we are a basically a consent-based data pipe where a consumer allows Finverse to connect to their account and share it with another fintech or financial institution,” said Lesaffre.</p>
<p>This can include information about accounts, balances, transaction histories and bank statements. Accessing this data gives financial institutions a sense of the consumer’s assets and liabilities, and can be used to perform things like income estimates, credit checks and gauge ability to repay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Lesaffre said that Finverse’s early adopters are mostly fintech startups, including a mix of SME lending providers and buy now, pay later services.</p>
<p>Finverse’s APIs can be used for a wide range of use cases, but most of its current potential clients are focused on consumer or SME lending. Many of them want to transition from a heavily manual process that requires applicants to upload documents, to a digitized credit decision that can take as little as one minute.</p>
<p>Finverse is currently focused on banked consumers, or people who have traditional bank accounts and credit histories, but over time it also plans to add digital wallets, neobanks and other less traditional institutions. Future use cases include financial tracking as more people in Asia start using e-wallets, investment apps and online bank accounts.</p>
<p>“If you are a smaller digital bank, you know that a lot of your customers will have another primary account at a larger bank, so a lot of smaller banks are quite keen to be able to get a full perspective on their consumers,” said Lesaffre. “One way to do that is to let consumers track all their accounts in one place.”</p>
<p>Another use case for Finverse’s APIs is cross-border payments verification, compliance and KYC.</p>
<p>Other open banking startups focused on Southeast Asia include Brankas and Finantier. Lesaffre said Finverse’s approach is different because it is targeting the entire Asia-Pacific region, instead of focusing on specific markets. Its new funding will be used to grow its engineering and business development teams.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Growing reliance on SaaS has opened the door to shadow IT: SaaS applications bought by individual employees without the knowledge or approval of their organization’s IT department.</p>
<p>While shadow IT can be an <a href="https://www.i-cio.com/innovation/consumerization/item/how-cios-start-to-view-shadow-it-as-a-catalyst-for-innovation">opportunity for innovation</a>, if left unaddressed, it can lead to risks like duplicate subscriptions, wasted IT spend, a lack of compliance and greater risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>By leveraging SaaS management and taking some steps, businesses can more effectively manage shadow IT, gain a competitive edge, reduce unnecessary costs and empower a distributed workforce.</p>
<p>To avoid the negative consequences associated with shadow IT, you need to give IT teams visibility into your organization’s entire SaaS portfolio. Once IT has a line of sight into all applications in use and how they are used, they are positioned to optimize investments. Maximize your SaaS investments with these tips:</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Implementing self-service SaaS at your organization is easier than you may think.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Discover all SaaS applications and spending</h2>
<p>Some organizations take a spreadsheet-based approach to managing their SaaS applications. Others turn to web browser plugins, single sign-on tools and cloud access security brokers. But these discovery processes can be time-consuming and involve piecing together SaaS inventories from disparate sources, often resulting in records that are out of date before they’re even completed.</p>
<p>Even the most detailed, frequently updated spreadsheet is not always the most effective way to manage SaaS, especially when you consider that organizations manage over <a href="https://zylo.com/blog/zylo-2020-saas-management-benchmarks/">650 SaaS applications</a> on average, and they underestimate the number of SaaS applications within their ecosystem by two to three times. If you don’t know a SaaS application exists, how can you manage and budget for it?</p>
<p>To optimize your SaaS portfolio, you have to start with gaining complete visibility. Tools like SaaS management platforms with machine learning capabilities that detect SaaS purchases enable continuous discovery of software. These solutions can also integrate with your financial management systems to discover purchases.</p>
<p>It’s critical for this strategy to happen in real time so you have a picture of your tech ecosystem that’s always complete, accurate and up to date.</p>
<h2>Optimize and rightsize licenses and features</h2>
<p>Do you have as many active users as you accounted for or could you downgrade your plan? Perhaps an employee left, but their accounts were never deactivated. In practice, you may not need all the premium features or seats you’ve paid for, which means there could be opportunities to reduce your SaaS spend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zolve, a neobanking startup that aims to help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">immigrants in the U.S. gain access to financial services</a>, said on Wednesday it has raised $40 million in a new financing round as it begins to roll out its offerings.</p>
<p>Partners of DST Global led the Bangalore-headquartered startup’s Series A financing round. The round, which values the 10-month-old startup at $210 million and brings its all-time raise to $55 million, also saw participation from Tiger Global and Alkeon Capital and existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of students and working professionals leave India for the U.S. each year to pursue higher education and for work. Even after spending months in a new country, they struggle to get a credit card from local banks, and end up paying a premium to access a range of other financial services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Raghunandan G, a high-profile Indian entrepreneur who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold his previous startup to ride-hailing giant Ola</a>, set out to solve this problem for Indians earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://zolve.com">Zolve</a> rolled out its credit card to 2,000 customers (and amassed a waiting list that has surpassed 70,000) last month and immediately identified two insights, he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Not only were the customers extensively using Zolve’s services and paying on time, he said, but the startup had also organically attracted demands from individuals who had immigrated from other nations such as Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224598 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="523" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our basic value proposition is a credit card. Other than a credit card, you also get a local bank account and a debit card. We never expected our customers to deposit money to their bank accounts. And we thought even if someone deposits money, it would probably be a few hundred or thousand dollars. What we saw is that people are depositing tens of thousands of dollars and using this account as their primary bank account,” he said. “We are currently sitting on a deposit of $2 million.”</p>
<p>The logical result of this early traction is that Zolve now plans to expand its offerings to immigrants from several nations early next year, he said.</p>
<p>Zolve currently works with banks in the U.S. and India to provide consumers access to financial products seamlessly — without paying any premium or coughing up any security deposit. It underwrites the risks, which has enabled banks in foreign countries to extend their services to Zolve customers.</p>
<p>Working with banks in India has helped Zolve gain clarity on the individuals and do the underwriting. The startup now plans to replicate this model for customers from other nations.</p>
<p>Raghunandan said the startup was fortunate enough to identify and bring on-board the investors it wanted. He pointed out that many of the partners at DST Global are immigrants themselves and the three new investors have backed several startups that operate in similar spaces.</p>
<p>“Access to tailored and fair financial products has a direct and meaningful impact on people&#8217;s lives. We&#8217;re incredibly excited to have invested in Zolve, and to support Raghu&#8217;s vision of bringing world-class financial services products and experiences to immigrants in the US and other markets,” said Bejul Somaia, partner at Lightspeed, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The company&#8217;s rapid acceleration, especially around customer acquisition and usage, is a reflection of the team&#8217;s execution capability and significant unmet needs of Zolve&#8217;s target customer base. We&#8217;re excited for what the future holds and have high confidence in Zolve&#8217;s future success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zolve also said it plans to aggressively expand its team. The startup’s headcount was just five earlier this year. It has since grown to 100, and now the startup is looking to hire 150 people across several roles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart Eye, a supplier of driver monitoring systems for automakers, has agreed to acquire human behavior software company iMotions for $46.6 million just five months after it snapped up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/">emotion-detection software startup Affectiva</a>.</p>
<p>Smart Eye, a publicly traded Swedish company, said Tuesday this is a <a href="http://www.corp.smarteye.se/sv/press/pressmeddelanden/press-detail/?slug=smart-eye-ingar-avtal-att-forvarva-imotions-och-avser-att-anskaffa-kapital-genom-en-riktad-nyemission">cash-and-stock deal</a>. Smart Eye will provide $23.2 million (200 million Swedish kroner) in shares and the remaining amount will be paid in cash. iMotions, which employs 63 people, will operate as a standalone company within the Smart Eye Group. The company&#8217;s structure and management team will remain in place, according to Smart Eye.</p>
<p>The acquisition is notable because it signals growing consolidation within the driver monitoring systems segment, a trend that Smart Eye CEO and founder Martin Krantz confirmed in comments to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see continued consolidation of DMS vendors due to increased demand for DMS and interior sensing, which is already ramping up amongst OEMs,&#8221; Krantz told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;With regulatory requirements in Europe — that are sure to follow in other regions of the world — we believe that nearly all global OEMs will procure their first or second generation DMS during the next couple of years. By joining forces with Affectiva, and now with iMotions, we are perfectly positioned for this development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attention on DMS has increased as automakers roll out so-called Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems. There are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions &#8212; like adaptive cruise and lane keeping &#8212; are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 2 is not considered full self-driving. These are advanced driver assistance systems that require a human being to be engaged and ready to take over.</p>
<p>The DMS typically involves a camera that watches the driver to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention and not abusing or stretching the capabilities of the system. GM and Ford use DMS to allow for hands-free driving. For years, Tesla has not had a camera, or in the case of the Model 3 and Y, used it to monitor the attentiveness of drivers using its Autopilot system. Instead, Tesla has relied on a sensor to gauge whether the driver&#8217;s hands were on the wheel.</p>
<p>While Tesla now equips Model X and Model S vehicles produced in 2021 or later with a camera, the feature is currently only available for Model 3 and Y vehicles equipped with Tesla Vision. That has been a sore spot for safety advocates in the United States, who have called on Tesla to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/ntsb-chair-elon-musk-change-tesla-autopilot/">change the system design of Autopilot</a> to ensure it not being misused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regulators in Europe have already weighed in on what vehicles must be equipped with, opening up an opportunity for Smart Eye and other competitors.</p>
<p>While Affectiva and iMotion are related, Smart Eye contends that they offer different and complementing capabilities that can be folded into its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The two companies actually used to work together, according to Smart Eye.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which spun out of the MIT Media Lab in 2009, uses computer vision, speech analytics and software to study facial expressions and analyze human emotion and cognitive states. Meanwhile, iMotion developed a software layer that brings together data coming in from multiple sensors and provides analytics that can then be used to improve driver safety and the driving (or riding) experience.</p>
<p>Affectiva and iMotions&#8217; tech could help its new parent company establish market share in &#8220;interior sensing,&#8221; in which software and hardware are combined to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Representatives from TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">testified</a> before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security today to discuss how to protect kids online. This hearing follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>&#8216;s document leaks to the Wall Street Journal, which &#8212; among many things &#8212; exposed Facebook&#8217;s knowledge that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">Instagram is toxic</a> for teenage girls. According to Facebook&#8217;s own research, 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.</p>
<p>But as the Senate tries to hold Facebook accountable for its influence on teen girls, lawmakers understand that this problem doesn&#8217;t begin and end with Mark Zuckerberg. Though the companies that testified today each have policies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">prohibiting content</a> that promotes eating disorders, Senators cited evidence from constituents about teenagers on these platforms who have still suffered from illnesses like anorexia and bulimia.</p>
<p>&#8220;On YouTube, my office created an account as a teenager. We watched a few videos about extreme dieting and eating disorders. They were easy to find,&#8221; Senator Blumenthal (D-CT), the committee chair, said in his opening statement. He said that then, the account was fed related eating disorder content in its recommendations. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way out of this rabbit hole.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224346" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Blumenthal&#8217;s staff also found troubling content on TikTok. The Wall Street Journal conducted <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-algorithm-sex-drugs-minors-11631052944?mod=e2tw">an investigation</a> like this into the platform, creating 31 bot accounts &#8212; registered as users &#8212; between the ages of 13 and 15. The publication reported that while content glorifying eating disorders is banned on TikTok, the accounts in its investigation were still served several such videos.</p>
<p>Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confronted Michael Beckerman, TikTok&#8217;s head of Public Policy for the Americas, asking if TikTok has stopped promoting content that glorifies eating disorders, drugs and violence to teens.</p>
<p>Beckerman noted that he doesn&#8217;t agree with the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s methodology for that experiment &#8212; the users were bots programmed to search for and linger on certain content &#8212; but affirmed that TikTok has made improvements to the way users can control the algorithm and see age-appropriate content on TikTok.</p>
<p>Beckerman said that content related to drugs violates community guidelines and that 97% of content violating policies about minor safety is removed proactively. These numbers track with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/tiktok-removed-81-million-videos-for-violations-in-q2-representing-1-of-uploads/">recently released</a> transparency report, outlining information about how content was removed on the platform between April and June 2021. Per the report, 97.6% of content violating minor safety policies were removed proactively before being reported by users, and 93.9% of those videos were removed at zero views. In the category of &#8220;suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts&#8221; &#8212; which is inclusive of content glorifying eating disorders &#8212; 94.2% were removed proactively, and 81.8% of videos had zero views.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Senator Klobuchar continued by asking Beckerman if TikTok has conducted any research about how the platform might push content promoting eating disorders to teens, and if Beckerman personally had asked for any internal studies on eating disorders before testifying. He said no to both questions, but reaffirmed that TikTok works with outside experts on these issues.</p>
<p>Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) asked each company to outline the steps each company is taking to remove &#8220;content that promotes unhealthy body image and eating disorders and direct users to supportive resources instead.&#8221; In particular, Baldwin&#8217;s question was geared toward how these companies are focusing on these issues among younger users.</p>
<p>Beckerman reiterated that TikTok &#8220;aggressively&#8221; removes content that promotes eating disorders and works with outside organizations to support users who might need help. He may have been referring to TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">recent expansion</a> of its mental health resources. Right after Instagram was blasted for its harm to teen girls, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">rolled out</a> a brief memo about the impact of eating disorders in its Safety Center, developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631712835680000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_6fZatFLr2KphvOIMd5SIVjFDvQ">National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA)</a>. NEDA has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/over-a-year-after-new-content-policies-self-harm-social-media-still-thrives/">long track record</a> of collaborating with social media platforms and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/pinterest-updates-policy-to-prohibit-ads-promoting-weight-loss/">worked with Pinterest</a> to prohibit ads promoting weight loss this year.</p>
<p>Beckerman added that TikTok doesn&#8217;t allow ads that target people based on weight loss. The app <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/coming-together-to-support-body-positivity-on-tiktok">updated its policies</a> in September 2020 to ban ads for fasting apps and weight loss supplements, and increase restrictions on ads that promote a negative body image. This update came soon after Rolling Stone reported that TikTok was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/what-is-intermittent-fasting-tiktok-ads-1031931/">advertising fasting apps</a> to teenage girls. Still, TikTok allows weight management product ads for users above the age of 18.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube and Snapchat were asked to defend their apps&#8217; age ratings in Senate hearing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/youtube-and-snapchat-were-asked-to-defend-their-apps-age-ratings-in-senate-hearing/embed/#?secret=3noWvgiAWa" data-secret="3noWvgiAWa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Snapchat’s Vice President of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout answered Klobuchar&#8217;s question by saying that content promoting eating disorders violates community guidelines. Snapchat directs users who search terms like &#8220;anorexia&#8221; or &#8220;eating disorder&#8221; to expert resources that might be able to help them.</p>
<p>Per Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/ad-policies">ad policies</a>, diet and weight loss ads aren&#8217;t banned, but certain content in that realm is. Ads can&#8217;t promote weight loss supplements, contain exaggerated or unrealistic claims, or show &#8220;before and after&#8221; pictures related to weight loss.</p>
<p>Leslie Miller, YouTube’s vice president of Government Affairs and Public Policy, also said that YouTube prohibits content glorifying eating disorders. YouTube&#8217;s ad policy says that it <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10249050?hl=en">allows ads for weight loss</a> as long as the imagery isn&#8217;t disturbing.</p>
<p>But TikTok and YouTube&#8217;s representatives both pointed out how some users can find solace on social media, for instance, in a video about how someone overcame an eating disorder. This content can be uplifting and help teens know that they&#8217;re not alone in what they&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>Miller claimed that when users search for eating disorder content, its algorithms &#8220;raise up&#8221; content that might offer positive support to someone who is struggling with an eating disorder. She said more than 90% of content that violates guidelines is spotted through technology, but human moderators contribute as well.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In hearing with Snap, TikTok and YouTube, lawmakers tout new rules to protect kids online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/embed/#?secret=pBiwZR3dLE" data-secret="pBiwZR3dLE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Toward the end of the hearing, Senator Blumenthal circled back to the points he made in his opening statement &#8212; his office made fake TikTok accounts for teenage girls and was quickly able to find content that is supposedly banned from the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you explain to parents why TikTok is inundating their kids with these kinds of videos of suicide, self-injury and eating disorders?&#8221; Senator Blumenthal asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak to what the examples were from your staff, but I can assure you that&#8217;s not the normal experience that teens or people that use TikTok would get,&#8221; Beckerman said.</p>
<p>Though the representatives from TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube used their ad policy and content moderation guidelines as evidence that their companies are moving in the right direction, Senators still seemed hesitant about how cooperative the platforms would be in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">passing legislation</a> to make social media safer for children.</p>
<p>As the hearing closed, Senator Blumenthal observed that he wouldn&#8217;t be taking the day&#8217;s testimony at face value. &#8220;The time for platitudes and bromides is over,&#8221; Blumenthal said.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/sequoia-dramatically-revamps-its-fund-structure-as-it-looks-to-rethink-venture-capital-model/"><strong>Sequoia rebuilds itself for the future of venture capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>With capital now a commodity and nearly every VC focused on offering services, standing out is hard in the venture game. As are the harsh realities of startups staying private longer and restrictions on how venture capitalists can invest. Sequoia thinks that it has the solution.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/jessica-rosenworcel-becomes-the-first-woman-to-chair-the-fcc-and-gigi-sohn-is-nominated-for-5th-spot/">Jessica Rosenworcel to lead FCC:</a> </strong>Rosenworcel will be the first woman to ever lead the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is at once good news and an indictment of my nation’s governmental diversity through the years. Also, Gigi Sohn, whom TechCrunch called an “FCC veteran and tireless policy advocate,” was nominated to the group. Sohn is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/05/top-fcc-lawyer-agency-will-win-inevitable-legal-fight-over-net-neutrality/">well known for her work on net neutrality</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">Inside the Sweetgreen IPO filing:</a></strong> Heavily VC-backed fast-casual food chain Sweetgreen is going public, so TechCrunch spent time mucking about in its numbers. Our takeaway is that the company has identified a notable portion of the economy where it can plug a need, but that it loses too much money.</li>
<li><em>By the time this newsletter reaches your inbox, Rent the Runway should have priced its IPO. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">initial notes concerning its business are here</a>; more in the a.m.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a <em>lot</em> of startup news to chat about today, but first, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/from-the-american-heartland-a-startup-boom/">TechCrunch dug into the American Midwest yet again this morning</a>, this time asking CEOs and investors in the region what impact the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">fundraising boom</a> and increasingly flat global talent and capital market are having on area startups.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/dehaat-raises-115-million-in-the-largest-agritech-round-in-india/"><strong>Indian AgTech accelerates:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, it seems that every day another Indian startup raises a nine-figure round. But this time it’s DeHaat, which focuses on agriculture, catching my eye. Per TechCrunch, the company built “an online platform that offers full-stack agricultural services to farmers in India.” Given how many farmers its market includes, DeHaat should not lack for TAM.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/gusto-buys-remoteteam-com-in-bid-to-support-more-international-hiring/"><strong>Gusto buys RemoteTeam:</strong></a> U.S. HR and payroll-focused startup Gusto bought another company, it announced this morning. With an eye on supporting more international hiring, it picked up RemoteTeam. The increasingly global and distributed tech talent pool likely helped pull Gusto in this particular direction.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiger-and-falcon-look-to-double-down-on-indian-social-commerce-startup-dealshare/"><strong>DealShare set to raise more capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Returning to India, TechCrunch can report from several sources that “Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital are looking to double down on their bets on DealShare,” perhaps putting more than $225 million into the company at a unicorn valuation. DealShare exists in the social commerce space, in case you were wondering.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/logicbroker-taps-into-135m-to-advance-cloud-based-drop-ship-software/"><strong>How often do we get to talk about startups from Connecticut?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not very often. But today was a nice exception with LogicBroker raising $135 million in a single go. The startup builds software for the shipping world (think e-commerce and drop-shipping) and now certainly has as much capital as it could have dreamed about at its fingertips. Good on the Nutmeg State.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/piiano-raises-9m-to-help-businesses-protect-their-pii/"><strong>Piiano raises $9M to help keep PII safe:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Get it? <em>PII</em>-ano wants to help you keep PII, or <em>personally identifying information</em>, safe. The company likely competes with Skyflow, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/skyflows-data-privacy-api-business-raises-45m-series-b/">raised a bunch of money just the other week</a>. The market for data protection services is hot and potentially lucrative given that there is lots of data in the world, and that leaking it is bad. (Note that this is not Piano, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/piano-raises-88m-for-analytics-subscription-and-personalization-tools-for-publishers-adds-linkedin-as-investor/">the subscription media software startup</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/softbank-bets-big-on-pipefy-which-just-raised-75m-for-its-low-code-workflow-management-tool/"><strong>SoftBank backs Pipefy:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Gone are the days when SoftBank would drop a flat trilly on a dog-walking startup or zero-gravity pinball maker. Instead, the Japanese telco, conglomerate and frenetic technology investor has put $75 million into a low-code workflow management startup. How very pedestrian!</li>
</ul>
<p>And there was so much more. Fabric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/fabric-200-million-robotics-fulfillment-e-commerce/">raised $200 million</a> so that robots can help with e-commerce order fulfillment. Indian busing startup Chalo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/chalo-acquires-amazon-backed-bus-aggregator-shuttl/">bought another bus-focused startup</a>. Jay-Z’s venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/marcy-venture-partners-cofounded-by-jay-z-just-closed-its-second-fund-with-325-million/">just closed its second fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/market-demand-for-cybsersecurity-products-helps-devo-raises-250m-at-unicorn-valuation/">Devo raised $250 million</a> on the back of rising global cybersecurity spend.</p>
<p>To close us out, TechCrunch has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/inside-realms-of-ruin-ya-novelists-failed-nft-project/">great story on what happens when you mix fiction, community, NFTs and copyright questions</a>.</p>
<h2>Bridging the gap: What CISOs must do to get the C-suite on their side</h2>
<p>On a good day, most people forget the chief information security officer even exists. But if something should go wrong, everyone will demand answers.</p>
<p>Keeping a company’s security measures up to the mark while getting all stakeholders to implement safe security practices is a tall order, complicated by the fact that many CISOs aren’t inside the executive decision-making loop.</p>
<p>According to Sean McDermott, founder and CEO of RedMonocle, CISOs should meet executives where they are.</p>
<p>“You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership’s shoes to explain why it’s crucial to theirs,” he writes.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/"><strong>Social media goes to Congress:</strong></a> It appears that social media companies want to avoid the fate of Facebook, namely becoming a company better known for obfuscation and late fixes. So, before Congress today, TikTok, Snap and YouTube shared new changes to their products that may help protect kids. TikTok, however, was a bit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/">more coy about data than we’d have liked</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/apple-ones-premier-subscription-tier-is-rolling-out-in-17-new-countries-on-november-3/"><strong>Apple will roll out its software bundle to 17 new markets:</strong></a> In early November, that is. Per TechCrunch, the service, called Apple One Premier, will include “Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+ and 2 TB of iCloud storage” for a flat fee. In other news, remember when Apple product names were good?</li>
<li>And from Adobe, much news, including that the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/adobe-continues-its-ai-push-in-creative-cloud/">keeping up its cloud push</a> and following the times by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/adobes-behance-adds-support-for-nfts-and-paid-subscriptions/">adding support for NFTs to its products</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Land Rover plans to add an all-electric Range Rover to its lineup in 2024, the brand said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The announcement was made alongside its reveal of the 2022 Range Rover, the redesigned fifth generation of its luxury SUV that is loaded with tech, features an electrical architecture to support over-the-air software updates and sits on a new flexible architecture that will be the basis of the brand&#8217;s future models, including plug-in hybrid and electric variants.</p>
<p>Land Rover didn&#8217;t disclose many details about this upcoming EV. Although a close watcher of its parent company, Jaguar Land Rover might have seen this coming. JLR said<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/every-jaguar-and-land-rover-vehicle-from-2020-on-will-have-an-electric-option/"> back in 2017</a> that all new vehicles in both the Jaguar and Land Rover brands would offer an electric or hybrid option from 2020 on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224393" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The 2022 Range Rover will be offered in a mild hybrid variant and a plug-in hybrid version of the new Range Rover is coming in 2023, according to Land Rover.</p>
<p>The extended-range plug-in hybrid set for 2023 will be outfitted with an inline six-cylinder engine with 48-volt mild hybrid technology, a 105 kW electric motor and a 38.2 kWh lithium-ion battery that has a usable capacity of 31.8 kWh. This combo will provide up to 62 miles of pure EV range and have 434 horsepower.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224463" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224463" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2224463 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg" alt="Range Rover plug in hybrid electric SUV 2023" width="2000" height="1373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=1536,1054 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2224463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Land Rover</p></div></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As for the 2022 Range Rover, the new SUV will be offered in an array of variants with standard and long wheelbase body designs, six- and eight-cylinder powertrains and seating options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It all starts with the Range Rover P400 SE, a mild hybrid with a 3.0L turbocharged engine that produces 395 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque and has a base price of $104,000, not including taxes or the $1,350 destination fee. The 2022 Range Rover lineup tops out with the P530 First Edition, a long wheelbase body design with a 4.4L twin turbocharged V8 that produces 523 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque and starts at $163,500 (again not including taxes and fees).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other notable techy type highlights in the 2022 Range Rover include a new electrical vehicle architecture, called internally EVA 2.0, that will allow the company to communicate wirelessly with more than 70 electronic modules, according to Land Rover. What this means is that Land Rover should be able to add features such as a new app or make improvements to existing functions on the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system through a software update. That&#8217;s an important feature for any automaker hoping to keep up with these tech-centric times.</p>
<p>The 2022 Range Rover will come with Amazon Alexa as the integrated voice assistant that can provide news updates, access the driver&#8217;s calendar, control some vehicle functions as well as turn on lights at home and connect with other Alexa-enabled devices.</p>
<p>Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the in-car platform that brings the look and functions of a smartphone to the vehicle’s central screen, will also be offered in the vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple News is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-news-expands-local-news-offerings/">expanding</a> its local news coverage to Charlotte, Miami and Washington, D.C. Local news coverage will give users access to numerous publications such as Axios Charlotte, the Charlotte Observer, Eater Miami, the Miami Herald, DCist, Washingtonian, the Washington Post and more.</p>
<p>Each local news experience is curated by Apple News editors and features coverage about topics ranging from restaurant openings and real estate trends to big policy decisions.</p>
<p>Apple News first launched curated local news experiences for the Bay Area, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco last year. Earlier this year, Apple expanded the local news feature to additional U.S. cities, including Sacramento, San Antonio, and San Diego.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224410" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple says it plans to expand its local news feature to more cities in the future. It&#8217;s clear that the tech giant is looking to further compete with other news aggregator services such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flipboard-local-1000/">Flipboard</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities/">SmartNews</a>, which offer local news coverage in thousands of U.S. cities.</p>
<p>The Apple News local coverage expansion comes as Apple is expanding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/apple-launches-fitness-group-workouts-powered-by-shareplay/">Fitness+</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/apple-ones-premier-subscription-tier-is-rolling-out-in-17-new-countries-on-november-3/">Apple One Premier</a> subscription bundle to 17 more countries on November 3rd. The countries include Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The two companies put up solid growth numbers, made a zillion dollars between them and spent a collected $23.5 million on shareholder-friendly activities. It's a good time to be a tech giant.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Helping power the global boom in startup investment is a huge &#8212; and growing &#8212; demand for digital products and services. The same tailwinds that are bolstering smaller tech companies, it turns out, are also powering the giants.</p>
<p>On the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">weak Q4 growth forecast from social giant Snap</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/">revenue miss from social titan Facebook</a>, you would have been forgiven if you had low expectations for other Big Tech firms.</p>
<p>Today, however, pushing back against what could have been construed as a budding narrative, both Microsoft and Alphabet &#8212; Google&#8217;s parent company &#8212; smashed revenue expectations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here are the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft revenue expectation: $43.97 billion (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/analysis?p=MSFT">Yahoo Finance</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2022-q1/press-release-webcast">Actual Microsoft revenues</a>: $45.32 billion, +22% year over year.</li>
<li>Alphabet revenue expectation: $63.45 billion (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/analysis?p=GOOG">Yahoo Finance</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q3_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=f1ba3f6">Actual Alphabet revenues</a>: $65.12 billion, +41% year over year.</li>
</ul>
<p>In after-hours trading, shares of Microsoft are up 1%, while shares of Alphabet are down a fraction.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much more to each report, of course. Alphabet and Microsoft are more akin to corporate empires than mere companies. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at each for more context.</p>
<h2>Microsoft&#8217;s Q1 fiscal 2022</h2>
<p>The key number from Microsoft&#8217;s blizzard of metrics is the growth of its public cloud business, Azure. That revenue source grew 50% on a year-over-year basis, or 48% in constant-currency terms. More simply, Azure got a modest lift from currency fluctuations that boosted its growth rate by a hair.</p>
<p>Regardless of that nuance, Azure growth has stuck around the 50% mark for some time now, which implies pretty big numbers being added to Microsoft&#8217;s aggregate top line from the product.</p>
<p>Other numbers that stood out to us in our perusal of Microsoft&#8217;s earnings were search and news advertising revenues rising 40% on a year-over-year basis. That figure is adjusted to remove traffic acquisition costs, something that Alphabet also does and is a pretty fair adjustment. In less good news, Surface revenues fell 17%, though with new hardware on the way, that could be set for a turnaround.</p>
<p>From the subscription side of things, the Microsoft picture is somewhat mixed. Business revenues for Office 365 grew by 23% on a year-over-year basis, while consumer incomes from the same product line were up a smaller 10%. Finally, LinkedIn revenues rose 42%, which feels pretty strong for the Microsoft tuck-in.</p>
<h2>Alphabet&#8217;s Q3 2021</h2>
<p>Something nice about Alphabet is that its financial results are short enough to include here. Observe:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224376" style="width: 697px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224376" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2224376 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png" alt="" width="687" height="228" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=680,226 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alphabet earnings release</p></div></p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s revenue growth remains astounding, now that the company has broken out that particular line item. Recall that Google took more of a hit in 2020 than some tech giants as demand for search ads dipped when everyone suddenly stayed home due to the COVID-19 pandemic; Google was not alone in seeing that drop &#8212; other search products were impacted.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/alphabet-goog-earnings-q3-2021.html">CNBC&#8217;s collection of street estimates</a>, Google Cloud missed growth targets in the quarter: $5.07 billion was expected, meaning that despite its growth rate, Mountain View&#8217;s cloud bucket was smaller at the end of Q3 than investors had anticipated.</p>
<p>Other Bets putting up a small revenue gain is nice to see, though the group&#8217;s operating losses scaled during the quarter. The skunkworks collective posted an operating loss of $1.29 billion, up from $1.10 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Avoiding showering you in 1,000 more words of financial nuance, the two Big Tech companies put up solid growth numbers, made a zillion dollars between them and spent a collected $23.5 million on shareholder-friendly activities including share buybacks and dividends. It&#8217;s a good time to be a tech giant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it’s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment. This year, VCs have flowed $14.7 billion to health tech startups, compared to $14.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>Given the high cost of care in the United States compared to other nations, pairing fintech with health tech is just good business.</p>
<p>Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation, says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/fintechs-growing-role-in-the-healthcare-revolution/">he’s paying particularly close attention to these areas of convergence</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Data and the transition to value-based care.</li>
<li>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>Since the U.S. Congress passed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package this year that increased funding for affordable healthcare, Wu says opportunities are expanding for startups in this space.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re only in the early innings of a digital-first revolution in healthcare, but the convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today,&#8221; according to Wu.</p>
<p>&#8220;A modern financial consumer experience can help build relationships and trust between patients, providers and payers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rising tide of venture capital that has lifted startups around the world also splashed over America&#8217;s Midwest this year.</p>
<p>Regions like Denver and Chicago &#8220;are crushing their 2020 venture capital tallies, results that were at times already at or near record highs,&#8221; report Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>

<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, the U.S. residential housing market became feverish as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overbidding and speedy closings became the norm, often facilitated by the speed and convenience offered by proptech companies that helped sellers cash out quickly so they could get into their next homes.</p>
<p>But shares in Zillow fell 10% last week after the company said it would pause buying houses for the rest of the year. Not long after, one of its chief rivals clapped back by announcing that &#8220;OpenDoor is open for business and continues to scale and grow,” reports Ryan Lawler.</p>
<p>He interviewed OpenDoor CTO Ian Wong and Chief Customer Officer Megan Meyer Toolson to learn more about their plans to grow in a market that&#8217;s facing acute labor and supply constraints.</p>
<p>“The last 18 months have been a very dynamic time for the housing market, to say the very least. So we’ve had to be very competitive since things are so dynamic and price appreciation has been very strong,” Wong said.</p>

<p>On a good day, most people forget the chief information security officer even exists. But if something should go wrong, everyone will demand answers.</p>
<p>Keeping a company&#8217;s security measures up to the mark while getting all stakeholders to implement safe security practices is a tall order, complicated by the fact that many CISOs aren&#8217;t inside the executive decision-making loop.</p>
<p>According to Sean McDermott, founder and CEO of RedMonocle, CISOs should meet executives where they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership’s shoes to explain why it’s crucial to theirs,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>When Lunchclub, a social platform that helps people find new connections in specific industries, launched its fireside chats service last year, it immediately found itself the subject of a lot of interest.</p>
<p>So much so, Lightspeed Ventures handed the startup a term sheet even though its founders weren&#8217;t looking to raise.</p>
<p>In the latest TechCrunch Live episode, Lunchclub co-founder Vlad Novakovski and Lightspeed’s Nicole Quinn broke down its Series A deck, Lightspeed&#8217;s investment thesis and how having a strong investor network makes the difference between a successful raise and a dud.</p>
<p>“Consumer feedback is everything to us,” said Quinn. “It is the number one most important thing that I’m looking for in a slide deck and a conversation. I want to know, do customers love this?”</p>

<p>Snap Inc.&#8217;s Q3 results last week sent its stock tumbling, but it wasn&#8217;t alone: Apple&#8217;s iOS 15 privacy implementation disrupted ad tracking and measurement for social media and advertising platforms across the board.</p>
<p>This potential volatility in ad revenue might have something to do with Facebook&#8217;s metaverse focus, notes Alex Wilhelm. Is Zuckerberg planning to shore up losses with a leap into VR?</p>
<p>&#8220;Something <em>else</em> will have to fill the void,&#8221; writes Alex. &#8220;The company’s rebrand fits neatly into that sort of push.&#8221;</p>

<p>While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, NYC-based customer engagement software startup Braze may just crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it finally goes public.</p>
<p>As per Alex Wilhelm&#8217;s initial read of the startup&#8217;s fresh, new S-1 filing, Braze seems to have a decent business with growing revenue (albeit with costs rising faster than profits), good retention with a focus on larger clients and a strong subscription business.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sum up: Braze is growing nicely at scale with modest net losses and no smokescreen-y, fake profit numbers on display,&#8221; Alex writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube and Snapchat were asked by lawmakers to defend whether or not their respective social media apps were appropriately rated on the U.S. app stores, given the nature of the content they hosted. In a line of questioning led by Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), Snap was given specific examples of the types of content found on its app that seemed to be inappropriate for younger teens. Both companies were also asked to explain why their app would be rated for different age groups on the different app stores.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">YouTube app on the Google Play Store</a> is rated &#8220;<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6209544?p=appgame_ratings&amp;visit_id=637708704885448608-3284839682&amp;rd=1#zippy=%2Cnorth-south-america">Teen</a>,&#8221; meaning its content is appropriate for ages 13 and up, while the same <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664">app on Apple&#8217;s App Store</a> is rated &#8220;17+,&#8221; meaning the content is only appropriate for users ages 17 and up, the senator pointed out.</p>
<p>Leslie Miller, YouTube&#8217;s Vice President of Government Affairs and Public Policy, who attended the hearing on behalf of YouTube, responded that she was &#8220;unfamiliar with the differences&#8221; the senator had just outlined with his question.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224288" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s Vice President of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout, also wasn&#8217;t sure about the discrepancy when asked the same question.</p>
<p>In Snapchat&#8217;s case, the app is rated 12 and up on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370">Apple App Store</a> but is rated &#8220;Teen&#8221; (13 and up) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">on the Google Play Store</a>. She said she believed it was because Snapchat&#8217;s content was deemed &#8220;appropriate for an age group of 13 and above.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inconsistency with app ratings can make it hard for a parent to decide if an app is, in fact, appropriate for their kids, based on how strict their own household rules are on this sort of thing. But the issue ultimately comes down to each platform having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/heres-how-iphone-app-store-ratings-work-hint-they-dont/">different</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/google-play-gets-more-family-friendly-with-content-ratings-filtering-by-age-and-interest/">policies</a> around app ratings. And because the app stores&#8217; ratings aren&#8217;t necessarily consistent with similar ratings across other industries, like film and TV, parents today will often look to third-party resources, like <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>, <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2021/10/26/youre-not-alone-practical-tips-on-managing-your-childs-social-media-usage/">news articles</a>, <a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/apps-guide/">online guides</a>, or even anecdotal advice, when deciding whether or not to let their kids use a certain app.</p>
<p>Lee pushed on this point with Snapchat, in particular. He said his staff entered a name, birth date, and email to create a test account for a 15-year old child. They didn&#8217;t add any further content preferences for the account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When they opened the Discover page on Snapchat with its default settings, they were immediately bombarded with content that I can most politely describe as wildly inappropriate for a child, including recommendations for, among other things, an invite to play an online sexualized video game that&#8217;s marketed itself to people who are 18 and up; tips on quote, &#8216;why you shouldn&#8217;t go to bars alone;&#8217; notices for video games that are rated for ages 17 and up; and articles about porn stars,&#8221; said Lee.</p>
<p>He wanted to know how Snap determined this content was appropriate for younger teens, as per the app&#8217;s rating on the app stores.</p>
<p>Stout responded by saying that Snapchat&#8217;s Discover section was a closed platform where the company chooses the publishers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do select &#8212; and hand-select &#8212; partners that we work with. And that kind of content is designed to appear on Discover and resonate with an audience that is 13 and above,&#8221; she explained. Stout also seemed surprised that Discover would include the sort of inappropriate content the senator described. &#8220;I want to make clear that content and community guidelines suggest that any online sexual video games should be age-gated to 18 and above,&#8221; Stout said, adding that she was &#8220;unclear&#8221; why they would display by default for a younger user by default.</p>
<p>She went on to note that Snap&#8217;s publisher guidelines indicate the content must be accurate and fact-checked.</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s response indicated he thought she was missing the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the articles about the porn stars were accurate and fact-checked,&#8221; he barked back. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure that the tips on why you shouldn&#8217;t go to bars alone are accurate and fact-checked, but that&#8217;s not my question. It&#8217;s about whether it&#8217;s appropriate for children ages 13 and up as you certified,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The senator&#8217;s questions harken back to the ongoing <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anxious-parents-creating-moral-panic-over-social-media-602tfmxx0">moral panics from parents</a> over teens&#8217; use of social media &#8212; panics that have particularly impacted Snapchat <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/disruptions-indiscreet-photos-glimpsed-then-gone/">with its ephemerality primed for teenage sexting</a>.</p>
<p>However, the backlash over inappropriate Discover content actually spurred Snapchat to take action in the past &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/snap-overtakes-its-ipo-debut-price/">ahead of its IPO</a>, of course.</p>
<p>The company in 2017 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/technology/snapchat-discover-takes-a-hard-line-on-misleading-and-explicit-images.html">said it would begin to take a harder line</a> on the sort of risqué and misleading images that had overrun the Discover section by implementing an updated set of publisher guidelines, which Stout also referenced during the hearing. But user reviews of the app in the years that followed have pointed out that Snapchat&#8217;s news section is filled with, as some young people described it: <a href="https://studybreaks.com/tvfilm/snapchat-discover-page/">&#8220;cringe-worthy content&#8221; and &#8220;nonsense,&#8221;</a> or &#8220;<a href="https://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/opinion-snapchat-s-discover-page-is-terrible/article_02c9733c-3a44-11eb-ace9-7bff7041b6fa.html">gossip, sex, and drugs</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The page is driven by clickbait, reality television news, and influencer fodder, with a smattering of TV networks and reputable news publishers, including ESPN, the Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal,&#8221; <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22519100/snapchat-spotlight-forgotten-gen-z">a Vox report stated</a> in June 2021. &#8220;Users complain that they’re frequently served tabloid-like content about influencers they don’t care about, or nonsensical clickbait that is best described as &#8216;internet garbage,'&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>This is likely the sort of content the senator&#8217;s team stumbled upon, too.</p>
<p>Of course, Snap has the right to curate whatever sort of publisher content it wants to &#8212; but there is a question here as to how well it&#8217;s actually curating and age-gating the content when it comes to its younger teenage users and whether that&#8217;s something that should be better regulated by law, not just left to the companies themselves to police.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of oversight do you conduct on this?,&#8221; Lee wanted to know about Snap&#8217;s curation of Discover.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use a variety of human review as well as automated review,&#8221; said Stout, adding that Snap would be interested in talking to his staff to find out what sort of content they saw that violated its guidelines.</p>
<p>(As an aside, reporters know well how this is often the response a big tech company will give when confronted with a direct example of something that contradicts their guidelines. They want the journalists to do the moderation work for them by itemizing the specific issues. They&#8217;ll then follow through and block or remove the violating pieces in question while downplaying the examples as a one-off they just missed by accident &#8212; instead of acknowledging this could be an example of a systemic problem. That&#8217;s not to say this is the situation with Snap, per se, but the tactic of acting shocked and surprised then demanding to know the examples is a familiar one.)</p>
<p>&#8220;While I would agree with you tastes vary when it comes to the kind of content that is promoted on Discover, there is no content there that is illegal. There is no content there that is hurtful,&#8221; Stout stated.</p>
<p>But Lee, whose questions mirror those from parents who believe age-inappropriate content is, in fact, hurtful, would likely disagree with that assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These app ratings are inappropriate,&#8221; Lee concluded. &#8220;We all know there&#8217;s content on Snapchat and on YouTube, among many other places, that&#8217;s not appropriate for children ages 12 or 13 and up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate line of questing led by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Snap was also pressed on whether or not advertisers in Snapchat Discover understood what sort of content they&#8217;re being placed next to.</p>
<p>Stout said they did.</p>
<p>TikTok was not questioned by Lee on the nature of its content or app store age rating, but later in the hearing did note, in response to Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), that its content for younger users was curated with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">help from Common Sense Networks</a> and is &#8220;an age-appropriate experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI and big data are an important part of most enterprise-scale companies now, but that very scale can make it difficult to employ them safely and ethically. Kathy Baxter at Salesforce and Nashlie Sephus at AWS have made ethical AI and data collection their business over the last few years, both sounding the alarm on machine bias and prescribing solutions for it. They&#8217;ll discuss the growing need for work like theirs at the highest levels of business tech at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=kathyandamazonpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=kathyandamazonpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Sephus, applied science manager for Amazon Artificial Intelligence, focuses on fairness and the detection of biases in data and machine learning models. She worked her way up through the company after it acquired the startup she worked at — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/partpic-makes-it-easier-to-find-repair-parts-for-your-whozits-whatsits-and-more/">Battlefield alumnus Partpic</a>. Now in addition to acting as an ethics evangelist and working with various teams to ensure AI models and databases are being deployed right, she leads The Bean Path, a non-profit in her native Jackson, Mississippi where she helps the new generation of tech workers get the training they need to compete.</p>
<p>Baxter came to Salesforce by way of Google, eBay and Oracle, where she worked for years in user experience research. Once at the enterprise giant she was among the earliest to recognize the risks of systematic bias in a company preparing to integrate AI at a fundamental level. She sought and got buy-in from CEO and founder Marc Benioff to lead an Ethical AI Practice team, performing in both a research and advisory role on matters of fair and equitable use of data and machine learning models. (If you want a top-level primer, check out the <a href="https://einstein.ai/static/ethics/EthicalAIMaturityModel.pdf">Maturity Model</a> linked <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-debuts-ai-ethics-model-how-ethical-practices-further-responsible-artificial-intelligence/">at the bottom of this post</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223613" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two experts will be discussing why and how companies should develop ethical AI practices and the ways in which the enterprise and AI worlds are learning to embrace and internalize them. If your company is thinking of putting AI to work in a big way — and what company isn&#8217;t? — you owe it to yourself to hear what they have to say.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the day to hear from these amazing speakers!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speech recognition has gone from convenient to crucial over the last few years as smart speakers and driving assist modes have taken off — but not everyone&#8217;s voice is recognized equally well. Speechmatics claims to have the most inclusive and accurate model out there, beating Amazon, Google and others when it comes to speech outside of the most common American accents.</p>
<p>The company explained that it was guided toward the question of accuracy by a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/14/7684">2019 Stanford study entitled &#8220;Racial Disparities on Speech Recognition,&#8221;</a> which found exactly that. Speech engines from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft &#8220;exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers.&#8221; Not great!</p>
<p>The source of this disparity may be partly attributed to a lack of diversity in the datasets used to train these systems. After all, if there are few black speakers in the data, the model will not learn those speech patterns as well. The same may be said for speakers with other accents, dialects, and so on — America (let alone the U.K.) is full of accents and any company claiming to make services for &#8220;everyone&#8221; should be aware of that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224265" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At any rate, U.K.-based Speechmatics made accuracy in transcribing accented English a priority for its latest model, and it claims to have blown the others out of the water. Based on the same data sets used in the Stanford study (but using the latest versions of the speech software), &#8220;Speechmatics recorded an overall accuracy of 82.8% for African American voices compared to Google (68.7%) and Amazon (68.6%),&#8221; <a href="https://www.speechmatics.com/news/breakthrough-ai-bias-inclusion/">the company wrote in its press release</a>.</p>
<p>The company credits this success to a relatively new approach to creating a speech recognition model. Traditionally, the machine learning system is provided with labeled data — think an audio file of speech with an accompanying metadata or text file that has what&#8217;s being said, usually transcribed and checked by humans. For a cat detection algorithm you&#8217;d have images and data saying which ones contain cats, where the cat is in each picture, and so on. This is <em>supervised</em> learning, where a model learns correlations between two forms of prepared data.</p>
<p>Speechmatics used <em>self-supervised </em>learning, a method that&#8217;s gained steam in recent years as datasets, learning efficiency, and computational power have grown. In addition to labeled data, it uses raw, unlabeled data and much more of it, building its own &#8220;understanding&#8221; of speech with far less guidance.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v6u3Kozxsa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/computer-vision-inches-towards-common-sense-with-facebooks-latest-research/">Computer vision inches toward &#8216;common sense&#8217; with Facebook&#8217;s latest research</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Computer vision inches toward &#8216;common sense&#8217; with Facebook&#8217;s latest research&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/computer-vision-inches-towards-common-sense-with-facebooks-latest-research/embed/#?secret=v6u3Kozxsa" data-secret="v6u3Kozxsa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In this case the model was based on about 30,000 hours of labeled data to get a sort of base level of understanding, then was fed 1.1 million hours of publicly available audio sourced from YouTube, podcasts and other content. This type of collection is a bit of a grey area, since no one explicitly consented to have their podcast used to train someone&#8217;s commercial speech recognition engine. But it&#8217;s being used that way by many, just as &#8220;the entire internet&#8221; was used to train OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3, probably including thousands of my own articles. (Though it has yet to master my unique voice.)</p>
<p>In addition to improving accuracy for Black American speakers, the Speechmatics model claims better transcription for children (about 92% accurate versus about 83% in Google and Deepgram) and small but significant improvements in English with accents from around the world: Indian, Filipino, Southern African and many others — even Scottish.</p>
<p>They support dozens of other languages and are competitive in many of them, as well; this isn&#8217;t just an English recognition model, but given the language&#8217;s use as a lingua franca (a hilariously inapt idiom nowadays), accents are especially important to it.</p>
<p>Speechmatics may be ahead in the metrics it cites, but the AI world moves at an incredibly rapid clip and I would not be surprised to see further leapfrogging over the next year. Google, for instance, is hard at work on making sure its engines work for people with impaired speech. Inclusion is an important part of all AI work these days and it&#8217;s good to see companies trying to outdo each other in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fallout from revelations around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">teen mental health on Instagram</a> continues — and not just for Facebook. On Tuesday, policy reps from YouTube, Snap and TikTok faced Congress to talk about kids and online safety, marking the first time the latter two companies appeared in a major tech hearing.</p>
<p>The hearing, held by the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, managed to stay on topic about half of the time. The committee’s Republican members were keen to steer their rare time with a TikTok executive toward questions about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/">privacy concerns</a> over the company’s relationship with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Diversions notwithstanding, a few of the hearing’s more useful moments saw the three policy leads pressed to answer yes/no questions about specific policy proposals crawling through Congress. The hearing featured testimony from Snap VP of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout, TikTok’s VP and Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman and Leslie Miller, who leads government affairs and public policy at YouTube.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224314" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both YouTube and TikTok called for the U.S. to create comprehensive laws around online privacy, with Beckerman deeming a legal framework for national privacy laws “overdue.” All three companies agreed that parents should have the ability to erase all online data for their children or teens, with Stout pointing out that Snapchat data disappears by design. Still, Snapchat’s own privacy page mentions that the company retains location data for “different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use.”</p>
<p>Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), himself an unlikely TikTok sensation, pushed for what he calls a kids’ “privacy bill of rights for the 21st century” during the hearing. Markey pointed to his proposed changes to the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-cassidy-propose-bipartisan-bill-to-update-childrens-online-privacy-rules">Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a> that would bolster protections for young social media users. That legislation would ban tech companies from collecting the data of users between 13 and 15-years-old without explicit consent, implement an “eraser button” that would make it easy to delete minors’ personal data and more broadly restrict the kind of information that social media platforms can collect to begin with.</p>
<p>Markey pressed each company rep on if they would support the COPPA changes. Speaking for TikTok, Beckerman said the company does support the proposal but views a standard method for platforms to verify the age of their users as just as essential, if not more so.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is what drives us crazy. Big Tech always says, “we want to talk, we want to talk, we want to talk.” Meanwhile they continue to profit from preying on kids and teens.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Snap wouldn’t commit to the COPPA proposal, and Markey derided Stout for playing “the old game” of tech companies refusing to commit to specifics. YouTube, which was slammed with a historic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/youtube-asks-the-ftc-to-clarify-how-video-creators-should-comply-with-coppa-ruling/">$170 million FTC fine for COPPA violations in the past</a>, didn’t explicitly commit to anything but pointed to “constructive” talks the company has had with Markey’s staff.</p>
<p>In the hearing, Markey and Blumenthal also highlighted their<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm"> reintroduction of the KIDS (Kids Internet Design and Safety) Act</a> last month. That bill would protect online users under 16 from engagement-juicing features like autoplay, push alerts and like buttons. It would also ban influencer marketing to kids under 16 and force platforms to create a reporting system for the instances in which they serve harmful content to young users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its first-ever Congressional hearing, TikTok successfully dodged questions about what it plans to do with the biometric data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">its privacy policy permits it to collect</a> on the app&#8217;s U.S. users. In an update to the company&#8217;s U.S. privacy policy in June, TikTok added a new section that noted the app &#8220;may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information&#8221; from its users’ content, including things like &#8220;faceprints and voiceprints.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company was questioned by multiple lawmakers on this matter today during a hearing conducted by the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security. The hearing was meant to be focused on social media&#8217;s detrimental impacts on children and teens, but often expanded into broader areas of concern, as the lawmakers dug into the business models, internal research, and policies being made at Snap, TikTok and YouTube. </span></p>
<p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) asked specifically why TikTok needed to collect a wide variety of biometric data, &#8220;such as faceprints, voiceprints, geolocation information, browsing and search history,&#8221; as well as &#8220;keystroke patterns and rhythms.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead of directly answering the question, TikTok’s VP and Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman responded by pointing out that many outside researchers and experts have looked at its policy and found that TikTok actually collects less data than many of its social media peers. (He also later clarified in another round of questioning that keystroke patterns were collected in order to prevent spam bots from infiltrating the service.)</p>
<p>Blackburn pressed on to ask if TikTok was putting together a comprehensive profile &#8212; or &#8220;virtual dossier&#8221; &#8212; on each of its users, including younger kids and teens, which included their biometric data combined with their interests and search history.</p>
<p>Beckerman deferred answering this question as well, saying that: &#8220;TikTok is an entertainment platform where people watch and enjoy and create short-form videos. It&#8217;s about uplifting, entertaining content.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the senator&#8217;s line of questioning was a bit confusing at times &#8212; she once referred to this dossier as a &#8220;virtual you,&#8221; for example &#8212; it&#8217;s worth noting that we don&#8217;t have a full picture today as to what TikTok is doing with the data it collects from its users outside of what&#8217;s outlined in its privacy policy and, per <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you">TikTok&#8217;s 2020 blog post</a>, how some of that data plays a role <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">in its recommendation algorithms.</a> And given the chance to set the record straight over its plans to collect biometric data with regard to minor users, TikTok&#8217;s policy head skirted the questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a line of follow-ups on its data collection practices led by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Beckerman was asked if this sort of &#8220;mass data collection&#8221; was necessary to deliver a high-quality experience to TikTok&#8217;s users. She noted the company&#8217;s policy allowed for the collection of the person&#8217;s location, device model of their phone, browsing history outside and inside TikTok, all the messages sent on TikTok, IP address, and biometric data.</p>
<p>In response, Beckerman said &#8220;some of those items that you listed off are things that we&#8217;re not currently collecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said that the privacy policy states TikTok would get user consent if it were to begin collecting those items in the future.</p>
<p>Though not immediately clear, his statements were likely in reference to the clause about biometric data collection. In June, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">declined</a> to detail the product developments that necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users. But at the time, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">company told TechCrunch</a> it would ask for user consent in the case such data collection practices began.</p>
<p>The senator said the committee would follow up with TikTok on this question.</p>
<p>Both senators were concerned about TikTok&#8217;s connection to China, given its parent company is Beijing-based ByteDance. But the issue of over-collection of user data &#8212; particularly with regard to children and minors &#8212; isn&#8217;t just a geopolitical concern or, as Trump believed, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/">national security threat.</a> It&#8217;s a matter of transparency.</p>
<p>Privacy and security experts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/privacy-policies-give-companies-lots-of-room-to-collect-share-data.html">generally think</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">that users should</a> understand why a company needs the data it collects, what is done with it, and they should have the right to refuse to share that data. Today, users can somewhat limit data collection by disallowing access to their smartphone&#8217;s sensors and other features. Apple, for example, implements opt-outs as part of its mobile operating system, iOS, which pops up consent boxes when an app wants to access your location, your microphone, your camera, or your contacts.</p>
<p>But there is much more data that apps can track, even when these items are blocked.</p>
<p>Following the questions about data collection practices, Lummis also wanted to know if TikTok had been built with the goal of keeping users engaged for as long as possible. After all, having a treasure trove of user data could greatly boost this sort of metric.</p>
<p>In reply, Beckerman pointed to the app&#8217;s &#8220;take a break&#8221; reminders and parental controls for screen time management.</p>
<p>Lummis clarified that she wanted to know if &#8220;length of engagement&#8221; was a metric the company used in order to define success.</p>
<p>Again, Beckerman skirted the question, noting &#8220;there&#8217;s multiple definitions of success&#8221; and that &#8220;it&#8217;s not just based on how much time somebody&#8217;s spending [on the app],&#8221;</p>
<p>Lummis then restated the question a couple more times as Beckerman continued to dodge answering directly, saying only that &#8220;overall engagement is more important than the amount of time that&#8217;s being spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it one of the metrics?,&#8221; Lummis pushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a metric that I think many platforms check on how much time people are spending on the app,&#8221; Beckerman said.</p>
