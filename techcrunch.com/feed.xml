										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Prime Wardrobe has been a key way for the e-commerce giant to expand its reach selling clothing and other apparel: giving shoppers an easy way to try on several items, return what they don&#8217;t want, and pay for what they keep has helped it cross the virtual chasm by bringing the online experience a little closer to what it&#8217;s like to shop for fashion in physical stores. Now, a startup that&#8217;s built &#8220;Prime Wardrobe as a service&#8221; to help smaller competitors offer its shoppers the same experience is announcing some funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trynow.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TryNow</a> &#8212; which provides technology to online retailers that use Shopify Plus to let their customers receive and try out apparel, return what they don&#8217;t want and pay only for what they keep &#8212; has raised $12 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p>The startup, based out of San Francisco, already works with around 50 up-and-coming online retailers doing between $10 million and $100 million in revenues, with Universal Standard, Roolee, Western Rise, and Solid &amp; Striped among its customers. Founder and CEO Benjamin Davis said in an interview that it has seen business grow six-fold in the last year as more shopping has shifted online from brick-and-mortar due to the pandemic. TryNow claims that using its service can help brands grow average order value by 63%, conversion rates by 22% and return on ad spend by 76%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fashion has been a primary focus for &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; services online, but the the model is not limited to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparel is a core category for us,&#8221; said Davis, but he also said he believes that the model can be applied to improve the unit economics of selling online to other categories, like cookware. &#8220;Prime Wardrobe has solidified the power of that model for fashion, but we believe it&#8217;s much larger. We think that any purchase that is discretionary should be tried before it is bought.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding, a Series A, is coming from a very notable list of backers that speaks to the opportunity in this space. Investors in the round include Shine Capital, Craft Ventures, SciFi VC (the venture firm co-founded by Max Levchin, founder and CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Affirm), Third Kind, and Plaid co-founders Zachary Perret and William Hockey.</p>
<h2>As-a-service, at your service</h2>
<p>TryNow sits as part of a bigger wave of commerce and finance services that have emerged over the years to provide technology to entrepreneurs where the commerce technology they are using is not the core of the business they are building.</p>
<p>The thinking goes: building payments or related features is complex and not something that a company not focused on payments would build itself (much like most businesses would not build their own accounting software, or the computers that they use). And as the biggest competitors &#8212; eg, Amazon &#8212; continue to grow and build their own technology in-house to keep their competitive edge, a demand for more tech-enabled tools only grows and becomes more sophisticated with the competitive threat. These in turn get delivered as a service, since smaller competitors will lack the funds and human capital to build these themselves.</p>
<p>Davis said that TryNow chose to work solely with Shopify (and specifically Shopify Plus, the version of the service with more features, designed for retailers with more than $1 million in revenues) and its platform for letting retailers build and operate e-commerce storefronts, because of how it has become such an integral player in that ecosystem.</p>
<p>He said that there has been demand from retailers using other platforms such as Big Commerce and Adobe&#8217;s Magento &#8212; as well as the platforms themselves. And it will look to expand to these over time, but for now, &#8220;we think Shopify is the most powerful, and growing the fastest, with the biggest opportunity at checkout,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;It&#8217;s a multibillion opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>TryNow has whittled down its core functionality in the e-commerce space to a very specific role.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t handle checkout &#8212; that&#8217;s Shopify; nor transactions &#8212; that&#8217;s payment companies, or indeed by-now-pay-later companies (like TryNow, another kind of tech helping people defray the payment part of procurement); nor returns &#8212; it integrates with Happy Returns, Loop Returns and Returnly; nor email-based communications and marketing with customers &#8212; that&#8217;s Klaviyo.</p>
<p>What TryNow provides are analytics to manage the risk around any deal, and technology to integrate and manage the payments and returns experience, so that procuring doesn&#8217;t trigger a payment, returning triggers a payment for what is kept, and I suppose not returning triggers a different kind of payment (plus flagging the customer for future try-now-pay-later attempts).</p>
<p>Within the wider space of e-commerce, apparel has had a particularly tricky ride among those trying to bring the experience into the online world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise when you think about it: shopping for apparel is an inherently physical activity, involving trying things on, browsing around big stores with wide selections, and only paying for what you actually take away with you.</p>
<p>That has given rise to a lot of different startups, leaning on new innovations in computer vision and other areas of artificial intelligence, better cameras on phones, new manufacturing techniques and more to try to sew up the gap between what you do online and how you would shop in the brick-and-mortar world.</p>
<p>(And these startups are seeing their own opportunities and demand in the market: just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap Inc acquired Fit Analytics</a>, one of the tech companies building better tools to improve how online shoppers can estimate what size they might need to buy of an item: the social media company&#8217;s interest is to use the technology to expand how it works with its advertisers and to build out a bigger shopping experience on Snapchat and beyond.)</p>
<p>Before try-now-pay-later, the basic idea of selling fashion online has been to assume it&#8217;s okay to skip all the physical aspects of buying apparel before paying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a credit card, and I&#8217;ll charge you for what you are getting, and if you don&#8217;t like it, you can get a refund? We would never operate a brick-and-mortar store that way, charging people before going into fitting rooms,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;It&#8217;s unnatural and restricts growth.&#8221; And high-ticket items can be even harder to sell in that environment, he added.</p>
<p>While companies like Le Tote, Stitch Fix, and Wantable have built out fashion businesses on the premise of try first, and then pay only for what you keep, there are fewer companies out there that have distilled this idea into a standalone, B2B service. (And indeed, the try-before-you-buy service can be a tricky one to manage as a viable business, with Le Tote, now in Chapter 11, and now-defund Lumoid pointing to some of the challenges.)</p>
<p>“Ben and the TryNow team are taking what they&#8217;ve learned from Affirm and Stitch Fix and launching the ultimate checkout option: try now, buy later. This translates into more order volume and more profit. We all want to try before we buy: it&#8217;s only a matter of time before TryNow&#8217;s checkout solution becomes the standard,” said Brian Murray, managing director at Craft Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, there are others that compete more directly. <a href="https://www.blackcart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackCart</a> out of Canada, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/blackcart-raises-8-8m-series-a-for-its-try-before-you-buy-platform-for-online-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised funding earlier this year</a>, also provides try-now-pay-later as a service for apparel and other goods, and it integrates with other storefront platforms beyond Shopify. (It seems to take a different approach to offsetting the risk for retailers, essentially making up-front payments for goods itself and then reconciling directly with the retails around returns.) And it seems like a no brainer that Amazon might try to offer Wardrobe as a service to more retailers, as it does with so many of its other features.</p>
<p>Along with the funding, TryNow is also announcing a couple of new executive appointments that speak to where it sees itself competing and sitting longer term. Jessica Baier, formerly of Stitch Fix, is now VP of growth strategy; and Jonathan Kayne, a former head of product partnerships for Affirm, is now TryNow’s VP of platform.</p>
<p>The investors in this round are a pretty interesting set of backers that also point to possible directions for the company.</p>
<p>Shine is a relatively new firm co-founded by Mo Koyfman and Josh Mohrer to focus on early stage investments, with Koyfman previously backing a lot of interesting e-commerce companies at Spark; Craft is another early stage firm co-founded by David Sacks and Bill Lee; SciFi VC is Max and Nellie Levchin&#8217;s venture fund (and Max has a long and impressive track record in e-commerce, most recently as the founder and CEO of another startup in the flexible payment space, buy-now-pay-later business Affirm).</p>
<p>Third Kind, meanwhile, has been a prolific backer of e-commerce tech as part of its bigger investment thesis. And while Plaid&#8217;s founders are investing here as financial backers, it&#8217;s notable that they are both providing financial features as a service to third party businesses: diversification for Plaid might one day come in the form of providing tools for specific verticals, which would likely take them into the realm of more flexible payment and procurement options.</p>
<p>“At Shine, we are attracted to businesses with simple yet powerful insights that can ultimately lead to massively scalable new platforms,” said Koyfman in a statement. “TryNow’s understanding that a lack of tactility restricts e-commerce growth has opened the opportunity to create and scale the Try Now Buy Later category. It is rare to find such a strong team attacking such a simple but big idea. We are delighted to partner with Benjamin and the entire TryNow team as they scale their elegant platform and help e-commerce brands close the conversion gap with brick and mortar retail.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nigerian startup <a href="https://xend.finance/">Xend Finance</a> uses <span style="font-weight: 400;">decentralized finance (DeFi) to address currency devaluation. DeFi aims to bridge the gap between decentralized blockchains and financial services. <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ugochukwu-aronu-4477a59b">Aronu Ugochukwu</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chima-abafor-56801a90">Abafor Chima</a> founded the startup in 2019, and Ugochukwu is quite familiar with currency devaluation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency devaluation is a common economic nightmare faced in most African countries and other developing countries worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has become imperative for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> organisations like credit unions to hedge their collective funds against their <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nigerians-turn-to-stablecoins-for-protection-against-inflation">local currency&#8217;s devaluation</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve experienced three massive currency devaluations in the last three years in Nigeria, and this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different economies in the world with unstable economies,&#8221; Ugochukwu said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My mother and I belong to different cooperatives where we save and make monthly contributions to help one another in the cooperative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Realizing that despite saving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we were losing more value for our money. This gave birth to Xend Finance.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company announced its mainnet launch, opening up the ability for credit unions to access DeFi for their members by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using decentralized stablecoins such as DAI and BUSD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Xend Finance trying to protect credit unions from fluctuation, but it is also changing how they operate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these unions, groups of individuals contribute to informal savings for their different mutual benefits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are often limited by three factors. One is in its size &#8212; only a small knit of people in a particular locale can access the service. The second</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is lack of insurance which means people don&#8217;t have the confidence to join saving cycles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third has to do with how credit union members default in payments, affecting how much </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xend Finance is plugging these gaps using blockchain technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform allows credit unions to have over 1,000 members who don&#8217;t stay in the same geographical location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also employs smart contracts to lock each member&#8217;s contribution and enable flexible payouts when a payment cycle is due, which reduces default payment rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also says it offers decentralized insurance to protect members against any form of asset loss that results from contract failures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, this isn&#8217;t a traditional insurance contract from an insurance company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the company says credit union members can earn interests in their savings by exchanging their crypto or fiat currency for stable cryptocurrencies and locking crypto assets on lending platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, there&#8217;s a possible 15% available annual percentage yield on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be the world’s first decentralized finance (DeFi) credit union platform and the first DeFi company to launch out of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its technology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain for developing high-performance decentralized applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the startup based in Enugu, Nigeria, took part in the</span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/09/12-startups-selected-for-4th-google-launchpad-africa-accelerator/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Launchpad Africa accelerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/06/4-african-startups-graduate-from-binance-incubation-programme/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Incubation Programme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has since secured $2.2 million from Binance, Google Launchpad, NGC Ventures, Hashkey, and AU21 Capital, amongst others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From December 2020 to January 2021, Xend Finance executed a testnet with over 1,500 participants in 75 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helped them find product-market fit, and last week, the company did a beta launch of its mainnet where it received over $500,000 in deposits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also signed a credit union <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-backed-defi-credit-union-platform-secures-partners-funding-before-launch">partnership</a> with a software service provider, TechFusion Africa and its 5,000 members</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128353" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128353" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2128353" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png 3032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=2048,1205 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128353" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Xend Finance</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company intends to onboard a lot of customers now and focus on revenue later, Ugochukwu says. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it does, the play will be to charge a commission (not more than 5%) on the return on investment when members of cooperatives or regular individuals save or perform contributions on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having run some tests and passed several iterations, Xend Finance is fully going public today, and Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, CEO of Binance, expects the platform to show what can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on BSC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Africa is one of the most important continents, representing the future and emergence of DeFi and blockchain capabilities,” said Zhao</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very excited about the mainnet launch of Xend Finance, with a team we backed early on that has a strong foothold in Africa and have been strong advocates for what Binance Smart Chain can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accomplish</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their platform, they can bring stable currency and DeFi investment opportunities to those who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wouldn’t have them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the mainnet launch, Xend Finance will introduce the $XEND token through a Token Generation Event (TGE) on <a href="https://balancer.exchange/">Balancer</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says the token will reward users for performing different operations in &#8220;the protocol, as well as allows a decentralized governance of the Xend Finance ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Ugochukwu, Xend Finance presents people with the opportunity to channel their savings into stablecoins without worry that their money will devalue overnight and earn higher interest rates through DeFi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We are very excited that blockchain will have a positive impact on the people of Africa,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B. Before I forget, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the newsletter, if you&#8217;re interested in attending our upcoming early-stage conference. I have a gift for you.</p>
<p>Um, there is a #$@% ton of mobility news to get to, including a few scoops, some investment news, and a new &#8220;market map&#8221; that takes a deep look into the business of Mobility-as-a-service apps. Buckle up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First up, here&#8217;s the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/">market maps story</a> (I just mentioned) from writer Jason Plautz. The upshot: As transit agencies seek to win back riders, a flurry of platforms &#8212; some backed by giants like Uber, Intel and BMW &#8212; are offering new technology partnerships. Whether it&#8217;s bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are selling these mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings as a lifeline to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility. Third-party platforms have become more appealing to transit agencies as they scramble to keep buses, trains and rail full of customers.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Bird peeped up this week (they&#8217;ve been sorta quiet lately) and announced it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">investing $150 million</a> into a European expansion plan that will include launching in more than 50 cities this year, a move that it says will double its footprint in the region.</p>
<p>According to Bird, this growth plan is already underway, with the shared micromobility company recently bringing its scooters to Bergen, Norway; Tarragona, Spain; and Palermo, Italy.</p>
<p>Bird emphasized that its European expansion will be more than just a geographic one. The company said it is adding more scooters to its existing fleets and made several other promises as part of its announcement, including plans to launch new mobility products and safety initiatives, &#8220;the next generation of recycling and second-life applications for vehicles,&#8221; investing in equity programs and &#8220;securing partnerships across the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>I might have raised an eyebrow or two when I first read this announcement. Why? Welp, for one it isn&#8217;t clear what these new mobility products or initiatives around safety or recycling will be. A Bird spokesperson told me these will be new vehicles and “transport modes” in the region. Bird didn’t provide details about what it means by “securing partnerships,” a phrase that could mean an extension of its franchise program called the Bird Platform or some other kind of arrangement with local governments or operators.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the bit about that $150 million. A Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch it’s using “existing resources” to fund these various initiatives. However, the pandemic, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">acquisition of Circ</a> and its effort to launch operations in new cities while maintaining existing fleets have depleted its funds. (Last June, Bird <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/bird-shuts-down-circ-operations-in-middle-east-scraps-as-many-as-10000-scooters/">shut down scooter sharing</a> in several cities in the Middle East, an operation that was managed by Circ.) The company’s last public fundraising announcements were more than a year ago. The company raised $275 million in a Series D round back in September 2019. That round was later extended to $350 million.</p>
<p>Now, this could be the $100 million in convertible debt that Bird reportedly was close to finalizing (per The Information&#8217;s reporting back in January). But something tells me there is more to this. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>A few other interesting micromobbin&#8217; nugs for you &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> appear to have secured a license that will allow the companies to exclusively operate scooter and bike share services in Denver. The city&#8217;s Department of Transportation &amp; Infrastructure said it is moving two licensing agreements through the Denver City Council approval process. On March 23, he DOTI will present the licensing agreements to Denver City Council&#8217;s Land Use, Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee  for approval before heading to full council for consideration.</p>
<p>The &#8220;license&#8221; term is important here and marks a shift in how Denver is thinking about dockless shared scooters and bikes. A license would replace how dockless electric scooter and bike companies currently operate in Denver, which is through a permit. If the licenses are approved by Council, Lyft and Lime would be the only two companies operating vehicles in Denver under the new bike and scooter share program. The license would be valid for 5 years.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Superpedestrian</strong>, the startup that makes e-scooters equipped with self-diagnostic software, is upgrading its product as it prepares for a major expansion into 10 new cities within the next two weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan reported</a>. Superpedestrian might not be a household name, but it is an up-and-coming player in the micromobility world. The company has developed AI — which is integrated into the vehicle — that monitors and corrects scooter safety issues in real time.</p>
<p>The next-generation operating system that will provide those upgrades, codenamed “Briggs,” will be uploaded to its global fleet of LINK e-scooters. It includes improvements to geofencing capabilities and battery life, making Superpedestrian more attractive to cities looking for partners who can provide assurances around safety and reliability.</p>
<p><strong>SMART</strong>, a startup founded in 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/startup-founded-by-survivor-champ-debuts-airless-bike-tires-based-on-nasa-rover-tech/">revealed its first product</a>: An airless bicycle tire based on technology NASA engineers created to make future lunar and Martian rovers even more resilient. This nifty tech that shows how NASA investments towards space exploration can end up improving life on Earth. SMART has a partnership with NASA through the Space Act Agreement and is part of the agency&#8217;s formal Startup Program that aims to commercialize some of its innovations.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s &#8220;METL tire&#8221; came out of its work with NASA&#8217;s Glenn Research Center, where NASA engineers Dr. Santo Padula and Colin Creager first developed their so-called &#8220;shape memory alloy&#8221; (SMA) technology. SMA allows for a tire constructed entirely of interconnected springs, which requires no inflation and is therefore immune to punctures, but which can still provide equivalent or better traction when compared to inflatable rubber tires, and even some built-in shock-absorbing capabilities, TechCrunch&#8217;s Darrell Etherington reports.</p>
<p>SMART&#8217;s  co-founders, Survivor: Fiji” champion Earl Cole and engineer Brian Yennie, are targeting the cycling market first with their METL tire, which is set to become available to the general public by early next year. SMART intends to bring SMA tires to the automotive and commercial vehicle industries.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Typically, my &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; has a financial figure tied to it. This time, I don&#8217;t have those terms. (Feel free to share,  if you do.) This deal made it to the top of the list because of its importance in the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>
<p>I am, of course, talking about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/cruise-acquires-self-driving-startup-voyage/">Cruise acquiring Voyage</a>, a four-year-old autonomous vehicle startup that is well-known in the industry despite its size relative to other major players. Voyage had 60 employees and raised about $52 million compared to giants like Cruise that has a nearly 2,000-person workforce and is valued at $30 billion. But Voyage made an indelible mark on the industry, in large part because of its co-founder and CEO Oliver Cameron. The company, which spun out of Udacity in 2017, is best known for its operations in two senior living communities. Voyage tested and gave rides to people within a 4,000-resident retirement community in San Jose, California, as well as The Villages, a 40-square-mile, 125,000-resident retirement city in Florida.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told the majority of Voyage’s team will move over to Cruise and Cameron will take on a new role as vice president of product. Basically, Cameron will be in charge of anything that touches the customer.</p>
<p>Importantly, Voyage&#8217;s ride-hailing service (which always included a human safety driver behind the wheel) at the two senior communities, one in California and the other in Florida, will be ending before summer. The Villages community in Florida is massive and its where Voyage scaled up and at one point had &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of riders. The shuttering of this service would seem to open up the opportunity to other AV companies; my guess is that Cameron has already fielded a few inquiries.</p>
<p>Voyage’s partnership with FCA, now called Stellantis, will also end once the acquisition with Cruise closes.</p>

<p>Lots. of. news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles and robotics</h2>
<p><strong>Ford Motor </strong>announced plans to embed 100 of its researchers and engineers in a new $75 million robotics and mobility facility on the University of Michigan&#8217;s Ann Arbor campus. The arrangement will give Ford space to conduct robotics research and access to students &#8212; and vice versa &#8212; from the top floor of the four-floor, 134,000 square-foot building. In addition to its fourth-floor lab, Ford will have access to a high-bay garage space to test autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Shortly after the event wrapped up, TechCrunch hardware editor Brian Heater hopped on the phone with Ford’s Technical Expert Mario Santillo, who will help head up the expanded robotics efforts. Here&#8217;s what<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/robotics-roundup-4/"> Santillo had to say.</a></p>
<h2>Electric</h2>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> is expanding customer deliveries via electric cargo vehicle to San Francisco, making the Bay Area the second of 16 total cities the company expects to bring its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">Rivian-sourced EVs</a> to in 2021. San Francisco&#8217;s unique terrain and climate were a couple of the reasons Amazon said it chose the city for its second round of testing. Its EVs, which were designed and built in partnership with Rivian, can last up to 150 miles on a single charge.</p>
<p><strong>BMW</strong> takes the wraps off of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/bmw-takes-the-wraps-off-the-i4-its-first-all-electric-sedan/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">all-electric i4 sedan</a>. The German automaker also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bmw-debuts-the-next-generation-of-its-idrive-operating-system/">version 8 of its iDrive operating system</a>, which will feature a new dashboard layout and visual design, with two curved screens. It will make its debut in the i4 and iX.</p>
<p><strong>Chanje</strong>, EV startup that emerged from stealth in 2017 and is owned by Chanje is owned by Chinese automotive company  FDG, is being sued by truck rental company Ryder for alleged failing to deliver 100 of the 125 vans it was promised, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337230/ryder-chanje-lawsuit-fedex-electric-vans-startup-delivery">The Verge reported</a>. Ryder says it&#8217;s owed nearly $4 million. <a href="http://www.autonocast.com/blog/2018/1/2/40-joerg-sommer-of-chanje">Chanje was on The Autonocast</a> waayyyyy back in 2018. At the time, I was impressed by the idea and the van, which I drove with co-host Alex Roy around downtown Los Angeles. But it seems that Chanje is riddled with problems — and lawsuits. The Verge reported that Chanje has been sued more than once in Los Angeles Superior Court by former employees who say they&#8217;re owed tens of thousands in back pay and bonuses. The company has also been hit with liens from the California Secretary of State for not paying taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Motors</strong>, which is already experimenting with energy storage systems for commercial and residential customers, is also eyeing ways to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/">repurpose batteries from its electric vehicles</a>, according to this scoop by TechCrunch&#8217;s Aria Alamalhodaei. While Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson has previously discussed plans to eventually build energy storage systems like Tesla that uses new batteries, this is the first time the company has talked about second-life applications for the product.</p>
<p>This is interesting because Lucid is still years from having to contend with a large number of used batteries. After all, its first EV, the luxury Lucid Air sedan, isn&#8217;t coming to market until the second half of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> is offering owners of the 2021 Kona Electric and Ioniq Electric access to 250 kWh of complimentary charging (approximately 1,000 miles of EPA estimated driving range) on the  Electrify America fast-charging network.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian </strong>plans to install more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/rivian-to-install-more-than-10000-ev-chargers-by-end-of-2023/">10,000 chargers by the end of 2023</a>. The network will have a dual purpose: quickly power its electric vehicle models with fast chargers installed along highways and provide Level 2 chargers at further afield locations next to parks, trailheads and other adventurous destinations. The company said that its so-called Rivian Adventure Network will include more than 3,500 DC fast chargers at over 600 sites, which will only be accessible to owners of its electric vehicles. Each site will have multiple chargers and located on highways and main roads, often by cafes and shops.</p>
<p>Rivian is also installing thousands of &#8220;waypoint&#8221; Level 2 AC chargers throughout the United States and Canada. These waypoint chargers will have a 11.5 kW charging speed, which should be able add up to 25 miles of range every hour for its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The waypoint chargers will be strategically located along and near routes that Rivian customers are likely to take. They will be found at shopping centers restaurants, hotels, campsites and parks.</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen AG</strong> revealed how it aims to seize the top spot as the world&#8217;s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, outlining plans to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/volkswagen-will-bring-240-gigawatt-hours-of-battery-production-capacity-to-europe-by-2030/">six 40 gigawatt hour (GWh) battery cell production plants</a> in operation in Europe by 2030. To get there, the automaker put in a 10-year, $14 billion order with Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt &#8212; and that&#8217;s only one of the six planned factories. A second plant in Germany will commence production in 2025.</p>

<h2>Ride-hailing</h2>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> says that drivers in the U.K. who use its ride-hailing app will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">treated as workers</a>, a designation that will give them some benefits such as holiday pay. However, even as Uber seemingly concedes to a Supreme Court ruling last month, a new fight could already be brewing over the company&#8217;s decision to calculate working time from the point a trip commences &#8212; rather than when drivers log on to the app.</p>
<p>All drivers in the U.K. will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, which will be paid out every two weeks. Drivers will also be paid at least the minimum wage after accepting a trip request and after expenses. Eligible drivers in the U.K. will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber. These contributions will represent approximately 3% of a driver&#8217;s earnings.</p>
<p><em>However</em> &#8230; Uber will only guarantee that drivers&#8217; working time and other benefits will accrue once they accept a trip and not based on when they have signed into the app to begin working. That already has labor activists fuming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber’s use of facial recognition technology for a driver identity system is being challenged in the U.K., where the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) and Worker Info Exchange (WIE) have called for Microsoft to suspend the ride-hailing giant’s use of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/">B2B facial recognition</a> after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their licence to operate revoked by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>The union said it has identified seven cases of “failed facial recognition and other identity checks” leading to drivers losing their jobs and licence revocation action by TfL, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">TechCrunch reporter Natasha Lomas writes.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/poshmark/">Poshmark</a> has come a long way over the last decade. Launched in 2011, the social fashion marketplace has raised upwards of $150 million, and has now listed on the public markets. It&#8217;s valued at $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>But well before all the success, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/goshposh-its-been-a-ten-year-journey-to-ipo-tales-from-partnering-with-poshmark/">Navin Chaddha saw the potential</a>, leading the Series A for the company.</p>
<p>On our next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Chaddha and Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra to discuss going from Series A to public company. (Registration info is at the bottom of this post.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chandra is a triple-threat executive. He has degrees in marketing, business and computer science, and is a serial entrepreneur who sold his previous company, Kaboodle, to Hearst in 2007. The introduction of the iPhone inspired him to think about the coming shift in consumer behavior, paving the way for an idea like Poshmark to thrive. As is so often the case, what seems obvious in hindsight was incredibly insightful at the time.</p>
<p>The brilliance wasn&#8217;t at all lost on Chaddha, an entrepreneur in his own right. Now, Chaddha leads Mayfield, a firm with $2.5 billion in assets under management. Of the 50 companies he&#8217;s invested in during his venture capital career, 17 have gone public and 24 have been acquired. In other words, it makes sense that he has made an appearance on the Forbes Midas list 12 times.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Chandra and Chaddha about the process of fundraising from the early stage to the growth stage and beyond. But more importantly, we&#8217;ll talk about how a company has to adapt in order to be successful over time.</p>
<p>Plus, Chandra and Chaddha will take a look at pitch decks submitted by the audience and give their live feedback. If you&#8217;re wondering how to perfect your deck, there may be no more valuable resource than the advice of this founder/investor duo.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space startup Astroscale has launched ELSA-d, the demonstration mission for its End-of-Life Services by Astroscale (ELSA) technology, which aims to dock with, and then safely remove, orbital debris. Astroscale&#8217;s demonstrator package includes two separate payloads, a servicer that represents its future production spacecraft, and a &#8216;client&#8217; satellite that&#8217;s meant to represent the debris satellites it&#8217;ll be de-orbiting on behalf of customers in future.</p>
<p>The Astrocale payload was launched via a Soyuz rocket that took off early this morning from Kazakhstan carrying 38 commercial satellites from 18 countries. It&#8217;s the first Astroscale spacecraft to reach orbit, since the startup&#8217;s founding in 2013 by Japanese entrepreneur Nobu Okada. Astroscale had launched a micro satellite designed to measure small-scale debris in 2017, but all 18 of the satellites on that particular mission failed to reach orbit, due to human error in the launch vehicle&#8217;s programming.</p>
<p>This ELSA-d mission is a much more ambitious effort, and involves what amounts to an active on-orbit demonstration of the technology that Astroscale ultimately hopes to commercialize. The mission profile includes repeat docking and release maneuvers between the servicer satellite and the simulated client satellite, which is equipped with a ferromagnetic plate to assist the servicer with its magnetic docking procedure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Astroscale hopes to prove out a range of its advertised capabilities with this demonstration, including the servicer&#8217;s ability to search out and located the client satellite, inspect it for damage, and then dock with it as mentioned, in both non-tumbling and tumbling scenarios (ie., a payload that&#8217;s maintaining a stable orbit, and one that&#8217;s spinning end-over-end in space with no ability to control its own attitude).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot riding on this mission, which will be controlled from a ground center established by Astroscale in the UK. Aside from its long-term commercial ambitions, the startup is also contracted to partner with JAXA on the Japanese space agency&#8217;s first orbital debris removal mission, which aims to be the first in the world to remove a large object from orbit, representing the spent upper stage of a launch rocket.</p>

		Howard Boville is the senior vice president of IBM Hybrid Cloud. He directs IBM’s global network of more than 60 cloud data centers across 19 countries and 18 availability zones across six regions.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recent testimony before Congress on the massive SolarWinds attacks served as a wake-up call for many. What I saw emerge from the testimony was a debate on whether the public cloud is a more secure option than a hybrid cloud approach.</p>
<p>The debate shouldn’t surround which cloud approach is more secure, but rather which one we need to design security for. We — enterprise technology providers — should be designing security around the way our modern systems work, rather than pigeonholing our customers into securing one computing model over the other.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An organization’s security needs to be designed with one single point of control that provides a holistic view of threats and mitigates complexity.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SolarWinds attack was successful because it took advantage of a vast, intermixed supply chain of technology vendors. While there are fundamental lessons to be learned on how to protect the code supply chain, I think the bigger lesson is that complexity is the enemy of security.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Frankencloud&#8221; model</h2>
<p>We’ve seen our information technology environments evolve into what I call a “Frankenstein” approach. Firms scrambled to take advantage of the cloud while maintaining their systems of record. Similar to how Frankenstein was assembled, this led to systems riddled with complexity and disconnected parts put together.</p>
<p>Security teams cite this complexity as one of their largest challenges. Forced to rely on dozens of vendors and disconnected security products, the <a href="https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/cybersecuritylandscape/Marketing">average security team</a> is using 25 to 49 tools from up to 10 different vendors. This disconnect is creating blind spots we can no longer afford to avoid. Security systems shouldn’t be piecemealed together; an organization’s security needs to be designed with one single point of control that provides a holistic view of threats and mitigates complexity.</p>
<h2>Hybrid cloud innovations</h2>
<p>We’re seeing hybrid cloud environments emerging as the dominant technology design point for governments, as well as public and private enterprises. In fact, a recent study from Forrester Research found that 85% of technology decision-makers agree that on-premise infrastructure is critical to their hybrid cloud strategies.</p>
<p>A hybrid cloud model combines part of a company’s existing on-premise systems with a mix of public cloud resources and as-a-service resources and treats them as one.</p>
<p>How does this benefit your security? In a disconnected environment, the most common path for cybercriminals to compromise cloud environments is via cloud-based applications, representing 45% of cloud-related incidents analyzed by our IBM X-Force team.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, your cloud-based systems that authenticate that someone is authorized to access systems. A login from an employee’s device is detected in the middle of the night. At the same time, there may be an attempt from that same device, seemingly in a different time zone, to access sensitive data from your on-premise data centers. A unified security system knows the risky behavior patterns to watch for and automatically hinders both actions. If these incidents were detected in two separate systems, that action never takes place and data is lost.</p>
<p>Many of these issues arise due to the mishandling of data through cloud data storage. The fastest-growing innovations to address this gap are called Confidential Computing. Right now, most cloud providers promise that they won’t access your data. (They could, of course, be compelled to break that promise by a court order or other means.) Conversely, it also means malicious actors could use that same access for their own nefarious purposes. Confidential Computing ensures that the cloud technology provider is technically incapable of accessing data, making it equally difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to it.</p>
<h2>Creating a more secure future</h2>
<p>Cloud computing has brought critical innovations to the world, from the distribution of workloads to moving with speed. At the same time, it also brought to light the essentials of delivering IT with integrity.</p>
<p>Cloud’s need for speed has pushed aside the compliance and controls that technology companies historically ensured for their clients. Now, those requirements are often put back on the customer to manage. I’d urge you to think of security first and foremost in your cloud strategy and choose a partner you can trust to securely advance your organization forward.</p>
<p>We need to stop bolting security and privacy onto the “Frankencloud” environment that operates so many businesses and governments. SolarWinds taught us that our dependence on a diverse set of technologies can be a point of weakness.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it can also become our greatest strength, as long as we embrace a future where security and privacy are designed in the very fabric of that diversity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer new ways for consumers to collect, wear and trade fashion online, and now that most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/fashion/what-happened-at-new-yorks-first-pandemic-fashion-show.html">fashion shows have scaled back</a> or <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/amp/articles/fashion-show-review/digital-shows-here-to-stay-as-fashion-week-gets-a-makeover">gone virtual</a>, they may become an important tool for the industry.</p>
<p>Because some of the most profitable NFTs are produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/lilmiquela/status/1329976205538324480">celebrities</a> with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/shawn-mendes-andrew-gertler-nft-marketplace-sturdy-exchange-1135558/">teams</a>, it makes sense that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/tech/9535765/nft-music-gold-rush-sales-timeline-grimes-3lau">music corporations, </a><a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/the-cryptocurrency-boom-will-luxury-fashion-brands-jump-in">fashion brands</a> and designers are venturing into the NFT market as well. Just this month, sneaker brand RTFKT Studios garnered <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/3/rtfkt-studios-fewocious-sale-nfts">$3.1 million </a>in seven minutes by selling crypto collectibles. In December 2020, NFT startup Enjin partnered with Netherlands-based fashion house <a href="https://www.thefabricant.com/">The Fabricant</a> on a <a href="https://enjin.io/blog/atari-the-fabricant-digital-fashion">virtual collection</a>. Real-life fashion brands use NFTs for marketing in virtual worlds like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/minecraft-enjin-microsoft-nfts">Minecraft</a>, plus several <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Atari-Inspired-Virtual-Fashion-Line-Designed-By-The-Fabricant-Rolls-Ou">Atari</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-teams-up-with-enjin-to-offer-crypto-collectible-rewards">Microsoft</a> video games.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The fundamental value NFTs offer to bridge virtual fashion items with video games is the option to secure custody of the item for use in other games or mobile apps.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“Brands are coming up with some creative solutions because the pandemic is persistent, and fashion is something that is so close to our identities,” said Bryana Kortendick, Enjin’s VP of operations and communications. “You can snap a photo of yourself wearing your Atari-branded NFTs. You’ll also be able to wear them in video games.”</p>
<p>Breakout NFT star Beeple said he imagines a future where fashion NFTs could be redeemed for specific items in physical stores, especially at luxury retailers like his former client Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>“You can relate NFTs to clothing in new and interesting ways,” he said. “This will be seen as the next chapter of digital art history. This is a continuation of digital art history that started decades ago, by that I mean art made on a computer and distributed through the internet.”</p>
<p>Fashion designers like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polygondressing/">Schirin Negahbani </a>are already creating NFTs that represent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKTttyqjD5r/">actual clothing</a>. Precisely because multimillion-dollar NFT sales are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/arts/design/beeple-nonfungible-nft-review.html">breaking records</a>, spectators have been prompted to question the role speculative trading plays in this trend.</p>
<p>Textile designer <a href="https://www.amberjdickinson.com/">Amber J. Dickinson</a> says fashionable NFTs shouldn’t primarily be viewed as speculative trading opportunities. “The way I think fashion translates to the digital world is to view an NFT as a collectible piece of the garment for history,” said Dickinson, known for hand-made silk scarves and her work with Alexander McQueen. “I would only buy art as a piece that I liked. Whether digital or in the real world, I don’t take an investor’s point of view.”</p>
<p>There are many fashion fans who disagree with Dickinson, preferring to invest through assets like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/your-money/birkin-bag-racehorse-invest.html">Birkin bags</a>. They may have a different approach to NFTs. The <a href="https://digitalax.medium.com/introducing-digitalax-the-digital-fashion-engine-42801a431283">DIGITALAX </a>crypto fashion platform, for example, is being built with a plethora of trading features. As for Dickinson, she said she is still looking for her tribe of crypto-savvy artists on Twitter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost item finder Tile, the maker of the popular Bluetooth-powered tracker that can help you find your misplaced keys, bag, wallet or more, is bringing its tracking service to a wearable device for the first time with the launch of its <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/inspire2">Fitbit partnership</a>. Starting today, all new and current Fitbit Inspire 2 users will gain access to Tile&#8217;s Bluetooth-finding technology at no extra cost, the company says.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, existing Inspire 2 users will soon be prompted to update their device&#8217;s software via the Fitbit app, which will make the new Tile feature available. Once updated, users will be directed to download Tile&#8217;s mobile app for access to the lost item finding features. From the Tile app, Inspire 2 users will then be able to locate their misplaced Fitbit when they&#8217;re within Bluetooth range &#8212; for example, if the device has been lost somewhere inside their home. If the device is further away, users will be able to tap into Tile&#8217;s broader finding network which leverages the Tile app installed on all Tile users&#8217; smartphones. When anyone with the app is near the lost item, its location is shared back through the network to the original owner.</p>
<p>At present, Tile says it&#8217;s locating up to 6 million unique items per day across 195 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tile&#8217;s service is made available for free to <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/inspire2">Fitbit users</a> and other customers, but it monetizes through a combination of device sales, in-app subscriptions, and other partnerships. The <a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004254653-Tile-Premium-Features">Tile Premium subscription</a> will also be available to Inspire 2 users as an optional upgrade from within the Tile app at $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. This service, originally targeted towards Tile tracker owners, includes free battery replacements for Tile devices, access to 30-day location history, item reimbursements, and smart alerts that remind you when you&#8217;ve left home without important things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now with Tile technology, we’re adding even more convenience and helpful tools to Inspire 2, our accessible, easy-to-use activity and sleep tracker,&#8221; said Larry Yang, Director of Product Management of Fitbit Devices at Google, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/">finalized its Fitbit acquisition in early 2021</a>. &#8220;We’re excited to partner with Tile so our users can focus on building healthy habits without worrying about not being able to find their misplaced device, with the potential to bring Tile’s finding technology to more Fitbit devices in the future,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Tile&#8217;s partnership with Fitbit is now one of <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/partners">over 20 partners</a> who are leveraging Tile&#8217;s technology in some way across audio, travel, smart home and PC categories. And while technically Fitbit is the first &#8220;wearable&#8221; partner, Tile has worked with others in the consumer electronics space, including headphone makers like Skullcandy, Bose and Sennheiser.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s ability to expand its reach through industry partners may become even more critical to its future in the face of new competition from Apple, and to some extent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">Samsung</a>. Apple has been developing its own Tile competitor, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags,</a> which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">accidentally disclosed</a> in a YouTube video last year. These will leverage both Bluetooth and newer ultra-wideband technology to more precisely locate lost items. Meanwhile, S<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">amsung&#8217;s newest Tile competitor</a>, the Galaxy SmartTag, will also come in an UWB-powered version later this year.</p>
<p>This competition, specifically from Apple, could spell trouble for Tile, which has become a vocal participant in the U.S. antitrust investigations against Apple. The company has testified against Apple<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V"> in congressional hearings</a> about how its business has been negatively impacted by Apple in the past, and it pushed for third-party access to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; app as a means of evening the playing field between Apple&#8217;s upcoming trackers and its own. Tile also joined the Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that&#8217;s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/08/arizona-bill-apple-google-app-fees-antitrust-challenge">pushing for legislation to regulate the app stores</a> in various U.S. states.</p>
<p>Partnering with Apple&#8217;s competitor, Google (by way of Fitbit), could be seen as another way for Tile to shore up a position for itself within a key section of the wearables market before AirTags arrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> has announced that it is applying for a bank charter in the U.S. The company has submitted a draft application with the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.</p>
<p>If the company manages to get a charter in California, it would let the company operate throughout the U.S. as an independent bank. The discussions are still ongoing, which means it could take a while before the authorities grant a charter to the company.</p>
<p>After obtaining a charter in the U.S., Revolut could start offering more financial services. In particular, it would open up more opportunities when it comes to lending and savings products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, Revolut partners with Metropolitan Commercial Bank in the U.S. — they handle your deposits and they are insured by the FDIC. They also issue cards for Revolut.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Revolut is also launching <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a>. These accounts let a company send and receive international payments more easily. Companies can also use the service for payments with virtual and physical debit cards. Revolut Business is available across all 50 states. There are 500,000 companies using Revolut Business in Europe.</p>
<p>Revolut currently has 15 million customers for its financial super app — most of them are in the U.K. and the European Union. The company recently announced that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/revolut-applies-for-uk-banking-license/">applying for a banking license</a> in the U.K., its home country and its biggest market. In Europe, Revolut has a specialized license from the Bank of Lithuania — some customers are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/revolut-lets-customers-switch-to-revolut-bank-in-10-additional-countries/">moving their account to Revolut Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Revolut isn’t the only fintech startup applying for a bank charter in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/">Last month</a>, Brex announced that it would apply for a bank charter in Utah. Varo Bank also obtained its own bank charter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/mobile-banking-startup-varo-is-becoming-a-real-bank/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>It proves that leveraging another bank’s charter is great for growth. But at some point, if you want to launch new products and generate more revenue from those products, you have to get your own charter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear sign of a maturing platform is when the company exposes the services it uses for its own tools to other developers. <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> has been doing that for some time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">introducing Zoom Apps</a> last year and the Marketplace to distribute and sell these apps. Today, the company introduced a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers embed Zoom video services inside another application.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Video SDK enables developers to leverage Zoom’s industry-leading HD video, audio, and interactive features to build video-based applications and desktop experiences with native user interfaces,&#8221; Zoom&#8217;s Natalie Mullin wrote in a blog post announcing the new SDK.</p>
<p>If you want to include video in your app, you could try and code it yourself, or you could simply take advantage of Zoom&#8217;s expertise in this area and use the SDK to add video to the application and save a lot of time and effort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company envisions applications developers embedding video in social, gaming or retail applications where including video could enhance the user experience. For example, a shop owner could show different outfits to an online shopper in a live video feed, and discuss their tastes in real time.</p>
<p>Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson said the SDK is actually part of a broader set of services designed to help developers take advantage of all the developer tooling that the company has been developing in recent years. As part of that push, the company is also announcing a central developer portal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to have a single point where developers can go to to learn about all of the tools and resources that are available for them in the Zoom platform for their work in development, so we&#8217;re launching <a href="http://developer.zoom.us">developer.zoom.us</a> as that central hub for all developer resources,&#8221; Ittelson told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom launches its events platform and marketplace, brings apps to your calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/embed/#?secret=FIZgxukDUR" data-secret="FIZgxukDUR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition, the company said that it wanted to give developers more data about how people are using the Zoom features in their applications, so they will be providing a new analytics dashboard with usage statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are adding additional tools and actually providing developers with analytic dashboards. So folks that have developed apps for the Zoom ecosystem are able to see information about the usage of those apps across the platform,&#8221; Ittelson said.</p>
<p>He believes these tools combined with the new video SDK and existing set of tools will provide developers with a variety of options for building Zoom functionality into their applications, or embedding their application into Zoom as they see fit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.y42.com/">y42</a> (formerly known as Datos Intelligence), a data warehouse-centric business intelligence service that promises to give businesses access to an enterprise-level data stack that&#8217;s as simple to use as a spreadsheet, today announced that it has raised a $2.9 million seed funding round led by <a href="https://lafamiglia.vc/">La Famiglia VC</a>. Additional investors include the co-founders of Foodspring, Personio and Petlab.</p>
<p>The service, which was founded in 2020, integrates with over <a href="https://www.y42.com/product/integrate">100 data sources</a>, covering all the standard B2B SaaS tools from Airtable to Shopify and Zendesk, as well as database services like Google&#8217;s BigQuery. Users can then transform and visualize this data, orchestrate their data pipelines and trigger automated workflows based on this data (think sending Slack notifications when revenue drops or emailing customers based on your own custom criteria).</p>
<p>Like similar startups, y42 extends the idea data warehouse, which was traditionally used for analytics, and helps businesses operationalize this data. At the core of the service is a lot of open source and the company, for example, contributes to GitLabs&#8217; <a href="https://meltano.com/">Meltano</a> platform for <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/05/18/why-gitlab-is-building-meltano-an-open-source-platform-for-elt-pipelines/">building data pipelines</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2127963" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127963" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png" alt="y42 founder and CEO Hung Dang" width="1024" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png 1389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FounderPhoto.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127963" class="wp-caption-text">y42 founder and CEO Hung Dang.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking the best of breed open-source software. What we really want to accomplish is to create a tool that is so easy to understand and that enables everyone to work with their data effectively,&#8221; Y42 founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hung-dang-y42/?originalSubdomain=de">Hung Dang</a> told me. &#8220;We&#8217;re extremely UX obsessed and I would describe us as no-code/low-code BI tool &#8212; but with the power of an enterprise-level data stack and the simplicity of Google Sheets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before y42, Vietnam-born Dang co-founded a major events company that operated in over 10 countries and made millions in revenue (but with very thin margins), all while finishing up his studies with a focus on business analytics. And that in turn led him to also found a second company that focused on B2B data analytics.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127964" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127964" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ProductScreenshot1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> y42</p></div></p>
<p>Even while building his events company, he noted, he was always very product- and data-driven. &#8220;I was implementing data pipelines to collect customer feedback and merge it with operational data &#8212; and it was really a big pain at that time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was using tools like Tableau and Alteryx, and it was really hard to glue them together &#8212; and they were quite expensive. So out of that frustration, I decided to develop an internal tool that was actually quite usable and in 2016, I decided to turn it into an actual company. &#8221;</p>
<p>He then sold this company to a major publicly listed German company. An NDA prevents him from talking about the details of this transaction, but maybe you can draw some conclusions from the fact that he spent time at Eventim before founding y42.</p>
<p>Given his background, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that y42&#8217;s focus is on making life easier for data engineers and, at the same time, putting the power of these platforms in the hands of business analysts. Dang noted that y42 typically provides some consulting work when it onboards new clients, but that&#8217;s mostly to give them a head start. Given the no-code/low-code nature of the product, most analysts are able to get started pretty quickly  &#8212; and for more complex queries, customers can opt to drop down from the graphical interface to y42&#8217;s low-code level and write queries in the service&#8217;s SQL dialect.</p>
<p>The service itself runs on Google Cloud and the 25-people team manages about 50,000 jobs per day for its clients. the company&#8217;s customers include the likes of <a href="https://www.lifemd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lifemd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGF1J01xU9lwGPsAn0hLL6Cn0QYg">LifeMD</a>, <a href="https://thepetlabco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thepetlabco.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDUzlxtUx7seE8InbBS4ZyKEtOFw">Petlab</a> and <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.everdrop.de/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHLzJlfl3V1yIw8lWpDtwEF7ZeVw">Everdrop</a>.</p>

<p>Until raising this round, Dang self-funded the company and had also raised some money from angel investors. But La Famiglia felt like the right fit for y42, especially due to its focus on connecting startups with more traditional enterprise companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first saw the product demo, it struck us how on top of analytical excellence, a lot of product development has gone into the <span class="il">y42</span> platform,&#8221; said Judith Dada, General Partner at LaFamiglia VC. &#8220;More and more work with data today means that data silos within organizations multiply, resulting in chaos or incorrect data. <span class="il">y42</span> is a powerful single source of truth for data experts and non-data experts alike. As former data scientists and analysts, we wish that we had <span class="il">y42</span> capabilities back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dang tells me he could have raised more but decided that he didn&#8217;t want to dilute the team&#8217;s stake too much at this point. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small round, but this round forces us to set up the right structure. For the series, A, which we plan to be towards the end of this year, we&#8217;re talking about a dimension which is 10x,&#8221; he told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s clear that automated workflow tooling has become increasingly important for companies. Perhaps that explains why <a href="http://camunda.com/">Camunda</a>, a Berlin startup that makes open source process automation software, announced an €82 million Series B today. That translates into approximately $98 million U.S.</p>
<p>Insight Partners led the round with help from A round investor Highland Europe. When combined with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/camunda-hauls-in-28m-investment-as-workflow-automation-remains-hot/">$28 million A investment</a> from December 2018, it brings the total raised to approximately $126 million.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s attracting this level of investment says Jakob Freund, co-founder and CEO at Camunda is the company is solving a problem that goes beyond pure automation. &#8220;There&#8217;s a bigger thing going on which you could call end-to-end automation or end-to-end orchestration of endpoints, which can be RPA bots, for example, but also micro services and manual work [by humans],&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;Camunda has become this endpoint agnostic orchestration layer that sits on top of everything else.&#8221; That means that it provides the ability to orchestrate how the automation pieces work in conjunction with one another to create this full workflow across a company.</p>

<p>The company has 270 employees and approximately 400 customers at this point including Goldman Sachs, Lufthansa, Universal Music Group, and Orange. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Matt Gatto, managing director at Insight Partners sees a tremendous market opportunity for the company and that&#8217;s why his firm came in with such a big investment.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Camunda’s success demonstrates how an open, standards-based, developer-friendly platform for end-to-end process automation can increase business agility and improve customer experiences, helping organizations truly transform to a digital enterprise,&#8221; Gatto said in a statement.</p>
<p>Camunda is not your typical startup. Its history actually dates back to 2008 as a business process management (BPM) consulting firm. It began the Camunda open source project in 2013, and that was the start of pivoting to become an open source software company with a commercial component built on top of that.</p>
<p>It took the funding at the end of 2018 because the market was beginning to catch up with the idea, and they wanted to build on that. It&#8217;s going so well that company reports it&#8217;s cash-flow positive, and will use the additional funding to continue accelerating the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://worldswaterfund.com/">Waterfund</a>, an investment and trading firm that specializes in acquiring and managing water-related infrastructure assets, today announced a deal with Israel-based crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a> that will see the Waterfund team commit $50 million to build a water- and agtech-focused portfolio of 15 companies. The first of these investments is in <a href="https://www.plenty.ag/">Plenty</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/plenty-has-raised-over-500-million-to-grow-fruits-and-veggies-indoors/#:~:text=Plenty%E2%80%8C%20%E2%80%8CUnlimited%E2%80%8C%20has%20raised,the%20berry%20farming%20giant%20Driscoll's.">well-funded vertical farming startup</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these direct investments, the two companies are also working together on a new water-focused platform called Aquantos, which aims to issue so-called <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/ideas/blue-bonds/2583076-FINAL-MS_GSF_Blue_Bonds.pdf">Blue Bonds</a> and other financial products related to the water industry. Comparable to Green Bonds that focus on projects with environmental benefits &#8212; and which have been around for more than a decade now &#8212; Blue Bonds are still a new idea and focus on projects that could benefit the oceans.</p>
<p>“We are working to issue Blue Bonds that can be both climate bonds-certified and backed by sovereign or sub-sovereign borrowers,&#8221; said Waterfund CEO Scott Rickards. &#8220;This new financial tool and others are being designed to enable water projects in the Middle East to acquire leading technologies to address water scarcity in a fundamentally new way.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rickards argues that a lack of private capital has held back innovation in the water sector and that this new partnership &#8212; and the equity and debt financing opportunities it brings with it &#8212; will help change this.</p>
<p>OurCrowd, meanwhile, currently has about $1.5 billion in committed funding and has made investments in about 250 companies across its 25 funds. Among the companies the platform has invested in are the likes of Lemonade, Jump Bikes and Beyond Meat. Its portfolio also includes a number of existing agtech startups and last November, OurCrowd partnered with <a href="https://agfundernews.com/why-israels-ourcrowd-is-teaming-up-with-new-zealands-sprout.html">Sprout Agritech</a> (a company in its portfolio) to run a new agtech accelerator in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Abraham Accords present a huge opportunity to bring new water and agricultural technology to the water scarcity challenges of the entire Middle East,&#8221; said OurCrowd founder and CEO Jon Medved. &#8220;Alongside Waterfund, it is our mission to invest in and help build game-changing technology companies. We are excited to be working together with Waterfund to drive more private capital to address the critical challenges of water.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The once untouchable semiconductor sector continues to attract fervent attention from VCs.</p>
<p>The latest news this morning is that Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital has led a $55 million Series D round of financing into <a href="https://flex-logix.com">Flex Logix</a>, which builds chips designed to bring AI workflows to the compute edge. That follows on earlier rounds in the company totaling $27 million from the likes of Lux, Eclipse Ventures and Tate Family Trust, the investment vehicle of the company’s founder and CEO Geoff Tate.</p>
<p>This isn’t Mithril’s first foray into the chip investing world. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-series-b/">The firm previously backed Nuvia</a>, a promising entrant in the server chip market which was founded by several of the top chip designers of Apple’s A-line of processors. Mithril invested $240 million in Nuvia last September, just a few months before the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">flipped over to Qualcomm in a $1.4 billion transaction</a> announced in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back to Flex Logix though: we last covered the company in October, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/flex-logix-chip-availability/">when it announced the availability of its X1 AI chip</a>. As I wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flex Logix wants to bring AI processing workflows to the compute edge, which means it wants to offer technology that adds artificial intelligence to products like medical imaging equipment and robotics. At the edge, processing power obviously matters, but so does size and price. More efficient chips are easier to include in products, where pricing may put constraints on the cost of individual components.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mithril in its statement noted the company’s strength in designing a competitive processor which meets tight power and cost requirements in a white-hot segment of semiconductors. It also was excited that Flex Logix has developed a strong well of intellectual property in the eFPGA space, where there has been energetic activity given increasing interest from customers for flexible processors that can adapt to application needs over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has led to people everywhere shopping more online and Latin America is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based Nuvemshop has developed an e-commerce platform that aims to allow SMBs and merchants to connect more directly with their consumers. With more people in Latin America getting used to making purchases digitally, the company has experienced a major surge in business over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Nuvemshop&#8217;s offering was already heating up prior to the pandemic. But over the past 12 months, that demand has skyrocketed as more merchants have been seeking greater control over their brands. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than selling their goods on existing marketplaces (such as Mercado Libre, the Brazilian equivalent of Amazon), many merchants and entrepreneurs are opting to start and grow their own online businesses, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most merchants have entered the internet by selling on marketplaces but we are hearing from newer generations of merchants and SMBs that they don’t want to be intermediated anymore,” he said. “They want to connect more directly with consumers and convey their own brand, image and voice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof is in the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop has seen the number of merchants on its platform surge to nearly 80,000 across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico compared to 20,000 at the start of 2020. These businesses range from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to larger brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong and Luigi Bosca. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every KPI tripled in the company in 2020 as the world saw a massive transition to online, and Nuvemshop’s platform was home to 14 million transactions last year, according to Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With us, businesses can find a more comprehensive ecosystem around payments, logistics, shipping and catalogue/inventory management,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop&#8217;s rapid growth caught the attention of Silicon Valley-based Accel. Having just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/nuvemshop-a-latin-american-answer-to-shopify-raises-30-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $30 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round in October and achieving profitability in 2020, the Nuvemshop team was not looking for more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ethan Choi, a partner at Accel, said his firm saw in Nuvemshop the potential to be the market leader, or the “de facto” e-commerce platform, in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accel has been investing in e-commerce for a very long time. It’s a very important area for us,” Choi said. “We saw what they were building and all their potential. So we pre-emptively asked them to let us invest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Nuvemshop is announcing that it has closed on a $90 million Series D funding led by Accel. ThornTree Capital and returning backers Kaszek, Qualcomm Ventures and others also put money in the round, which brings Nuvemshop’s total funding raised since its 2011 inception to nearly $130 million. The company declined to reveal at what valuation this latest round was raised but it is notable that its Series D is triple the size of its Series C, raised just over six months prior. Sosa said only that there was a “substantial increase” in valuation since its Series C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop is banking on the fact that the density of SMBs in Latin America is higher in most Latin American countries compared to the U.S. On top of that, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly with projections of it </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Brazil, it grew 40% last year but is still underpenetrated, representing less than 10% of retail sales. In Latin America as a whole, penetration is somewhere between 5 and 10%,” Sosa said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company transitioned from a closed product to a platform that is open to everyone from third parties, developers, agencies and other SaaS vendors. Through Nuvemshop’s APIs, all those third parties can connect their apps into Nuvemshop’s platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform becomes much more powerful, vendors are generating more revenue and merchants have more options,” Sosa told TechCrunch. “So everyone wins.” Currently, Nuvemshop has about 150 applications publishing on its ecosystem, which he projects will more than triple over the next 12 to 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for comparisons to Shopify, Sosa said the company doesn’t necessarily make them but believes they are “fair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Choi, there are many similarities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw Amazon get to really big scale in the U.S.. Merchants also found tools to build their own presence. This birthed Shopify, which today is worth $160 billion. Both companies saw their market caps quadruple during the pandemic,” he said. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamics in LatAm&#8230;Our bet here is that this company and business has all the same dynamics and the same really powerful tailwinds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Accel partner Andrew Braccia, Nuvemshop has a clear first mover advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, direct-to-consumer has become one of the most important drivers of entrepreneurship globally,” he said. “Latin America is no exception to this trend, and we believe that Nuvemshop h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the level of sophistication and ability to understand all that change and fuel the continued transformation of commerce from offline to online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Sosa expects Nuvemshop will use its new capital to significantly invest in: continuing to open its APIs; payments processing and financial services; “everything related to logistics and logistics management” and attracting larger (mid-size) merchants. It also plans to expand into other markets such as Colombia, Chile and Peru over the next 18-24 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the countries share the same secular trends and product experience, they have very different market dynamics,” Sosa said. “This requires an on the ground local knowledge to make it all work. Separate markets require distinct knowledge. That makes this a more complicated opportunity, but one that enables a long-term competitive advantage.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zaver.io/">Zaver</a>, a Swedish fintech that enables merchants to accept cardless payments and offer buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) as an option, has raised $5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The company, which began life focused on P2P payments for marketplace transactions, is now doubling down on the durables sector (think: automotive, health &amp; beauty, craftmanship, etc.) for both online and offline commerce, after claiming to have found product-market fit.</p>
<p>Backing Zaver&#8217;s new round are VCs Inbox Capital (the firm that has invested in the likes of Revolut and Klarna) and Inventure. Other investors include Fredrik Österberg (founder of Evolution Gaming), Magnus Rausing (angel investor), Joen Bonnier (partner at Atomico), Fabian Hielte and Max Hobohm and Johannes Hobohm (owners of Ernstrom).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Amir Marandi and Linus Malmén in mid 2016, while both were students at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Zaver wants to accelerate the move away from plastic cards to mobile payments. Its target market is &#8220;durables,&#8221; starting in Sweden. Payments functionality and features include online and offline cardless payments powered by open banking, instant payouts for merchants, BNPL and credit scoring.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B4iAwAZtFV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/zaver/">Swedish fintech Zaver has raised $1.2M seed for its P2P payments platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Swedish fintech Zaver has raised $1.2M seed for its P2P payments platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/zaver/embed/#?secret=B4iAwAZtFV" data-secret="B4iAwAZtFV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;By durables, we mean goods (and services) that do not need to be purchased often, and typically last for a longer period of time e.g. automotive, a visit to the dentist clinic or kitchen renovation,&#8221; Marandi tells me. &#8220;[These] are often higher transaction value than &#8216;common&#8217; retail products or services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since the launch of &#8220;Zaver for Business&#8221; two years ago, Marandi says the company has gone from zero to &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; in processing volume. “Today, we have a product-market fit proving that the users are willing to leave old habits, and instead use their phone in order to pay for even larger items or services,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Through bypassing the card rails, Marandi argues that Zaver is able to customize pricing, user experience and product development in-house, in a way that wasn&#8217;t possible until now. &#8220;The focus is on replacing legacy-solutions with a comprehensive banking and payments platform for SMEs in this sector, where BNPL plays a key role in the transition in customer behaviour,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zaver&#8217;s main competitors are cited as legacy products, such as credit cards and factoring companies. &#8220;What makes us different is that we focus on the shift to mobile payments in a sector with low margin sales, and high average transaction values,&#8221; says Marandi. &#8220;By focusing on new customer behaviours (e.g. BNPL, direct debit, instalments at point-of-sale) and real-time settlements, we can offer the same frictionless payment experience online and offline, no matter the size of the tickets&#8221;.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">In the 170 years since Western Union was founded, no company has managed to solve two basic problems that continue to bedevil the remittance business &#8212; exorbitant fees and slow deposit times. For instance, it takes days or weeks for money sent from an immigrant in the U.S. to reach a relative in Nigeria.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ben-eluan">Ben Eluan</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/osezele-orukpe-1a37a9167">Osezele Orukpe</a>, two software engineers based in Nigeria, faced this problem in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They had executed a project for a client in the U.K. and when the time came for them to get paid, they settled with Skrill. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it took a week for the friends to get their money, and they lost a considerable chunk of it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to charges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience made us think of the payments and, more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross border payments,&#8221; Eluan said to TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gig economy and the service economy for small businesses economy is very massive, and we care about it enough to dedicate all our time into building payments for Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three years, crypto remittance companies have emerged to fill in this need, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an application and from a wallet, people can convert fiat into crypto and send it to the wallets of people in other countries who convert back to fiat if they choose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127947" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127947" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png 1775w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=1536,935 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flux</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the same proposition Eluan (CEO), Orukpe (CTO) and the team have with their product, <a href="https://iflux.app/">Flux</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto remittance company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enable merchants to send and receive money from anywhere in the world, Eluan tells me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that what differentiates Flux from other crypto remittance startups lies in the ease and speed of the platform&#8217;s transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He claims that facilitating payments on Flux is 100x faster than fiat, and is cheaper too. The platform charges $0.50 for every transaction, regardless of the amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2020, Flux got <a href="https://pioneer.app/blog/meet-the-pioneers-may-2020/">accepted into Pioneer</a>, an accelerator launched by ex-YC partner Daniel Gross</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer gives founders access to funding streams and talent hardly found outside Silicon Valley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has already backed more than 100 founders who give up 1% equity to join the accelerator. Depending on their progress, Pioneer can decide to give either $20,000 for 5%, $100,000 for 5%, or $1 million for 10%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the program, Flux </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $77,000 pre-seed investment from different investors &#8212; Hustle Fund and Mozilla, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eluan says the six-month-old company has 5,000 customers who have transacted over $750,000 in payments volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the CEO, the startup is growing 40% month-on-month and has made $25,000 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company witnessed this growth despite the Central Bank of Nigeria&#8217;s clampdown on crypto exchange activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The country&#8217;s apex bank <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2021/CCD/CBN%20Press%20Release%20Crypto%2007022021.pdf">ordered local banks</a> to stop aiding crypto transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This meant that crypto users on Flux and other crypto platforms could no longer convert fiat to crypto using their bank accounts or cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had to be compliant because of the CBN policy and our customers can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convert their crypto to fiat but can still transact their crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is why we want to make Flux available in the US and UK, where people can use Flux and send money to Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s currently not available but that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building and is the next phase of our application,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is also working on a peer-to-peer feature that will see users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transact crypto and fiat with one another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has launched Flux Merchants, a product that allows merchants to accept payments by creating payment links for their products and services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eluan, Orukpe, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/israel-akintunde">Israel Akintunde</a> (VP, Engineering) and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ayomide-lasaki-1208b6172">Ayomide Lasaki</a> (head of Marketing) &#8212; met in their freshman year at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Ile-Ife, Osun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying various engineering disciplines, the four friends formed a &#8220;programming club&#8221; with other software developers on campus where they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet to write code and make applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Eluan even tells me they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skipped class for these sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Flux, the friends built an e-commerce platform called Joppa that helped people find merchants around them within the city</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they had 20,000 users, Eluan says the team didn&#8217;t understand the dynamics of what it entailed to run a startup, so the business had to shut down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A factor that eventually led to founding Flux was the university&#8217;s budding tech talent ecosystem, which is teeming with stories of prominent startups launched by alumni. Some include J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obberman, Africa&#8217;s largest recruitment site; Kudi and Cowrywise, two YC-backed companies; and Techstars company Farmcrowdy among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These founders came from our school and it was a huge motivation for us. We always knew that we wanted to build something but we weren&#8217;t sure what this would be. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> landed on Joppa, then Flux,&#8221; Eluan added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/10/29/oau-cu-mwas/">Techpoint Africa</a>, OAU alumni have founded startups that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $1 million more than other alumni from other universities in West Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Think of OAU as the region&#8217;s Stanford University.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike others, the founders dropped out of the university to start Flux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We dropped out to focus on our startup and scaling it into a $1 billion company. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity here is huge. So for us, the right thing to do is to get the job done well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Startups need time so dropping out was inevitable,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are they the first set of African founders that are all dropouts to get into Y Combinator, but they&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the youngest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a feat Flux </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about, and Eluan believes it will open the doors for more young founders on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about that, and it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means brilliant young people in Nigeria and Africa can definitely go ahead to build stuff and get funded too </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like founders from the U.S.,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while their acceptance into Y Combinator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a much-needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> validation for their work and sacrifice, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, now based in Lagos, is playing in a competitive payments space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different companies like Chipper Cash, Flutterwave, MFS Africa and other crypto startups are trying to fix cross-border payments, and there&#8217;s a race against time to capture market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, YC, Pioneer, other backers, and the team&#8217;s understanding of the market will propel Flux to dominance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Caesar Sengupta, the long-time head of Google’s Next Billion Users initiative, is leaving the company next month, he said Monday. Sengupta, who additionally also led the company&#8217;s payments business in the past three years, is leaving the firm after nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>A regular fixture at Google’s events in India, Brazil, and Indonesia, Sengupta (pictured above) is best known outside the company for leading the company’s Next Billion Users unit, an initiative to make internet and services more accessible to users in developing markets.</p>
<p>As part of Next Billion Users initiative, Google brought internet connectivity to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/google-says-over-8-million-people-use-its-free-wifi-service-at-railway-stations-in-india/">hundreds of railway stations</a> and other public places in India and other markets (then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">shut down Station</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/google-debuts-tez-a-mobile-wallet-and-payments-app-for-india/">launched Google Pay in India</a> (which unlike Google Pay in the U.S., wasn&#8217;t developed atop credit cards) and built several products such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/android-go-is-a-lightweight-version-of-android-for-crazy-cheap-phones/">Android Go</a>, Datally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-launches-kormo-app-in-india-to-help-people-find-entry-level-jobs/">Kormo Jobs</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/after-leak-googles-new-file-manager-for-android-files-go-launches-into-public-beta/">Files</a> apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to Next Billion Users unit, Sengupta served as VP and Product Lead at ChromeOS, the company&#8217;s desktop operating system that powers Chromebooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 15 years with Google, Caesar Sengupta has made a personal decision to leave the company and start something entrepreneurial outside of Google. Through his time at Google, Caesar has played a key role in starting, building and leading initiatives such as ChromeOS, Next Billion Users and Google Pay. We are excited to see what he builds next and wish him the best in his new journey,” said a Google spokesperson in a statement. Sengupta&#8217;s current position at the firm is VP and GM of Next Billion Users and Payments.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations <a href="https://twitter.com/caesars?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@caesars</a> for an amazing long innings <a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Google</a>.

<p>“To the many, many Googlers working in Africa, APAC, LATAM and MENA, it has been inspiring to hear your voices take more weight in the products Google builds. I know there is so much more work to do,” Sengupta wrote in an email to his colleagues, which he also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thank-you-google-caesar-sengupta/">shared publicly</a>.</p>
<p>“But we are light years ahead of where we were just a short time ago. You’ve helped digitize your economies, made Google feel local and driven Google’s investment into your countries to unprecedented levels,” wrote the Asia-based executive. Sengupta didn&#8217;t share what he plans to do next.</p>
<p>Under Sengupta&#8217;s watch, Google also made several investments in startups in Asia. Some of these investments include Bangalore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">delivery startup Dunzo</a>, Android <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">lockscreen developer Glance, and popular news and entertainment app Dailyhunt</a>.</p>
