</div><p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve recently been bombarded with news of job surpluses, including predictions that the number of software developer roles will increase <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">22%</a> by 2030. With the need for nearly a quarter more developers, recruiters are having to scale their search and look under the stones that have previously been left unturned.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to assume in the digital age that job candidates are waiting at the end of a mouse click, but the online hiring space isn&#8217;t as encompassing as we think. Less than <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10%</a> of people on LinkedIn don&#8217;t have an education that surpasses high school, despite <a href="https://blog.hyperiondev.com/index.php/2018/04/04/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2018-key-findings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of developers having taught themselves a new coding language, framework or tool without formal education.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			People who live in emerging markets use LinkedIn less frequently, even though these locations harbor some of the world&#8217;s most promising tech talent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some developers choose not to have a LinkedIn account because it feels like another social media channel to maintain. This aversion makes sense considering engineers focus more on hard skills rather than their online personae.</p>
<p>This week, LinkedIn announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/linkedin-adds-hindi-to-reach-500-million-people-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would start offering its services in Hindi</a>, which will allow the service to reach 600 million people globally. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272783/linkedins-membership-worldwide-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People who live in emerging markets use the platform less frequently</a>, even though these locations harbor some of the world&#8217;s most promising tech talent.</p>
<p>Companies can&#8217;t let how they&#8217;ve hired in the past influence their approach today &#8212; doing so means missing not just the quantity of developers, but the quality and diversity of them. The remote revolution didn&#8217;t just broaden where we can recruit, it&#8217;s expanded who we can bring on board. With that in mind, these are the best ways to tap into the hidden developer gems.</p>
<h2>Open up your content, chats and code</h2>
<p>No recruiter should think of hiring a developer as the same process as selling a product or service. As Adam DuVander explains in &#8220;<a href="https://everydeveloper.com/developer-marketing/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Marketing Does Not Exist</a>,&#8221; resonating with developers requires more education and less promotion than the majority of companies currently provide.</p>
<p>The content you publish can organically pique people&#8217;s interest, as long as it has a strategic purpose and doesn&#8217;t overly mention your brand or services; for example, blog posts about upskilling, industry trends and exclusive data insights. You could also host events like webinars, round tables, quizzes and hackathons that are less for recruitment purposes and more to showcase the team and culture. Don&#8217;t be afraid to be lighthearted with your content, either. Memes, GIFs and videos are a great way to demonstrate that you don&#8217;t take yourself too seriously. And once you remove the promotional positioning, developers in the shadows will start to come forward.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I have a run of internal meetings starting in 15 minutes, so we have to be quick, but tech stocks are taking body blows yet again today.

<p>And when we say tech shares are under attack, we are not only pointing out that DocuSign has lost <em>more than 40% of its worth thus far today</em>, or that the Nasdaq Composite is off 2.5%. SaaS and cloud stocks are off 6.5% today after declines earlier in the week. They are now in a technical bear market. That matters!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The air we breathe has a carbon problem. But in Hellisheidi, Iceland, a geothermally active plateau just outside of Reykjavik, a new technology is taking a small but mighty step toward fixing it.</p>
<p>A plant called Orca, built by <a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a>, is the first-ever facility where CO<sub>2</sub> is being filtered directly from the air and stored permanently underground.</p>
<p>Orca’s carbon-capturing devices resemble giant transistor radios. They fit right into an already larger-than-life Icelandic landscape, where the wind blows fierce even on a rare day when sunlight gleams off the icy mountaintops.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Though the plant has only been operational since September, its air-straining technology, known as direct air capture, has been a point of contention among environmentalists for much longer. Vacuuming up carbon dioxide was once considered a last resort, but it’s looking like we’re headed toward a future where last resorts are a must-have.</p>
<p>“The combination of direct air capture and storage is very likely what the world will need at a massive scale if we want to be compliant with Paris climate targets,” said Jan Wurzbacher, the CEO and co-founder of Climeworks.</p>
<h2>Carbon removal, by math and magic</h2>
<p>By “Paris” targets, Wurzbacher was referring to the global goal of limiting emissions to two degrees Celsius (or ideally 1.5 degrees), established under the 2015 Paris Agreement. To meet that goal, the United Nations has estimated that 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide will need to be removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050. That number is a best-case scenario, assuming that aggressive cuts in emissions are achieved through other means. Without enough cuts, the need for carbon removal could be even higher.</p>
<p>“It’s relatively simple climate math,” Wurzbacher explained on a video call from Zurich, Switzerland, where Climeworks is based. “By mid-century, we need to remove 10 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, if everything else goes well. We might end up needing to remove 20 billion tons, because we can’t ramp down fast enough coal power plants and other stuff.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Direct air capture technology is one among many options for removing excess CO<sub>2</sub>. There are natural methods, like planting trees, and there are technologies that capture CO<sub>2</sub> directly from smokestacks and other emission sources. Compared to capturing CO<sub>2</sub> at the source, it’s more challenging and costly to pull CO<sub>2</sub> literally out of thin air, but a benefit of direct air capture is that it doesn’t require finding and stopping every single polluter. It’s a solution that works across the globe.</p>
<p>“When you do direct air capture, you don’t need to go where the CO<sub>2</sub> is, because air is everywhere,” said Wurzbacher.</p>
<p>The Orca plant consists of eight shipping container-sized boxes, which Climeworks calls collectors. On the front of each box, there are slats, kind of like large venetian blinds. On the back, there are 12 fans that pull air through the box. Within the collectors, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules hit the surface of a specially developed filter material, where molecules, called amines, selectively grab onto them.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://climeworks.com/co2-removal">point of contact</a> is a magical moment. The rest of the air continues out the other side of the collectors, but the carbon sticks tight to the amines. In that moment, the CO<sub>2</sub> goes from the chaotic fray of the atmosphere to the ordered grip of humanity, potentially remaining under control for thousands of years to come. With the application of heat, the CO<sub>2</sub> is released from the amines, and then it gets pumped into nearby volcanic rocks, where it forms long-lasting carbonate minerals.</p>
<p>Currently, removing a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> at Orca costs between $600 and $800, which is prohibitive for most potential payers. Early customers have been companies and individuals willing to pay a premium, such as Microsoft, Stripe, Swiss Re and even <a href="https://climeworks.com/news/climeworks-supported-by-coldplay">the band Coldplay</a> (which hired Climeworks to cancel out some of the emissions from its upcoming world tour).</p>
<p>Climeworks is aiming to get that cost down to between $100 and 200. The US Department of Energy recently<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-remarks-going-carbon-negative-doe-event-us-pavilion-cop26"> set a similar goal</a> of bringing the cost of technological carbon removal to under $100 per ton. At those lower price points, direct air capture would be on par with other ambitious measures to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2241087,2241088,2241086"]</p>
<p>For now, the magic moment of capture may not be cheap, but at least it works.</p>
<p>“Orca has gone from zero to one,” said Dr. Julio Friedmann, a senior research fellow at Columbia University “At this point we know, if we had to, we could make more Orcas. We imagine the cost will reduce, we imagine the performance will improve, et cetera, but we now have a single-unit device that pulls four thousand tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from the air every year.”</p>
<p>In addition to the high cost, Orca has been criticized for the miniscule quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> that it captures. Four thousand tons is paltry compared to the 10 billion tons that need to be removed within several decades. At our current level of emissions, humanity is canceling out Orca’s yearly efforts every three seconds.</p>
<p>However, it may be helpful to reframe this amount by considering it relative to other means of removing carbon from the atmosphere. Growing an acre of<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716302584"> redwood forest</a> also removes about 4,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, but it takes much longer than a year, and it can only be done in a limited number of places.</p>
<p>Friedmann framed the elevator pitch for direct air capture in similar terms: “It does the work of two hundred thousand trees, in one thousand times less space.”</p>
<p>Activists like Greta Thunberg have<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit"> dismissed</a> engineered solutions like direct air capture as “technologies that barely exist” and have instead promoted nature-based solutions, but it’s possible to pursue both strategies. If the United Nations estimates are correct, there will be room for multiple solutions to suck up the extra carbon.</p>
<p>“It’s at the order of billions of tons that we will need this. I’m quite sure of that,” said Wurzbacher.</p>
<h2>Sometimes, smaller is better</h2>
<p>Criticisms of Orca’s small size also miss another key point: starting small is a unique learning opportunity.</p>
<p>Like with any technology, direct air capture can improve with iteration, becoming more efficient and less expensive over time. The Climeworks CO<sub>2</sub> collectors are modular, meaning that the way to collect more CO<sub>2</sub> is to add more collectors, rather than making the collectors themselves any bigger. With a modular product, it’s cheaper and easier to iterate than with one that’s larger and more bespoke.</p>
<p>“By the time we build big plants or multiples of what we have now, we are quite certain that it works and how we keep operating,” said Nathalie Casas, the head of technology at Climeworks. “That’s the beauty of the modular approach.”</p>
<p>A bigger plant is already in the works, according to Wurzbacher, though the location has not yet been determined. It will be ten times larger than the Orca plant, so there will be 80 shipping container-sized collectors, instead of just eight, capturing 40,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
<p>An advantage of building a plant the size of Orca is that any tweaks to the collector design only need to be repeated eight times.</p>
<p>“If you build eighty containers, it’s a whole different story,” Wurzbacher said.</p>
<p>Climeworks’ small- to medium-scale approach stands in contrast to that of another major company commercializing direct air capture technology, Carbon Engineering, which is currently building a plant in Texas that will capture half a million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. That plant is scheduled to go online towards the middle of this decade.</p>
<p>“Climeworks is going into the swimming pool step by step as opposed to cannonballing in all at once,” said Colin McCormick, chief innovation officer at Carbon Direct, an investment and advisory firm focused on carbon removal.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if one, both, or neither of these approaches will be able to achieve carbon removal at scale and at cost. Direct air capture is still in its infancy, but it has parallels to some of the heavy hitters of sustainable technology. Both solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines started off as long shots several decades ago, but now they’re huge and growing industries at the vanguard of the energy transition.</p>
<p>The solar comparison is particularly apt, because the panels were working with novel materials to achieve something theoretically possible but commercially unproven.</p>
<p>According to McCormick, there’s a minimum amount of energy needed to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air, and it’s substantial, but Climeworks and Carbon Engineering are both using about ten times more energy than that minimum, so there’s a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p>“We’re wildly off from 100% efficiency, and that’s okay,” he said. “Early solar panels were a few percent efficient.”</p>
<p>There are many ways that Climeworks is seeking to boost efficiency and reduce costs. A big one is to improve the filter material, so that it captures more CO<sub>2</sub> and lasts longer. The company is also sorting out how to streamline production, so that the modular units are cheaper to build. Then there are the relatively fixed costs, like pipelines for CO<sub>2</sub>, that will naturally decrease as the plants get bigger.</p>
<p>The technical challenges ahead may seem daunting, but the team at Climeworks is unfazed. In fact, Wurzbacher considers the current state of direct air capture to be much more favorable than that of wind and solar in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>“If you compare it to where solar PV or wind started, they had to do larger factors of cost reduction,” said Wurzbacher. “It’s actually good news that it’s only on the order of a factor of ten that we have to do.”</p>
<p>Achieving these cost reductions requires learning that can only take place in real-world conditions, not a laboratory or an office.</p>
<p>“It’s not a software startup,” said Wurzbacher. “We’re putting steel and concrete in harsh environments. Weird things happen that you can only predict maybe to ninety percent, but the last ten percent you can never predict, and then you learn it, so it’s so important to get stuff out in the field.”</p>

<h2>Why Iceland?</h2>
<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find a field site more majestic than Orca. The plant sits on the edge of a grassy plain, just beneath craggy black peaks accentuated with crisp white snow. But the Climeworks team didn’t choose to build Orca in that spot for the scenery. The site in Hellisheidi offers two elements that are essential for direct air capture: cheap renewable energy and a place to put CO<sub>2</sub>. Both of those elements are products of Iceland’s unique volcanic geology.</p>
<p>Orca is located directly next to the Hellisheidi Geothermal Power Plant, which is one of Iceland’s biggest sources of geothermal energy. The plant draws hot water from over a mile below the ground, where it’s naturally warmed by a volcanic hotspot. The geothermal process produces heat and electricity, both of which are key inputs to direct air capture.</p>
<p>The electricity is used to move air through the collector, and the heat is used to release captured CO<sub>2</sub> from the filter material, which happens at around 100 degrees Celsius, the temperature of boiling water.</p>
<p>“Geothermal is particularly good to start with, because it’s 24/7; it’s heat and electricity, so it’s really well suited to what we are doing,” said Wurzbacher.</p>
<p>Then there’s the CO<sub>2</sub>. The rock under Hellisheidi is porous basalt, less than 1 million years old, which means it’s pretty much brand new, geologically speaking. A company called <a href="https://www.carbfix.com/">Carbfix</a> has figured out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0011-8">how to inject CO<sub>2</sub></a> into this young rock so that it reacts to form carbonate minerals.</p>
<p>Carbfix is a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy, the municipal-owned utility that operates the geothermal plant. For over five years, it had been using its technique to store the small amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> released from the geothermal process, so the infrastructure to store the CO<sub>2</sub> from Orca was already in place.</p>
<p>“This is a big part of why Orca is in Iceland,” said McCormick. “They have waste heat and zero-carbon power from the geothermal field. They have already-drilled injection holes and excellent geology for injecting CO<sub>2</sub>, so that location has everything you want.”</p>
<p>Carbon storage is an essential piece of the equation for carbon removal. There are many ways to do it, but the Carbfix method is particularly promising because the carbon dioxide turns quickly into rock. It mineralizes within two years—or more likely a few months—and it will remain in that solid state for thousands of years.</p>
<p>“The CO<sub>2</sub> is not going anywhere, so basically once it’s underground, we know it’s going to stay underground,” said Kari Helgason, the head of research and innovation at Carbfix.</p>
<p>This time frame contrasts with other methods, like storage in abandoned oil wells, which requires indefinite monitoring to make sure that the CO<sub>2</sub> does not escape.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the Carbfix method is that the cost is almost negligible, especially relative to the high cost of capturing carbon.</p>
<p>“If we receive pure CO<sub>2</sub>, it’s pretty cost efficient,” said Helgason. “What we’re doing with Climeworks, it’s ridiculously cheap.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Iceland is comprised mostly of basalt, so the storage opportunities are almost limitless. Helgason estimates that each cubic kilometer of basalt can store one hundred million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>“The storage capacity is enormous,” he said.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Iceland where this massive storage capacity exists. Carbfix put together an<a href="https://www.carbfix.com/atlas"> online atlas</a> that maps out regions round the world with potential for geologic carbon storage.</p>
<p>Wurzbacher noted that Hellisheidi and Carbfix were a perfect match for the Orca plant, but Climeworks is open to other locations for subsequent projects.</p>
<p>“What is not so perfect is the weather and wind in Iceland,” he said. “If you ask our commissioning team if they want to build the next plant in the same weather conditions, they might rather ask for going to Hawaii or someplace else with a lot of volcanic rocks.”</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2241305,2241306,2241307,2241326,2241325"]</p>
<h2>It takes a village to capture carbon</h2>
<p>The partnership between Climeworks and Carbfix is an example of the collaborative innovation that’s needed for carbon removal to succeed. In an attempt to incentivize similar relationships, the US has allocated $3.5 billion for building four direct air capture “hubs,” where multiple companies will work together to capture and store CO<sub>2</sub>. The provision is part of the infrastructure bill recently passed in Congress.</p>
<p>“It’s really important to think of direct air capture as a partnership among a number of different groups,” said Rory Jacobson, deputy director of policy at Carbon180, a think tank focused on carbon removal.</p>
<p>Often, oil and gas companies have been part of direct air capture projects, usually in the role of financial backers. Carbon Engineering is partnering with Occidental Petroleum on its project in Texas, and another direct air capture company, Global Thermostat, is is<a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/inside-exxonmobils-hookup-carbon-removal-venture-global-thermostat"> partnering with Exxon Mobil</a> on several smaller projects in the US.</p>
<p>For carbon capture startups, it makes sense to work with these larger companies, because they can write big checks and have a deep understanding of geology, but such partnerships have also fueled claims that carbon capture is a smokescreen for continued pollution.</p>
<p>“The thing that’s really promising about Orca is that there is no clear fossil fuel involvement at all in the project,” said Jacobson.</p>
<p>With or without help from the fossil fuel industry, direct air capture is likely to face limits in its ability to scale without support from government climate policy. The problem is that there’s no inherent market for removing carbon from the atmosphere, like there is for the electric power generated from wind and solar. Direct air capture needs to be funded by voluntary purchases (such as those that have so far supported Climeworks) or government incentives and directives.</p>
<p>“The voluntary market for carbon removal will bring us to millions of tons, maybe ten million tons, maybe more,” said Wurzbacher. “Public instruments will have to bring us from tens of millions of tons to billions of tons.”</p>
<p>Some incentives are already in place. The US currently has a policy called <a href="https://carbon180.medium.com/enhancing-and-expanding-the-45q-tax-credit-for-direct-air-capture-85f0f00c98c">45Q</a> that pays $50 per ton for carbon capture and storage, and that payment would be expanded to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/congress-eyes-235b-in-clean-energy-subsidies-here-they-are/">$180 per ton</a> under the Build Back Better bill, which was recently passed by the House of Representatives but remains in limbo in the Senate.</p>
<p>However, direct air capture will have a much bigger market if governments charge high carbon taxes or enact other measures that force industries to steeply reduce or remove their emissions right away. At the recent United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, world leaders weren’t announcing those kinds of bold moves. That may change as both public pressure and the effects of climate change continue to intensify. Neither shows signs of letting up any time soon.</p>
<p>If stronger policies materialize in the coming years, Climeworks will be ready, with direct air capture technology that’s likely to be much cheaper than it is today. The price will still be high, but the price of doing nothing could be far higher.</p>

<p>First, everyone was talking about &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; the Korean psychological thriller that became Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1448045816308961280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest series launch</a> ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/netflix-says-142-million-households-watched-korean-series-squid-game/">142 million viewers</a>. Now, everyone&#8217;s talking about YouTuber MrBeast&#8217;s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recreation</a> of the show&#8217;s titular fight-to-the-death, which racked up 142 million views in eight days. (Don&#8217;t worry, no one was killed).</p>
<p>Jimmy Donaldson (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrBeast</a>), the 23-year-old who was <a href="https://blog.youtube/culture-and-trends/2021s-top-trending-videos-and-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just named</a> YouTube&#8217;s Top U.S. Creator for the second year in a row, built sets and made costumes for 456 competitors, making the video look as close to the Netflix show as possible. And, like the popular series, the last player standing would win a life-changing cash prize &#8212; in Donaldson’s case, competitors had the chance to win $456,000.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are a number of reasons why Donaldson’s “Squid Game” is almost as popular as “Squid Game” itself, at least by the number of views. For one thing, YouTube is free, and Netflix isn’t.</p>
<p>But Donaldson’s virality comes at a cost. His 25-minute video required a whopping $3.5 million to make, he said on <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1459407625389490183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1459407625389490183%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fentertainment%2Fmrbeast-reveals-insane-cost-of-highly-anticipated-squid-game-video-1697945%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>. For comparison, the nine-episode series cost Netflix a total of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21.4 million</a>, averaging out to about $2.4 million per hour-long installment.</p>
<p>Even the most popular YouTube creators like Donaldson can’t measure up to the resources that a publicly traded, global company like Netflix has. So for creators who make shocking, stunt-based videos like Donaldson, it’s getting harder to do something unprecedented, like recreating “Squid Game.”</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t had nine hours to spare since the September release of &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; here&#8217;s the premise: If you&#8217;re so deep in debt that you&#8217;ll never get out, why not fight to the death for the chance to win unfathomable wealth? This is director Hwang Dong-hyuk&#8217;s response to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/08/squid-game-lays-bare-south-koreas-real-life-personal-debt-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> South Korea&#8217;s debt crisis</a>, but international viewers can relate &#8212; the U.S. has<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/america-has-1point73-trillion-in-student-debtborrowers-from-these-states-owe-the-most.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1.73 trillion in student debt</a>, increasing by more than 91% over the last 10 years. If you&#8217;re someone who fears that one bad dental visit could deplete your life savings, it&#8217;s not hard to relate to these characters&#8217; desperation for quick cash.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; it turns out that a ring of wealthy elites created the games for their own entertainment &#8212; why not pay poor people to fight to the death if they agree to the terms of the game?</p>
<p>But in a far less extreme way, MrBeast&#8217;s videos do the same thing. He gives out large sums of money to ordinary people, entertains millions of viewers with his brand of performative philanthropy, then reaps the financial benefit of their attention.</p>
<p>Predictably,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MrBeast’s &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; video</a> lacked the emotional resonance and suspense that made the Netflix show so compelling &#8212; since there is nothing at risk for the participants, the stakes feel about as high as a daytime rerun of “Wheel of Fortune.” But Donaldson has pioneered &#8212; and perfected &#8212; this style of YouTube content: Do something outrageously absurd, and people will watch, because, on YouTube, time watched is money. However, the cost to capture users’ attention when pursuing this model requires an increasingly heftier investment over time.</p>
<p>As the creator economy grows, some YouTubers’ budgets are growing, too. But with the precarious nature of this work, falling into the red could be dangerous. While Netflix&#8217;s “Squid Game” has made at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/netflix-says-142-million-households-watched-korean-series-squid-game/">$891.1 million</a> so far (almost 42 times the size of its budget), Donaldson might not recoup his own &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; investment.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0e3GPea1Tyg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Going big until you can&#8217;t go bigger</strong></h2>
<p>In Donaldson&#8217;s video &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-HphHIJS9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How I Gave Away $1,000,000</a>,&#8221; the creator explains how he got started making this sort of content when Quidd, a digital collectibles app, offered him a $10,000 brand deal for a video. He filmed a video giving the $10,000 to a homeless person, and then Quidd kept paying him to make more videos, so it snowballed from there.</p>
<p>Today some of his most popular videos include even larger investments, like &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y3Pkn95GI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Ate A $70,000 Golden Pizza</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxYjTTXc-J8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last To Leave Circle Wins $500,000</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6jC6VaO3j0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donating $100,000 To Streamers With 0 Viewers</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, MrBeast told the creator-focused YouTube channel<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCamLstJyCa-t5gfZegxsFMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Colin and Samir</a> that he spends<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW7cH2wLv00" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $4 million every month</a> to make his videos, and while some outperform his expectations, other videos don&#8217;t. He said that his video &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJH28ICkCdU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Sold My House For $1</a>&#8221; cost over $1 million to make, but he recouped less than half a million from ad revenue, and sponsorship money didn’t make up the difference. But as long as some videos do better than he expected, a slightly-less-viral video here and there won’t kill him.</p>
<p>“Once you know how to make a video go viral, it’s just about how to get as many out as possible,” he<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-22/who-is-mrbeast-meet-youtube-s-top-creator-of-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> told Bloomberg</a> last year. “You can practically make unlimited money.”</p>
<p>Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/12/18/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-of-2020/?sh=55bdb6c96e50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that Donaldson made $24 million on YouTube between June 2019 and June 2020 (YouTube isn’t his only income source – he also runs a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/dining/ghost-kitchen-mrbeast-burger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ghost kitchen</a> called MrBeast Burger, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mrbeast6000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streams</a> on Twitch and collaborates with a number of brands). But he said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYvmvr5_smQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> with fellow viral star Logan Paul that he puts most of his income directly back into his videos.</p>
<p>“If I make three or four million dollars a month, I just spend it on videos the next month,” Donaldson said. “We literally have like, razor-thin margins, and just reinvest it all.”</p>
<p>The problem with this clickbait model is that viewers become desensitized to these high-budget YouTube videos, which requires creators to keep upping the ante.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qfi9JpgMc2U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The comedian Demi Adejuyigbe also encountered this issue with his yearly videos in which he dances to &#8220;September&#8221; by Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire.</p>
<p>In his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPwG6L73-VU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first viral video</a> in 2016, he simply<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPpUYXZb2AA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> danced in his bedroom</a> wearing a homemade shirt that read &#8220;SEPT 21&#8221; on the front and &#8220;THAT&#8217;S TODAY&#8221; on the back. The following year, he got some fancy balloons, then in 2018, he<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG7YHFT4hjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> enlisted a children&#8217;s choir</a>, and in 2019, he hired a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hpU6UEq8hA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> mariachi band</a> &#8212; you get where this is going. This year, he decided he wasn&#8217;t going to make any more videos, because it&#8217;s too time-consuming and challenging to keep going bigger and better every year &#8212; so he<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfi9JpgMc2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> went all out</a> one last time and ended up raising over $1 million for charity from fans. But these “September” videos aren’t Adejuyigbe’s bread and butter. Going viral might have helped him get noticed in Hollywood, though. In between plotting each year’s “September” videos, he earned <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5093519/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing credits</a> on shows like “The Good Place” and “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”</p>
<p>A fashion and beauty creator, Safiya Nygaard, is another example. She first developed a following as a video producer at BuzzFeed, but<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aiRY5EwqPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> left</a> to invest in her own channel and retain more independence. Nygaard differentiated herself in the beauty space by doing “bad makeup experiments,” like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOFXPlUPOIg&amp;list=PLTJwUfUd8XBguvffQBb8-n1KTopgJzbUh&amp;index=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melting All My Nude Lipsticks Together</a>” or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahw3WH_UW7M&amp;list=PLTJwUfUd8XBguvffQBb8-n1KTopgJzbUh&amp;index=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixing All My Foundations Together</a>.” Over a year, this escalated to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3B-qp3U5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melting Every Candle From Bath &amp; Body Works Together</a>” and &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhllRWReNEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melting Every Lipstick From Sephora Together</a>.&#8221; For the latter video, she used more than 600 lipsticks &#8212; and with Sephora lipstick prices ranging from around $10 to $50, Nygaard’s bill was so expensive that she filmed the Sephora cashier calling her bank to verify the purchase.</p>
<p>But once you buy every lipstick at Sephora, you can’t really push further. Now, Nygaard updates her YouTube channel with almost 10 million subscribers only once or twice a month, though she started posting on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/reels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> every few days. Sometimes, even a TikTok might require a pricey purchase &#8212; in one <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany/video/6965594498302807301?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular TikTok</a>, Nygaard styles Balenciaga’s <a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/heeled-toe--black-636813W18061000.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,350 toe-heels</a>. Still, that’s a small purchase compared to 117 Bath and Body Works candles, or 600 Sephora lipsticks.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhllRWReNEE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Creators like Nygaard and Adejuyigbe have been able to pivot away from this high-cost, sometimes-low-reward content. But Donaldson&#8217;s high-budget videos are his lifeblood. He can&#8217;t stop making more and more extreme content if he wants his channel to remain at the top of the YouTube food chain.</p>
<h2><strong>Funding the creator economy</strong></h2>
<p>When startups need cash to fund the growth of their business, they turn to venture capital. Now, some firms are looking at viral creators as an investment opportunity in a time when video creation costs are growing. Venture capital firm SignalFire says that creators are the<a href="https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/#:~:text=More%20than%2050%20million%20people,%25)%20when%20they%20grow%20up." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fastest-growing small businesses</a>, and some firms like Sam Lessin&#8217;s Slow Ventures take that idea to the next level. Slow Ventures<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kb9mg/a-former-facebook-vp-thinks-investing-in-humans-is-the-future-of-vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recently invested</a> $1.7 million in the future of YouTuber Marina Mogilko, whose channel is called<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiq1FIgtEK7LRAOB1JXTPig" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Silicon Valley Girl</a> &#8212; they will get 5% of her earnings as a creator for the next 30 years.</p>
<p>Investing in literal people might seem sketchy, but assuming everyone involved has good intentions, is offering artists a financial cushion really the worst thing in the world? This is essentially what happens in Hollywood already. A production company might buy a script, hire talent and market a film, only for it to be a flop at the box office.</p>
<p>But creators &#8212; literal people &#8212; aren’t startups. And what happens when you keep trying to out-do yourself? You burn out.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the cushion of venture funding could take some financial burden off of creators, but the pressure to appease stakeholders could also add more stress.</p>
<p>YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki acknowledged the growing issue of burnout in a <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/my-final-letter-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to creators </a>in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard some creators say they feel like they can&#8217;t take a break from filming because they&#8217;re concerned their channel will suffer,&#8221; Wojcicki wrote. &#8220;If you need to take some time off, your fans will understand. After all, they tune into your channel because of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>YouTube’s product team found that creators only garner more views once they come back from breaks. But Drake McWhorter <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/tech/youtube-creator-burnout/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told CNN at the time</a> that he didn’t think this was true.</p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube is a treadmill,&#8221; McWhorter said. &#8220;If you stop for a second, you&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s easier than ever to go viral online, but that doesn’t always mean it’s easy to capture viewers’ attention in the long term &#8212; and to make a living on the internet, you need an audience. Now that MrBeast is making YouTube videos with Hollywood-sized budgets, yet still making a “razor-thin” profit, we have to ask: Who’s winning in the creator economy? At the end of the day, the success of “Real Life Squid Game” may be better news for YouTube, or even Netflix, than it is for Donaldson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The plan is simple: First, we create a knockoff of a popular digital service. Second, we cry political persecution. Third, we raise a bunch of money with a SPAC. And then, to cap it off, we take on AWS.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually funny is that I am not kidding. That is not only a real plan, but one that we&#8217;ve now seen twice.</p>

<p>We first got wind of the method of raising capital with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">the Trump SPAC deal</a> taking a collection of ideas and very little product public. And then we got another dose yesterday <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/">with online video hosting portal Rumble&#8217;s SPAC plan</a>. Both have long-term ambitions, or at least teasers, to take on the incumbent cloud players.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Good luck? That goal, about a hundred billion dollars, and 15 years might get you to quaternary status in the vicinity of where the big public clouds play.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at the Rumble scheme to conquer the digital world. After all, startups are designed to make big plans. Rumble&#8217;s plot to take on the combined heft of Amazon, Microsoft and Google is, if nothing else, not a small endeavor.</p>
<h2>Surely *this* is peak SPAC?</h2>
<p>Rumble, a self-described &#8220;neutral video platform,&#8221; is merging with CF Acquisition Corp. VI. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, per the companies. Here are <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/">the financial terms of the deal</a> (modestly condensed):</p>
<blockquote><p>The transaction values Rumble at an initial enterprise value of $2.1 billion, with current Rumble shareholders having the ability to earn additional shares of the combined company if the stock reaches price hurdles of $15.00 and $17.50 per share. The transaction is expected to provide approximately $400 million in proceeds to Rumble, including a fully committed PIPE of $100 million at $10.00 per share and $300 million of cash held in the trust account of CFVI.</p></blockquote>
<p>You are correct in being surprised that Rumble is worth $2.1 billion, or will be next year when it combines with the blank-check company. After all, we don&#8217;t really know that much about it.</p>
<p>Crunchbase data has a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rumble-inc-2-series-unknown--d2098ab7">single funding event</a> on record for the company, a May 2021 round with capital arriving from Peter Thiel and J.D. Vance. At the time, the company was worth around $500 million, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-j-d-vance-invest-in-rumble-video-platform-popular-on-political-right-11621447661?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter">per The Wall Street Journal</a>. The Journal also notes that Rumble was founded in 2013, but only recently found more mainstream popularity after right-wing figures began to promote the service as &#8220;a more welcoming, free-speech alternative&#8221; to video offerings from major platform players like Meta and Alphabet.</p>

The new feature is rolling out [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Messenger <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/12/03/close-out-the-year-with-messengers-new-expression-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that it&#8217;s starting to test out a new &#8220;Split Payments&#8221; feature that introduces a way for users to share the cost of bills and expenses through the app. The company says the new feature is a &#8220;free and fast&#8221; way to handle finances through Messenger. The new feature is rolling out next week for U.S. users.</p>
<p>To use Split Payments, users need to click on the “Get Started” button in a group chat or the Payments Hub in Messenger. From there, you can split a bill evenly or modify the contribution amount for each individual in the group chat, either with or without yourself included. You&#8217;ll also have the option to enter a personalized message. Lastly, you will be asked to confirm your Facebook Pay details, after which your request will be sent and viewable in your group chat thread.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’ve struggled with dividing up (and getting paid back for) group dinners, shared household expenses or even the monthly rent, it’s about to get easier,&#8221; the company said in a blog post about the new feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The launch of Split Payments comes as Messenger added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/messenger-adds-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-the-u-s/">Venmo-like QR codes</a> for person-to-person payments a few months ago. The codes launched in the U.S. and allow anyone to send or request money through Facebook Pay — even if they’re not Facebook friends. The feature can be accessed under the “Facebook Pay” section in Messenger’s settings.</p>
<p>Facebook Pay first <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/simplifying-payments-with-facebook-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in November 2019, as a way to establish a payment system that extends across the company’s apps for not just person-to-person payments, but for other things like donations and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Split Payments was introduced alongside a few other Messenger updates, including four new group AR effects designed with creators Emma Chamberlain, Zach King, Bella Poarch and King Bach. The company notes that it also recently launched two new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; Soudmojis, which are emoji that play a sound when you send them within Messenger, and a new chat theme. Messenger also recently rolled out a new Taylor Swift Soudmoji to celebrate the release of &#8220;Red.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Friday, which means the whole crew was aboard for this particular episode. We had <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris</a> behind the scenes, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> on the mics. And, frankly, we needed the full team, because the holidays aren&#8217;t slowing any news down.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>First up? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">Square becoming Block</a>, which we wanted to make fun of but mostly found to be reasonable, given the company&#8217;s disparate interests.</li>
<li>From there we chatted about Inpathy&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/inpathy-aims-to-be-a-social-network-that-mirrosrs-real-human-experience/">neat take</a> on social networking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/massive-wants-to-rent-your-spare-compute-power-to-pay-for-apps/">Massive&#8217;s $11 million funding round</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/butter-raises-7m-to-end-accidental-churn-due-to-payment-failure/">why Butter could help grease the skids</a> of many a subscription business.</li>
<li>Then it was time to trade startups for bigger companies, as we had to riff on Bret Taylor&#8217;s quasi-ascension to the top of Salesforce along with a host of other executive exits. Alex calls it cold resignation winter, but Meta clearly has put some people on the hot seat.</li>
<li>Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">was also in our remit this week</a>, due to its fundraising and layoffs. We debate if you should raise if it comes at the cost of your employees, and the morality of a Zoom layoff.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/sounding-board-lands-series-b-to-move-coaching-beyond-services-and-into-saas/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Sounding Board&#8217;s Series B</a> reminded us that executive coaching, even and especially for the folks above, isn&#8217;t just a services business. It&#8217;s a SaaS business.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vinehealth.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinehealth</a>, a 2018-founded, London-based digital health startup that&#8217;s built an app offering personalized support for cancer patients while also making it easier to gather patient-reported outcome (PRO) data, including for drug development and clinical trials, has closed a $5.5 million seed round as it prepares to expand into the U.S.</p>
<p>The round, which co-founder and CTO Georgina Kirby describes as a &#8220;late seed&#8221; &#8212; ahead of a planned Series A &#8220;in the next 12-18 months&#8221; &#8212; is led by Talis Capital with participation from previous investors<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space"> </span>Playfair Capital<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space"> </span>and<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space"> </span>Ascension.</p>
<p>A number of angel investors have also joined the round, including Keith Gibbs, former CEO of AXA PPP Healthcare; Pam Garside, partner at Newhealth; Voyagers <span class="il">Health</span>-Tech Fund, led by David Rowan, founding editor of Wired; David Giampaolo, healthcare entrepreneur and founder of PI Capital; Deepali Nangia, venture partner at Speedinvest and Atomico Angel; Faisal Mehmud, VP and former medical director of Bristol Myers Squibb; and<span class="m_3993107806375557245m2119360555473242954m-4424213529466934543apple-converted-space"> KHP MedTech Innovations</span>, a collaboration between King&#8217;s College London, King&#8217;s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; NHS Trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; which we billed as one &#8220;to watch&#8221; back in 2019 when we saw the founders pitching at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/ef11/">Entrepreneur First&#8217;s demo day</a> &#8212; combines behavioral science and AI to deliver timely patient support and nudges (for things like medication reminders) so they can more easily self-manage their treatment.</p>
<p>Vinehealth&#8217;s platform also acts as a channel through which patients can be remotely monitored by their clinicians as they provide feedback on symptoms and report any treatment side-effects.</p>
<p>So far its app has been downloaded around 15,000 times since being made available in January 2020 &#8212; which Kirby confirms covers all usage to date, so both for pure patient-support and for trials/research.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;8 VCs agree: Behavioral support and remote visits make digital health a strong bet for 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/embed/#?secret=E4cWncAeDD" data-secret="E4cWncAeDD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The patient-support app is offered free for cancer patients to download themselves &#8212; currently available in the U.K. and Ireland.</p>
<p>For pharma, Vinehealth provides its platform as a software as a service &#8212; supporting drug companies in recruiting patients for trials and gathering PRO to help with R&amp;D and drug development.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been focused on pharma since the very beginning and we&#8217;re getting a lot of traction there and seeing a lot of opportunity,&#8221; said Kirby. &#8220;The patient support program and the clinical trial are extremely similar [products]. &#8230; For pharma they&#8217;re different parts of the drug development process but in terms of the delivery of software, the things that patients need throughout that process &#8212; it&#8217;s extremely similar. So we&#8217;ve really narrowed down to that life science offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>She confirms Vinehealth is not going down the procurement route of trying to sell to healthcare services directly. So essentially the idea is for life sciences research to fund a  free provision of the support software to patients. (Although it can&#8217;t disclose any pharma customer names as yet.)</p>
<p>For monetization, it&#8217;s focused on serving the needs of drug companies, Vinehealth is equally keen to be seen as patient-centric &#8212; and wants its app to play a key clinician support role that promotes better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a web dashboard that is accessible through any browser for clinicians and doctors who want to be able to track their patients remotely and do this through running research studies or even within clinical trials,&#8221; said Kirby. &#8220;Those doctors and nurses can see that data in real-time but they can feed that into either appropriate points of the care pathway &#8212; obviously they&#8217;re not sitting there on the dashboard all day, but there may times at which it&#8217;s very useful for them to see specific red flags and be able to know which patient to see first and also to know how to make better clinical decisions using that kind of more real-time data &#8212; rather than the typical [fortnightly or monthly catch up with a patient].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s kind of giving them that context and that rich longitudinal data that they&#8217;ve never had,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Vinehealth has</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> digitized the traditional paper-based questionnaires that cancer patients would typically be asked to fill in during a visit with their clinical team to report their symptoms and provide any wider feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its premise is that moving that legacy process to </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a dedicated, user-friendly digital interface supports better patient self-management, treatment outcomes and improved quality of life for people living with cancer &#8212; given the relative ease of reporting data via an app, combined with the wider support package it offers (it&#8217;s worked with charities Macmillan and Bowel Cancer UK to supply support content to the app). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For example, Kirby said they use A/B testing and AI to configure personalized and timely recommendations to surface appropriate resources, as well as to determine how best to nudge and motivate patients to take medications and manage what can be complex medication regimes for cancer treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Vinehealth&#8217;s app wrapper can also dole out positive feedback to encourage patients to provide PRO.</span></p>
<p>Kirby points to<a title="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/jXlYCG6nDsWy7XhNDf_J?domain=pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231381/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231381/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638616166684000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MsW1g8AWhRWfwQqtSkmJU"> evidence </a>that when patients track their PRO data effectively, survival rates can increase by up to 20%. &#8220;Better self-management can have such a huge impact on survival,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want to show not only improvements in survival but in quality of life. too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blend of behavioral science and data-driven support Vinehealth&#8217;s approach involves stems from the combined expertise of the co-founders.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Rayna&#8217;s [Patel; co-founder and CEO] background is really in behavioral science; mine is in data science,&#8221; said Kirby. &#8220;And so when we came together, we thought we can really leverage both sides here &#8212; and use the data to understand what people are going through and where those nudges can be most effective. And use behavioral science to deliver some really key nudges at the right time with the right wording that can really nudge people to build their habits and be able to feel more in control and be able to actually understand what&#8217;s going on and make some better decisions for their own care.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of nudges in the app &#8212; some small ones, some bigger ones. We build medication nudges and reminders to be delivered in a certain way that is really effective and isn&#8217;t just dismissed by patients. We have nudges for logging certain symptoms and what that leads on to &#8212; so certain supportive content. So you&#8217;re logging anxiety at certain levels, here&#8217;s some supportive content that could really help you with dealing with this particular symptom or side effect of your drug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At different times it&#8217;s about the timing, the wording and the delivery of that nudge,&#8221; she added. &#8220;If you try to change too many things at once research shows that you don&#8217;t change anything at all &#8212; so we&#8217;ve really carefully thought about how we nudge and how we try to help patients build better habits and how often we do that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirby says the goal &#8212; in time &#8212; is also to use AI to incorporate more advanced suggestions into the platform in the future, such as predictive symptom logging, i.e., &#8220;what is likely to occur for this particular drug for this particular patient&#8221;.</p>
<p>For now, Vinehealth has built a content recommender system that is specialized in oncology and personalized to the patient: tuned to their diagnosis, adapting to their ongoing input, and factoring in content that other similar patients are reading and finding supportive.</p>
<p>On the research side, Kirby says the largest study the platform has been used for to date is an ongoing study involving nine NHS Trusts and 300 patients &#8212; which is a piece of research that Vinehealth is undertaking itself.</p>
<p>Health data is of course highly sensitive, and Kirby confirmed that consent for any third-party research purposes is sought separately to the consent a user of the patient-support product is asked for so that Vinehealth can process their medical information to provide the service and give them personalized treatment support.</p>
<p>&#8220;That data is not shared with anybody &#8212; unless they have [given] explicit consent to do that. By just signing up to the platform, they&#8217;re not consenting to sharing their data as part of a clinical trial. That is a completely separate piece of consent,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We make it extremely clear and don&#8217;t want to hide any sharing in any way &#8212; it has to be really obvious and really clear to a patient. Ultimately everyone wants to support patients. They want to give more opportunities for patients to be in those clinical trials, to be able to capture that data and feed that back in a way where &#8212; normally they&#8217;re suffering at home with these kind of side effects and that&#8217;s never getting back to the pharma company, for example &#8212; so we&#8217;re making it really clear what we&#8217;re doing and why we&#8217;re doing that and we give patients a choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirby suggested that, in the future, the startup may also look to be able to provide &#8220;properly anonymized&#8221; data sets based on purely aggregated insights provided by patients &#8212; so it might, for example, be able to highlight demographic groups that experience particular side effects of certain drugs. However, she added that that is not something it&#8217;s doing at the moment &#8220;given our focus on trials and patient support programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the near term, Vinehealth is gearing up for growth via a U.S. launch &#8212; which it hopes will happen &#8220;early next year&#8221; &#8212; with the 18-strong team likely to double over the next six months or so and its first U.S. hire already locked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing that we&#8217;ve been focused on since we fundraised is hiring a great team and growing that team and investing time in really building that out and making sure that everyone&#8217;s aligned on the mission and that we&#8217;re really building out a product that&#8217;s scalable to be able to take into these new markets,&#8221; Kirby said. &#8220;Building a startup is all about having great people. You can have great technology but if you don&#8217;t have great people, then you don&#8217;t really have anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Beatrice Aliprandi, principal at Talis Capital, said: “We’re hugely excited to be partnering with Rayna and Georgina: We’d been keeping a close eye on Vinehealth’s growth for several months before we invested in the company, given its unique value proposition where healthcare outcomes work in direct correlation with financial outcomes. It’s a win-win-win for patients, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, which is rarely the case in the healthcare space where parties are often at odds with one another.</p>
<p>“From our first meeting, the resilience and mission-driven attitude of the founders was immediately clear and is really what made this opportunity so compelling. Both Rayna and Georgina are clearly incredibly driven to improve the lives and survival of cancer patients, and as a team they possess a unique combination of expertise, skills, and drive to make Vinehealth a success.”</p>

<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller looked back at Taylor’s career to better understand how a one-time Google product manager ended up co-leading one of the world’s most valuable companies.</p>
<p>To get a fuller perspective, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/3-analysts-break-down-bret-taylors-pretty-sweet-week/">Ron interviewed four analysts</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242576" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<li>Holger Mueller, analyst, Constellation Research</li>
<li>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst, CRM Essentials</li>

<p>Leary said Taylor’s elevation likely signals that Salesforce founder Marc Benioff is getting ready to transition “into the next phase of his life, whatever that may be.”</p>
<p>Mueller, however, said power-sharing only succeeds “when the senior partner relinquishes responsibilities. That will be a first for Benioff, and we will see how this will pan out.”</p>

<p>Every blog post, Tweet and Instagram Story is an opportunity to explain to customers (and your board) how the company creates value or is a step ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>But quality will always beat quantity when it comes to content marketing; Googlebot may be hungry for new links, but potential customers demand expertise and insights.</p>
<p>“Marketers need a new plan of action that puts creativity before quantity, audience before engine, and sets connection as the top priority,” says Lindsay Tjepkema, CEO of audio and video content marketing platform Casted.</p>

<p>Companies that offer software as a service have been writing their own ticket in recent years, but are we entering a bear market?</p>
<p>Last month, the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund was at a 52-week high of $65.51, but as of this week, that figure had fallen to $53.</p>
<p>“That’s a decline of 19.1%,” writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange. “Or, 90 basis points under the 20% required for a particular asset … to reach technical bear-market territory.”</p>

<p>Singapore’s population is under 5 million, but according to KPMG, fintech investment in the nation-state will reach $3B this year, a significant chunk of the $42B global total.</p>
<p>By comparison, investors flowed $4.8B to Canadian fintech startups in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>One factor driving Singapore’s fintech success is its high consumer adoption rates, but its government also directly supports related initiatives through its Green Finance Action Plan.</p>

<p>Singapore-based Grab started out by offering ride-hailing services, but it has since swelled to become a “super app” that offers everything from food delivery to online payments.</p>
<p>The company went public via a SPAC on Thursday in the biggest U.S. debut by a company based in Southeast Asia. But by market close, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/grabs-spac-splat-caps-off-a-bad-week-for-blank-check-combinations/">shares had fallen 21% to $8.75</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back, a question Alex Wilhelm asked before trading began seems quite prescient:</p>
<p>“What are investors seeing in the company to make them confident enough to drop billions into its accounts and bid its shares higher?</p>

<p>Workers who want to accelerate their professional development no longer need to incur tens of thousands in debt.</p>
<p>Online education options are inexpensive and myriad, and “access to coaching and mentoring at the individual and group levels is improving,” writes Rhys Spence, head of research at European edtech-focused fund Brighteye Ventures.</p>
<p>To get a holistic sense of the opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, he crafted a market map that charts professional learning startups.</p>
<p>“These companies focus on a combination of both B2C and B2B models and have had substantial success on the B2B front,” says Spence.</p>
<p>“It’s a convenient way for employers to offer their teams opportunities for continuous personal development, tailored to an extent to their interests and priorities.”</p>

<p>Tencent, Didi and other China-based startups were able to go public in the U.S. thanks to a complex loophole known as a VIE, or variable-interest entity.</p>
<p>A VIE sets up an offshore company that allows non-Chinese citizens to get around restrictions on foreign ownership.</p>
<p>“The model was always risky as heck,” reported Alex Wilhelm, “but now the Chinese Communist Party is considering doing away with the side-step of its own rules,” which could have a devastating impact on the nation’s VC market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past few years, Pinduoduo has been widely regarded as Alibaba&#8217;s strongest challenger. While Alibaba reported 863 million annual active consumers across its retail platforms <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p211118.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 12 months ended September</a>, Pinduoduo&#8217;s <em>monthly</em> active users exceeded 740 million <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/static-files/d552ef24-b612-43c2-bf8c-7b1e61ae27a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the quarter ended September</a>.</p>
<p>In its pursuit of new growth engines, Pinduoduo is taking a different route from its older rival. Both e-commerce titans are starting to see their growth plateau, but instead of doubling down on cloud computing like Alibaba, Pinduoduo is pouring money into agriculture.</p>
<p>In August, Pinduoduo unveiled its <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/24/2285429/0/en/Pinduoduo-posts-2Q-results-unveils-10-Billion-Agriculture-Initiative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion)</a> agriculture program to &#8220;face and address critical needs in the agricultural sector and rural areas.&#8221; The initiative is all-encompassing, including possible equity funding for agritech startups and grants for fundamental research and talent training.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The program won&#8217;t be profit-driven, the company promised, and all profit from the second quarter and &#8220;any potential profits in future quarters would be allocated to the initiative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some see Pinduoduo&#8217;s investment in agriculture as an effort to alleviate rural poverty and is thus an answer to Beijing&#8217;s recent call for <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;common prosperity,&#8221;</a> which denotes &#8220;affluence shared by everyone, both in material and cultural terms.&#8221; But the company has reiterated that agriculture was at its core business from the outset.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Pinduoduo took off by selling fruit online before gradually broadening its product categories. For many growers, e-commerce was a boon. Agriculture in China was dominated by millions of small family-owned farms, which relied on layers of distributors to sell their produce nationwide. The setup meant farmers often ended up with razor-thin profits.</p>
<p>To attract vendors of agricultural products, Pinduoduo has been waiving commissions and said on last week&#8217;s earnings call that it planned to maintain the policy for the &#8220;future quarters.&#8221; Once farmers sign up, the platform then trains them to be savvy digital store operators and marketers. When orders are placed, third-party logistics services transport the produce to consumers, thanks to a mature delivery network that took shape during China&#8217;s e-commerce boom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pinduoduo isn&#8217;t the only Chinese internet platform trying to bring rural produce to urban households. Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao has long made &#8220;agricultural e-commerce&#8221; a key initiative and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/tiktoks-chinese-rival-kuaishou-becomes-a-popular-online-bazaar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video apps like Kuaishou</a> are helping farmers sell through livestreaming.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok&#8217;s Chinese rival Kuaishou becomes a popular online bazaar&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/tiktoks-chinese-rival-kuaishou-becomes-a-popular-online-bazaar/embed/#?secret=wkLfGzTS5t" data-secret="wkLfGzTS5t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Pinduoduo wants to go beyond selling and also help tackle farmers&#8217; production problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trained as engineers, my team and I have devoted ourselves to finding technology solutions to implement across the agriculture supply chain,&#8221; Chen Lei, who took over from Colin Huang as the firm&#8217;s CEO earlier this year, said <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4472091-pinduoduo-inc-pdd-ceo-chen-lei-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the earnings call</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our efforts in applying agriculture technology go beyond matching supply and demand, and extend into identifying upstream technology solutions to improve productivity, nutritional profiles and environmental sustainability. By strengthening agritech applications, we also hope to make agriculture attractive to a tech-savvy younger generation,&#8221; Chen added.</p>
<p>Besides selling and growing, Pinduoduo is working with research institutes to implement industry standards for products like meat and crops, the firm&#8217;s vice president of finance, Jing Ma, said on the earnings call.</p>
<p>As a Nasdaq-listed company, Pinduoduo is, of course, beholden to its investors. In Q3, the company posted a positive operating profit for the second consecutive quarter, due in part to reduced marketing expenses. In the meantime, the firm is shifting its focus to R&amp;D spending, which accounted for <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/static-files/d552ef24-b612-43c2-bf8c-7b1e61ae27a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 19%</a> of its operating expenses in Q3.</p>
<p>It will be a while before Pinduoduo&#8217;s agricultural investment starts to produce visible results, like, how will its technology help improve yield output for the 16 million farmers selling on Pinduoduo?</p>
<p>The company has shared some early accomplishments. Last year, for instance, it called on startups worldwide to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/"> grow the sweetest and most environmentally sustainable strawberries</a> and claimed that the winning team&#8217;s precision-farming solution has already been deployed at some farms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Umamicart aims to be a one-stop shop for home cooks, offering staple products and pantry essentials, recipe inspirations and occasion-specific kits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People come together around the dinner table and the food they love, but for <a href="https://umamicart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umamicart</a> founder and CEO Andrea Xu, it wasn’t always easy to find the ingredients to make the foods she grew up eating with her family.</p>
<p>Xu’s parents are Chinese, but moved to Spain, opening up their own Chinese restaurant. She recalls the grocery stores not having the kinds of sauces, thinly-sliced meat cuts and vegetables common in Asian cuisine. Even when she moved to the U.S. for college, she and her friends would talk about what wasn’t available in the one aisle of the grocery store dedicated to Asian cooking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242466" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242466" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2242466 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?w=300" alt="Andrea Xu, Umamicart" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg 4018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=768,767 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=2048,2046 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xu_Andrea_Photo.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242466" class="wp-caption-text">Andrea Xu, founder and CEO of Umamicart. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Umamicart</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242433" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Food has been a way to connect back to identity, but there was difficulty in accessing foods that were prevalent in my household,” she told TechCrunch. “In the U.S., there are 29 million Asian Americans, yet there is still a hurdle to access products.”</p>
<p>With most anything available for delivery these days, Xu decided to put that to the test with Asian ingredients. In March, she and Will Nichols, formerly with FJ Labs, launched Umamicart, an online Asian grocer and delivery service offering both a curated and comprehensive selection of traditional and creative Asian products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Umamicart aims to be a one-stop shop for home cooks, offering staple products and pantry essentials, recipe inspirations and occasion-specific kits for cooking activities like holiday roast duck, DIY sushi night, hotpot and dumpling making.</p>
<p>Orders can be placed via the company’s website — and soon a mobile app — with same-day delivery for New York City customers, or next-day delivery to ZIP codes in greater New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. areas.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $6 million in seed capital in a round co-led by M13 and FJ Labs, with participation from Picus Capital, Starting Line, Golden Ventures, First Minute Capital and Goldhouse Ventures. This brings the company’s total funding raised to $7 million, including a $1 million seed round.</p>
<p>Brent Murri, investor at M13, was introduced to Xu by FJ Labs, and said Umamicart was in line with the kinds of consumer technology his firm typically invests in, looking at the digitization of food. M13 has invested in similar companies, like Thrive Market and Shef.</p>
<p>“The combination of Andrea and Will as co-founders is one of the best market fits I saw this year,” Murri said. “Andrea has learned from her parents and retained a lot of relationships with food distributors, while Will led Instacart’s New York City market, so he knows how to scale the grocery business. All of that set them apart.”</p>

<p>He noted that grocery experts expect half of the U.S. population to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/2021-online-grocery-sales-will-surpass-100-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make at least one digital grocery purchase</a> next year. However, the digitization of grocery stores is not equal to everyone, citing the Asian market as one that is largely offline, providing space for companies like Umamicart to offer a curated selection of food with good customer experience.</p>
<p>The new capital will enable the company to expand its delivery range, grow its team and add product catalogue and geographic service areas as Umamicart sees increased demand from customers. Xu would like to provide more diverse offerings for Southeast Asian cuisine and increase the number of recipes available to users.</p>
<p>“We are also seeing huge interest from people who didn’t exactly grow up eating Asian food, but have come to enjoy it and cooking it,” she added.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=497217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global food delivery market</a> was estimated at around $111 billion last year, with forecasts showing that to be $154 billion in 2023, according to a report from ResearchAndMarkets.com. Overall interest in cooking and eating ethnic food continues to increase. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/324422/us-retail-sales-of-ethnic-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. retail sales of ethnic foods</a> was $12.5 billion in 2018, up from $11 billion in 2013, while <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/chinese-restaurants-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual spend at Chinese restaurants in the U.S.</a> was estimated to be just over $15 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>Umamicart itself saw 313% in quarter-to-quarter web traffic growth since its launch in March, is growing 20% to 30% month over month and now has more than 3,000 products.</p>
<p>The pandemic showed some key insights that when cooking with Asian cuisine, people prefer fresh products, but if those aren’t accessible, it impedes cooking and people try to find swaps, Xu said.</p>
<p>“Consumers are also rejecting what is in the international or ethnic aisle and want to source products and brands that are better,” she added. “We value that, so when they come to Umamicart, they know that what we put on our shelves is a vetted product, tried and true staples or the best new brands we were able to scout.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Swedish coworking space and investment fund Norrsken Foundation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/norrsken-opens-east-africa-startup-fund-and-hub-in-kigali/">announced the launch</a> of its first entrepreneurship hub outside the Scandinavian nation in Rwanda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center, located in Kigali, has finally opened up to the region, though it is happening</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two phases. The first, which took place yesterday, will welcome 250 entrepreneurs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> second phase hopes to bring in over 750 additional entrepreneurs to the Norrsken House in Kigali by December 2022, the company confirmed to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have massive demand we can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">satisfy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to become the biggest physical hub for startups in Africa,” said the managing director of Norrsken East Africa, <a href="https://rw.linkedin.com/in/pascal-murasira">Pascal Murasira</a>. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">We believe Kigali is on a path to become one of Africa&#8217;s leading clusters for tech and startups, and we want to help accelerate that journey.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kigali center is the first of 25 hubs the Norrsken Foundation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/with-norrsken-house-ex-klarna-executive-envisions-a-global-network-of-co-working-spaces-focused-on-impact/">plans to open globally</a> over the next decade, according to founder <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/niklasadalberth">Niklas Adalberth</a>, the Klarna co-founder who left the unicorn fintech in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation sees itself as “nonprofit, nonpolitical and nonpartisan” with a mission to help entrepreneurs solve the “world’s greatest challenges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its coworking space in Stockholm, Norrsken runs an impact accelerator program and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/norrsken-foundation-is-closing-on-an-oversubscribed-impact-venture-fund-at-125-million-euros/">impact VC fund</a> of €130 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, alongside Norrsken House in Kigali, the foundation also manages an Africa-focused seed fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While Norrsken mentioned in 2019 that its seed investments ranged from $25,000 to $100,000, with plans to make later-stage investments from $100,000 to $1 million, it did not give any update on its fund size this time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization only stated that it made a handful of investments into companies based in Rwanda, the<a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/11/17/2-rwanda-tech-startups-bank-funding-from-kigali-based-norrsken-foundation/"> two most recent ones</a> being Viebeg Technology and PesaChoice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic played a huge role in the project delays, Norrsken said it continues to follow the timeline it laid out when starting in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about launching Norrsken House </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same way as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about launching a product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get it out there before it’s ready, to involve users and get feedback on how to perfect it,” a company’s spokesperson said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We don’t have all the answers, and we need our users to help us shape the final product. Construction will continue and operations will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gradually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come online throughout the first half of 2022.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the pandemic triggering shifts in how we work and communicate globally from offline to remote, why is Norrsken continuing with the project? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Adalberth, it all boils down to a known fact that offline clusters help create billion-dollar companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, unicorns have popped up from cluster cities with economic, technological, innovative and real estate advancement: Think Silicon Valley, London, Stockholm, Beijing, Bengaluru, São Paulo and Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder hopes to replicate this model within the Norrsken House in Stockholm and Kigali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He believes Norrsken can create microcosms of these ecosystems with the center. And by bringing together 1,000 entrepreneurs solving real societal issues with their business models and connecting them to funding, network and mentorship, Norrsken aspires to create “impact unicorns.”<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike Stockholm, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is regarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a unicorn factory in Europe, Kigali doesn’t have a prominent big-name startup yet. And though it has a v<a href="https://report.startupblink.com/">ibrant startup and tech ecosystem</a>, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lags behind other markets such as Lagos, Nairobi, Cairo, Cape Town and Johannesburg in terms of <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/01/30/startup-ecosystem-and-funding/">receiving VC funding</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Norrsken chose Kigali as its first base in Africa because of Rwanda’s advantage in providing a friendlier <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2019-report_web-version.pdf">business environment</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, internet penetration and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we ended up with Kigali for a couple of different reasons. One is that we thought that we could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make the highest impact in Kigali,” Adalberth said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, from the World Bank, you know that Kigali is one of the easiest countries to do business in Africa. And it has built out infrastructure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> internet, traffic, and so on. So it’s a good prerequisite to building unicorns, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the final piece that was missing is what we’re trying to enable now with the Norrsken House.”</span></p>
<p>[gallery type="slideshow" size="medium" ids="2242615,2242609,2242614,2242618,2242619,2242616,2242612,2242613,2242610"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Murasira, startups including PesaChoice, SPENN, Fixa, BioMassters and ZoraBots will move into the Norrsken House in this first phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other tenants are partner organizations such as Katapult VC, The Bestseller Foundation, The Howard Buffett Foundation and the Novartis Foundation, which is housing its East Africa health tech hub and accelerator program at the center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://briterbridges.com/briterafrilabs2019">research</a> by AfriLabs and Briter Bridges in 2019, Africa has more than 600 active tech hubs, with 10 African cities home to about 250 of those and the rest spread across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These hubs such as Nigeria’s CcHub and Kenya’s iHub (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/nigerias-cchub-acquires-kenyas-ihub-to-create-mega-africa-incubator/">subsidiary</a> of the former) have contributed significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the growth of startups and innovation on the continent; some regard them as the backbone of Africa’s tech ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Adalberth noted, hubs as technology clusters set up suitable conditions to create successful tech companies. But Norrsken knows that if it seeks to replicate the ecosystems of Lagos, Cape Town and their successful counterparts that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, it needs to take a multi-stakeholder approach that involves the government, private sector and academia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a ‘hub of hubs.’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer infrastructure, access to networks, venture capital funds to invest in startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is going to be the biggest hub in the region and even before we launched, we received a lot of interest from international organizations, international funds, government, looking to work with us to be able to invest in the local startups,” Murasira said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our theory is that once we have these role models that we elevate via this venue, we can have more young people deciding to go into entrepreneurship as a career path. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if we maintain that momentum and build this, it will be a tremendous accomplishment for us and the East African tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zindi is all about using AI to solve real-world problems for companies and individuals. And the South Africa-based crowd-solving startup has done that over the last three years they have been in existence.</p>
<p>Just last year a team of data scientists under Zindi used machine learning to improve air quality monitoring in Kampala as another group helped Zimnat, an insurance company in Zimbabwe, predict customer behavior &#8212; especially on who was likely to leave and the possible interventions that would make them stay. Zimnat was able to retain its customers by offering custom-made services to those who would have otherwise discontinued.</p>
<p>These are some of the solutions that have been realized to counter the data-centered challenges that companies, NGOs and government institutions submit to Zindi.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zindi announces these challenges and invites its community of data scientists to take part in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/zindi-taps-12000-african-data-scientists-for-solutions-on-covid-19/">solution-finding competitions</a>. Participating data scientists submit their solutions and the winner gets a cash prize. The hosts of the competitions get to use the best results to overcome the challenge they had &#8212; like in an air quality monitoring project by AirQo, which sought solutions for forecasting air pollution across Uganda, and in helping Zimnat cut its losses.</p>
<p>“So AirQo now has a dashboard that allows the public to check air quality and air quality forecasts. One of the exciting things about this project is that AirQo hired two of the winners from the challenge to help with the implementation of the project,” said <a href="https://zindi.africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zindi</a> co-founder and CEO, Celina Lee. South African Megan Yates and Ghanaian Ekow Duker are the platform’s other co-founders.</p>
<p>“AirQo also raised funding from Google, based on the solution that they built, and they’ll now be replicating it in other African countries,” said Lee about the competition that was organised in partnership with the Digital Air Quality East Africa (DAQ EA) project of the University of Birmingham and the AirQo project from Makerere University, Kampala.</p>

The crowd-solving startup recently secured $1 million in seed funding. <strong>Photo Credits:</strong> Zindi</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among other notable private and public organizations that have tapped Zindi include Microsoft, IBM, Liquid Telecom and UNICEF, and the government of South Africa.</p>
<p>So far, Lee is excited about what Zindi has achieved and is enthusiastic about the community’s future, given how the crowd-solving startup has grown since launch. The platform is now providing alternatives and stepping up competition against traditional consulting firms operating across Africa, which are often expensive.</p>
<p>Zindi’s users have grown three-fold from the start of last year, to 33,000 data scientists from 45 countries across the continent. It has also paid data scientists $300,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>This number is set to grow as it hosts the third inter-university Umoja Hack Africa challenge in March next year, where college students will compete against one another for different solutions.</p>
<p>Zindi is using the inter-university competition to expose students to practical data science experiences and to solve real-life challenges using AI. During last year’s event the platform attracted about 2,000 students during the event that took place virtually because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Students get to build their first machine learning models, and from there, it opens up all kinds of doors for their careers and education,” said Lee, who is originally from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Zindi currently has a jobs portal to “shorten the path from learning to earning.” The talent placement portal allows organizations to tap from its pool of talent by posting openings.</p>
<p>The crowd-solving platform is also planning to introduce a learning component that provides training material to budding data scientists; this is after it realized a knowledge gap and need for training. Besides, Lee said that most of Zindi’s users are university students in need of learning experience, and who require enhanced skills to solve world problems.</p>
<p>The new plans will be made possible by a $1 million seed funding the platform recently secured.</p>

<p data-wp-editing="1">Lee said, “For us, it&#8217;s really about scaling the community and creating more value for all of our data scientists.”</p>
<p>“So we&#8217;re going to be using the funding to introduce much more learning content, because one of the things we understand is that, especially in Africa, data science is such a new field. And a lot of our data scientists are still university students or very early in their careers. And they&#8217;re just looking for a chance to learn and build their skills.”</p>
<p>The seed round was led by San-Francisco based VC firm Shakti, with participation from Launch Africa, Founders Factory Africa and FIVE35.</p>
<p>All these plans are toward building a strong data science community in Africa and for the continent, according to Lee, who said that they want to grow their users to reach one million in the near future. This, she said, will be achieved by opening up training opportunities to early career data scientists and by forming a strong community that encourages collaboration and mentorship.</p>
<p>Lee said, “And so where we want to eventually reach a million data scientists in Africa &#8212; we want to make data science something that any young person who&#8217;s interested in pursuing this career has access to the tools, the connections and the experience that they need to make a successful career in this field.</p>
<p>“Our vision is to make AI accessible to everyone.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche&#8217;s venture arm has taken a minority stake in 1Komma5°, a five-month-old German startup aiming to offer households everything needed for a carbon neutral home, including energy storage, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and solar.</p>
<p>The investment, the amount of which was not disclosed, follows a series of deals made by Porsche Ventures in the past two years, including Israel-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/intel-samsung-and-porsche-among-investors-in-trieyes-74m-funding-round/">sensing technology startup TriEye</a>, online electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/porsche-and-yamaha-invest-3-75-million-in-e-micromobility-dealership-ridepanda/">micromobility dealership RidePanda</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/goodyear-ventures-porsche-ventures-invest-in-virtual-sensing-company-tactile-mobility/">virtual sensing startup Tactile Mobility</a>.</p>
<p>This investment is a bit of a departure from Porsche Ventures&#8217; typical mobility tech play.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242566" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;With this investment, we want to underline our ambition in the area of smart city and sustainability,&#8221; Patrick Huke, head of Porsche Ventures Europe and Israel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Hamburg, Germany startup was founded by Micha Grueber, who is the CFO, and Philipp Schröder, whose previous stints were at Tesla and energy storage systems company Sonnen.</p>
<p>The company — its name a nod to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement to keep the increase of global temperatures down to 1.5°C — is taking an interesting route to its one-stop shop goal.</p>
<p>Today, companies are all focused on selling the components such as solar or energy storage, Schröder said in a recent interview. At the same time, no one in Europe is focused on bringing together these decentralized assets. That is bound to cause problems, Schröder contends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There will be issues in a decentralized energy world if every home is having a heat pump and a charge point and storage system and they do not communicate on the grid level (or with each other) there will be issues,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>1Komma5° is aiming to bring everything together through its software as well as acquisitions. Specifically, 1Komma5° is seeking to buy leading electrical installation companies in Germany — and will eventually expand to other countries such as Austria and Switzerland — that focus on renewable energies such as solar, heat pumps and energy storage. 1Komma5° provides the enterprise software for these companies to handle administrative tasks and customer-relationship management as well as energy management software that ties the charging, solar and energy storage together.</p>
<p>What makes 1Komma5°&#8217;s business interesting is its plan to interconnect these components like solar and energy storage at home level and at the grid level, Schröder said.</p>
<p>The startup has made five acquisitions so far through cash and stock deals.</p>
<p>The young startup has grand ambitions to use €100 million in cash and stock over the next to two years to acquire more of these renewable energy-focused installation companies. It&#8217;s targeting installation companies that have revenue between €5 million and €20 million and skilled labor — not sales outfits that simply outsource to other contractors.</p>
<p>The funding from Porsche will be used to to help 1Komma5° expand, a plan that includes opening retail locations that embody a premium Apple design-like vibe where potential customers can learn about the essential building blocks of a carbon neutral home. Customers to these stores might see a Porsche Taycan next to a home charger, energy storage and solar, for instance.</p>
<p>The first showrooms are planned at Hamburg&#8217;s Binnenalster and in Lingen an der Ems and are expected to open in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Porsche doesn&#8217;t have any immediate plans to offer 1Komma5° products to its own customer base. However, as Huke noted, Porsche Ventures makes strategic investments and it will be looking at different possibilities in the medium to long term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s ride-hailing behemoth Didi has begun the procedure of delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and applying to list in Hong Kong instead, the company <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4710244250289231?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via a Weibo post on Friday morning.</p>

<p>The move is anything but surprising.

<p>Over the past few months, China has rolled out a litany of new data regulations, including rules that would bolster user privacy protection and restrict cross-border data transfers. A Didi executive <a href="https://auto.sina.com.cn/news/hy/2021-07-03/detail-ikqcfnca4724348.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously said</a> it stored data in China and it was “absolutely not possible” that it passed data to the U.S., just like &#8220;many other U.S.-listed Chinese firms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Didi, which had about 500 million annual users as of March, pulled itself from Chinese app stores after it came under a cybersecurity review in early July. People with the app installed on their phones can continue using it but new users or those who have switched phones would have to download Didi alternatives.</p>
<p>Didi&#8217;s market cap currently stands at $37.6 billion. Its shares have plunged from more than $15 apiece at debut to $7.80 as of Thursday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">With hybrid models taking off across many aspects of society, it’s clear that though they offer incredible flexibility, the boundary lines between work and personal life are becoming increasingly blurred and emotionally draining.</p>
<p>Ritual has always been a powerful force in shaping our mental and emotional states; the gathering of people, physical totems, wardrobe and space design all work to choreograph that experience. But for people in the hybrid workforce, many of the rituals to which they&#8217;ve become accustomed are no longer accessible—their daily work experience involves no gathering, no change in location, and little (if any) wardrobe change.</p>
<p>We are doubling down on hybrid virtual experiences, even though studies reveal that young people who spend more than seven hours a day staring at a screen are more susceptible to depression, anxiety and have greater difficulty in completing tasks. Furthermore, employees are reporting fatigue and exhaustion from a sea of back-to-back meetings that stretch across multiple time zones, making the days feel endless.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Given that so much of the population is currently reliant on computing devices to engage in everything from work and school to shopping, banking and healthcare, we have to start taking a harder look at how we’re designing and developing those devices to better equip us for new rituals for the hybrid virtual world.</p>
<p>Today, computing devices account for every possible scenario, from the traditional desktop workstation to the ultra-portable handheld mobile phone. But what if the design of these objects could help users enforce the boundaries between work and personal life?</p>
<p>For instance, a device with a keyboard in front of a screen conveys “productivity tool,” while a touch tablet experience feels more casual and entertainment-focused. What if remote workers could have the option to switch between these two modalities to signal a switch from “work” to “personal”?</p>
<p>Another area that has exploded into the tech spotlight is video chat and conferencing tools. For many of us, the majority of our interactions are now playing out via virtual meetings on video conferencing apps. HD webcams and ring lights have been in high demand, and the number of virtual backgrounds and effects multiply daily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are still many challenges and limitations to the video conference experience, partly because it’s so dependent on the hardware design. Tools like Zoom, Google Hangouts and Teams have all been racing to keep up with the latest upgrades, but the software can only go so far without tackling hardware hurdles like integrated lighting sources, improved audio or even tactile feedback.</p>
<p>However, if we start to accept these paradigm shifts of in-person to virtual, we can begin to design for the future normal with hardware upgrades like a camera lens no larger than a pixel that disappears into the screen to make it appear as if users are making direct eye contact with their colleagues. Other areas, such as the application of temperature and tactile technologies, can help us feel deeper connections with one another via virtual spaces. There may also be new possibilities in exploring olfactory technologies as immersive experiences continue to evolve.</p>
<p>But what does this hardware evolution actually look like when it comes to production and consumption? While the expediency and convenience of technology is certainly impressive, it comes at a cost to our planet.</p>
<h2>Have consumers become Earth’s abusers?</h2>
<p>When I think about my most cherished possessions, what they have in common is that they are old and rare. Of course, this is typical of valuable items, but why couldn’t we bring this value system to our tech products? While I swap out my iPhone every year or two, I take tremendous joy in upgrading parts on my Ducati motorcycle bit by bit. I would never think of tossing it out for a brand new one.</p>
<p>As consumer demand for sustainable solutions increase, hardware companies must adjust their offerings. Powerful brands like Apple could be a great leader in strong regenerative practices. Building your own desktop PC is nothing new (especially for hardcore gamers) but imagine a future where all portable tech is modular with swappable upgrades. What if 50 years from now, your smartphone from 2025 is a still functional and highly valued piece of vintage tech?</p>
<p>The reality of our new normal is that the plethora of devices is not going away, while software developments are continuing to make leaps and bounds. It’s time we started thinking about our devices as objects to keep and care for, repairing and refurbishing things like phones and computers to keep up with the latest advancements, much like we do with our cars or even our homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re trying to get a mortgage or an auto loan, banks will put on their judging glasses and look into your past. Makes sense; it&#8217;s a reasonably reliable indicator as to whether you&#8217;ll be able to repay your loans or not. Student financing is a little different. Sure, your past plays a role, but for a lot of education, having a degree dramatically changes your earning potential, and hence your ability to repay. With a philosophy that the current student loan systems perpetuate the rich-get-richer systems, <a href="https://stridefunding.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stride Funding</a> is taking a different approach and just raised $12 million to help it take the business a few more steps into the future.</p>
<p>The issue at the heart of the company is one of equality and access to education &#8212; one of the most significant indicators as to whether someone will have an opportunity for financial upward mobility. As you might expect, there are layers of privilege (can your parents help pay for your loans) and &#8212; more specifically &#8212; institutionalized racism in the picture. It is with quixotic optimism that Stride Funding is taking on the $130 billion student loan industry, which currently has $1.6 trillion worth of loans outstanding.</p>
<p>Since closing its seed round in 2019, Stride increased the capital committed to students to over $50 million, with capital providers such as Silicon Valley Bank seeking to finance hundreds of millions of additional funds.The main thrust behind the company is to make education more available, especially to populations that have traditionally struggled to secure financing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Especially in student lending, there&#8217;s this massive gap in terms of access to capital,&#8221; says Tess Michaels, CEO and founder at Stride Capital. &#8220;Ninety-two percent of private loans require co-signers, and less than a fourth of students actually have access.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today announced it closed a $12 million Series A financing, led by <a href="https://www.firework.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firework Ventures</a> (co-founded by Brigette Lau and Ashley Bittner). Other investors include impact investors such as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juvo-ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juvo Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.ghco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graham Holdings</a> — alongside previous investors GSV Ventures, Slow Ventures and Sinai Ventures. The Stride Funding team has a personal mission at the core of its business:</p>
<p>&#8220;Both my parents immigrated here to the States, and education was their pathway to economic mobility. Education is what opens doors. And unfortunately for a lot of historical reasons, I think a lot of folks, especially underrepresented populations, are just left out of the market,&#8221; says Michaels, highlighting how this difference further amplifies the gap between the haves and the have-nots. &#8220;I feel very tied to the mission. We have supported such a wide range of really, really amazing, inspiring students, from refugees to DACA students, women, underrepresented minorities, and so on. We get such encouraging stories all the time from students, and it just reinforces that this is something that is worth doing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I admit I was thinking about the Oura Ring incorrectly. I was thinking of the device as an alternative to my Apple Watch. I suppose this is true, in the vaguest sense &#8212; likely for most people, it’s one or the other. After all, two activity trackers is overkill for most. It’s also cost-prohibitive. At $299, we’re well within smartwatch territory on the pricing front.</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that, starting with the Ring 3, Oura is adding a $6/month subscription fee that kicks in after a six-month grace period. The new service arrives with additional features, but also sticks behind a paywall metrics that were previously free to users. The Oura Ring 3 is, in a word, an investment. But it isn’t a smartwatch.</p>
<p>If anything, it’s a successor to the fitness band &#8212; a category we don’t think about much these days, but one that utterly dominated the wearable category before Apple sunk its teeth into the space. Companies like Fitbit and Xiaomi still sell a ton of the things on an annual basis, but they’ve largely fallen out of fashion in favor of their more fully featured brethren. The more I’ve begun to think about the Oura Ring as a fitness band (or, perhaps more appropriately, <em>health </em>band), the more it has begun to make sense.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2240774" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240774" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0723.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It is, in a sense, a passive device &#8212; not one that buzzes and beeps, constantly demanding attention throughout the day. The Oura Ring is a device to be worn and largely ignored, save for the occasional predetermined nudge for things like movement reminders. And if we’re being honest, that’s always going to be the case here. Sure, many fitness bands have blurred the line with displays, but the ring form factor has some very real limitations with regard to real estate.</p>
<p>Rather, the Ring is designed to stay out of the way, collecting actionable sleep, health and fitness data that you can peruse later on a connected mobile app. And really, that’s long been the selling point here. For the most part, a ring is better at staying out of your way than a fitness band. That was the appeal of Motiv’s initial play &#8212; and while that product seemingly moved away from the fitness category, it’s a banner than Oura has been more than happy to pick up and run with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240776" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0721.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before we venture any further, a confession: I’m not a ring guy. I don’t particularly like rings and don’t wear them (cue: “Don&#8217;t Fence Me In”). This is one of the big reasons I’m not going to be a regular Oura user. I’ve also, honestly, become fairly attached to my smartwatch. That said, I’ve been wearing the Ring 3 for the prescribed two weeks. That was Oura’s recommendation/soft demand for reviewing the product.</p>
<p>It was a strange request, as far as these things go. When reviewing hardware, you generally like to spend as much time with the product as possible. Easier said than done, sometimes. But here, the company insists that a fortnight is required for setting a kind of baseline measurement. It’s not that readings are going to be bad for the first two weeks, so much as things will be better when you’ve been wearing the device for a bit and Oura has a clearer idea of your habits, sleep and biometrics.</p>
<p>And it’s understandable, given that we’re all different, and customization is a key to any sort of health device. My guess is that sort of buy-in won’t be difficult to engender among those willing to plunk down $299 for a ring. It’s also a relatively simple lift given that it’s a minimally invasive product. Again, as someone who isn’t a ring person, it took some getting used to, but as a bit of a restless sleeper myself, it’s easier to wear to bed than a big, bulky smartwatch. Let’s take a moment to appreciate the built-in irony of a sleep-tracking device that’s hard to wear to bed. The Oura Ring is not that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comfortable. Because it’s a ring. Again, I’m not a ring guy, but the simple fact of it occupying less real estate makes it less invasive. Design-wise, the product is virtually identical to its predecessor. It’s a single-color metal band, round, but for a flatish edge that denotes the top of the product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240777" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240777" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0720.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240777" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>If you don’t know your ring size, the company will send a sizing kit à la Warby Parker, featuring a number of plastic dummy rings. You’re encouraged to wear one around for 24 hours, as the human finger has a way of swelling and contracting during the day. I chose my size and color (a matte black) and waited. Ultimately, I found the final product to be a bit looser than its plastic counterpart, but the ring stayed on fine. And, indeed, I found that the exact fit tended to evolve over the day.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the device looks like a standard ring &#8212; and that’s really the appeal. You will, however, sometimes see a green glow emanating from the inner circle, as the ring’s sensors grab a heart rate reading. Daytime heart rate monitoring is among a handful of new features available at launch, along with period production (something I admit that I did not have an opportunity to test) and improved temperature sensing. Based solely on those new features, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/the-oura-ring-is-the-personal-health-tracking-device-to-beat-in-2020/">3 represents an incremental update over the 2</a>.</p>
<p>The list of upcoming features arriving this year and next is a significantly longer one, including additional content like meditation and breathing sessions, workout heart rate monitoring, more accurate sleep staging and SpO2 blood oxygen sensing. In the case of that last one, in particular, it’s not entirely surprising it was delayed &#8212; and Oura’s certainly not alone in turning on a key health sensing feature after launch. In this case, it’s not about FDA approval (not yet, at least), but rather implementation.</p>
<p>This stuff is tricky to get right, and that likely goes double when you’re not Samsung or Apple. It is, however, a long list of promised features that will likely leave many potential consumers wondering why the company didn’t wait to launch a more fully realized product. I do ultimately wonder if it’s a piece of a deeper strategy to offer a base of hardware with the promise that features will continue to improve and roll out over the course of its life.</p>
<p>After all, there’s no question that Oura has some long-term ambitions with this stuff. Look no further than the <a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/category/research-validation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myriad studies</a> in which the company has participated. A cursory glance at its blog shows everything from depression to the impact of phone usage on sleep to adapting to undersea environments. Not everything is going to prove out, and certainly most or many would lead to brand new features, but at the very least, there’s some interesting insight here into precisely how much we’ll ultimately be able to monitor or predict with sensors. Among other things, those studies do appear to have proven out the accuracy of measuring things like heart rate on a finger versus the wrist.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I prefer a wrist-worn tracker like the Apple Watch for its workout tracking. I was able to pair the two and use them to paint an overall picture of my activity. I recognize not everyone has the means &#8212; or desire &#8212; to do this, however. Where the Oura Ring ultimately succeeds versus more traditional trackers is its emphasis on actionable insights &#8212; that’s precisely why the company is so insistent people let it determine a baseline before judging its efficacy.</p>

<p>Things like recovery and readiness tend to be overlooked by these sorts of devices. Oura describes the latter thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readiness is your main Oura score and is designed for you and only you, helping you discover what works for your body and lifestyle. Readiness is a holistic picture of your health — taking into account your recent activity, sleep patterns, and direct body signals (like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and body temperature) that can signify if your body is under strain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Effectively, it takes all of the metrics it has been collecting and determines whether you’re doing a good enough job recovering between them. Recovery Time was a constant red flag for me. Which, fair enough. I could and probably should be doing a better job letting my body recover between workouts. It’s certainly something to improve on, as the red “Pay attention” notifications plainly indicate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240780" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240780" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2240780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CMC_0712.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Another place that pops up is sleep. Clicking over to the Home tab, the app notes, “Your heart rate decreased late last night, so you might not by fully recovered. To help your body recharge, how about taking a moment to unwind today?” It seems obvious on the face of it that, say, meditating at night (versus the morning when I usually do) or practicing breathing exercises before bed, would be better for my (admittedly restless) sleep than, say, doom scrolling with my buds on Twitter.</p>
<p>But in amongst the daily grind, it’s easy to lose sight of this fact. I’ve always said that one of the underrated and under discussed benefits of a wearable is that it’s kind of the tech equivalent of tying a string around your finger. It’s an injection of mindfulness and a reminder of why you made that investment in the first place. We buy these things because we want to better ourselves. And in a world where technology too often does the opposite, some positive technological reinforcement is a net positive.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 2, 2021! There’s a lot going on. More fintech in Latin America. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/actuator-robots-for-bathrooms-agtech-food-and-architecture/">Actuator launching</a>. App Store Awards. The week’s software selloff. It’s a lot, so buckle in. Maybe the news slowdown will come next week? Here’s hoping! – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">Better.com shows how not to fire people</a>: Here’s a small tip: If you announce that you have raised or otherwise managed to access hundreds of millions of dollars, don’t fire a bunch of your team right afterward. Not only is it bad PR — and it definitely is — it’s also just an awful thing to do. Anyways, Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">got access to half its SPAC money early</a> and then laid off 9% of its staff.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">Grab goes public, quickly sheds value</a>: The Grab SPAC was supposed to be a crowning moment of sorts for the company. And then, despite raising oodles of capital and avoiding the poison of shareholder redemptions, shares of Grab still ate it <em>hard</em> today. Despite stocks rising in the United States, the Nasdaq-listed Grab shed around 20% of its value, at least as I write this to you. Ouch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/apple-announces-the-2021-app-store-award-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">Guess who won App Store Awards</a>: No really, guess. <em>I </em>would not have anticipated that a mobile League of Legends game would win the iPhone gaming prize. It feels a bit anachronistic that Apple picks favorites each year, a bit like the Grammys, if the Grammys also owned the music marketplace. Perhaps we should do some sort of Best of TechCrunch collection and see if Apple News picks it up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/google-timnit-gebru-ai-research-dair/">Timnit Gebru gets the last laugh</a>: Following her high-profile exit from Google, former Alphabet AI ethicist Gebru “has set up shop herself with a brand new research institute, DAIR, focused on the topics she felt were being sidelined at Google,” TechCrunch reports. The best revenge is living well, they say. That or founding your own company to do the damn work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/social-app-irl-makes-its-first-acquisition-with-deal-for-digital-nutrition-company-aabeze-labs/">IRL buys AaBeZe Labs</a>: This story makes me happy. Because there was a time when app names made no sense. And then startups started to have names like Vertical SaaS 4 Ur Industry, and it all got a bit corporate. IRL is a social app, while AaBeZe does “digital nutrition.” Hell yeah, tech being weird. I will now go take 17 virtual supplements to avoid getting a virus.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/playground-launches-in-beta-to-help-creators-cultivate-community/">Say it with me: ~ community ~</a> Community became a buzzword in the startup space after it got super expensive to buy an audience from social networks. So, build your own community, and it makes acquiring customers cheaper! Viola! There’s more to it than that, but that’s a bit of context regarding what Playground is up to. Per TechCrunch reporting, “Playground is a social platform that seeks to help people discover and develop community while empowering creators to monetize their audience.” (Don’t forget that if you say “monetize community” three times in the mirror, you only get coal in your stocking.)</li>
<li>Two stories from Mexico: Mendel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexicos-mendel-secures-35m-to-tackle-corporate-spend-management-in-latam/">has raised $35 million</a> to work on the corporate spend issue that has proven so lucrative in the United States. And Kueski <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexican-bnpl-player-kueski-secures-202m-as-it-nears-100m-in-arr/">just added a bajillion dollars</a> to its accounts to help it grow its Mexico-focused BNPL solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/glorify-an-ambitious-app-for-christians-just-landed-40-million-in-series-a-funding-led-by-a16z/">Glorify raises venture capital money</a>: Nothing says “Christianity” like raising venture capital to fund an app that sells folks religious material. And while we’re just muttering Matthew 19:24 to ourselves, we should note that a16z just backed Glorify to the tune of $40 million. We presume $4 million will get tithed.</li>
<li>How much does it cost to deliver groceries? Trick question. The answer is infinite capital. Evidence? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/instant-grocery-delivery-startup-jokr-bags-another-huge-round-to-enter-unicorn-status/">JOKR just raised again</a>, and Swiggy is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">going to drop $700 million</a> on its own “instant” grocery delivery effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4 analysts break down Bret Taylor’s pretty sweet week</h2>

<p>Bret Taylor is on a roll: On Monday, he became the chair of Twitter’s board, and a day later, Salesforce made him its co-CEO and co-chair.</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller looked back at Taylor’s career to better understand how a one-time Google product manager ended up co-leading one of the world’s most valuable companies. To get a fuller perspective, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/3-analysts-break-down-bret-taylors-pretty-sweet-week/">interviewed four analysts</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liz Herbert, VP and principal analyst, Forrester Research</li>
<li>Holger Mueller, analyst, Constellation Research</li>
<li>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst, CRM Essentials</li>
<li>Jason Wong, analyst, Gartner</li>
