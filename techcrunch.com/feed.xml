										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Templafy.com">Templafy</a>, a Denmark-born B2B SaaS platform that does business document creation, has raised a $60 million D round of funding led by Blue Cloud Ventures. All previous investors also participated, including Insight Partners, Seed Capital, Dawn Capital and Damgaard Company. Templafy has now raised a total of $125 million.</p>
<p>To some extent, Templafy competes with PandaDoc. However, Jesper Theill Eriksen, CEO, told me: “The platform that we&#8217;ve built is very enterprise focused, so it is agnostic to use case. It’s really about helping employees produce pretty much any type of business document or content that they need to have, allow them to start from any application where they work. It might be Office or Google but it could also be Salesforce or teams or slack. Others are very vertically focused against particular use cases for example around sales. We are horizontally focused and helping out on a series of use cases across large enterprises.”</p>
<p>Mir Arif, Managing Partner at Blue Cloud Ventures said: “Templafy is solving an all-too-common, yet frequently overlooked problem for organizations: disconnected content. While the term may be new, the problem itself is not. When company content isn’t integrated to the applications where employees work, organizations experience disconnected content which can cause several damaging issues including loss of compliance, a drag on efficiency and ultimately a negative impact on business performance. The ambition to solve disconnected content for all enterprises combined with a ripe market, an operationally strong team and a powerful, user-friendly platform makes Templafy an exemplary partner.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Templafy’s <a href="https://info.templafy.com/blog/templafy-raises-25m-to-continue-scaling-globally">Series C round of $25 million</a> was 14 months ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Amazon continues to expand its self-service, computer-vision-based grocery checkout technology by bringing it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-fresh-grocery-store-meet-just-walk-out-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to bigger stores</a>, an AI startup out of Israel that&#8217;s built something to rival it has picked up funding and a new strategic investor as a customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trigo.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trigo</a>, which has produced a computer vision system that includes both camera hardware and encrypted, privacy-compliant software to enable &#8220;grab and go&#8221; shopping &#8212; where customers can pick up items that get automatically detected and billed before they leave the store &#8212; has bagged $10 million in funding from German supermarket chain REWE Group and Viola Growth.</p>
<p>The exact amount of the investment was not being disclosed (perhaps because $10 million, in these crazy times, suddenly sounds like a modest amount?), but Pitchbook notes that Trigo had up to now raised $87 million, and Trigo has confirmed that it has now raised &#8220;over $100 million,&#8221; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/trigo-raises-22m-for-an-automated-grocery-check-out-platform-similar-to-amazon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A</a> in 2019, and a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201221005337/en/Trigo-Raises-60M-to-Scale-Its-Frictionless-Checkout-Grocery-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $60 million</a> that it raised in December of last year. The company has confirmed that the amount raised is $10 million today, and $104 million in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation. We have asked and will update as we learn more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trigo is immensely proud and honored to be deepening its strategic partnership with REWE Group, one of Europe’s biggest and most innovative grocery retailers,&#8221; said Michael Gabay, Trigo co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;REWE have placed their trust in Trigo’s privacy-by-design architecture, and we look forward to bringing this exciting technology to German grocery shoppers. We are also looking forward to working with Viola Growth, an iconic investment firm backing some of Israel’s top startups.”</p>
<p>The REWE investment is part of a bigger partnership between the two companies, which will begin with a new &#8220;grab and go&#8221; REWE store in Cologne. REWE has 3,700 stores across Germany, so there is a lot of scope there for expansion. REWE is Trigo&#8217;s second strategic investor: Tesco has also backed the startup and <a href="https://retailanalysis.igd.com/news/news-article/t/tesco-launches-trial-of-check-out-free-shopping/i/22554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been trialling its technology</a> in the U.K.. Trigo&#8217;s also being used by Shufersal, a grocery chain in Israel.</p>
<p>REWE&#8217;s investment comes amid a spate of tech engagements by the grocery giant, which recently also announced a partnership with Flink, a new grocery delivery startup out of Germany that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised a big round of funding to expand</a>. It&#8217;s also working with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/yamo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamo</a>, a healthy eating startup; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/whisks-a-i-powered-recipe-app-lets-you-send-the-ingredients-to-your-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whisk</a>, an AI powered buy-to-cook startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;With today’s rapid technological developments, it is crucial to find the right partners,&#8221; said Christoph Eltze, Executive Board Member Digital, Customer &amp; Analytics REWE Group. &#8220;REWE Group is investing in its strategic partnership with Trigo, who we believe is one of the leading companies in computer vision technologies for smart stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>More generally, consumer habits are changing, fast. Whether we are talking about the average family, or the average individual, people are simply not shopping, cooking and eating in the same way that they were even 10 years ago, let alone 20 or 30 years ago.</p>
<p>And so like many others in the very established brick-and-mortar grocery business, REWE &#8212; founded in 1927 &#8212; is hoping to tie up with some of the more interesting innovators to better keep ahead in the game.</p>
<p>“I don’t actually think people really want grocery e-commerce,” Ran Peled, Trigo&#8217;s VP of marketing, told me back in 2019. “They do that because the supermarket experience has become worse with the years. We are very much committed to helping brick and mortar stores return to the time of a few decades ago, when it was fun to go to the supermarket. What would happen if a store could have an entirely new OS that is based on computer vision?”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how widely used and &#8220;fun&#8221; smart checkout services will become in that context, and whether it will be a winner-takes-all market, or whether we&#8217;ll see a proliferation of others emerge to provide similar tools.</p>
<p>In addition to Amazon and Trigo, there is also Standard Cognition, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/amazon-go-rival-bets-pandemic-bolstered-case-for-cashierless-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money at a $1 billion valuation</a>, among others and other approaches. One thing that more competition could mean is also more competitive pricing for systems that otherwise could prove costly to implement and run except for in the busiest locations.</p>
<p>There is also a bigger question over what the optimal size will be for cashierless, grab-and-go technology. Trigo cites data from Juniper Research that forecasts <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/smart-checkout-technologies-to-process-$387-bn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$400 billion</a> in smart checkout transactions annually by 2025, but it seems that the focus in that market will likely be, in Juniper&#8217;s view, on smaller grocery and convenience stores rather than the cavernous cathedrals to consumerism that many of these chains operate. In that category, the market size is 500,000 stores globally, 120,000 of them in Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://thefund.vc/">The Fund</a>, the early-stage investment firm focused on pre-seed and seed startups, is going Down Under for its latest expansion. The Fund was founded in New York in 2018, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/the-fund-la-london/">launching in Los Angeles</a>, London, the Rockies and the Midwest, too.</p>
<p>Co-founder Jenny Fielding, who is also managing director at Techstars New York, said The Fund decides on new areas for expansion based on demand from the local startup ecosystem, and earlier this year, it heard from a group of founders and operators who wanted to launch it in Australia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to participating in first check rounds, The Fund also builds communities of founders and other leaders from successful startups, who not only provide mentorship, but also capital as limited partners. The Fund now has a network of about 400 founders and has made around 120 investments across its funds.</p>

<p>In each of its regions, The Fund is led by an investment committee of four people. In Australia, they are: Techstars managing director Todd Deacon; venture firm AirTree principal Elicia McDonald; AfterWorks Ventures co-founder Adrian Petersen; and former Canva head of product Georgia Vidler.</p>
<p>There will be 50 people in The Fund Australia’s limited partner base, including founders of startups like Culture Amp’s Rod Hamilton, Linktree’s Alex Zaccaria, Adore Beauty’s Kate Morris, and leaders from Canva and Safety Culture, too. The Fund Australia’s LPs will help source promising startups from their networks, and refer them to the investment committee for review.</p>
<p>The Fund is targeting $3.5 million USD and will invest in about 40 startups, writing check sizes of $50,000 to $100,000 USD over 24 months. Limited partners and other members of its community around the world will provide guidance as portfolio companies grow.</p>

<p>Deacon told TechCrunch that The Fund Australia’s focus on very early-stage startups is important because of the growing pre-seed/seed funding gap. He points to a <a href="https://crossroads.startupaus.org/analysis/capital/seed-capital">report by StartupAus</a>, an advocacy group for Australian startups, that angel and seed investment in Australia has fallen over the past few years, both in terms of number of deals and aggregate value.</p>
<p>The Fund’s hypothesis is that many early-stage funds, in Australia and other parts of the world, shift their focus to later stages as they raise larger funds, Deacon added. This happened in New York City, too, and was one of the contributing drivers for the creation of The Fund in the first place.</p>
<p>“There’s been this gap in early-stage funding. There’s those two points of building a really strong community—helping founders and then the funding gap, which we can help to solve to a certain degree. We’re bringing in checks in the early stage with a lot of power in providing founders access to that network,” he said.</p>
<p>Writing early checks lets The Fund see deal flow before other venture firms and limited partners, and small check sizes gives it an advantage with startups.</p>
<p>“We don’t take a huge proportion of their raise, yet we come with really high quality capital,” said Deacon. “We’ve got that investor network. For why some of our [LPs] are interested, it’s to generate a return, but they also want to give back and make Australia and New Zealand companies prosper.”</p>
<p>Being able to tap into The Fund’s international network is helpful for startups in Australia, where many companies eye international expansion from the start.</p>
<p>Australian unicorns like Atlassian and Canva are also helping strengthen Australia’s startup ecosystem, said Vidler. “It feels like an inflection point for me in the startup ecosystem, where now there’s all these original founders and a community of senior operators who are keen to give back and create and bolster the ecosystem here.”</p>
<p>The Fund Australia is sector agnostic and wants to create a diverse portfolio. The Fund has focused on gender parity since the start. Each region’s investment committee is comprised of two men and two women, about half of its LPs are women and over 40% of its total capital has gone to female founders. Vidler says this was a major draw for her.</p>
<p>“The pull for me, and I think for a big part of the network in Australia, and a lot of women in tech in Australia, is that they’re going to be super interested in investing in the next generation of female founders as well,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV battery swapping startup Ample has locked in two partnerships this month that will help fuel an expansion into Japan and New York City after years of working on the technology. The startup, which was founded in 2014 and came out of stealth in March, said Tuesday it has partnered with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese petroleum and energy company Eneos </span>to jointly deploy and operate battery swapping infrastructure<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Japan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next year, the two companies will pilot Ample’s fully automated swapping technology with a focus on ride-hailing, taxi, municipal, rental and last-mile delivery companies. Ample and Eneos will also evaluate whether </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">swapping stations can offer other uses, such as a backup source of power for the energy grid.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> It is still early days for the partnership and few details have been disclosed; Ample, for instance didn&#8217;t share when the pilot program would begin or where in Japan it would initially launch. However, even with these scant details, Eneos&#8217; interest signals that battery swapping — at least for Ample — is gaining some believers. </span></p>
<p>The Eneos announcement comes a few days after Ample launched a separate partnership with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally, a New York City-based EV rental company for ride-hailing, taxi and last-mile deliveries. Ample and Sally will roll out five to 10 stations in NYC by the fourth quarter of this year, with plans to expand into other markets in 2021, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khaled Hassounah, founder and CEO of Ample</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample&#8217;s partnership with Sally will also expand to San Francisco in the next couple of months. Depending on the cost of using both services, this might be an advantageous deal for ride-hailing drivers in California, at least, where the state just decreed </span><a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2021/05/uber-lyft-electric-cars-california-mandate-weighed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90% of Uber and Lyft drivers must be in EVs by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal is to ultimately make swapping stations as ubiquitous as gas stations,” Hassounah told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample came out of stealth this March with five operational stations in the Bay Area and a partnership with Uber that entails drivers renting vehicles directly from Ample that have been retrofitted with the startup&#8217;s battery technology. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Ample architecture is designed to be integrated into any modern electric vehicle,&#8221; Levi Tillemann, VP for policy and international outreach at Ample, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Unlike a standard electric vehicle, where you have a battery pack that is never meant to be removed from the car, with the Ample system, you replace the battery pack with an adapter plate that essentially shares the exact same dimensions as the OEM designed battery pack. That adapter plate is the architecture that allows for battery swap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ample&#8217;s standardized battery modules work with every vehicle that has been configured to run on the Ample platform, says Tillemann. With Ample&#8217;s partnership with Sally, the company will begin stepping away from running its own fleet, which it essentially launched to prove its business model. The company will work with Sally and probably other fleet and rental companies in the future to make vehicles Ample-enabled.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ample&#8217;s battery swapping works with any electric vehicle and dramatically reduces the cost and time it takes to install EV infrastructure by being a drop-in replacement for the OEM battery and does not require any modification to the car (either hardware or software),” said Hassounah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the concerns that puts ride-hailing drivers off switching to EVs is the amount of time it takes to charge a battery. Hassounah says swapping a battery only takes 10 minutes, but that the company aims to reduce that to five minutes by the end of the year. Having a more efficient and seamless process might help ride-hailing drivers and logistics companies make the switch.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/embed/#?secret=URBYL9BLjC" data-secret="URBYL9BLjC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Currently, drivers pay 10 cents per mile for swapping services, including energy, and the range varies based on the car model and battery size,&#8221; said Hassounah. &#8220;The price of the service varies depending on the price of electricity, but our goal is to have it be 10% to 20% cheaper than gas.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When drivers want to swap a battery, they&#8217;ll use Ample’s app to find nearby stations and then initiate the autonomous swap. Each station can serve about five to six cars per hour, but the company expects to be able to serve double that by the end of the year. That said, this also depends on the amount of available power at a given site.</span></p>
<p>Tillemann says as Ample expands, the company aims to one day work with existing OEM partners to offer consumers the choice of having Ample production plates installed into their new vehicles on the production line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our unit costs are very favorable for the battery swap systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They do not cost a lot to deploy, and that means, with a relatively low number of vehicles our battery swap architecture is economical and profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eneos, which previously invested in Ample, according to the company, is committed to providing the next generation of energy supply. The company is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also exploring hydrogen and recently partnered with Toyota’s Woven City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a futuristic prototype city that’s being built in Japan, to power the metropolis using hydrogen. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dec12470-894b-11ea-9dcb-fe6871f4145a">lost their jobs</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="https://apna.co">Apna</a>, a startup by an Apple alum, is helping millions of such blue and gray-collar workers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/apple-alum-jobs-app-apna-for-india-workers-raises-12-5-million/">upskill themselves, find communities and land jobs</a>. On Wednesday it announced its acceptance by the market has helped it raise $70 million in a new financing round as the startup prepares to scale the 16-month-old app across India.</p>
<p>Insight Partners and Tiger Global co-led Apna’s $70 million Series B round, which valued the startup at $570 million. Existing investors Lightspeed India, Sequoia Capital India, Greenoaks Capital and Rocketship VC also participated in the round, which brings Apna’s to-date raise to over $90 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, whose name is inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGKJBPFdUA">a 2019 Bollywood song</a>, at its core is solving the network gap issue for workers. “Someone born in a privileged family goes to the best school, best college and makes acquaintance with influential people. Many born just a few kilometres away are dealt with a whole different kind of life and never see such opportunities,” said Nirmit Parikh, founder and chief executive of Apna, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apna is building a scalable networking infrastructure, something that doesn’t currently exist in the market, so that these workers can connect to the right employers and secure jobs. “Apna’s focus on digitizing the process of job discovery, application and employer candidate interaction has the potential to revolutionize the hiring process,” said Griffin Schroeder, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>

<p>The startup’s eponymous Android app, available in multiple languages, features more than 70 communities today for skilled professionals such as carpenters, painters, field sales agents and many others.</p>
<p>On the app, users connect to each other and help with leads and share tips to improve at their jobs. The app also offers people the opportunity to upskill themselves, practice with their interview performance, and become eligible for even more jobs. The startup said it&#8217;s building Masterclass-like skilling modules, outcome or job based skilling, and also enabling peer-to-peer learning via its vertical communities. It plans to launch career counselling and resume building feature.</p>
<p>And that bet is working. The startup has amassed over 10 million users and just last month it facilitated more than 15 million job interviews, said Parikh. All jobs listed on the Apna platform are verified by the startup and free of cost for the candidates.</p>
<p>Apna has partnered with some of India’s leading public and private organizations and is providing support to the Ministry of Minority Affairs of India, National Skill Development Corporation and UNICEF YuWaah to provide better skilling and job opportunities to candidates.</p>

<p>More than 100,000 recruiters &#8212; including Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, Flipkart, Zomato, Licious, Burger King, Dunzo, Bharti-AXA, Delhivery, Teamlease, G4S Global and Shadowfax &#8212; in the country today use Apna’s platform, where they have to spend less than five minutes to post job posts and are connect to hyperlocal candidates with relevant skills in within two days.</p>
<p>Apna has built the “market leading platform for India’s workforce to establish digital professional identity, network, access skills training, and find high quality jobs,” said Nikhil Sachdev, managing director, Insight Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Employers are engaging with Apna at a rapid pace to help find high quality talent with low friction which is leading to best in class customer satisfaction scores. We believe that our investment will enable Apna to continue their steep growth trajectory, scale up their operations, and improve access to opportunities for India’s workforce.”</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale across India and eventually take the app to international markets, said Parikh. Apna, which has recently seen high-profile individuals from firms such as Uber, BCG  and Swiggy join the firm, is also actively hiring for several tech roles in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Apna has built the infrastructure and brand awareness in the market that it can launch in a new city within two days and drive over 10,000 interviews there in less than two days, it said.</p>
<p>“Our first goal is to restart India’s economy in the next couple of months and do whatever we can to help,” said Parikh, who was part of the iPhone product-operations team at Apple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors has enough &#8220;binding orders&#8221; from customers to fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022, executives at the company said Tuesday, just a day after an executive shakeup that included the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">resignation of the company&#8217;s CEO and CFO</a>.</p>
<p>Reaching that goal will come at a cost. The company is putting all of its resources toward the Endurance pickup truck, which means other projects, including an electric recreational van, have been put on hold, according to comments made by Lordstown interim CEO Angela Strand and President Rich Schmidt during an automotive press event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just focused currently on the Endurance truck,&#8221; Schmidt said at the event, according to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-shares-soar-after-new-chairwoman-says-production-plans-remain-on-track.html">report by CNBC</a>. &#8220;That&#8217;s our next goal for the next three months, to make sure we hit our production targets and stay within our budgets and drive forward to getting the vehicles ready for the market.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What was meant to be the &#8220;first mass produced all-electric RV&#8221; should have been revealed this month, but with its money woes, Lordstown has pushed back the reveal and removed mention of the van from its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021008107/ride-20201231x10ka.htm#Item7ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisof_">amended annual filing</a> — a change first noted earlier this month <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lordstown-motors-amends-annual-filing-with-going-concern-notice-11623181411">by the WSJ</a>.</p>
<p>Investors responded to the company&#8217;s &#8220;we have enough capital&#8221; and &#8220;binding order&#8221; comments and put less weight on the &#8220;we&#8217;re punting on the electric van&#8221; part. Shares of Lordstown Motors were up 11.34% on the news to close at $10.31.</p>

<p>Lordstown&#8217;s <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">Q1 report</a> filed with the SEC last week showed a startling lack of capital that would have gotten in the way of manufacturing and delivering the EV pickup. In the filing, the company warned investors that it had &#8220;substantial doubt regarding [its] ability to continue&#8221; in the next year. The automaker has faced scrutiny in the past after investment research firm Hindenburg Research said the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">misled consumers and investors</a> about Endurance&#8217;s preorders.</p>
<p>But Tuesday is a &#8220;new day&#8221; for the automaker-gone-SPAC, says Strand. Schmidt revealed the company has enough orders for limited production of the Endurance for 2021 and 2022, calling those orders &#8220;firm&#8221; and &#8220;binding.&#8221; The work truck will start at $55,000, he said. To compare, the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, another truck aimed at commercial customers, will start below $40,000.</p>
<p>Schmidt said the company has $400 million in the bank, but would need more to increase its ability to build more than 20,000 vehicles per year. Lordstown is actively seeking additional capital from GM, which owns a small stake in the startup, and other early investors. In a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lordstown-motors-orders/lordstown-has-binding-orders-for-first-two-years-of-production-president-idUSKCN2DR22V">statement to Reuters</a>, GM said, &#8220;we are comfortable with our current relationship with LMC but we are willing to listen to proposals that make sense for both parties.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As so-called neobanks continue to gain more traction in the market with their more modern takes on banking and other financial services, a startup that&#8217;s building technology to help incumbent players better compete is announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.10xbanking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x Future Technologies</a>, a London-based fintech that helps larger, established banks build both next-generation services as well as tools to help their older services work more efficiently, has raised $187 million. We understand from sources close to the company that 10x&#8217;s valuation with this round is in the range of $700 million.</p>
<p>(The amount raised and valuation also roughly line up with the figures from Sky News, which reported earlier this month that 10x was raising new funding.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>10x will be using the funds both to expand into new geographies like North America, as well as to continue building more technology for its flagship platform. <a href="https://www.10xbanking.com/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuperCore</a>, as that platform is called, is an all-in-one system built from scratch to run a wide range of banking services such as payments, core banking, mortgages, analytics, security and marketing, which 10x&#8217;s bank customers can integrate into their existing tech by way of APIs, or 10x can use to build those clients new services from the ground up.</p>

<p>This Series C round is full of heavy hitters that speak to the credibility 10x has picked up in its five years in the market.</p>
<p>Co-led by BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), it also includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/10x-founded-by-the-ex-ceo-of-barclays-raises-46m-to-take-on-ancient-banking-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing investors</a> JPMorgan Chase, Nationwide, Ping An and Australia&#8217;s Westpac.</p>
<p>The latter four include strategic backers: Antony Jenkins, the founder and CEO of 10x who himself used to work at big banks (his last role was CEO of Barclays, and although he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left under a cloud</a>, his prominence and track record are likely reasons for the company&#8217;s clout), tells us that 10x is currently building services for Westpac and Nationwide.</p>
<p>10x has two other banks as customers that it is not disclosing yet, which will be leading to more soon, Jenkins added, since the industry is &#8220;at a transitional moment&#8221; right now. Some of 10x&#8217;s engagements are already live, with &#8220;volume going over the platform,&#8221; he said. Others have yet to launch.</p>
<p>The opportunity that 10x is targeting is big, but also elusive.</p>
<p>Neobanks and other new-generation fintech providers are slowly chipping away at incumbent banks&#8217; stronghold on consumer and business banking. They are typically doing this not by becoming fully fledged banks themselves, but by stitching together suites of traditional and more modern banking services by way of APIs from other fintechs; machine learning algorithms to personalise services to customers; and modern interfaces to make the whole experience more user-friendly than what you might get from a traditional bank.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=ZJrkURj76t" data-secret="ZJrkURj76t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Incumbent banks want to compete against these new upstarts with rival products of their own, but in many cases they can&#8217;t: their infrastructure is too old, and oftentimes the company culture is even older.</p>
<p>This is where 10x comes in, providing the tools and advice to help them get new services up and running.</p>
<p>Jenkins notes that currently, a lot of the engagements 10x is seeing involve banks bolting on completely new services rather than building services to replace those they already offer. One fitting analogy here is that it&#8217;s a little like putting a modern extension on a very old house, rather than remodelling and modernizing the whole of the old house from the ground up.</p>
<p>But, it seems that we are now, five years into 10x&#8217;s life as a business, starting to see the first signs of banks willing to explore how to migrate their core data to more modern systems to make it more extensible and usable in a wider range of new services, and 10x believes it can be a partner in that back-end transformation, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legacy systems are where banks&#8217; issues sit, because they are all architected around product, not customers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we believe that the industry is ready to contemplate the process of migration now.&#8221; The company is not yet working on any projects of this kind, he added, but it expects to in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>And even with other fintech startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/fintechos-nabs-61-5m-for-a-low-code-approach-to-modernizing-legacy-banking-and-insurance-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, also building services aimed at helping incumbent banks be more modern, that expectation spells opportunity for investors.</p>

<p>“We have been impressed with 10x’s strategy and ambition to play a key role at the heart transformations taking place in financial services, driven by technology innovation, consumer expectations and regulatory reform,&#8221; said William Abecassis, BlackRock&#8217;s head of Innovation Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be investing in the business as it scales into new markets.”</p>
<p>Leon Pedersen, MD and head of Thematic Investing, CPP Investments added: “10x is very well placed to change how big banks are built and deliver for their customers. 10x presents an attractive opportunity for a long-term investor like CPP Investments as we believe they will benefit from their exposure to the structural growth trend of financial institutions investing in digital initiatives and renewing core technology infrastructure, allowing banks to introduce new offerings and products much faster than using legacy platforms.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration is outlining new plans to combat domestic terrorism in light of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and social media companies have their own part to play.</p>
<p>The White House released on Tuesday a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf">national strategy on countering domestic terrorism</a>. The plan acknowledges the key role that online platforms play in bringing violent ideas into the mainstream, going as far as calling social media sites the &#8220;front lines&#8221; of the war on domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The widespread availability of domestic terrorist recruitment material online is a national security threat whose front lines are overwhelmingly private-sector online platforms, and we are committed to informing more effectively the escalating efforts by those platforms to secure those front lines,&#8221; the White House plan states.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Biden administration committed to more information sharing with the tech sector to fight the tide of online extremism, part of a push to intervene well before extremists can organize violence. According to a fact sheet on the new domestic terror plan, the U.S. government will prioritize &#8220;increased information sharing with the technology sector,&#8221; specifically online platforms where extremism is incubated and organized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuing to enhance the domestic terrorism-related information offered to the private sector, especially the technology sector, will facilitate more robust efforts outside the government to counter terrorists’ abuse of Internet-based communications platforms to recruit others to engage in violence,&#8221; the White House plan states.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Threat of inauguration violence casts a long shadow over social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/capitol-attack-social-media-inauguration-day/embed/#?secret=eeDxlInxsz" data-secret="eeDxlInxsz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/politics/white-house-strategy-domestic-terrorism/index.html">remarks</a> timed with the release of the domestic terror strategy, Attorney General Merrick Garland asserted that coordinating with the tech sector is &#8220;particularly important&#8221; for interrupting extremists who organize and recruit on online platforms and emphasized plans to share enhanced information on potential domestic terror threats.</p>
<p>In spite of the new initiatives, the Biden administration admits that domestic terrorism recruitment material will inevitably remain available online, particularly on platforms that don&#8217;t prioritize its removal — like most social media platforms, prior to January 2021 — and on end-to-end encrypted apps, many of which saw an influx of users when social media companies cracked down on extremism in the U.S. earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dealing with the supply is therefore necessary but not sufficient: we must address the demand too,&#8221; the White House plan states. &#8220;Today’s digital age requires an American population that can utilize essential aspects of Internet-based communications platforms while avoiding vulnerability to domestic terrorist recruitment and other harmful content.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Biden administration will also address vulnerability to online extremism through digital literacy programs, including &#8220;educational materials&#8221; and &#8220;skills-enhancing online games&#8221; designed to inoculate Americans against domestic extremism recruitment efforts, and presumably disinformation and misinformation more broadly.</p>
<p>The plan stops short of naming domestic terror elements like QAnon and the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement specifically, though it acknowledges the range of ways domestic terror can manifest, from small informal groups to organized militias.</p>
<p>A report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in March <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2194-unclassified-summary-of-assessment-on-domestic-violent-extremism">observed</a> the elevated threat to the U.S. that domestic terrorism poses in 2021, noting that domestic extremists leverage mainstream social media sites to recruit new members, organize in-person events and share materials that can lead to violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How big is the market in India for a neobank aimed at teenagers? Scores of high-profile investors are backing a startup to find out.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://fampay.in">FamPay</a> said on Wednesday it has raised $38 million in its Series A round led by Elevation Capital. General Catalyst, Rocketship VC, Greenoaks Capital and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital and Venture Highway also participated in the new round, which brings FamPay&#8217;s to-date raise to $42.7 million.</p>
<p>The size of the new investment makes it one of the largest Series A rounds in India. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> early this month that FamPay was in talks with Elevation Capital to raise a new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/_SambhavJain_">Sambhav Jain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamkushtaneja">Kush Taneja</a> (pictured above) &#8212; both of whom graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2019 &#8212; FamPay enables teenagers to make online and offline payments.</p>
<p>The thesis behind the startup, said Jain in an interview with TechCrunch, is to provide financial literacy to teenagers, who additionally have limited options to open a bank account in India at a young age. Through gamification, the startup said it’s making lessons about money fun for youngsters.</p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., where it’s common for teenagers to get jobs at restaurants and other places and understand how to handle money at a young age, a similar tradition doesn’t exist in India.</p>
<p>After gathering the consent from parents, FamPay provides teenagers with an app to make online purchases, as well as plastic cards &#8212; the only numberless card of its kind in the country &#8212; for offline transactions. Parents credit money to their children’s FamPay accounts and get to keep track of high-ticket spendings.</p>
<p>In other markets, including the U.S., a number of startups including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/">Till Financial</a> are chasing to serve the teenagers, but in India, there currently is no startup looking to solve the financial access problem for teenagers, said Mridul Arora, a partner at Elevation Capital, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It could prove to be a good issue to solve &#8212; India has the largest adolescent population in the world.</p>
<p>“If you’re able to serve them at a young age, over a course of time, you stand to become their go-to product for a lot of things,” Arora said. “FamPay is serving a population that is very attractive and at the same time underserved.”</p>
<p>The current offerings of FamPay are just the beginning, said Jain. Eventually the startup wishes to provide a range of services and serve as a neobank for youngsters to retain them with the platform forever, he said, though he didn’t wish to share currently what those services might be.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166644" style="width: 612px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166644" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166644 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg?w=602" alt="" width="602" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg?resize=265,300 265w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg?resize=768,868 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg?resize=602,680 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fampay-product.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166644" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FamPay</p></div></p>
<p>Teens represent the “most tech-savvy generation, as they haven’t seen a world without the internet,” he said. “They adapt to technology faster than any other target audience and their first exposure with the internet comes from the likes of Instagram and Netflix. This leads to higher expectations from the products that they prefer to use. We are unique in approaching banking from a whole new lens with our recipe of community and gamification to match the Gen Z vibe.”</p>
<p>“I don’t look at FamPay just as a payments service. If the team is able to execute this, FamPay can become a very powerful gateway product to teenagers in India and their financial life. It can become a neobank, and it also has the opportunity to do something around social, community and commerce,” said Arora.</p>
<p>During their college life, Jain and Taneja collaborated and built an app and worked at a number of startups, including social network ShareChat, logistics firm Rivigo and video streaming service Hotstar. Jain said their work with startups in the early days paved the idea to explore a future in this ecosystem.</p>
<p>Prior to arriving at FamPay, Jain said the duo had thought about several more ideas for a startup. The early days of FamPay were uniquely challenging to the founders, who had to convince their parents about their decision to do a startup rather than joining firms or startups as had most of their peers from college. Until being selected by Y Combinator, Jain said he didn’t even fully understand a cap table and dilutions.</p>
<p>He credited entrepreneurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11">Kunal Shah</a> (founder of CRED) and <a href="https://twitter.com/amrishrau">Amrish Rau</a> (CEO of Pine Labs) for being generous with their time and guidance. They also wrote some of the earliest checks to the startup.</p>
<p>The startup, which has amassed over 2 million registered users, plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its user base and product offerings, and hire engineers. It is also looking for people to join its leadership team, said Jain.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“If you’re not going to an Ivy League, which is most of the world, you need better support than just going to a website.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.applyboard.com/">ApplyBoard</a>, a startup that helps international students find opportunities to study abroad, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210615005210/en/ApplyBoard-Announces-C375M-Investment-Round-with-a-Valuation-of-C4B-to-Meet-Expanding-International-Student-Demand">announced</a> today that it has nearly doubled its valuation in a little over a year. The Ontario-based company is now worth around $3.2 billion after raising a $300 million Series D round led by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Startups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>ApplyBoard makes money from revenue-sharing agreements with colleges and universities. If a student attends a college after using their services, ApplyBoard receives a cut of the tuition. Meanwhile, the service, which helps students search and apply to schools, is free to use.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbasiri?originalSubdomain=ca">Martin Basiri</a> did not share specifics on revenue, but he confirmed that his company is growing its sales at a 400% year-over-year rate in 2021. For context, sales in 2019 hit $300 million, meaning that ApplyBoard is making at least $1.2 billion in sales this year.</p>
<p>These figures violate the prevailing edtech narrative from last year: <em>Higher ed is dead! Students don’t want to attend college anymore. Bring back the gap year, but make it permanent! </em></p>
<p>Instead, this company is proving that the university tech stack is more lucrative than many assumed, especially if you look beyond content offerings and into back-end marketing support.</p>
<p>My take: Startups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8220;Students want a seamless and pain-free application process&#8221;</strong></h2>
<p>ApplyBoard’s recent fundraising efforts shed a light on its strategy to become, effectively, a tech-savvy guidance counselor for the approximately 200,000 students that it has served to date.</p>
<p>The company raised a $55 million extension round in September to bring on a partner, Education Testing Services (ETS) Strategy Capital, the venture arm of the world’s largest nonprofit education testing and assessment organization. ETS helps administer the TOEFL English-language proficiency test and the GRE graduate admissions test.</p>
<p>The synergies there led ApplyBoard to launch ApplyProof, a service that helps admissions and immigrant officers verify documents that international students need to apply to colleges around the world. Today’s financing event similarly brings in a strategic investor, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.</p>
<p>“The demand remains high post-pandemic and we continue to see a strong, pent-up demand from students wishing to study abroad,” Basiri said. “Students want a seamless and pain-free application process and be able to have all the information they need to make an informed decision.”</p>

<h2>How to identify unicorn founders when they’re still early-stage</h2>
<p>What are investors looking for?</p>
<p>Founders often tie themselves in knots as they try to project qualities they hope investors are seeking. In reality, few entrepreneurs have the acting skills required to convince someone that they&#8217;re patient, dedicated or hard working.</p>
<p>Johan Brenner, general partner at Creandum, was an early backer of Klarna, Spotify and several other European startups. Over the last two decades, he&#8217;s identified five key traits shared by people who create billion-dollar companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;A true unicorn founder doesn’t need to have all of those capabilities on day one,&#8221; says Brenner, &#8220;but they should already be thinking big while executing small and demonstrating that they understand how to scale a company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scale co-founder and CEO Alex Wang joined us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> this week to discuss his company&#8217;s role in the autonomous driving industry and how it&#8217;s changed in the five years since its founding. Scale helps large and small AV players establish reliable &#8220;ground truth&#8221; through data annotation and management, and along the way, the standards for what that means have shifted as the industry matures.</p>
<h2>Good data is the &#8220;good bones&#8221; of autonomous driving systems</h2>
<p>Even if two algorithms in autonomous driving might be created more or less equal, their real-world performance could vary dramatically based on what they&#8217;re consuming in terms of input data. That&#8217;s where Scale&#8217;s value prop to the industry starts, and Wang explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think about a traditional software system, the thing that will separate a good software system from a bad software system is the code, the quality of the code. For an AI system, which all of these self-driving vehicles or autonomous vehicles are, it&#8217;s the data that really separates an amazing algorithm from a bad algorithm. And so one thing we saw was that being one of the stewards and shepherds of high-quality data was going to be incredibly important for the industry, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s played out. We work with many of the great companies in the space, from Aurora to Nuro to Toyota to General Motors, and our work with all of them is ensuring that they have really a solid data foundation, so they can build the rest of their stacks on top of it. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 06:24)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Location-based services may have had their day as a salient category for hot apps or innovative tech leveraging the arrival of smartphones, but that&#8217;s largely because they are now part of the unspoken fabric of how we interact with digital services every day: We rely on location-specific information when we are on search engines, when we are using maps or weather apps, when we are taking and posting photos and more.</p>
<p>Still, there remain a lot of gaps in how location information links up with accurate information, and so today a company that&#8217;s made it its business to address that is announcing some funding as it scales up its service.</p>
<p><a href="https://uberall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uberall</a>, which works with retailers and other brick-and-mortar operators to help them update and provide more accurate information about themselves across the plethora of apps and other services that consumers use to discover them, is announcing $115 million in funding. Alongside that, the Berlin startup is making an acquisition: it&#8217;s buying <a href="https://momentfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MomentFeed</a>, a location marketing company based out of Los Angeles, to continue scaling its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by London-based investor Bregal Milestone, with Level Equity, United Internet and Uberall management also participating. From what we understand from sources, the funding values Uberall at around $500 million, and the deal for MomentFeed was made for between $50 million and $60 million.</p>
<p>The business combination is building way more scale into the platform: Uberall said that together they will manage the online presence for 1.35 million business locations, making the company the biggest in the field, with customers including the gas station operator BP, KFC, clothes and food chain Marks and Spencer, McDonald&#8217;s and Pizza Hut.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Florian Hübner, the CEO and co-founder of Uberall, noted in an interview that the companies have <a href="https://uberall.com/en-us/products/uberall-vs-momentfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite a lot of overlap</a>, and in fact prior to the deal being made the companies worked together closely in the U.S. market, but all the same, MomentFeed has built some specific technology that will enrich the wider platform, such as a particularly strong tool for measuring sentiment analysis.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Managing the online presence&#8221; is not a company&#8217;s website, nor is it its apps, but may nevertheless be its most common digital touchpoints when it comes to actually engaging with consumers online. It includes how those companies appear on local listings services like Yelp or TripAdvisor, or mapping apps like Google&#8217;s &#8212; which provide not just listings information like addresses and opening hours but also customer reviews &#8212; or social apps or location-based advertising. Altogether, when you are considering a company with multiple locations and the multiple touchpoints a consumer might use, it ends up being a complicated mess of places that need to be managed and kept up to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the catalyst for this huge ecosystem where we enable the brands to use everything that the other tech platforms are offering in the best possible way,&#8221; Hübner told me. The tech platforms, meanwhile, are willing to work with middleware companies like Uberall to make the information on their services more accurate and complete by connecting with businesses when they have not managed to do so directly on their own. (And if you&#8217;ve ever been caught out by the wrong opening times on a Google Maps entry, or any other entry or piece of information elsewhere, you know this is an issue.)</p>
<p>And of course expecting any company with potentially hundreds of locations to provide the right details without a tool is also a nonstarter. &#8220;Casually updating 100,000 profiles is super hard,&#8221; Hübner said.</p>
<p>It also provides services to update information about vaccine and COVID-19 testing clinics, as well as other essential services that also have to contend with the same variations in location, opening hours and customer feedback as any other business on a site like Google Maps.</p>

<p>Altogether, Uberall has built out a platform that essentially connects up all of those end points, so that an Uberall customer can use a dashboard to provide updates that populate automatically everywhere, and also to read and respond to reviews.</p>
<p>Conversely, Uberall also can look out for instances where a company is being unofficially represented, or misrepresented, and locks those down. Alongside those, it has built a location-based marketing service that also serves ads for its customers. It is somewhat akin to social media management tools, which let you manage social media accounts and social media marketing campaigns, except that it&#8217;s covering a much more fragmented and disparate set of places where a company might appear online.</p>
<p>The bigger picture here is that just as location-based marketing is a fragmented business, so is the business of providing services to manage it. This move reduces down that field a little more and improves the efficiency of scaling such services.</p>
<p>“As we saw the market trending towards consolidation, we considered several potential companies to merge with. Uberall was by far our most preferred,” said MomentFeed CEO Nick Hedges in a statement. “This combination makes enormous strategic sense for our customers, who represent the who’s-who of leading U.S. omni channel brands. It helps accelerate our already rapid pace of innovation, giving customers an even greater edge in the hyper-competitive world of ’Near Me’ Marketing.” After the deal closes, Hedges will become Uberall&#8217;s chief strategy officer and EVP for North America.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with the Uberall team for this next phase of growth. Our strategic investment will significantly accelerate Uberall’s ambition to become the leading ‘Near Me’ Customer Experience platform worldwide. Uberall’s differentiated full-suite solution is unsurpassed by competition in terms of integration and functionality, providing customers with a real edge to reach, interact with, and convert online customers. We look forward to supporting Florian, Nick and their talented team to deliver on their exciting innovation and expansion roadmap,” said Cyrus Shey, managing partner of Bregal Milestone, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What, exactly, are investors looking for?</p>
<p>Early-stage founders, usually first-timers, often tie themselves in knots as they try to project the qualities they hope investors are seeking. In reality, few entrepreneurs have the acting skills required to convince someone that they&#8217;re patient, dedicated or hard working.</p>
<p>Johan Brenner, general partner at Creandum, was an early backer of Klarna, Spotify and several other European startups. Over the last two decades, he&#8217;s identified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/how-to-identify-unicorn-founders-when-theyre-still-early-stage/">five key traits shared by people who create billion-dollar companies</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;A true unicorn founder doesn’t need to have all of those capabilities on day one,&#8221; says Brenner, &#8220;but they should already be thinking big while executing small and demonstrating that they understand how to scale a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawing from observations gleaned from working with founders like Spotify&#8217;s Daniel Ek, Sebastian Siemiatkowski from Klarna, and iZettle&#8217;s Jacob de Geer and Magnus Nilsson, Brenner explains where &#8220;VC FOMO&#8221; comes from and how it drives deal-making.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re running a series of posts that recap conversations from last week&#8217;s virtual TC Mobility conference, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/refraction-ais-matthew-johnson-roberson-on-finding-the-middle-path-to-robotic-delivery/">an interview with Refraction AI&#8217;s Matthew Johnson</a>, a look at how autonomous delivery startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/how-autonomous-delivery-startups-are-navigating-policy-partnerships-and-post-pandemic-operations/">navigating the regulatory and competitive landscape</a>, and much more.

<p>Founded in 2013 and based in São Paulo, Brazil, Nubank serves more than 34 million customers, making it Latin America&#8217;s largest neobank.</p>
<p>Reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcemccarthy">Marcella McCarthy</a> spoke to CEO David Velez to learn about his efforts to connect with consumers and overcome entrenched opposition from established players who were friendly with regulators.</p>
<p>In the first of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">a series of stories for Nubank&#8217;s EC-1</a>, she interviewed Velez about his early fundraising efforts. For a balanced perspective, she also spoke to early Nubank investors at Sequoia and Kaszek Ventures, Latin America&#8217;s largest venture fund, to find out why they funded the startup while it was still pre-product.</p>
<p>“There are people you come across in life that within the first hour of meeting with them, you know you want to work with them,” said Doug Leone, a global managing partner at Sequoia who&#8217;d recruited Velez after he graduated from grad school at Stanford.</p>
<p>Marcella also interviewed members of Nubank&#8217;s founding team to better understand why they decided to take a chance on a startup that faced such long odds of success.</p>
<p>“I left banking to make a fifth of my salary, and back then, about $5,000 in equity,” said Vitor Olivier, Nubank&#8217;s VP of operations and platforms.</p>
<p>“Financially, it didn’t really make sense, so I really had to believe that it was really going to work, and that it would be big.”</p>

<p>In his last dispatch before a week&#8217;s vacation, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> waded through the numbers in Didi&#8217;s SEC filing. The big takeaways?</p>
<p>&#8220;While Didi managed an impressive GTV recovery in China, its aggregate numbers are flatter, and recent quarterly trends are not incredibly attractive,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>However, &#8220;Didi is not as unprofitable as we might have anticipated. That’s a nice surprise. But the company’s regular business has never made money, and it’s losing more lately than historically, which is also pretty rough.&#8221;</p>

<p>AutoX, Momenta and WeRide took the stage at TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 to discuss the state of robotaxi startups in China and their relationships with local governments in the country.</p>
<p>They also talked about overseas expansion — a common trajectory for China’s top autonomous vehicle startups — and shed light on the challenges and opportunities for foreign AV companies eyeing the massive Chinese market.</p>

<p>&#8220;As in any disruptive industry, the forecast may be cloudier than the rosy picture painted by passionate founders and investors,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/breadfrom">Aria Alamalhodaei</a> writes. &#8220;A quick peek at comments and posts on LinkedIn reveals squabbles among industry insiders and analysts about when this emerging technology will truly take off and which companies will come out ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while some electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) companies have no revenue yet to speak of — and may not for the foreseeable future — valuations are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electric air mobility is gaining elevation,&#8221; she writes. &#8220;But there’s going to be some turbulence ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though some may say the doomsday clock is ticking toward catastrophe for digital marketing, Apple&#8217;s iOS 14.5 update, which does away with automatic opt-ins for data collection, and Google&#8217;s plan to phase out third-party cookies do not signal a death knell for digital advertisers.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a few changes to short-term strategy — and a longer-term plan that takes into account the fact that people are awakening to the value of their online data — advertisers can form a new type of relationship with consumers,&#8221; Permission.io CTO Hunter Jensen writes in a guest column. &#8220;It can be built upon trust and open exchange of value.&#8221;</p>
<p>If offered the right incentives, Jensen predicts, &#8220;consumers will happily consent to data collection because advertisers will be offering them something they value in return.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pony.ai, the robotaxi startup that operates in China and the United States, has started testing driverless vehicles on public roads in California ahead of plans to launch a commercial service there in 2022.</p>
<p>The company said the driverless vehicle testing, which means the autonomous vehicles operate without human safety drivers behind the wheel, is happening daily on public roads in Fremont and Milpitas, California. Pony.ai is also testing its driverless vehicles in Guangzhou, China.</p>
<p>Pony.ai said it also plans to resume a rideshare service to the public in Irvine this summer using AVs with a human safety driver. Its goal is to roll out the fully driverless service to the public in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Going completely driverless is key to achieving full autonomy and an indispensable catalyst to realizing our ambitious vision,&#8221; said James Peng, CEO and co-founder of Pony.ai.</p>
<p>Pony.ai still has some regulatory hurdles to clear before it can operate commercially. Autonomous vehicle companies that want to charge the public for driverless rides need both the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission to issue deployment permits. In early June, Cruise became the first company to receive a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">driverless autonomous service permit</a> from the California PUC that allows it to test transporting passengers. The final step with the DMV, which only Nuro has achieved, is a deployment permit.</p>
<p>Pony&#8217;s driverless testing milestone in California comes a month after the state issued the company a permit to test a fleet of six driverless vehicles in a geographic area that spans about 39 square miles. While dozens of companies &#8212; <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/">55 in all</a> &#8212; have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it is less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Pony was the eighth company to be issued a driverless testing permit in the state, a list that includes Chinese companies AutoX, Baidu and WeRide, as well as U.S. businesses Cruise, Nuro, Waymo and Zoox. Only Nuro has been granted a so-called deployment permit, which allows it to operate commercially.</p>

<p>Pony.ai, which was founded in 2016 by former Baidu developers Peng and Lou Tiancheng, has been allowed to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2017.  The driverless permit issued in May by the California DMV expanded upon Pony&#8217;s existing activity in the state.</p>
<p>Pony has tested ridesharing in Fremont and Irvine, California. In 2019, a fleet of electric, autonomous Hyundai Kona crossovers equipped with a self-driving system from Pony.ai and Via&#8217;s ride-hailing platform began shuttling customers on public roads. The robotaxi service, called BotRide, wasn&#8217;t a driverless service, as there was a human safety driver behind the wheel at all times. The BotRide pilot concluded in January 2020.</p>
<p>The company then started operating a public robotaxi service called PonyPilot in the Irvine area. Pony shifted that robotaxi service from shuttling people to packages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pony.ai also partnered with e-commerce platform Yamibuy to provide autonomous last-mile delivery service to customers in Irvine. The delivery service was launched to provide additional capacity to address the surge of online orders triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pony.ai said at the time.</p>
<p>As the pandemic eases and California returns to normal operations, Pony is preparing to launch a commercial robotaxi service. It has already amassed a number of partners and more than $1 billion in funding, including $400 million from Toyota, to help it achieve that goal. Last November, the company said its valuation had reached $5.3 billion following a fresh injection of $267 million in funding. Pony has several partnerships or collaborations with automakers and suppliers, including Bosch, Hyundai and Toyota.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health startup Ksana Health has received $2 million in seed funding led by re:Mind Capital, the mental health VC arm of Christian Angermayer and Apeiron Investment Group. It’s a move informed by two trends: passive data collection, and a burgeoning mental health crisis in teens and young adults. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ksana Health is an Oregon-based company founded two years ago by University of Oregon Professor </span><a href="https://psychology.uoregon.edu/profile/nallen3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas Allen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a clinical psychologist and director of the Center for Digital Mental Health. Ksana&#8217;s platforms focus on collecting data related to mental health, and transfer that data from user to healthcare practitioners through an app. It&#8217;s, in essence, a mobile therapy app with a highly detailed dashboard of patient information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has 12 employees, and other investors in the round include WPSS Investments, Panoramic Ventures, the Telosity Fund, Palo Santo Venture Fund and Able Partners. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Ksana Health has one live product called the Effortless Assessment Research System (EARS), which is designed for institutions conducting clinical research. Participants in clinical trials can download an app and opt-in to sharing with the trial’s investigators data, including movement, location (via GPS), keystrokes and patterns in written language content (no specific messages are shared). The app’s connection also goes two ways: trial administrators can send out things like surveys to keep in touch with participants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EARS product, says Allen, has already generated about $900,000 in revenue based on usage in clinical trials, but this most recent round of funding is geared toward another product called Vira, aimed at consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vira will also passively collect data like exercise (via an accelerometer), screen time, keystrokes or location-based data via a smartphone or smart device. Screenshots from Vira&#8217;s dashboard also include sleep data, though that&#8217;s not specifically listed as a recorded variable on the <a href="https://ksanahealth.com/vira">company&#8217;s website at the moment</a>. Instead of funneling that data to a clinical trial, the data will be accessible to a patient’s therapist. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What happens to edtech when kids go back to school?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/what-happens-to-edtech-when-kids-go-back-to-school/embed/#?secret=dZj5msJwFb" data-secret="dZj5msJwFb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user would give a therapist a personalized code that allows them to access data collected on their phone. Then, a therapist might discuss those habits, and program behavioral nudges to pop up on a phone during the day, reminding the user to exercise, or wind down before bed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically what this system does is it allows some of the data that&#8217;s been collected by the way people use their cell phones in a day to day fashion [to be turned] into indicators of important health behaviors that we know are relevant to mental health &#8212; so things like sleep, physical activity, geographic mobility, mood, cognition, social connection,” Allen says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vira is a major force of forward momentum for Ksana Health. The company was also selected as part of the insurance company Anthem Inc.’s, </span><a href="https://www.thinkanthem.com/uncategorized/anthems-digital-incubator-supports-entrepreneurs-growth-through-collaboration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Incubator program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That inclusion allows Vira to be trialed within Beacon Health Options, a behavioral health company with 37 million members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vira has yet to launch, but the key audience, says Allen, is people 13 to 30 years old. Rates of mental health issues within this group have increased (even before the pandemic). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/abn-abn0000410.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abnormal Psychology&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the rate of young adults (18 to 25) reporting signs of major depression jumped 63% (from 7.7 to 13.1%) between 2009 and 2017. Meanwhile, there was no significant increase in the percentage of older adults experiencing mental distress or depression in that study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer Vira seems to offer is extremely detailed data on well-being that will be funneled to a therapist. Data collection in the mental health space isn’t unheard of &#8212; some AI-based mental health chatbots do indeed analyze user conversations, but those conversations happen within the confines of an app. Vira, conversely, is capable of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">collecting data on a variety of variables that are passively trackable by a phone, and have some bearing on mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critically, there are no clinical trials of Vira itself right now, but the concept of the app is based on research that verifies each one of its individual parts. For instance, there is evidence that </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/11203"><span style="font-weight: 400;">la</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nguage used on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can predict mood disorders, and that lack of sleep (or in some cases, excessive sleep) is linked to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005791617300629?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety and depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some sense, Ksana Health is somewhat reminiscent of a cadre of software betting that improving mental health is partially a factor of increased vigilance of digital life, particularly among teens. AI-based software like GoGuardian for instance, has been used in school to record students keystrokes or search histories in an attempt to head off student suicides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoGuardian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/student-suicides-nevada-coronavirus.html">was used</a> in Clark County in Nevada, home to the fifth largest school district in the country, and flagged 3,100 potential signs of self-harm between June and October 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/risks-and-rewards-of-digital-therapeutics-in-treating-mental-disorders/</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like GoGuardian, Ksana Health also catalogs digital activity as an indicator of mental health (note the inclusion of key strokes and language patterns, not just health variables like exercise), but Ksana Health’s focus also appears to be less on flagging harmful behavior automatically, and more about providing an extremely detailed data dashboard to a human therapist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus initially is to keep, for want of a better term, a human in the loop,” says Allen. Ksana Health also isn’t AI-based, so it may be harder to scale, but Allen sees this as a benefit, not a liability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re focused on embedding this within practitioners,” he says. “There&#8217;s obvious appeal to the scale of a fully automated solution, you know you can scale it up very quickly. But I think the problems with safety are very significant in those systems.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comprehensive array of data, but particularly the language component, says Jan Hardorp, a founding partner at re:Mind Capital, is one aspect that attracted the firm to Ksana Health. Hardorp will also have a seat on Ksana Health’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that language is very strong and variable, and then combined with other sensors, is a very good technological basis in order to assess and predict mental state and depression,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move fits within re:Mind’s somewhat unconventional approaches to mental health: Angermayer held a 22% stake in Compass Pathways, a company pursuing psychedelics as a fast-acting treatment for depression. That stake was worth about </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/a-bet-on-magic-mushrooms-made-one-investor-316-million-richer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$316 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the company’s September 2020 IPO. Angermayer’s other public investments span from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/billionaire-took-psychedelics-got-bitcoin-and-is-now-into-spacs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies to cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardorp says that overall, re:Mind’s activities are focused on one-third novel treatments (like psychedelics), one-third brain computer interfaces and one-third technology. Ksana Health fits squarely in that third category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen says the company is already planning clinical trials of the Vira program in addition to the pilot program with Beacon Health. But Hardorp notes that so far, the lack of clinical trials on Vira itself hasn’t given him pause. He takes the strength of the EARS platform as a signal that Ksana Health’s platform is viable in the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re quite confident that it’s really the same technology. The Vira product, if you want, is really a new front-end to existing technology and algorithms,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, the Vira platform isn’t commercially available, but Allen is anticipating a launch in the first quarter of 2022. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV sales are driving demand for services and startups that fulfill the new needs of drivers, charging station operators and others. Evette Ellis and Ben Schippers took to the main stage at TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 to share how their companies capitalize off the new opportunities presented by the electric transportation revolution.</p>
<p>Ellis is the co-founder and chief workforce officer of ChargerHelp, an on-demand EV charging station repair company. She spoke about how the company approaches hiring and training, why it engages with workforce development centers, and how training in cohorts makes economic sense. Farther down, we&#8217;ll hear from Schippers, the founder of TezLab.</p>
<h2>Why the company works with workforce development centers</h2>
<p>Workforce development is a government-run and -funded system to connect job seekers with employers, training and career development. There are thousands of job centers across the country, coordinated by the U.S. Department of Labor, that serve millions of Americans. Evette described why she and co-founder Kameale Terry wanted to engage with workforce development from the beginning.</p>

<blockquote><p>We really, really wanted to pioneer this idea that you can work with a workforce development center, who our federal government pays lots of money to train and do all the things that you need to get a great talent source, to create that pipeline, to use those pipelines for industries outside of construction or entry-level medical, but also for tech. Tech is the biggest industry in our country and it&#8217;s really running the show right now. We wanted to make sure that underrepresented communities didn’t get left out of this shift that is clearly happening. <strong>(Timestamp: 13:54)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscribers of MTN, the largest telecom provider in Nigeria, may soon face service disruption in the West African nation, according to a notice seen by some journalists and outlets. </span></p>
<p>A rise in insecurity challenges in Nigeria is likely to disrupt MTN&#8217;s service, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/mtn-nigeria-comm-security/update-1-mtn-warns-of-service-disruption-in-nigeria-due-to-rising-insecurity-idUSL2N2NX0XR">Reuters</a> and others said, citing an alert from customer service reps. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout this year, Nigerians have had to battle kidnappings, clashes between farmers and herders, mass abductions of students and armed robberies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we must inform you that with the rising insecurity in different parts of Nigeria, service delivery to your organization may </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the coming days. This means that in some cases, our technical support team may not be able to get to your site and achieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turnaround time in fault management as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as possible,” MTN <a href="https://twitter.com/MuvunyiF/status/1404781767802998787">reportedly</a> said in the message. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MTN didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When MTN Nigeria published its financial report for Q1 2021, it showed strong growth as data revenue grew by 43% year-on-year to N106 billion ($257 million), contributing to 28% of its total revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data revenue growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was propelled by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 21% year-on-year jump in active data subscribers to 32.5 million and a 27% year-on-year increase in smartphone penetration to 36.3 million. These numbers reflect MTN&#8217;s dominance in Nigeria. Per data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecom operator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is responsible for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 43% of Nigeria&#8217;s internet subscribers and 38% of the country&#8217;s mobile subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most network providers in the country, MTN&#8217;s services have been a tale of two experiences: good and subpar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nigerians who spoke with TechCrunch have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the latter these past few weeks following the government&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">decision to ban Twitter</a> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fears of internet restriction.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TAESmeojNH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/embed/#?secret=TAESmeojNH" data-secret="TAESmeojNH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports from <a href="https://punchng.com/telecoms-services-face-disruption-as-workers-threaten-strike/">local media</a> seem to corroborate Reuters, albeit for a different reason: a union&#8217;s nationwide strike against all network providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union PTECSSAN (Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria), which comprises senior telecommunications staff in the country, announced that it would be embarking on a three-day industrial strike starting Wednesday to protest the &#8220;arbitrary sack of workers and casualisation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PTECSSAN accused telecommunications companies in Nigeria for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. First, breaching freedom of association and right of workers to organise; victimisation of union members; and poor and discriminatory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remuneration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also claimed that telecom operators abused expatriate quotas, practiced intimidation, and have harassed and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">verbally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assaulted employees, among other anti-labour practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several MTN customer care agents TechCrunch reached out to were either unaware or refuted the aforementioned message. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have such network glitches,&#8221; one said. &#8220;Kindly be aware that we don&#8217;t have any information on any service disruption in the coming days. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have any information about that, we&#8217;ll let our customers know via messages as soon as possible,&#8221; another agent responded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As an early-stage VC, you spend time with hundreds of fantastic startups, trying to identify potential winners by thinking about market size, business model and competition. Nevertheless, deep down you know that in the long run, it all comes down to the team and the founder(s).</p>
<p>When we look at the most successful companies in our portfolio, their amazing performance is in large part thanks to the founders. However, even after 20 years in the industry, I have to admit that analyzing the team is still the most challenging part of the job. How do you evaluate a young first-time entrepreneur of an early-stage company with little traction?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The best founders are humble and well aware of their weaknesses and limitations as well as the potential challenges for their startup.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a>, in the past 18 years, we have been fortunate to work with some of Europe’s most successful startup founders such as Daniel Ek from Spotify, Sebastian Siemiatkowski from Klarna, Johannes Schildt from Kry, Jacob de Geer and Magnus Nilsson from iZettle, Emil Eifrem from Neo4J, Christian Hecker from Trade Republic and many more.</p>
<p>After a while, we realized that these incredible entrepreneurs all share some fundamental characteristics. They all have lots of energy, work hard, show patience, perseverance and resilience. But on top of that, all these unicorn founders share five key traits that, as an investor, you should look for when you back them at an early stage.</p>
<h2>They know what they don’t know</h2>
<p>Many people expect a typical startup founder to be very confident and have a strong sales mentality. While they should definitely live up to those expectations, the best founders are also humble and well aware of their weaknesses and limitations as well as the potential challenges for their startup.</p>
<p>They keep wanting to learn, improve and grow the business beyond what average people have the energy and drive to manage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">announced</a> a slew of new audio products, including its Clubhouse clone, called Live Audio Rooms, which will be available across both Facebook and Messenger. Since May, Facebook has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/facebook-begins-testing-clubhouse-rival-expanding-audio-suite">publicly testing</a> the audio rooms feature in Taiwan with public figures, but today the company hosted its first public test of Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. The event itself was hosted by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who chatted with fellow execs and creators.</p>
<p>Joining Zuckerberg were Facebook VP and Head of Facebook Reality Labs Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Head of Facebook App Fidji Simo and three Facebook Gaming creators, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=stonemountain64">StoneMountain64</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueenEliminator">QueenEliminator</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=thefiercediva">TheFierceDivaQueen</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166464" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166464" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2166464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166464" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The creators used their time in the Audio Room to talk more about their gaming journeys on Facebook, what kind of games they were streaming and other gaming-related matters. Zuckerberg also briefly teased new gaming features, including a new type of post, coming soon, called &#8220;Looking for Players.&#8221; This post type will help creators find others in the community to play games with while they&#8217;re streaming.</p>
<p>In addition, badges that are earned from livestreams will now carry over to fan groups, Zuckerberg said, adding that it was a highly requested feature by creators and fans alike.</p>
<p>Fan groups will also now become available to all partnered creators on Facebook Gaming, starting today, and will roll out to others in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The experience of using the Live Audio Room is very much like what you&#8217;d expect on another platform, like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces. The event&#8217;s hosts appear in rounded profile icons at the top of the screen, while the listeners appear in the bottom half of the screen, as smaller icons. In between is a section that includes people followed by the speakers.</p>
<p>The active speaker is indicated with a glowing ring in shades of Facebook blue, purple and pink. If verified, a blue check appears next to their name.</p>

<p>Listeners can &#8220;Like&#8221; or otherwise react to the content as it streams live using the &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen. And they can choose to share the Audio Room either in a Facebook post, in a Group, with a friend directly or through other apps.</p>

<p>A toggle switch under the room&#8217;s three-dot &#8220;more&#8221; menu lets you turn on or off auto-generated captions, for accessibility. From here, you can also report users or any issues or bugs you encountered.</p>
<p>The Live Audio Room today did not offer any option for raising your hand or joining the speakers on stage &#8212; it was more of a &#8220;few-to-many&#8221; broadcast experience.</p>
<p>Before today, TechCrunch received a couple of tips from users who reported seeing the Audio Rooms option appear for them in the Facebook app. However, the company told us it had only tested Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. with employees.</p>
<p>During the test period, Live Audio Rooms are only available on iOS and Android, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also used today&#8217;s event to talk more broadly about Facebook&#8217;s plans for the creator economy going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a good vision for the future is one where a lot more people get to do creative work and work that they enjoy, and fewer people have to do work that they just find a chore. And, in order to do that, a lot of what we need to do is basically build out a bunch of these different monetization tools,&#8221; explained Zuckerberg. &#8220;Not all creators are going to have the same business model. So having the ability to basically use a lot of different tools like Fiji [Simo] was talking about &#8212; for some people it might be, Stars or ad revenue share or subscriptions or selling things or different kinds of things like that &#8212; that will be important and part of making this all add up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted also that the tools Facebook is building go beyond gaming, saying that Facebook intends to support journalists, writers and others &#8212; likely a reference to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22518571/facebook-substack-bulletin-newsletter-launch">upcoming Substack clone, Bulletin</a>, expected to launch later this month.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg additionally spoke about how the company won&#8217;t immediately take a cut of the revenue generated from creators&#8217; content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having this period where we&#8217;re not taking a cut and more people can get into these kinds of roles, I think is going to be a good thing to do &#8212; especially given how hard hit a lot of parts of the economy have been with COVID and the pandemic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More realistically, of course, Facebook&#8217;s decision to not take an immediate cut of some creator revenue is a decision it&#8217;s making in order to help attract more creators to its service, in the face of so much competition across the industry.</p>
<p>Clubhouse, for example, is currently wooing creators with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">a payments feature,</a> where creators keep 100% of their revenue. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">it&#8217;s funding some creators&#8217; shows</a>. Twitter, meanwhile, is tying its audio product Spaces to its broader set of creator tools, which now include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">newsletters</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">tips</a> and, soon, a subscription platform dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follow</a>.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t say during today&#8217;s event when Live Audio Rooms would be available to the public, but said the experience would roll out to &#8220;a lot more people soon.&#8221;</p>
