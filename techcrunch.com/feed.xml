					<description><![CDATA[Google is tying everything together with a handbook for navigating hybrid work, which includes best practice blueprints for five common hybrid meetings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employee location has become a bit more complicated as some return to the office, while others work remotely. To embrace those hybrid working conditions, Google is making more changes to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/g-suite-is-now-google-workspace/">Google Workspace</a> offering by going live with spaces — its tool for small group sharing — in Google Chat for all users.</p>
<p>Spaces integrates with Workspace tools, like the calendar, Drive and documents, to provide a more hybrid work experience where users can see the full history, content and context of conversations regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Google’s senior director of product management Sanaz Ahari<span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote in a blog post</span> that customers wanted spaces to be more like a “central hub for collaboration, both in real time and asynchronously. Instead of starting an email chain or scheduling a video meeting, teams can come together directly in a space to move projects and topics along.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are some new features users can see in spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">One interface for everything — inbox, chats, spaces and meetings.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Spaces, and content therein, can be made discoverable for people to find and join in the conversation.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Better search ability within a team’s knowledge base.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ability to reply to any message within a space.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Enhanced security and admin tools to monitor communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employees can now <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/join-meeting-virtually-or-in-person-google-calendar.html">indicate if they will be virtual or in-person</a> on certain days in Calendar for collaboration expectations. As a complement, users can call colleagues on both mobile and desktop devices in Google Meet.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199238" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199238" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/calendar-worklocation.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="439" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199238" class="wp-caption-text">Calendar work location</p></div></p>
<p>In November, all customers will be able to use Google Meet’s Companion Mode to join a meeting from a personal device while tapping into in-room audio and video. Also later this year, live-translated captions will be available in English to French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, with more languages being added in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, Google is also expanding its Google Meet hardware portfolio to include two new all-in-one video conferencing devices, third-party devices — Logitech’s video bar and Appcessori’s mobile device speaker dock — and interoperability with Webex by Cisco.</p>
<p>Google is tying everything together with a <a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/navigating-work-handbook/dl-cd.html">handbook for navigating hybrid work</a>, which includes best practice blueprints for five common hybrid meetings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later is officially everywhere, and Latin America is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, one startup in the region, </span><a href="http://www.addi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is announcing a $75 million extension to its Series B, bringing the total round size to $140 million. In late May, the startup announced it had raised $35 million in an equity round led by Union Square’s Opportunity Fund, and $30 million in debt funding from Architect Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has dual headquarters in Bogota, Colombia, and São Paulo, Brazil, declined to reveal its new valuation other than to say it is &#8220;nearly triple&#8221; what it was 90 days ago when it closed on the first tranche of its Series B, and that it is now in the “hundreds of millions” of dollars range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Greycroft led the extension, which also included participation from new backers GGV Capital, Citius Capital and Intersection Growth Partners, as well as existing investors Union Square’s Opportunity Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Endeavor Catalyst, Foundation Capital, Monashees and Quona Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest financing, Addi has now raised a total of $220 million in debt and equity since its September 2018 inception &#8212; $140 million of that in equity and over $80 million in debt.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Colombian point-of-sale lender ADDI nabs $12.5 million from Andreessen Horowitz&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/colombian-point-of-sale-lender-addi-nabs-12-5-million-from-andreessen-horowitz/embed/#?secret=xKIcipNR0j" data-secret="xKIcipNR0j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi co-founder and CEO Santiago Suarez, says he, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Vallejo and Elmer Ortega</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started the company with a vision of making digital commerce a reality in Latin America &#8212; a region where an estimated fewer than 25% of people have a credit card.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To do this, we had to solve the payment problem,” he said. “We wanted to make frictionless payments possible while allowing customers to afford what they wanted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi started with a buy now, pay later offering, which allowed consumers to make purchases in minutes with “just a few clicks.” Today, the company allows customers to pay for their purchases over three months at no cost. For bigger purchases, Addi lets them pay for up to 24 months at what it describes as “competitive and fair rates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi is currently available for e-commerce, mobile and brick-and-mortar purchases in Brazil and Colombia, with plans to expand across Latin America in the coming years. In particular, it plans to enter the Mexican market in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of this year alone, Addi has grown its GMV (gross merchandise volume) by 13x, according to Suarez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And our ARR has seen similar growth,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies, Addi temporarily saw a slowdown in business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it quickly bounced back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We lost 99% of our GMV in 20 days when the pandemic hit. We had to make some painful decisions, including letting go of many of our colleagues at a very difficult time,” Suarez recalled. “We also refocused the business on e-commerce and digital payments, and we haven’t looked back since then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Addi reached its pre-COVID high again in March/April of 2021, and has grown by about 3x since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is more focused on growth than profitability, Suarez added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This round has increased our focus on making digital commerce ubiquitous and accessible across Latin America,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Latin America </span><a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/argentina-was-the-country-where-e-commerce-grew-the-most-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in e-commerce sales growth last year. For its part, Addi currently has more than 150,000 customers, a number that is growing at 30% to 40% month over month. On the merchant side, it has close to 500 merchant partners, including brands such as Arturo Calle, Mario Hernandez, Keep Running and Claro. Earlier this year, it inked a strategic partnership with Banco Santander.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi currently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 260 employees (or as Suarez put it, partners), up from less than 120 a year ago. The company prides itself as being “one of the few Latin American startups” that grants equity to everyone on staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we make it a point of speaking about partners and co-owners rather than employees,” Suarez told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>The company plans to use the new capital to speed up its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> product roadmap and geographic expansion. On the product side, it will be launching &#8220;a one-click checkout solution&#8221; for its merchant partners and customers by year&#8217;s end. Addi will also be accelerating its entry into Mexico, as mentioned previously, where it&#8217;s aiming to launch in early 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greycroft’s Thabet Mahayni said that prior to investing in Addi, his firm had been tracking the startup “for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to an exceptional team, we believe the BNPL value proposition is stronger in LatAm than anywhere else in the world,” Mahayni told TechCrunch.” We&#8230;believe they have an opportunity to fundamentally reshape the entire consumer payments experience in the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is in part because currently, consumers in Latin America have very few alternatives when it comes to credit, he points out. Card penetration is very low and those who apply for credit “face a cumbersome and frustrating application process,” Mahayni added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those who do have credit cards are often given very low limits with high interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s easy to see how this dynamic makes it difficult and expensive for consumers to access safe and reliable credit,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi, according to Mahayni, has “rebuilt the entire onboarding, underwriting and fraud stack so they can provide safer credit alternatives to consumers while enabling merchants to meaningfully increase their basket sizes and GMV.”</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second LatAm investment for Greycroft, which previously invested in Rocket.chat, a Brazilian enterprise communication and collaboration platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mexico next year, Addi will join existing player, Nelo. That startup </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/nelo-raises-3m-to-grow-buy-now-pay-later-in-mexico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $3 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April, and at the time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was live with more than 45 merchants and over 150,000 users. Also, Alchemy earlier this year </span><a href="https://www.trustalchemy.com/press-release/alchemy-enters-latin-america-with-buy-now-pay-later-client/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered the Mexican market</span></a>.</p>

The service, which lets you pick up goods from shelves and (yep) just walk out, is coming to new stores in Washington DC and Sherman Oaks, California next year, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/whole-foods-market-to-launch-just-walk-out-technology-at-two-locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">announced</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;By collaborating with Amazon to introduce Just Walk Out shopping at these two Whole Foods Market stores, our customers will be able to&#8230; save time by skipping the checkout line,&#8221; said Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve detailed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-05-amazon-go-grocery-store.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">previously</a>, Just Walk Out uses computer vision, sensors and AI to let you walk into a store, sign in with an app, fill up your bags and leave without the need to join a checkout line. On top of using the tech in its own Go and Fresh stores, Amazon signed a deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-amazon-checkout-free-technology-business-just-walk-out.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">last year</a> to license its technology to third-party retailers.</p>
<p>The technology will work the same at Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon. Shoppers can opt to use the tech when they enter the store by scanning an app, inserting a debit card linked to their Amazon account, or by placing their palm over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-adds-its-contactless-palmreading-one-tech-to-more-go-stores-103800363.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Amazon One</a> palm-scanning system.</p>
<p>Unions have <a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/ufcw-amazon-grocery-expansion-with-cashierless-technology-threatens-good-paying-jobs-of-essential-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">proclaimed</a> that Amazon&#8217;s cashierless tech will cost workers jobs, but Amazon said the new Whole Foods locations will &#8220;employ a comparable number of team members as existing Whole Foods stores of similar sizes.&#8221; Rather, employees will be able to &#8220;spend even more time interacting with customers and delivering a great shopping experience,&#8221; Amazon said in a press release.</p>

Three renewals would be enough to ensure the material used for casing is cut in half relative to the total mileage.</p>
<p>About 35 percent of the materials are renewables, including dandelion rubber, silicate made from rice husk ash and a string of vegetable oils and resins. Another 17 percent is polyester yarn made from recycled PET bottles, reclaimed steel and recovered carbon black.</p>
<p>The design should improve the efficiency of the cars themselves, Continental added. New casing, sidewall and tread patterns make the GreenConcept about 40 percent lighter than a conventional tire at about 16.5lbs, That, in turn, leads to 25 percent lower rolling resistance than the highest-rated tires in the EU. Continental estimates you&#8217;d get six percent more range from an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>While you might not outfit your car with these exact tires any time soon, this is more than just a thought exercise. Continental plans to gradually deploy its recycling technology starting in 2022, including the production of tires using recycled bottles.</p>
<p>Efforts like the Conti GreenConcept are partly meant to burnish Continental&#8217;s public image. It wants to be the most environmentally responsible tire company by 2030, and become completely carbon-neutral by 2050 &#8220;at the latest.&#8221; However, it also hints at a more holistic approach to eco-friendly cars where many components, not just the powertrain, are kinder to the planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based VC fund Gaia Capital Partners has change its name to <a href="https://revaia.com/">Revaia</a> and announced the final closing of its first growth fund, at €250 million. The firm said it exceeded its initial target of €200 million, and the fund will be ‘ESG focused’.</p>
<p>Revaia is also claiming to be Europe’s largest female-founded VC fund, although TechCrunch has not been able to verify that at the time of publication.</p>
<p>As Gaia Capital Partners, Revaia launched its first fund in late 2019, the portfolio for which currently consists of ten investments, including Aircall, recently achieved a unicorn valuation. Other investments include Epsor (Paris: Epsor designs and distributes employee savings and retirement plans), GetAccept (SF: an all-in-one sales enablement solution that assists B2B sales reps in closing remote deals), gohenry (London: a kids money management application), Planity (Paris: an online booking platform for hair and beauty salons), Welcome to the Jungle (Paris: a multichannel media company), and Yubo (Paris: a social platform for Generation Z).</p>
<p>Alice Albizzati, co-founder of Revaia said in a statement: “When we set up the firm, we were determined to create an investment strategy in line with our convictions – a focus on European companies with high ambitions but with no compromise on sustainability – and with the objective of bridging the gap between private and public markets. Our venture has performed beyond our initial expectations.”</p>
<p>The firm now has an office in Paris and Berlin, as well as a presence in New York and Toronto</p>
<p>The fund’s institutional investors include insurance companies such as Generali, Allianz, and Maif, pension funds, other institutional investors such as Bpifrance, as well as over 50 family offices and Angels.</p>
<p>Elina Berrebi, co-founder of Revaia, said: “We are very grateful to our investors and entrepreneurs who trusted us as we accelerated the build-up of our portfolio. This final closing of our first fund is a huge milestone. It is a solid foundation from which we can support future European technology leaders with their ambitions and sustainability plans, as well as expand and internationalize our team while building a strong value creation platform.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revaia said the new fund had already begun investing, and “two new investments should be announced soon”.</p>
<p>The firm says it aims to invest in around 15 companies and expand across Europe.</p>
<p>It’s also partnered with listed market sustainable investor Sycomore Asset Management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The beauty industry is worth some $500 million annually, and the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a sharp rise in the proportion of sales being carried out online. Today, a London-based beauty startup is announcing a major round of funding in hopes of reaping the spoils of that trend with a direct-to-consumer online storefront selling own-label goods.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beautypie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beauty Pie</a>, which describes itself as a buyers club for high-end beauty and wellness products &#8212; any consumer in the U.K. or U.S. can buy direct, but when one joins the buying <a href="https://www.beautypie.com/join-beauty-pie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">club</a> either for a month (£10/$15) or a year (£59/$59), deep discounts per item kick in &#8212; has raised $100 million, funding that it will use to continue expanding into a wider set of categories, and to target users with a wider set of sales channels and more infrastructure (warehouses, more pop-up retail) to source and sell its &#8220;basics&#8221;-styled goods, typified by clean and simple, no-frills packaging with a focus on product inside.</p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;I don’t believe in business models where you spend tons on marketing,&#8221; Canadian founder and CEO Marcia Kilgore said in an interview. &#8220;So we want to focus the funding on opening new warehouses, moving into new territories, and maybe some pop-ups. We are Sephora meets Costco.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; a Series B &#8212; is being co-led by Index Ventures and Insight Partners, with previous backers Balderton Capital, General Catalyst and Latitude VC (a sister fund to London-based seed investor LocalGlobe) also participating. Beauty Pie, founded in 2016, has now raised $170 million to date. It&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation, but from what we understand estimates on <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/225753-67/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> of $1.33 billion are not accurate (close sources tell us that the valuation is under $1 billion currently).</p>
<p>Beauty products are for many a very discretionary purchase, and that is even more the case for the higher end of that market &#8212; expensive and luxury brands. Skincare, cosmetics, hair products, and the rest are not in the same category of essentials as food, and if you do absolutely need a product, there are very cheap alternatives always available.</p>
<p>However, the last year and a half of Covid-19 living has had an interesting impact on that relationship. Many consumers have seen the opportunities to go out and spend money on activities significantly curtailed, and at the same time they have been looking for ways to pamper themselves in these complicated times. Combining that with the fact that non-essential stores were forced to close, or saw significantly reduced footfall, in many parts of the world, and that has translated to a huge boost for online shopping for beauty products, and especially nice ones. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSjM5B3QNlw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treat yourself</a> has become a fully-fledged beauty and wellness sales strategy. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Consumer%20Packaged%20Goods/Our%20Insights/How%20COVID%2019%20is%20changing%20the%20world%20of%20beauty/How-COVID-19-is-changing-the-world-of-beauty-vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey notes in a report on the impact of Covid-19 on the beauty industry</a> that will in-person commerce had pre-Covid dominated sales, accounting for 85% of revenues, online had taken up to 30% share in the pandemic, a huge shift in a short space of time.</p>
<p>The key to Beauty Pie&#8217;s model is that it sources and buys in high-end products from a range of producers and sells them under its own private label. Not unlike Amazon in its own private-label endeavors and how it combines this with its own Prime buying club model, this lets Beauty Pie sell products that compete with the best on the market, while also undercutting those high-end brands in the process. It says typical mark-ups for brands are 10x the cost of making a product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By offering products in two tiers &#8212; one for those not in the club, and one for those who are paying a premium to be in the club &#8212; it also means that the startup still makes a margin on the items that it sells. The very simple approach is also reflected in the products themselves, which emphasize what is inside the packaging more than what it looks like on the outside, the implication being that Beauty Pie&#8217;s own focus is on the substance more than the aesthetics (ironic given that the end game is all about making us all look and smell better).</p>
<p>The model has so far been a successful one for the company, even with the initial stumbles it, like others, faced at the start of the pandemic. For Beauty Pie, when Covid-19 kicked off, it took its foot off ad spend, Kilgore said, because it could see supply issues shaping up, and it did so to manage how much demand it was going to get in, so that customers would not turn away disappointed. That soon got up to speed again, and now the company has some 300 to 400 SKUs on offer.</p>
<p>Kilgore claims that its customer retention rates are currently higher than Spotify&#8217;s and Netflix&#8217;s and twenty times higher than other D2C beauty companies, partly a result of the buyers&#8217; club model. Members more than doubled in the last year, with revenues growing by more than 100%, and the company turned profitable last year for the first time, too.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;After only 48 months in operation, <span class="il">Beauty</span> <span class="il">Pie</span>&#8216;s annual and monthly subscriber figures are incredible,&#8221; Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, wrote last December (likely a <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/the-new-social-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that subtly kicked off the fundraising that we are writing about today). &#8220;At Index, we&#8217;ve never seen customer retention like this before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p6">It helps, too, that Kilgore is not a first-time founder. She&#8217;s also the force behind the shoe brand Fitflop, Soap and Glory and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcia-kilgore-15a3646/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other apparel and beauty enterprises</a>.</p>
<p>“Marcia has spent decades building businesses that genuinely treat customers the way she would want to be treated, and Beauty Pie is the epitome of that ethos. With its transformative value chain and membership model, [it] lets members have their pie and eat it too: the best products at the best prices,&#8221; noted Rebecca Liu, Principal at Insight Partners, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 70% of Egypt&#8217;s young and fast-growing population of over 100 million is financially underserved despite mobile penetration exceeding 90%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional banks often overlook this segment because of their spending power or financial status and fintechs have seized the opportunity to cater to their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such fintech is MNT-Halan, and today, the company which describes itself as &#8220;Egypt&#8217;s leading fintech ecosystem&#8221; is announcing that it has closed a $120 million investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors backing MNT-Halan include private equity firms Apis Growth Fund II, Development Partners International (DPI), and Lorax Capital Partners; VCs like Venture Partners, Endeavor Catalyst, and DisruptTech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They join previous local investors like GB Capital, DPI, Algebra Ventures, Wamda, Egypt Ventures, Shaka VC, Nowaisi Capital, Unidelta, Battery Road Digital Holdings that have backed the company in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Mounir Nakhla and Ahmed Mohsen started Halan as a ride-hailing and delivery app offering two and three-wheeler services to customers in Egypt. Since then, it has provided other features including wallets, bill payment services, e-commerce with buy now, pay later (BNPL), micro and consumer loans, all in a bid to become a super app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in June this year, Netherlands-based MNT Investments BV entered a share swap agreement with the Egyptian super app to accelerate the progress of its payments and lending arm, especially in BNPL across Egypt and the MENA region. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the merger, MNT acquired the shares of Raseedy, the first independent and interoperable digital wallet in Egypt licensed by its Central Bank to disburse, collect and transfer money digitally through mobile applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As MNT-Halan, it has also obtained the micro, consumer, and nano finance licenses to provide services to both businesses and consumers across Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has enabled the company to build a fintech ecosystem that connects consumers, merchants, and micro-enterprises via a digital platform and payment solutions.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business and consumer lender, MNT-Halan offers BNPL services, nano loans, microfinance, SME lending, payroll lending, and light-vehicle finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its digital payments ecosystem provides services around loan disbursement and collection, peer-to-peer transfers, payroll disbursement, remittances, and bill payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in mobility, MNT-Halan provides courier, delivery, and ride-hailing services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MNT-Halan claims to be Egypt&#8217;s largest and fastest-growing lender to the unbanked. Serving over 4 million customers in Egypt, of which 1 million are monthly active users, MNT-Halan has disbursed over $1.7 billion worth of loans to 1.8 million borrowers since inception. The company also claims to process $100 million monthly, growing 20x over the past five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, a mixture of private equity and venture capital money, will help the company improve its technology and product while scaling to customers within and outside Egypt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are at the forefront of the digital revolution sweeping across Egypt, bringing together the unbanked population with our technology. We are on track to bring financial inclusion to tens of millions of Egyptians. As a result, we will unleash this segment’s earnings potential and drive greater participation in the economy,” said CEO Nakhla.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its investors, Apis Growth Fund II, is a London-based private equity fund. It makes quasi-equity investments in the financial sector and related market infrastructure &#8212; payment gateways, switches, and payment platforms &#8212; in Africa and Asia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MNT-Halan is its first landmark investment in Egypt but second on the continent after taking part in TymeBank&#8217;s $109 million investment in February this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-founders and managing partners Matteo Stefanel and Udayan Goyal said this in a statement, “We are thrilled to be investing in MNT-Halan, which is our first investment in Egypt. Our belief is that they will be the leading player digitizing the unbanked and bringing financial services to millions of underserved customers in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look forward to partnering with them to extend their impressive growth trajectory and believe Mounir Nakhla’s track record, combined with MNT-Halan’s tech team and operational expertise, provide the ideal opportunity to invest in Egypt’s fintech sector.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this news, Halan as an independent entity had raised $26.4 million, according to Crunchbase. This investment takes it to a combined total of $146.4 million, of which the latest is one of the largest raised in Africa this year and continues to prove the dominance of fintech on the continent.</span></p>

<p>The transaction completion including the regulatory approval is expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>After the acquisition, the Japan-based company will continue to operate its existing business and maintain the brand while the leaders, Paidy’s president and CEO Riku Sugie and founder and executive chairman of Paidy Russel Cummer, keep their positions.</p>
<p>Japan is the third largest e-commerce market in the world, and so this is a significant move by PayPal to gain more market share both in the country and the region, specifically in the area of providing deferred payment services as an alternative to credit cards.</p>
<p>PayPal has long played nice with payment cards &#8211; users can upload details of their cards to PayPal and use it as a kind of digital wallet to manage how they pay for things online through it &#8211; but it got its start actually as a payment platform in itself, where people could pay into and out of PayPal accounts. Paidy is, in that sense, a strengthening of PayPal&#8217;s first-party rails, providing a way to &#8216;own&#8217; that flow of money on its own infrastructure, not involving the card networks.</p>
<p>Paidy is basically a two-sided payments service, acting as a middleman between consumers and merchants in Japan. Using machine learning it determines the creditworthiness of a consumer related to a particular purchase, and then it underwrites those transactions in seconds, guaranteeing payments to merchants. Consumers then make deferred payment to Paidy for those goods.</p>
<p>Paidy’s platform, which offers a monthly payment installment service branded &#8216;3-Pay&#8217;, enables shoppers to make purchases online and then pay for them each month in a consolidated bill at a convenience store or via bank transfer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“Paidy pioneered buy now, pay later solutions tailored to the Japanese market and quickly grew to become the leading service, developing a sizable two-sided platform of consumers and merchants,” said Peter Kenevan, vice president, head of Japan at Paypal.</p>
<p>Paidy has more than 6 million registered users, and the plan is to integrate PayPal and other digital and QR wallets with <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paidy-launches-paidy-link-to-instantly-link-paidy-accounts-to-digital-wallets-301270364.html">Paidy Link</a> to connect further online and offline merchants.</p>
<p>In April 2021, the Japan-based company launched Paidy Link, allowing users to link digital wallets with their Payidy account. PayPal was the first digital wallet partner to integrate with Paidy Link.</p>
<p>&#8220;PayPal was a founding partner for Paidy Link and we look forward to looking together to create even more value,&#8221; Sugie said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Japan has been a vibrant environment for our growth to date and we’re honored to have our team’s hard work and potential recognized by a global leader. Together with Paypal, we will be able to further achieve our mission of taking the hassle out of shopping,” Cummer said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, there are more than 40 million micro-businesses underserved in some form or another regarding banking services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some of these businesses have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bank accounts, gaps exist in how banks use the data available to serve the needs of each business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With banks, presenting a series of transactions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as statements is all these businesses require. They care less about providing them with insights and growth opportunities around their customers and products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fintech startup, Prospa wants to change that and has begun to tap into this market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/most-african-yc-backed-startups-in-todays-batch-are-focused-on-fintech/">was one of the 10 African startups</a> participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ew months past graduation, the startup, combining both worlds of banking and business management tools for micro and small businesses, has closed a $3.8 million pre-seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frederik Obasi, Chioma Ugo and Rodney Jackson-Cole. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a serial entrepreneur running businesses in tech and media, Obasi experienced how tough running operations and banking his business simultaneously was in Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks only concerned themselves with providing some financial services so people like Obasi had to look for software or personnel to cater to the operational parts of their businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> someone who runs a large business with a considerable influx of cash, it is easy to assign staff or buy software to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">delegate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tasks. But it can be expensive and a daunting task for smaller businesses; that’s why most of them struggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing an opportunity, Obasi and his team launched Prospa under the premise that they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheaply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solve the needs of these small business owners in banking and software.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I left my last business, I wanted to do something </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big and something that I knew the problem inside out. That&#8217;s why I started Prospa,&#8221; Obasi told TechCrunch over a call. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built the product between June and September 2019 and went live in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company acquired customers in stealth even when they got into YC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obasi explains that he wanted Prospa to have organic traction void of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth driven by hype and media noise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We like to think a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long-term game</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanted to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> test the hypotheses, build an actual business with revenue and understand what we were doing. Then the COVID period came and we started seeing enough traction,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when the company began to get some buzz, the typical description people had about Prospa was &#8220;a neobank for small businesses.&#8221; Over the call, CEO Obasi is quick to dispel that notion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside providing banking services, he says Prospa offers invoicing tools, inventory management, employee and vendor management, an e-commerce store, and payroll features</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Banking is just a little part of what we do. We know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we&#8217;re put</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the neobank category, but we see our product as 10% banking and 90% software. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the experience is very much different from what you&#8217;d get from a neobank and the use case for Prospa users is quite different,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospa focuses on freelancers and entrepreneurs, acting as the &#8220;operating system&#8221; for their businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">usinesses on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the platform get access to an account number and other features Prospa provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or unregistered businesses, Prospa takes them through a process of formalizing their business and providing bank accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, in the grand scheme of things, this segment is more of an inroad into an upsell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking on traction, Obasi says the company has tens of thousands of businesses and is growing 35% month-on-month. And from a non-banking perspective, Prospa has managed over 150,000 product catalogs while small businesses have sent out 360,000 invoices on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then pricing depends on the business&#8217; turnover. For instance, a business with a turnover of ₦100,000 (~$200) is not expected to pay Prospa any subscription fee. But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> businesses with turnovers exceeding ₦100,000 pay fees between ₦3,000 (~$6) and ₦5,000 (~$10) monthly.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199182" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199182" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199182" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg?w=680" alt="Prospa" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p_bank.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199182" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Prospa</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year, African VC has seen incredible numbers from all corners of the continent at different stages of investment. Prospa&#8217;s pre-seed investment, for instance, is the largest round of its kind in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa at the moment. In Africa, only Egyptian fintech Telda has raised a larger round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obasi believes the company&#8217;s understanding of the market and what it wants to achieve was the main reason it could command such a price which, according to him, was almost four times oversubscribed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in the round include VCs like Global Founders Capital and Liquid 2 Ventures. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders of global fintechs like Mercury&#8217;s Immad Akhund, Karim Atiyeh of Ramp, and executives from Teachable, Square, Facebook and Nubank also participated in the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the likes of Akhund and Atiyeh on Prospa&#8217;s cap table might suggest to some that Prospa was backed because the company is building a replica of those businesses in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Obasi says while there are similarities, Prospa is not building a product for startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a massive startup ecosystem in the U.S. where you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grow a billion-dollar company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serving YC companies. We don&#8217;t have that here. We&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building for the backbone of the economy, which is small and micro-businesses. Speaking to and being able to build relationships with investors, one of the things we made clear is that we&#8217;re not an American copycat,&#8221; he said when asked if Prospa could be likened with Mercury and other U.S. startup-focused financial product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospa plans to use its new capital to double down and expand with acquisition strategies to get more customers. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product and engineering.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leap, a two-year-old startup with headquarters in San Francisco and Bangalore that is helping students in India find the right college abroad, prepare for entrance tests, and also secure visas and loan, said on Wednesday it has raised $55 million in a new financing round from several high-profile edtech backers.</p>
<p>Leap said it has raised $55 million in a new financing round led by Owl Ventures. The Series C round also saw participation from Harvard Management Company, more popularly known for being a high-profile LP to venture funds. Existing investors Sequoia Capital India and Jungle Ventures also participated in the round, which follows a Series B funding in March this year and brings Leap all-time raise to over $75 million.</p>
<p>Arnav Kumar, co-founder of Leap, told TechCrunch that the startup sits at the intersection of edtech and fintech. It&#8217;s helping students in India find the right college for admission abroad and also ensuring that they have the visa and capital to study and live there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a massive market that the startup is tapping.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of teenagers and young adults get on flights each year from India to a foreign land to pursue higher education. &#8220;The desire for Indian students to study abroad is stronger than ever,&#8221; said Ashish Agrawal, Managing Director at Sequoia Capital India.</p>
<p>But they face a number of challenges, including some that present themselves after they have landed in the foreign land.</p>
<p>Since they don’t have a local credit history, they can’t avail a range of financial services, including a loan or a credit card — at least not without paying a premium for it. For banks and other financial institutions, there is an increased risk when they engage with foreigners, so they charge more. An Indian student studying in the U.S., for instance, borrows money at an interest rate of over 13%, nearly twice of what their local peers are charged.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leap is addressing the financial part by granting loans to students at a fair interest rate by evaluating the data they generated &#8212; alternative and derived &#8212; in India itself.</p>
<p>But finance is only one of its offerings. The startup has aggressively expanded its offerings to provide what it calls a broader infrastructure to enable students to pursue international higher education.</p>
<p>Leap has developed a community of over 1 million students where they advise each other and explore options. Leap said it has helped over 60,000 students in their study abroad journey over the last 18 months &#8212; and just had its strongest fall season.</p>

<p>Since we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/leap-raises-17-million-to-help-indian-students-study-abroad/">last spoke about Leap</a>, the startup has demonstrated strong growth on various fronts, said Kumar. Its community has grown (adding 100,000 students each month), the test preparation app is increasingly becoming popular, and its core financial services has also surged, he said.</p>
<p>On top of this, the startup has expanded its offerings to help students prepare for &#8212; and landing &#8212; internships when they do join a college abroad, solving another challenge faced by foreign students.</p>
<p>Now with the new funding, Leap is planning to expand to serve international markets including Middle East and Southeast Asia and help the students pursue higher education in 20 nations, said Kumar, who previously worked as an associate vice president at venture fund Elevation Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leap is on the trajectory to become the preeminent study abroad platform for students. The overseas education market is fragmented where there is no single one-stop solution,&#8221; said Amit Patel, Managing Director of Owl Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be very confusing for students to know where to begin preparation, what colleges they should target, and how they are going to afford to pay for their education. Leap is creating a comprehensive platform that addresses all of these preparation and financing needs for students. Owl Ventures is excited to deepen our partnership with Vaibhav, Arnav, and the Leap team to make studying abroad a reality for as many students as possible.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as there are hundreds of millions of Indians who have bank accounts, only about 30 million of them have credit cards. The adoption rate of the plastic card has largely remained stagnant in the South Asian nation for the last few years.</p>
<p>The relatively young credit-rating system in India covers only a tiny fraction of the nation’s population. And banks neither have sophisticated underwriting systems nor the risk appetite to make any attempts to move the needle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sliceit.com">Slice</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/slice-raises-20-million-to-go-after-credit-card-industry-in-india/">Bangalore-based startup</a>, believes it has found the solution. The startup, which has years of experience in issuing its cards to young professionals with no traditional jobs, said on Wednesday it’s launching a card with 2,000 Indian rupees ($27) as the default limit to tap the nation’s potential addressable market of 200 million individuals.</p>
<p>Rajan Bajaj, founder and chief executive of Slice, said the startup’s new credit limit card &#8212; considerably lower than industry’s lowest of about $270 &#8212; is aimed at those who don’t have a great credit score &#8212; or any score &#8212; and slowly help them build it.</p>
<p>The startup, which has been lately disbursing as many as 100,000 new super cards &#8212; its marquee offering &#8212; to users each month, is not charging any joining fee or annual fee with its new card and is offering the same benefits as its super card.</p>
<p>Bajaj said the startup is able to offer this card to users because it has spent years building its own credit underwriting system that supports this.</p>
<p>“In the last few years, we have actively invested in building a strong risk infrastructure by leveraging data science. Without robust risk management capabilities, it&#8217;s impossible to scale such a business and make such a truly inclusive product. But once the capability is built, no one can take the growth away from you. Currently, with a 50% m-o-m growth, our NPA is still less than 2%, a validation of our superior credit underwriting capabilities.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rajan said the startup arrived at the $27 figure because it believes this amount “still allows users to make meaningful transactions,” adding that by properly utilizing this limit and paying on time, users can instantly get approved for higher limits.</p>
<p>“We are confident this will encourage users to provide us with extra information that we need to increase their credit limit,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup, which raised $20 million in a financing round two months ago, is hoping to issue about 1 million of these new cards to users by the end of March next year.</p>
<p>It may raise more, soon. Investors are chasing the startup to finance a new round of about $100 million at a significantly higher valuation than that of its previous round. Rajan declined to comment on fundraise talks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know that large data centers running powerful servers use vast amounts of electricity. Anything that can reduce consumption would be a welcome change, especially in a time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/eric-dean-wilson-interview/">of climate upheaval</a>. That&#8217;s where the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/power/power10">new IBM Power E1080 server</a>, which is powered by the latest Power10 processors, comes into play.</p>
<p>IBM claims it can consolidate the work of 126 competitive servers down to just two E1080s, saving 80% in energy costs, by the company&#8217;s estimation. What&#8217;s more, the company says, &#8220;The new server has set a new world record in a SAP benchmark that measures performance for key SAP applications, needing only half the resources used by x86 competitive servers to beat them by 40%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategy, who closely follows the chip industry, says that the company&#8217;s bold claims about what these systems can achieve make sense from a hardware design perspective. &#8220;The company&#8217;s claims on SAP, Oracle and OpenShift workloads pass initial muster with me as it simply requires less sockets and physical processors to achieve the same performance. These figures were compared to Intel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/platforms/details/cascade-lake.html">Cascade Lake</a> that will be replaced with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/updates-next-gen-data-center-platform-sapphire-rapids.html#gs.auk2ga">Sapphire Rapids</a> (in the future),&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ivKr1RXMv4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/ibm-breaks-latest-revenue-losing-streak-as-cloud-revenue-shows-modest-growth/">IBM breaks latest revenue losing streak as cloud revenue shows modest growth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM breaks latest revenue losing streak as cloud revenue shows modest growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/ibm-breaks-latest-revenue-losing-streak-as-cloud-revenue-shows-modest-growth/embed/#?secret=ivKr1RXMv4" data-secret="ivKr1RXMv4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Steve Sibley, vice president and business line executive in the Power Systems Group at IBM, says that the new server (and the Power10 chip running it) have been designed for customers looking for a combination of speed, power, efficiency and security. &#8220;If you look at what we deliver here with scale and performance, it gives customers even more agility to respond quickly to scale to their highest demands,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To give customers options, they can buy E1080 servers outright and install them in a company data center. They can buy server access as a service from the IBM cloud (and possibly competitor clouds) or they can rent the servers and install them in their data centers and pay by the minute to help mitigate the cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our systems are a little bit more expensive on what I call a base cost of acquisition standpoint, but we allow customers to actually purchase [E1080 servers] on an as-a-service basis with a by-the-minute level of granularity of what they&#8217;re paying for,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, this server, which is the first to be released based on the Power10 chip, is designed to run Red Hat software under the hood, giving the company another outlet for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-red-hat-acquisition-for-34-billion/">its 2018 $34 billion acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing Red Hat&#8217;s platform to this platform is a key way to modernize applications, both from just a RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) operating system environment, as well as OpenShift (the company&#8217;s container platform). The other place that has been key with our Red Hat acquisition and our capitalizing on it is that we&#8217;re leveraging their Ansible projects and products to drive management and automation on our platform, as well,&#8221; Sibley explained.</p>
<p>Since Arvind Krishna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">took over as CEO at IBM</a> in April 2020, he has been trying to shift the focus of the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">to hybrid computing</a>, where some computing exists in the cloud and some on prem, which is the state many companies will find themselves in for many years to come. IBM hopes to leverage Red Hat as a management plane for a hybrid environment, while offering a variety of hardware and software tools and services.</p>
<p>While Red Hat continues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/red-hat-ceo-looks-to-maintain-double-digit-growth-in-second-year-at-helm/">to operate as a standalone entity</a> inside IBM, and wants to remain a neutral company for customers, Big Blue is still trying to find ways to take advantage of its offerings whenever possible and using it to run its own systems, and the E1080 provides a key avenue for doing that.</p>
<p>The company says that it is taking orders for the new servers starting immediately and expects to begin shipping systems at the end of the month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cao Cao Mobility, the ride-hailing unit of Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings, has announced a $589 million (RMB 3.8 billion) Series B raise that the company says will help it upgrade its technology and expand its fleet, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wT8i6hx8-4DYuTW3Y4u1Cw">statement</a> released by the company (in Chinese).</p>
<p>The raise, which Cao Cao announced on Monday, brings the company&#8217;s total funding to around $773.2 million (RMB 5 billion). Suzhou Xiangcheng Financial Holding Group, an investment company backed by the Xiangcheng district government of Suzhou, led the round along with Suzhou High-Speed Rail New City Group and three other state-controlled enterprises.</p>
<p>This raise comes amid troubles for Cao Cao&#8217;s biggest competitor, Didi Global, the Chinese ride-hailing app that&#8217;s currently under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-b18a0f7b87042d42266ea9aef96debba">cybersecurity investigation</a> by the Chinese government and has been temporarily removed from Chinese app stores causing stocks to plummet. Didi has been a ride-hailing staple in China, so any setbacks can create a vacuum that others in the space will try to fill.</p>
<p>Cao Cao, which is currently available in 62 cities in China, saw ride volume increase 32% in July, the same month Didi was taken down from app stores in China. Meituan, China&#8217;s e-commerce giant, also saw a 24% ride increase in July, according to the <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MDQwMDQ5NQ==&amp;mid=2247549998&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=9ff4cf1ac568ccb4e61b1aa8c1ab7395&amp;scene=0">Ministry of Transport</a>. However Meituan and Amap, Alibaba&#8217;s ride-hailing and navigation unit, are being criticized alongside Didi by the Chinese government for &#8220;disrupting fair competition and hurting the interests of drivers and passengers,&#8221; reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/china-orders-ride-hailing-firms-meituan-didi-to-fix-misconduct">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>As all of the other players in the ride-hailing sphere struggle under government scrutiny, Cao Cao is positioned for further growth and a larger market share, as long as it is found to be playing fair.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.intudovc.com/">Intudo Ventures</a>, the “Indonesia-only” investment firm, announced today it has closed its third fund, totaling $115 million. Called Intudo Ventures Fund III, it was raised in less than three months and oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Fund III’s limited partners include Black Kite Investments, the family office of Singaporean businessman Koh Bon Hwee; Wasson Enterprises, the family office of former Walgreens Boots Alliance chief executive officer Greg Wasson; and PIDC, the investment arm of Taiwan-based retail conglomerate Uni-President Enterprises Corp. Other LPs include more than 30 Indonesian families and their conglomerates; over 20 leading global funds and managing partners; and more than 10 founders of tech unicorns.</p>
<p>Intudo founding partners Patrick Yip and Eddy Chan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/12/intudo-ventures-launches-10m-fund-for-indonesias-fast-growing-startup-ecosystem/">launched the firm in June 2017</a> as the first Indonesia-only venture capital firm, with a debut fund of $10 million. At first, many people were dubious that a country-specific fund focused on early-stage Indonesian companies would take off, especially since Yip and Chan wanted to build a small portfolio and work closely with startups.</p>
<p>Then in 2019, Intudo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/intudo-ventures-raises-new-50m-fund/">closed its $50 million second fund </a>with LPs including Founders Fund, which Chan said helped validate its mission. Portfolio companies from its first two funds include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/two-months-after-its-series-a-pintu-gets-35m-in-new-funding-led-by-lightspeed/">Pintu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/">TaniHub Group</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/indonesian-edtech-startup-gredu-raises-4m-series-a-to-keep-teachers-parents-and-students-engaged-with-one-another/">Gredu</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning, “when we said we were going to raise $10 million, we got laughed out of the room by many managers, but four years into it, we’re running roughly $200 million dollars,” he told TechCrunch. “It shows that for the right markets, hyperlocal is the way to go.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hCos8lXZ5F"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/two-months-after-its-series-a-pintu-gets-35m-in-new-funding-led-by-lightspeed/">Two months after its Series A, Pintu gets $35M in new funding led by Lightspeed</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Two months after its Series A, Pintu gets $35M in new funding led by Lightspeed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/two-months-after-its-series-a-pintu-gets-35m-in-new-funding-led-by-lightspeed/embed/#?secret=hCos8lXZ5F" data-secret="hCos8lXZ5F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For its third fund, Intudo intends to invest in about 12 to 14 startups, in sectors like agriculture, B2B and enterprise, education, finance and insurance, healthcare and logistics. Initial check sizes will range from $1 million to $10 million. Leading early-stage and Series A rounds will continue to be Intudo’s core focus, but it also plans to invest in Series B and C rounds for companies from its first two funds.</p>
<p>Unlike many funds that have a handful of anchor investors, all of Intudo’s limited partners are capped at 10% of the total fund size so it can maintain its independent investment thesis and ensure all LPs are treated equally.</p>
<p>“I think 10% is a nice number, where it signals to the founder that we are doing what’s best for their company and not for one special interest group,” said Chan.</p>
<p>The firm will look for companies with competitive moats, like strong intellectual property or deep tech. It also looks for companies that operate in heavily-regulated sectors that are difficult for competitors to enter.</p>
<p>Chan pointed to crypto-exchange Pintu as a good example of Intudo’s investment thesis.</p>
<p>“Everyone was like, you invested in this because it’s trendy, but you have to understand that we met the founder when Bitcoin had dropped down to $6,000. When we gave him the term sheet, six months later in March 2019, Bitcoin was at $3,000,” he said. “The moral of the story is we knew the founder was legit and we were able to pick up all the best talent because you can’t go to a lot of major unicorns to work on crypto.”</p>
<p>Many of Intudo’s portfolio founders are pulkam kampung, or Indonesians who have studied and worked overseas, but returned to launch companies, and it runs a program called Pulkam S.E.A. Turtle Fellowship to mentor aspiring founders. One-third of the deals from Intudo’s first two funds were sourced from universities and the tech community in the United States.</p>
<p>Intudo works closely with founders after signing checks. For example, all of its companies have made a commercial deal sourced through the firm’s network before receiving an investment. Its country-specific approach is also an advantage during the pandemic, because Intudo can continue to hold in-person meetings with founders on an almost weekly basis.</p>
<p>“The founder community has obviously gone through a tough time this year and last year due to COVID,” said Yip. “A lot of these founders needed to make course adjustments and corrections to their business plans. I think our role as an in-market, involved investor has been even more enhanced. A lot of the companies that have gone under, they did not have an in-country partner from the get-go.”</p>
<p>He added, “I think our involved approach and having a concentrated portfolio is something that is appreciated by the founder community as well, so that’s definitely something we intend to rinse and repeat going into Fund III.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four months after its last funding announcement, Singapore-based e-commerce aggregator <a href="https://www.rainforest.life/">Rainforest</a> has closed a $20 million pre-Series A round led by Monk’s Hill Ventures. Other participants included January Capital, Crossbeam Venture Partners, Amasia and Lo &amp; Behold Group, along with returning investors Nordstar and Insignia Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Rainforest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/">announced in May</a> that it had raised $6.55 million in equity and a $30 million debt facility to fund acquisitions. The company says its latest raise means it now has more than $50 million to spend on acquiring e-commerce brands.</p>
<p>Founded by former Carousell and Fave executives, Rainforest buys mostly Asia-based Amazon brands and wants to become the e-commerce version of consumer goods conglomerate Newell Brands.</p>

<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer J.J. Chai told TechCrunch in an email that Rainforest raised funding again because it’s doubled its portfolio since the last round and also has “a number of sizable acquisitions in the pipeline.” The company originally intended to raise about $8 million to $12 million to add to its seed round, but increased that amount to $20 million because of investor interest, he added. In addition to brand acquisitions, the funding will also be used on hiring and building its tech infrastructure.</p>
<p>Chai said Rainforest raised only equity this time because it hasn’t finished using the debt facility it got from Accial earlier this year.</p>
<p>Since launching in January 2021, Rainforest has acquired six brands, including one from China for $3.6 million, marking its first foray into the country, and plans to triple its brand portfolio by the end of this year. After buying brands, Rainforest scales them up through inventory management, cost optimization and expansions into new marketplaces and distribution channel. The company claims its portfolio brands have seen over 50% improvement in annual growth rates after their acquisitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rainforest also announced it has hired Yev Ivanko, previously co-founder and CEO at NimbleSeller, as its vice president of acquisitions, and Christine Ng, who has worked in marketing and branding at Sephora, ShopStyle, Luxola and Shopbop, as its new vice president of brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marshmallow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshmallow</a> &#8212; a U.K.-based car insurance provider that has made a name for itself in the market by providing a new approach to car insurance aimed at using a wider set of data points and clever algorithms to net a more diverse set of customers and provide more competitive rates &#8212; is announcing a milestone today in its life as a startup, as well as in the bigger U.K. tech world.</p>
<p>The London company &#8212; co-founded by identical twins Oliver and Alexander Kent-Braham and David Goaté &#8212; has raised $85 million in a new round of funding. The Series B valuation is significant on two counts: it catapults Marshmallow to a &#8220;unicorn&#8221; valuation above $1 billion &#8212; specifically, $1.25 billion; and Marshmallow itself becomes one of a very small group of U.K. startups founded by Black people &#8212; Oliver and Alexander &#8212; to reach that figure.</p>
<p>(To be clear, Marshmallow describes itself as &#8220;the first UK unicorn to be founded by individuals that are Black or have Black heritage&#8221;, although I can think of at least one that preceded it: WorldRemit, which last month rebranded to Zepz, and is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210822005041/en/Zepz-Formerly-WorldRemit-Group-the-Leading-Digital-Cross-border-Payments-Platform-Has-Raised-292-Million-in-New-Primary-Series-E-Financing-Achieving-a-Valuation-of-5-Billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently valued at $5 billion</a>; co-founder and chairman Ismail Ahmed has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-50177680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as the most influential Black Briton.)</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Marshmallow is the first or one of the first, given the dearth of diversity in the U.K. technology industry, in particular in the upper ranks of it, it&#8217;s a notable detail worth pointing out, even as I hope that one day it will be less of a rarity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marshmallow&#8217;s novel, big-data approach and successful traction in the market speak for themselves. When we covered the company&#8217;s most recent funding round before this &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/uks-marshmallow-raises-30m-on-a-310m-valuation-for-more-inclusive-car-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 million raise in November 2020</a> &#8212; the startup was valued at $310 million. Now less than a year later, Marshmallow&#8217;s valuation has nearly quadrupled, and it has passed 100,000 policies sold in its home country, growing 100% over the last six months.</p>
<p>The plan now, Oliver told me in an interview, will be to deepen its relationships with customers, in part by providing more engagement to make them better drivers, but also potentially selling more services to them, too.</p>
<p>In this, the startup will be tapping into a new approach that other insurtech startups are taking as they rethink traditional insurance models, much like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yulife-nabs-70m-at-a-346m-valuation-for-its-gamified-wellness-oriented-approach-to-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YuLife</a> is positioning its life insurance products within a bigger wellness and personal improvement business. Currently, the average age of Marshmallow&#8217;s customers is 20 to 40, Oliver said &#8212; and there are some early thoughts of launching new products aimed at even younger users. That means there is long-term value in improving loyalty and keeping those customers for many years to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside that, Marshmallow will also use the funding to inch closer to its plan to expand to markets outside of the U.K. &#8212; a strategy that has been in the works for a while. Marshmallow talked up international expansion in its last round but has yet to announce which markets it will seek to tackle first.</p>
<p>Insurance &#8212; and in particular insurance startups &#8212; are often thought of together with fintech startups, not least because the two industries have a lot in common: they both operate in areas of assessing and mitigating risk and fraud; they are in many cases discretionary investments on the part of the customers; and they are both highly regulated and require watertight data protection for their users.</p>
<p>Perhaps because so much of the hard work is the same for both, it&#8217;s not uncommon to see services built to serve both sectors (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/fintechos-nabs-61-5m-for-a-low-code-approach-to-modernizing-legacy-banking-and-insurance-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/shift-technology-raises-220m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-fight-insurance-fraud-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shift Technology</a> being two examples), for fintech companies to dabble in insurance services, and so on.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Shift Technology raises $220M at a $1B+ valuation to fight insurance fraud with AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/shift-technology-raises-220m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-fight-insurance-fraud-with-ai/embed/#?secret=Dl7sVjSlfw" data-secret="Dl7sVjSlfw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But in reality, insurance &#8212; and specifically car insurance &#8212; has seen a massive impact from COVID-19 unique to that industry. Separate <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_uk/news/2020/11/uk-motor-insurance-market-to-record-profit-in-2020-due-to-covid-19-lockdowns-but-loss-expected-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports from EY</a> and the <a href="https://www.abi.org.uk/news/news-articles/2021/03/pandemic-lockdowns-lead-to-fall-in-motor-insurance-claims-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of British Insurers</a> noted that 2020 actually saw a lift for many car insurance companies: lockdowns meant that fewer people were driving, and therefore fewer were getting into accidents and making fewer claims on policies they took out before the pandemic.</p>
<p>2021, however, has been a different story: new pricing rules being put into place will likely see a number of providers tip into the red for the year. And the <a href="https://www.cii.co.uk/news-insight/coronavirus-hub/articles/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-motor-insurance/91908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chartered Insurance Institute</a> points out that it will also be worth watching to see how the low usage of cars in one year will impact use going forward: some car owners, especially in urban areas where keeping a car is expensive, will inevitably start to question whether they need to own and insure a car at all.</p>
<p>All of this, ironically, actually plays into the hand of a company like Marshmallow, which is providing a more flexible approach to customers who might otherwise be rejected by more traditional companies, or might be priced out of offerings from them. Interestingly, while neobanks have definitely spurred more traditional institutions to try to update their products to compete, the same hasn&#8217;t really happened in insurance &#8212; not yet, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with the idea of the power of data and using a wider range of resources [than incumbents], and using that in our pricing led us to be able to offer better rates to more people,&#8221; Oliver said, but that hasn&#8217;t led to Marshmallow seeing sharper competition from older incumbents. &#8220;They are big companies and stuck in their ways. These companies have been around for decades, some for centuries. Change is not happening quickly.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r51ulGIqg8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/uks-marshmallow-raises-30m-on-a-310m-valuation-for-more-inclusive-car-insurance/">UK&#8217;s Marshmallow raises $30M on a $310M valuation for more &#8216;inclusive&#8217; car insurance</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s Marshmallow raises $30M on a $310M valuation for more &#8216;inclusive&#8217; car insurance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/uks-marshmallow-raises-30m-on-a-310m-valuation-for-more-inclusive-car-insurance/embed/#?secret=r51ulGIqg8" data-secret="r51ulGIqg8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That leaves a big opportunity for companies like Marshmallow and other newer players like Lemonade, Hippo and Jerry (not an insurance startup per se but also dabbling in the space), and a big opening for investors to back new ideas in an industry estimated to be worth $5 trillion.</p>
<p>“The traction the team has achieved demonstrates the demand for a new kind of insurance provider, one that focuses more on consumer experience and uses the latest technology and data to give fair prices,&#8221; said Eileen Burbidge, a partner at Passion Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We’ve been proud to support the team’s ambitions since the start, and now look forward to its next chapter in Europe as it continues its mission to change the industry for the better.” Alongside Passion Capital, Investec and Scor also invested in this round. A full list of backers was not disclosed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to the Daily Crunch for Tuesday, September 7, 2021! Your regular host Alex Wilhelm is AFK for the next few days, so I (Greg Kumparak) will be handling his newsletter duties. Alex may be smarter, nicer and generally a better human than I am, but I&#8217;m at least more … well, more not currently on vacation. I&#8217;ll do my best.</p>
<p>Most of TechCrunch took a lonnnnng weekend (Labor Day + a surprise all-company holiday bestowed upon us by the higher-ups to celebrate the arrival of new even-higher-ups), so let’s check in on what&#8217;s happened since Alex last wrote.</p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/protonmail-logged-ip-address-of-french-activist-after-order-by-swiss-authorities/"><strong>ProtonMail forced to log a user&#8217;s IP:</strong></a> Privacy-minded email service ProtonMail does more than most alternatives to keep user data away from prying eyes, but it&#8217;s not going to break the laws of its home country of Switzerland to do it. Last week a story broke about ProtonMail being pushed by French authorities to reveal the IP of a French activist; it didn&#8217;t initially comply, but had to once that request was rerouted &#8220;to Swiss police via Europol.&#8221; The whole story is an evolving back-and-forth that has grown too complicated to wrap up in a single paragraph, so dive into the linked story for all the details.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/volkswagen-and-argo-ai-reveal-first-id-buzz-test-vehicle-for-autonomous-driving/">VW&#8217;s autonomous driving efforts move forward:</a></strong> Volkswagen&#8217;s commercial vehicle arm has been working with autonomous driving tech company Argo AI, and the pair showed off the mostly final version of its first test vehicle over the weekend. While there&#8217;s no shortage of in-the-works autonomous cars out there, Argo AI is one to watch here; the company is also working with Ford on a self-driving initiative for Lyft, with Argo AI&#8217;s valuation said to have cracked $12 billion back in July.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/hyundai-motor-group-unveils-its-hydrogen-strategy-plans-to-offer-fuel-cell-versions-of-commercial-cars-by-2028/"><strong>Hyundai goes heavy on hydrogen:</strong></a> Have doubts about hydrogen as the fuel source of the future? Hyundai seemingly does not — or, at least, it&#8217;s hedging its bets. The South Korean company announced this morning that it&#8217;ll be making hydrogen fuel cell versions of <em>all</em> of its commercial vehicles by 2028. It&#8217;ll keep working on electric vehicles in parallel, but says it hopes to make hydrogen cost-competitive with EV batteries by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We spent a good chunk of last week covering Y Combinator&#8217;s Demo Day, where <em>hundreds</em> of startups (seriously, hundreds!) debuted to an audience of investors. It&#8217;s gotten big enough that Demo Day has become Demo <em>Days</em>; if you haven&#8217;t already, check out our coverage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">Day One here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">Day Two here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/food-sharing-app-olio-raises-43m-series-b-as-the-world-switches-on-to-the-food-waste-crisis/">OLIO raises $43M to help fight food waste:</a></strong> Got food to spare? Snap a picture of the food, share it with your neighbors and hopefully don&#8217;t let it go to waste. A super nice idea, but can it be a big business?

<h2>A founder’s guide to effectively managing your options pool</h2>
<p>“In today’s cash-rich environment, options are more valuable than cash,” says Allen Miller, a principal at Oak HC/FT.</p>

			Reducing waste is key to meeting environmental milestones, and some retail firms have narrowed in on a unique approach to minimize what their customers throw away: personalization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For big brands and retailers, personalization is expected to be the <a href="https://chainstoreage.com/study-top-10-2021-tech-investment-priorities-retailers-are">top category for tech investment this year</a>. Moreover, personalization holds high appeal, with 80% of survey respondents indicating they are more likely to do business with a company if it offers personalized experiences and 90% indicating that they find personalization appealing, according to <a href="https://us.epsilon.com/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences">a survey by Epsilon</a>.</p>
<p>Startups that deliver sustainable personalization solutions that also improve business for retailers and brands fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>AR virtual try-on with shade matching.</li>
<li>Advanced virtual fitting rooms with VR/AR for fashion.</li>
<li>Smart packaging with IoT and distributed ledger technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AR virtual try-on with shade matching</h2>
<p>Faces are easy to map, since it’s not difficult to virtually place a lipstick color on a face, but using AR and AI to recommend skin-tone-matching makeup products has been challenging for many AR virtual try-on companies. “I’ve been searching for an intuitive foundation-shade-finder tool since launching Cult Beauty in 2008, and nothing has lived up to the experience of having a professional match you in daylight until I discovered MIME,” says Alexia Inge, founder of Cult Beauty. “There are so many variables like light, skin tones, prevalent undertones, device, screen, OS, formula density, formula oxidation, as well as preferences for coverage levels, finish, brand and skin type,” she says.</p>
<p>MIME founder and CEO Christopher Merkle said, &#8220;Virtual try-on has exploded in the past few years, but for color cosmetics, the technology doesn&#8217;t help solve the primary customer pain point: shade matching. From day one, I decided to focus our company&#8217;s R&amp;D efforts exclusively on color accuracy. I want to make sure that when the consumer receives their foundation or concealer in the mail, it&#8217;s the perfect shade once applied to their skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>MIME’s Shade Finder AI allows consumers to take a photo of themselves, answer a few questions, then get matched with a makeup color that pairs with their skin tone. MIME helps retailers and brands increase their online and in-store purchase conversion by up to five times. More than 22% of beauty returns are due to poor customer color purchases, but Merkle says MIME can get returns as low as 0.1%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco-based startup <a href="https://www.orbitfab.space/">Orbit Fab</a> wants to be the go-to source for orbital refueling, and now it has raised over $10 million in its quest to get there. The money will go toward funding a refueling trial that’s due to launch as early as the end of 2022, in which the company plans to send to space two refueling shuttles that will repeatedly perform a three-step dock, transfer fuel and undock process.</p>
<p>The round was led by Asymmetry Ventures, with participation from existing investor SpaceFund and new investors Marubeni Ventures and Audacious Venture Partners. Notably, both Northrop Grumman Corporation and Lockheed Martin Ventures also participated, the first time the two contractor-rivals have done an investment together, Orbit Fab co-founder Jeremy Schiel told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As launch market matures, space opportunities on the ground take off&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/as-launch-market-matures-space-opportunities-on-the-ground-take-off/embed/#?secret=qFcw7RjU1G" data-secret="qFcw7RjU1G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We are the tide that raises all boats,” Schiel said. “We don&#8217;t give either a competitive edge, but we can as a whole have better alternatives for sustainability in space.”</p>
<p>“Getting [the two primes] to play nice with each other,” as he put it, is key for the company, which wants to position itself as the favored source for space refueling. Orbit Fab, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/orbit-fab-gas-stations-in-space-seed-funding/">finalist in our TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in 2019, has developed a refueling valve it calls RAFTI (Rapid Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface) &#8212; but this component must be installed before spacecraft leave Earth, which means that much of the buy-in from major customers like the aerospace contractors must occur before their satellites even enter orbit.</p>
<p>The idea is that spacecraft outfitted with RAFTI would be able to dock with one of Orbit Fab’s refueling shuttles, which would be positioned in low Earth orbit, geostationary orbit and eventually even cis-lunar space. By 2025, Schiel said he hopes every spacecraft will have a RAFTI on it. In the long-term, the company is thinking even bigger: producing fuel in-space, using material mined from asteroids.</p>
<p>“We want to be the Dow Chemical of space,” Schiel said. “We want to be the first customers for lunar miners, asteroid miners, buying up their material that they mined off those bodies, and then convert that to usable propellants that we can produce in-orbit.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orbit Fab says orbital refueling will be the bedrock of the burgeoning new space economy, in which goods and spacecraft will need to be transferred from one orbit to another (a maneuver that’s extremely fuel-intensive), or to build out supply chains to return resources to Earth.</p>
<p>“We want to be that supply chain of propellant,” Schiel added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is exploring ways to build a more visually immersive experience with its latest test, which brings edge-to-edge tweets to the app on iOS.</p>
<p>Full-width images and videos track for the direction the company has shown some interest in going lately. Twitter introduced bigger images with improved cropping controls for its pair of mobile apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-image-cropping-changes/">earlier this year</a>, making plenty of photographers and other visual artists happy that the social network was suddenly a much friendlier platform for sharing their work.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now testing on iOS:</p>
<p>Edge to edge Tweets that span the width of the timeline so your photos, GIFs, and videos can have more room to shine. <a href="https://t.co/luAHoPjjlY">pic.twitter.com/luAHoPjjlY</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435287486411022337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">tested</a> the bigger photos and improved image previews in March before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-image-cropping-changes/">rolling them out broadly two months later</a>, a short timeline we could see again if the test product sticks.</p>
<p>In the current test, tweets fill the full frame from left to right instead of being offset by a pretty large margin on the left. The changes result in much larger images and videos that look better in the feed and a cleaner, more modern design that doesn&#8217;t unnecessarily squish tweets to the right of users&#8217; profile pictures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In testing the feature, Twitter says that it wants to encourage users to have conversations across photos and videos, rather than focusing solely on text like the platform traditionally has. While the result looks like a win to us, any change to Twitter&#8217;s design is likely to inspire a vocal subset of users to hate-tweet about it for a day or so before forgetting the changes altogether.</p>
