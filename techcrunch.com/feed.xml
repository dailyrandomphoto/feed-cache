<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. I&#8217;m back after a one-week hiatus. Did ya miss me? Yes, of course you did.</p>
<p>A lot happened while I was away and I&#8217;ll try my best to highlight the important stuff. Before I get to the hard news, I want to direct your attention to the latest founders Q&amp;A — an ongoing series to highlight people who have started and are running transportation companies. Our twist? We will check on these founders a year from when their interview has been published.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/zum-ceo-ritu-narayan-explains-why-equity-and-accessibility-works-for-mobility-services/">Zūm co-founder and CEO Ritu Narayan</a> was in the hot seat. Check it out.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s been awhile since I have directed y&#8217;all to The Autonocast, the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer. We&#8217;ve had some great episodes in recent weeks, notably our<a href="http://www.autonocast.com/blog/2021/8/18/233-olaf-sakkers-disrupts-mobility"> interview with mobility-focused venture capitalist Olaf Sakkers</a>. He joined the show to discuss &#8220;The Mobility Disruption Framework,&#8221; a funny, insightful book about the trends and technologies transforming the ways we get around. You can <a href="https://www.mobilitydisruptionframework.com/">read the book here</a>.</p>

<h2>Nuro&#8217;s Nevada play</h2>

<p>Earlier this month, we published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">series of articles</a> that took a deep dive into autonomous vehicle technology company Nuro. We mentioned that the company was aiming to move into Nevada. Now, there are more details.</p>
<p>Nuro, which is applying its AV tech to delivery, is investing $40 million to develop a factory and closed course test track in southern Nevada. Nuro co-founder and CEO Jiajun Zhu said this will allow Nuro to &#8220;build tens of thousands of robots.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nuro isn&#8217;t wasting any time getting started. Construction on the factory will begin in fall 2021 and is expected to be completed in 2022. Both the factory and closed-course testing facility are expected to be fully operational in 2022, the company said.</p>
<p>The factory, which will be more than 125,000 square feet, will be used to build Nuro&#8217;s third-generation autonomous vehicles with current and future partners. BYD North America will be Nuro&#8217;s manufacturing partner.</p>
<p>Nuro is also taking over 74 acres of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway to build a closed-course testing facility that will allow the development and validation of its autonomous on-road vehicles. The testing track will measure bot performance in a broad range of scenarios, from avoiding pedestrians and pets to giving bicycles space on shared roadways, as well as environmental tests and vehicle systems validation. the company said.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Rivian has raised more than $10.5 billion in its lifetime, funds that have been directed towards the design, development and production of its first two electric vehicles as well as commercial vans for Amazon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hefty sum that should be enough to fulfill that mission — and more. And yet, even Rivian is no match for the public market&#8217;s siren song.</p>
<p>The company, just weeks before its first electric pickup trucks are expected to be delivered to customers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">confidentially filed paperwork</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. A Rivian IPO announcement has been expected for months now. The valuation the company is shooting for is the big surprise. If Bloomberg&#8217;s sources are right, Rivian is shooting for a valuation roughly around $80 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nearly three times larger than the last valuation I was able to nail down in January. At that time, the company had just raised another $2.65 billion from existing investors T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. New investors also participated in that round, which pushed Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion, a source familiar with the investment round told TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised more money since then. In July, the company announced it had closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in that round. The company did not share a post-money valuation at the time of the July 2021 announcement.</p>
<p>Officially, Rivian says the size and price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coco</strong>, the Los Angeles delivery robot startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/">raised $36 million</a> in a Series A round led by Sam Altman, Silicon Valley Bank and Founders Fund, with participation from Sam Nazarian, Ellen Chen and Mario Del Pero. It brings the company&#8217;s total funding up to around $43 million.</p>
<p><strong>DealerPolicy</strong>, an insurance marketplace for automotive retail, raised $110 million in a Series C rouond led by the Growth Equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Additional investors include 3L Capital and Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. Goldman Sachs&#8217; Paul Pate will also join the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p><strong>Getaround</strong>, the peer-to-peer car-sharing startup, is in talks to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Altitude Acquisition Corp , <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-softbank-backed-getaround-spac-merger-talks-sources-2021-08-25/">Reuters reported</a>. The company has confidentially sought investors to participate in the deal through a private placement in public equity, or PIPE, at a valuation of around $1.7 billion.</p>
<p><strong>HyPoint</strong>, the two-year-old fuel cell developer, has secured a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/hypoint-and-piasecki-reach-6-5m-deal-to-develop-hydrogen-fuel-cells-systems-for-evtols/">$6.5 million development agreement</a> with Piasecki Aircraft Corporation for the design and certification of hydrogen fuel cell systems. Through the partnership, HyPoint aims to deliver five full-scale, 650 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell systems for ground testing, demo flights and the certification process.</p>
<p><strong>KKR</strong>, the global investment firm, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/kkr-to-acquire-new-zealand-bus-company-ritchies-transport-at-value-of-347m/">plans to acquire</a> New Zealand bus and coach company Ritchies Transport, which currently has a fleet of more than 1,600 vehicles and 42 depots that operate across the country. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the circumstances say the deal values Ritchies at over $347 million ($500 million NZD). This is KKR&#8217;s first infrastructure investment in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Malta Inc</strong>., an energy storage company, said that Chevron Technology Ventures and Piva Capital have joined a group of investors including Proman, Alfa Laval, Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Dustin Moskovitz in its oversubscribed Series B financing, increasing the round to more than $60 million.</p>
<p><strong>MaxAB</strong>, the Egyptian B2B e-commerce platform that serves food and grocery retailers, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/maxab-gets-an-extra-15m-acquires-yc-backed-moroccan-startup-waystocap/">$15 million extension</a> from existing investors RMBV, IFC, Flourish Ventures, Crystal Stream Capital, Rise Capital, Endeavour Catalyst, Beco Capital and 4DX Ventures. The extension brings its total Series A fundraise to $55 million.</p>
<p><strong>Point Pickup Technologies</strong>, a last-mile delivery service, acquired white-label e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/point-pickup-acquires-e-commerce-platform-grocerkey-for-42m-to-allow-for-same-day-delivery/">GrocerKey for $42 million</a>. The acquisition means Point Pickup will be able to offer retailers services such as same-day delivery under their own brand name, rather than under third parties like Instacart.</p>
<p><strong>Upstream</strong>, the Israeli automotive security firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/automotive-cybersecurity-startup-upstream-raises-62m-series-c-to-scale-cloud-based-security/">raised $62 million</a> in a Series C funding round led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and was joined by new investors I.D.I. Insurance, 57 Stars&#8217; NextGen Mobility Fund and La Maison Partners. Existing investors Glilot Capital, Salesforce venture, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Nationwide, Delek US and others also participated in the round. With this latest round, the company has raised a total of $105 million since its founding in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo Group</strong> has agreed to buy heavy duty truck subsidiary of Jiangling Motors Corp for about 1.1 billion Swedish crowns ($125.7 million) to make trucks in China, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ab-volvo-buys-chinese-vehicles-business-about-sek-11-bln-2021-08-23/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! The stalemate over the budget reconciliation that I warned might take months to break &#8212; just kidding! The House managed to pass the $3.5 trillion budget resolution and made progress on the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Tuesday, in a 220-212 bipartisan vote. The vote includes a non-binding agreement to vote on the infrastructure bill by Sept. 27.</p>
<p>The path is now clear for Democrats to pass one of the most socially progressive budgets in decades, with a slew of social safety net provisions for childcare, healthcare, climate and education. House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> had previously sworn she would stall the infrastructure bill until the budget passed, so the infrastructure bill passing sometime in our lifetime is suddenly looking like a much more realistic proposal!</p>
<p>Progressive Democrats in particular are committed to keeping the fate of the two bills intertwined. &#8220;We will only vote for the infrastructure bill after passing the reconciliation bill,&#8221; Progressive Caucus chairwoman, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), said in a statement.</p>
<p>Speaking of the two bills&#8230; while consumer incentives for electric vehicles were slashed from the infrastructure bill, they did survive the budget reconciliation. Right now, there currently exists a 30D tax credit, but the $7,500 incentive doesn&#8217;t include automakers that have sold more than 200,000 EVs (so General Motors and Tesla don&#8217;t qualify).</p>
<p>Leilani Gonzalez with the Zero Emission Transportation Association urged reform to the EV tax credit. She suggested that Congress slash means-testing for the credit, like one that only allows people under a certain annual income to access it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress should ensure that this tax credit is not impeded by restrictive means-tested requirements, like low manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price (MSRP) or adjusted gross income (AGI) caps,&#8221; <a href="https://www.zeta2030.org/insights/we-cant-tackle-the-climate-crisis-without-robust-electric-vehicle-incentives-for-all-americans">she wrote</a>. &#8220;These limitations ignore the public benefits of EVs that leave everyone better off, and they would only serve to hinder EV adoption.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even beyond reform, some Democrats are pushing for a direct cash rebate &#8212; meaning that the dollar amount would just be taken off the cost of the car at the point of sale, rather than the consumer having to wait to get that money back at tax time. But we&#8217;re still a long way from seeing a new kind of consumer incentive put into law, with some Democrats urging a $12,500 tax credit, and others arguing for a rebate, with still others arguing for either but with means-testing like what Gonzalez writes about.</p>
<p>In any case, we&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on it. It&#8217;s very hard to imagine how the country will achieve any kind of meaningful transition to electric vehicles by 2030 without some mechanism to make them easier (and cheaper) to buy.</p>
<p>In other news, the Federal Aviation Administration is spending $20.4 million in grants to airports who want to electrify equipment and transition to ZEVs. This isn&#8217;t about the planes themselves, though they tend to get the most media attention. These grants would be for less sexy things like airport shuttle buses and mobile ground power units, but which collectively still generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. The FAA has earmarked $300 million out of its $3.5 billion budget for electrification initiatives.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of those weeks folks. Lotta news so let&#8217;s get down to it.</p>
<h3>ADAS</h3>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> admitted that the latest version of its so-called FSD tech — which is an upgraded version of its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system — is &#8220;not great.&#8221; He went on to write that the &#8220;Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. We&#8217;re trying to have a single tech stack for both highway &amp; city streets, but it requires massive [neural network] retraining.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, GM&#8217;s self-driving car subsidiary, launched a new initiative called Farm to Fleet that will allow the company to source solar power from farms in California&#8217;s Central Valley. Cruise is directly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/cruise-is-buying-solar-energy-from-california-farmers-to-power-its-electric-self-driving-fleet/">purchasing renewable energy credits</a> from Sundale Vineyards and Moonlight Companies to help power its fleet of all-electric autonomous vehicles in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>Jalopnik&#8217;s</strong> Jason Torchinsky <a href="https://jalopnik.com/lots-of-people-seem-to-completely-misunderstand-the-aut-1847541014">has a great explainer</a> on the various levels of SAE autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35952477.html">suspended the operation</a> of its e-Palette autonomous shuttles — which do have two human safety operators on board — at the Paralympic Games Athletes&#8217; Village after one of the shuttles struck an athlete. The schedule for resuming operations at the Paralympic Games has not yet been determined, the company said. A spokesperson also noted to me that only the shuttles at the Olympics were halted. The e-Palette program is still operational.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Since the newsletter went out to subscribers over the weekend, Toyota has restarted the e-Palette shuttles in the Olympic village. It&#8217;s important to note that these shuttles use a combination of manual and autonomous driving modes while underway. Toyota President Akio Toyoda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXhG_hFNK4">apologized for the incident</a> during a recent interview. The translation provided in closed captioning isn&#8217;t great, but he does make some interesting comments about the readiness of autonomous vehicle technology. In short: it&#8217;s not ready and humans are still better drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">launched a robotaxi service</a> that will be open to certain vetted riders in San Francisco. The company officially kicked off its Waymo One Trusted Tester program in the city with a fleet of all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with the company&#8217;s fifth generation of its autonomous vehicle system. This is a big step for Waymo and we&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how the ramp mirrors, or differs, from its service in the Phoenix area.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Bensinger</strong> took a look at the terms of service on the Waymo One ride-hailing app <a href="https://twitter.com/GregBensinger/status/1430234711897509891">and in a tweet thread</a> provides a breakdown of what riders are agreeing to, including that the company will record video of riders while being driven around San Francisco.</p>
<p>Waymo also has decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/waymo-will-stop-selling-its-self-driving-lidar-sensors-to-other-companies/">get out of the lidar sales business</a> as it shifts its focus to deploying its autonomous vehicle technology across its ride-hailing and trucking divisions. In 2019, Waymo announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/waymo-to-start-selling-standalone-lidar-sensors/">sell its short-range lidar</a>, called Laser Bear Honeycomb, to companies outside of self-driving cars. It initially targeted robotics, security and agricultural technology.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> expanded (again) its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/gm-says-it-will-seek-reimbursement-from-lg-chem-for-1b-chevy-bolt-recall-losses/">recall of Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles</a> due to fire risks from battery manufacturing defects. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from LG Chem, its battery cell manufacturing partner, for what it expects to be $1 billion worth of losses. this is the third recall GM has issued for this vehicle related to batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> hired Daniel A. Ninivaggi, a longtime automotive executive and former head of Carl C. Icahn&#8217;s holding company, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/lordstown-motors-taps-former-icahn-exec-as-ceo-to-put-its-ev-truck-ambitions-back-on-track/">CEO and a board member</a>. The appointment follows months of tumult at Lordstown, which became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<h3>Other bits</h3>
<p><strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> wrote up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/yc-grad-buoyant-wants-to-solve-middle-mile-delivery-with-cargo-airships/">feature on Buoyant</a>, a recent Y Combinator grad and one of several airship startups that have popped up recently.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s</strong> chief technology officer Sajjad Khan is leaving the automaker to start a <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51095656&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9OZXdzT25seUNvbXBhbnkmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZmbGV4SW5mb1R5cGVzPTQwNjI2JTJDNDA2MzA!&amp;rs=0">venture capital fund</a>, the company said in a statement. Khan&#8217;s replacement, Magnus Östberg, will take over the CTO role effective Sept. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Porsche Cars North America</strong> added its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/porsche-expands-online-marketplace-to-include-us-inventory-of-new-cars/">entire U.S. inventory of new cars</a> to an online marketplace that it launched in May 2020. The platform called Porsche Finder is one of the ways the automaker is trying to keep up with customer demands and the industry&#8217;s shift to digital commerce. The product lets customers search by vehicle model and generation as well as price, equipment, packages and colors, on all new and used vehicle inventory from its 193 U.S. dealerships.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> wants to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/tesla-wants-to-sell-electricity-in-texas/">supply electricity directly to customers</a>, according to an application filed with Texas electricity regulators earlier this month. Energy Choice Matters first reported on the application.</p>
<p>The application, filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas on August 16, is a request to become what&#8217;s called a &#8220;retail electric provider&#8221; under its subsidiary Tesla Energy Ventures. On the deregulated, idiosyncratic Texas power market, REPs generally purchase wholesale electricity from power generators and sell it to customers. More than 100 REPs currently compete on the open market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you hear the word, “enterprise” and you immediately think software instead of Star Trek, you’re going to love this post — and the SaaS and Enterprise-focused knowledge waiting for you at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=saaspost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.</p>
<p>We’ve packed a veritable boatload of Grade A prime programming into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true&amp;promo=saaspost">three full days of Disrupt</a>. Prepare to hear and learn from an endless parade of tech icons, visionaries, movers, shakers and unicorn makers. We’re talking more than 80 scheduled offerings, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Join your people:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true&amp;promo=saaspost">Buy your pass</a> today and get ready to hear from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">leading voices</a> across the startup spectrum.</p>
<p>Where were we? Ah, yes — we’re here to help save you a bit of time by spotlighting just some of the sessions focused on enterprise software and SaaS. Plus, we’ll have a dedicated Disrupt Desk session where industry experts, like Emergence Capital’s Carlotta (Lotti) Siniscalco, and TechCrunch editors will break it down with deep-analysis, insight and likely a laugh or two.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">the Disrupt agenda</a> for exact days and times, and then plan your daily schedule in advance.</p>
<h3>From Bootstrapped to Billions</h3>
<p><em>Dozens have tried to reinvent the calendar, and dozens have failed. <strong>Tope Awotona</strong> built <strong>Calendly</strong> not as a way to reinvent the wheel, but to add a layer of simplicity to the chaos of human communication and time management. And boy did it work! The once-bootstrapped company is now worth more than $3 billion, serving individuals and enterprises alike. Hear from the founder and CEO on how he got Calendly off the ground, why he decided to finally take institutional investment, and how the company has changed as it grows.</em></p>
<h3>An Unstoppable Force and an Immovable Object</h3>
<p><em>Slack and Salesforce are two of the biggest names in tech. The communication tool (born from one of the odder pivots in tech history) is commonplace across organizations from almost every industry. It’s an unstoppable force. The sales CRM behemoth is used all over the world by sales teams small and large. An immovable object. In December of 2020, the pair announced a $27.7 billion merger. Hear from <strong>Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor</strong> about the future of the combined entity, why the deal made sense, and what it’s like to write down that many 0’s.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Powering the Small Business Economy with Cloud Technology</h3>
<p><em>Small business is a critical engine of job creation, economic growth, innovation and a driver in our efforts to recover from a global pandemic. Fifteen years ago, a New Zealand start-up called Xero was founded with the purpose of making life better for small businesses and their advisors. Xero achieved this by shifting accounting practices to the cloud and providing an open set of APIs, which has enabled more than 1,000 application partners to build affordable tech solutions connected to the Xero platform. <strong>Xero CEO, Steve Vamos</strong>, will discuss how Xero is revolutionizing the way small businesses do business by using the cloud and its platform to connect real-time data with bespoke business solutions that help small business owners be more successful. Steve will speak to a number of key initiatives that will change the game for startups and entrepreneurs who want to innovate and collaborate on the Xero platform, and he will explain how Xero’s vision extends beyond just technology to galvanizing a global community of support and purpose to help small businesses everywhere. Presented by Xero.</em></p>
<h3>Powering What’s Next: Insights from the Enterprise Software Market</h3>
<p><em>Spurred by digital transformation and the recent shift to remote work, the enterprise software industry has gone from strength-to-strength, and competition for deals and valuations are at all-time-highs. While investor appetite for enterprise software may be strong, it doesn’t mean that all tech businesses make worthy investments. In this panel, hear from <strong>Michael Fosnaugh and Monti Saroya, co-heads of Vista’s flagship investment strategy</strong>, and a selection of Vista CEOs on the hallmarks of best-in-class software companies and trends driving the industry. Presented by Vista Equity Partners.</em></p>
<h3>Achieve Sustainable IT with Prometheus, Grafana and Hardware Sentry</h3>
<p><em>Implementing sustainability initiatives to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the data center is a vital challenge. Join <strong>Bertrand Martin, Sentry Software’s co-founder and CEO</strong>, as he presents Hardware Sentry Exporter for Prometheus. Measure the power consumption and temperature of more than 250 platforms with this unique pure-software solution. Report CO₂ emissions, electricity usage and costs of applications and services in Grafana. Reduce the carbon footprint of your datacenter with intelligent optimization of ambient temperature. Presented by Sentry Software.</em></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>We are heading into a simply crazy week, so make sure that you keep Twitter pulled up as often as you can. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is Y Combinator Demo Day week</strong>, which means a zillion startups are going to be doing their best to make noise, stand out from their peers, and raise capital on uncapped notes sans discount. TechCrunch is going to be busy as bees tracking the accelerator cohort, and bringing our favorites to your ears and eyes.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <strong>Chinese regulatory story continues</strong>, with new gaming restrictions and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week?sref=gni836kR">fresh warnings about anti-monopoly action</a> coming this morning. As before, the news is moving stocks. And the gaming news underscores that the Chinese state is not too bothered about directly undercutting its private sector to meet government goals.</li>
<li><strong>All that regulatory work is harming venture capital investment</strong>, it appears. Despite a rapid-fire July for Chinese startups, <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-08-30/china-venture-capital-deals-shrink-amid-regulatory-concerns-101763857.html">August is looking thinner from a foreign-investor perspective</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/north-base-media-leads-2-7m-pre-series-a-funding-in-digital-media-startup-vietcetera/">Vietcetera has raised new capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/korean-3d-spatial-data-tool-startup-urbanbase-closes-11-1m-series-b-round/">along with Urbanbase</a>. In India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">Ola Electric is looking to raise a huge amount of capital</a>, we report.</li>
<li>In public market news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">Astra&#8217;s rocket didn&#8217;t go up high enough</a>, so its shares are falling. And we are heading back into an IPO cycle, so get ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright! That&#8217;s our show! Let&#8217;s get to work!</p>
<p><i>Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PST, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:00 a.m. PST, so subscribe to us on </i><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215439780"><i>Apple Podcasts</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1215439780/equity"><i>Overcast</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=rZDFHv2sQUul_g94iCRgpQ"><i>Spotify</i></a><i> and all the casts!</i></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The startup has big plans: It is moving into the cryptocurrency market, it announced this morning, and partnering with Plaid to make money transfer easier for investors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://alpaca.markets/">Alpaca</a> said this morning that it has closed a massive $50 million Series B round of capital. TechCrunch previously covered the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/alpaca-stock-trading-api/">late-2019 $6 million seed round</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/alpaca-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-api-powered-equities-trading-service/">late-2020 $10 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Alpaca offers equities trading software via API. The company initially allowed firms to plug into its technology, powering the trading capabilities of investing groups. More recently, Alpaca has begun allowing other fintech companies to offer equities trading through its service to their consumer user bases, work that fits under the larger embedded finance trend.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital led the company&#8217;s Series B, which saw participation from existing investors Spark Capital, Portage Ventures and Social Leverage. New investors including Horizons Ventures also put funds into the round.</p>
<p>Alpaca is an interesting startup. During the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">savings-and-trading boom of 2020</a>, we used the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/whats-driving-api-powered-startups-forward-in-2020/">company&#8217;s trading volume</a> growth as a proxy not only for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/api-startups-are-so-hot-right-now/">growth of API-delivered software startups</a>, but also as a window into interest in buying and selling U.S. equities more broadly.</p>
<p>By now offering its trading services to fintechs with consumer end users &#8212; the B2B2C model, if you will &#8212; Alpaca has expanded its market remit. Per the startup, the number of brokerage accounts it supports has risen some 1,500% this year to more than 100,000. The startup&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/iyoshyoshi">Yoshi Yokokawa,</a> told TechCrunch that it expects to secure 100 partners for its equities trading tech by the end of 2021. That figure was zero at the end of 2020, before its embedded finance product was released.</p>
<p>For Alpaca, working with more fintech companies opens up new revenue streams. The company will continue to generate payment for order flow incomes (PFOF), it said, but by supporting international customers, it can also earn incomes from foreign exchange fees and more.</p>
<p>Notably, Alpaca intends to make its service an anti-cost center by sharing PFOF revenues with partners that embed its fintech APIs. Yokokawa declined to share the PFOF split with customers, but our guess is that something around 15% to 25% makes sense, providing incentives to potential partners to choose Alpaca over rival tech while keeping enough top line on the Alpaca side of the ledger to continue building a venture-scale business.</p>
<p>The startup has big plans: It is moving into the cryptocurrency market, it announced this morning, and partnering with Plaid to make money transfer easier for investors. Recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">results from Robinhood</a>, a consumer trading platform popular in the United States, helped underscore just how lucrative crypto trading can be for platforms.</p>
<p>Why raise $50 million? TechCrunch was curious why the company would put so much capital onto its books in a single shot instead of raising a more modest round of, say, $25 million, still a healthy figure for a Series B and one closer in size to its preceding Series A.</p>
<p>Yokokawa said Alpaca has a lot of stuff to build. And to build it all is going to take a lot of folks. Alpaca had just 10 employees when COVID-19 hit, which means that the company has a lot of hiring in front of it. And the sorts of developers it needs, we suppose, aren&#8217;t going to come cheap.</p>
<p>Still, big rounds mean big expectations, from both investors and the observer team (that&#8217;s us) as well. We&#8217;ll check back with the company in a few months to see if it is on track to reach its partner goal for 2021.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Poppi is on a mission to lead in the new category of “functional soda” by offering a better-for-you product that also tastes good.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.drinkpoppi.com/">Poppi</a>, a prebiotic soda brand, closed $13.5 million in a Series A2 round and is on a mission to lead in the new category of “functional soda” by offering a better-for-you product that also tastes good.</p>
<p>The investor group includes CAVU Ventures as well as sports and entertainment celebrities like Russell Westbrook, the Chainsmokers, 24kGoldn, Kygo, Halsey, Kevin Love, Ellie Goulding, Olivia Munn, Nicole Scherzinger, Chantel Jeffries, Bryce Hall, Noah Beck, Josh Richards, Griffin Johnson and Blake Gray.</p>
<p>Husband-and-wife co-founders Stephen and Allison Ellsworth, former oil and gas researchers, launched the soda in 2020 after Allison Ellsworth began having stomach issues about two years prior. She went to doctor after doctor without a definitive diagnosis and decided to take to the internet to find some answers. She not only found that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a18e644abb994b3ca76211179751129b">80% of our body’s immunity stems from gut health</a>, but that she could assist by healing her body through food.</p>
<p>One of the foods that helped with the stomach issues was apple cider vinegar, but drinking it straight everyday became difficult for her. So she went into the kitchen and began concocting a drink that would help her tolerate the vinegar and be tasty enough to drink regularly.</p>
<p>What resulted was a drink that eventually became a hit at a Dallas farmers market, which is where the pair was approached to sell Poppi in Whole Foods Market. They then decided to quit their jobs and do Poppi full time, even gaining a deal from CAVU Ventures co-founder Rohan Oza on <a href="https://www.drinkpoppi.com/shark-tank/">Shark Tank</a> in December 2018.</p>
<p>Each can of Poppi includes approximately a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, sparkling water, real fruit and plant-based sweeteners mixed into a formula that provides a balance of gut-friendly prebiotics known to aid in digestion, immunity and glowing skin.</p>
<p>The drinks retail for $2.49 per can and come in nine flavors like watermelon, strawberry lemon, raspberry rose and orange. They are available in over 7,500 retail locations, including Target, Safeway, Kroger, Publix, Whole Foods and Amazon.com.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Now the Ellsworths say they are receiving comments from consumers who say Poppi has “changed their lives.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we are putting out a product that is healthy and tastes good,” Allison Ellsworth said. “We don’t want to be a niche health product — that is secondary to what we are trying to do, but it’s a bonus that we get that, too.”</p>
<p>Another bonus is that within the functional soda category, which has grown 465% year over year based on data from research company SPINS, the Ellsworths boast their annual growth put Poppi in the No. 1 spot based on four-week data from SPINS ending June 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Prior to the round, the company was bootstrapped. Proceeds will be used to expand distribution, scale Poppi’s team of 50 currently and marketing. The company is based in Dallas for now, but Allison Ellsworth said the company is moving its headquarters to Austin.</p>
<p>The company grew its revenue 550% year over year and the funding assists in giving Poppi a burn rate of 12 months and the ability to continue in high-growth mode, Stephen Ellsworth said.</p>
<p>Stevie Clements, chief brand architect at CAVU Ventures and a member of Poppi’s board, said via email that the company’s product, founders and growth to date were the drivers for her firm to invest in the company.</p>
<p>In addition, people are looking for products like Poppi that do more for them, while gut health, in particular, is a highly relevant category. The company’s ability to “deliver real function with incredible flavor is unlike anything on the market,” she said.</p>
<p>“Soda is a massive category ripe for disruption, and Stephen and Allison are a great team with an authentic story that’s really proven to resonate with people,” Clements added. “We’re excited by what Poppi has accomplished thus far and feel strongly that a better-for-you soda that tastes amazing and offers real function can shake up the multibillion dollar soda category.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ragnarok, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang operational since 2019 that gained notoriety after launching attacks against unpatched Citrix ADC servers, has shut down and released a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/decryption/">decryption key</a> for its victims.</p>
<p>The gang, sometimes referred to as Asnarok, last week replaced all 12 of the victims listed on its dark web portal with a short instruction on how to decrypt files. This was accompanied by the release of a decryptor, which experts at Emsisoft confirmed contains the master decryption key. The security firm, known for assisting ransomware victims with data decryption, has also released <a href="https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/ragnarok">a universal decryptor</a> for Ragnarok ransomware.</p>
<p>Ragnarok is best known for using the Ragnar Locker ransomware to target IT networks. It claimed dozens of victims after exploiting a Citrix ADC vulnerability to search for Windows computers that are vulnerable to the EternalBlue vulnerability — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/12/wannacry-two-years-on/">the same vulnerability behind the now-notorious WannaCry attack</a> — and has racked up more than $4.5 million in ransom payments, according to the <a href="https://ransomwhe.re">Ransomwhe.re</a> payments tracker.</p>
<p>In April 2020, the cybercriminals stole 10 terabytes of data belonging to Portuguese energy giant EDP and threatened to leak it if a ransom of $10.9 million was not paid. The gang went on to exfiltrate up to 2TB of data, including bank statements, employee records, and celebrity agreements, from the servers of Italian liquor giant Campari Group, and demanded it hands over $15 million in ransom.</p>
<p>And in November, the short-lived ransomware gang also targeted Capcom, the Japanese video games giant behind titles such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and Devil May Cry. The gang reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/capcom-resident-evil-game-maker-breach-ransomware/">stole the personal data of 390,000 customers</a>, business partners, and other external parties from Capcom’s systems.</p>
<p>News of the shut down was <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarok-ransomware-releases-master-decryptor-after-shutdown/">first reported</a> by Bleeping Computer.</p>
<p>With no formal departure note, it’s not clear why Ragnarok has seemingly decided to call it quits. But other ransomware gangs have adopted a similar self-destruction tactic in the face of increasing pressure from the U.S. government, which earlier this year branded ransomware as a national security threat; REvil, the gang behind the JBS attack, mysteriously disappeared from the internet, and DarkSide, the gang behind <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">the Colonial Pipeline incident</a>, also announced it was retiring.</p>
<p>Other ransomware gangs, including Ziggy Avaddon, SynAck, and Fonix, have also all retired from hacking this year, each giving up their keys to help victims recover from their attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Ragnarok&#8217;s disappearance is permanent, or whether it will simply rebrand; the infamous DoppelPayment ransomware gang recently reappeared as Grief Ransomware after months of no activity.</p>
<p>“Even though I am sure is only temporary, it is nice to see another win,” <a href="https://twitter.com/uuallan/status/1431075394023792641">tweeted</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/uuallan">Allan Liska</a>, from Recorded Future’s Computer Security Incident Response Team.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Flip mixes a live commerce mobile app with real customer reviews to improve the buying experience and opportunity for the creator economy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social commerce startup <a href="http://www.flip.shop">Flip</a> is mixing live commerce mobile apps with real customer reviews to improve the buying experience and opportunity for the creator economy. Today, the Los Angeles-based company closed on a $28 million Series A led Streamlined Ventures.</p>
<p>Nooruldeen “Noor” Agha, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur, founded Flip in 2019 after emigrating to the United States from Iraq. He had previously lived in Dubai, where he built some companies in the e-commerce space.</p>
<p>It was while leading the companies that he realized that the vision of commerce was broken and that people had a fragmented path to purchase: They may start on social media, then move to video platforms and conclude on yet another site to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Agha believes the future of e-commerce will be driven by shoppers and the experiences they have with social media, so Flip is pulling all of those experiences into one app, mixing in user-generated reviews and live shopping shows for beauty, wellness and health brands. It then adds same-day shipping and back-end logistics, Agha told TechCrunch. Users post video reviews of their purchases and can see in real-time data how they did, as well as receive commissions from sales that resulted from their posts.</p>
<p>“It’s not only a social platform, it is the best post-purchase experience — shipping, rewards, returns — everything people love and in a two-click process,” he added. “Our app is like if TikTok and Amazon had a baby.”</p>
<p>Joining Streamlined Ventures in the latest round is Mubadala Capital Ventures, BDMI and a group of early backers and angel investors, including Ruby Lu, an early investor in Kuaishou, China’s leading social commerce platform. In total, Flip raised $31.5 million, which includes a small seed two years ago, Agha said.</p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to scale the company and its creator ecosystem, while also expanding the end-to-end logistics part of the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live commerce originated in China, where McKinsey estimates the market reached <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">$171 billion in 2020</a> and will jump to a valuation of $423 billion by 2022. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinlarson/2021/03/27/retailers-embrace-livestreaming-market-expected-to-reach-11-billion-in-2021/?sh=5ce4f2d32fde">U.S. live commerce market</a> is trailing behind, expecting to reach $11 billion by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Flip is now signing an average of 20 new brands per week and has already gained partnerships with Unilever and Coty. Agha expects to hit 500 brands by this year’s holiday season. In addition, the company has 1 million downloads and in the last quarter shopped out 30,000 orders, which Agha predicts will double in coming months.</p>
<p>“We were hiding on purpose so we could build out everything and be done when we launched,” he added. “We focused on onboarding brands instead of pushing for growth, but now we expect to have a grand launch at the end of September where we start aggressively pushing growth.”</p>
<p>Ullas Naik, founder and general partner of Streamlined Ventures, said his firm does a lot of investment in e-commerce and marketplaces and was one of the first investors in DoorDash and also backed Rappi.</p>
<p>Commerce has evolved over the past 20 years in a meaningful way, he said. During that time, spend shifted from retail and online, while the quality of the experience has also evolved. He has seen evidence of similar models in other geographies, particularly in China when they have “had massive success.”</p>
<p>“We are most intrigued with how live commerce intersects with social networking to create enhanced shopping experiences,” Naik said. “When I met with Noor and he told me he was going to start with beauty and cosmetics, I thought he was building a unique experience and wanted him to be in a broad range of categories, not just beauty. With what he is building on the back end, with the logistics piece, he is creating a super experience and I’m intrigued by what can be built.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The mobile app provides tools for travel creators to build their own travel-based businesses in order to curate, share and soon sell interactive travel guides and planning services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a difficult year, the <a href="https://www.ustravel.org/research/monthly-travel-data-report">travel industry is gaining steam</a> again this summer and <a href="https://www.thatch.co">Thatch</a> is carving out a space for itself in the sector by enabling travel creators to monetize their recommendations.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $3 million Seed II round led by Wave Capital. They were joined by Freestyle VC’s Jenny Lefcourt and Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph. It brings Thatch’s total investment to $5.2 million since the company was founded by West Askew, Abby West and Shane Farmer in 2018.</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic, the company was a subscription-based consumer travel service that matched travelers with someone who would essentially plan their trips from top to bottom. Then the industry came to a grinding halt in 2020, and the co-founders saw a bigger need to help travel creators — those who share their experiences on social media — better connect to their followers and capture value for the travel recommendations, tips and perspectives they create.</p>
<p>“We noticed consumers were willing to pay individuals for their time and expertise,” Abby West told TechCrunch. “Increasingly, instead of going to travel agencies, they are going to Instagram or YouTube and then DM&#8217;ing them for information. We are formalizing that relationship so that the travel creator can get paid and can then provide a better experience for the end user.”</p>
<p>Askew and West say travel creators <a href="https://skift.com/2021/06/28/travels-creator-economy-is-poised-for-next-boom/">drive billions of dollars of consumer travel spending</a>. Thatch’s free mobile app provides tools for them to build their own travel-based businesses in order to curate, share and will soon be able to sell interactive travel guides and planning services. Thatch makes money when the creators do, taking a small percentage of the transactions.</p>
<p>While the pandemic was detrimental to the travel industry, it gave the Thatch team time to build out its app, and now it is focused on building the creator side and marketing to attract creators to the app. This is where the new funding will come in: The company intends to hire additional engineers, build out new content and launch new features for selling or earning tips on interactive guides that creators produce in the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195315" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195315" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195315" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thatch_app_1390x1390.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195315" class="wp-caption-text">Thatch app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thatch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new tab)</span></p>
<p>Among the travel creators already using the app, their audience reach is over 12 million, and the company saw a bump in usage in July, a sign that the travel industry is improving, Askew said.</p>
<p>Following the seed, the company will go live with the monetization and booking features so the creators can get paid, and it is looking at a strong first quarter in terms of potential bookings. The founders also want to attract larger creators and build a network for them, with Askew saying they need to be considered like the small businesses that they are and wants to help them grow.</p>
<p>“There is unfortunately a graveyard full of travel companies, but we are doing things differently,” West said. “We are unique with our people-to-people angle, and in this case, with people who have a built-in audience and who are trusted by that audience. That is something we don&#8217;t see in this space today.”</p>
<p>Wave Capital’s general partner Riley Newman said he and his other general partner, Sara Adler, both former Airbnb executives, were introduced to the company through one of Thatch’s existing investors.</p>
<p>His firm typically invests in marketplaces at the seed stage and the investment in Thatch marks the first into the travel sector, saying, “It is one we know well from Airbnb and a good moment to dive back into the industry.”</p>
<p>The travel market is poised for growth in the years ahead, especially with the pent-up demand for travel post-pandemic, Newman said. At the same time, the creator economy is on the same trajectory to democratize travel planning similar to the way he said Airbnb did, and that was a compelling vision for Wave Capital.</p>
<p>“Travel planning has been around for a long time, but this is an interesting new angle,” Newman added. “We look at the founding team and see Abby and West having complementary backgrounds and energy. This is a good moment for travel given their approach, and their concept for attacking the market is right and needed.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Berlin-based Xayn, which as we reported last year is doing ad-free, personalized, privacy-safe search as an alternative to tracking and profiling adtech giants like Google, has expanded its product offering &#8212; launching a desktop version (in beta for now). The desktop Xayn WebBeta is described as a &#8220;light web version&#8221; of the product with similar functionality [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.xayn.com/">Xayn</a>, which as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/xayn-is-privacy-safe-personalized-mobile-web-search-powered-by-on-device-ais/">reported last year</a> is doing ad-free, personalized, privacy-safe search as an alternative to tracking and profiling adtech giants like Google, has expanded its product offering &#8212; launching a desktop version (in beta for now).</p>
<p>The desktop Xayn WebBeta is described as a &#8220;light web version&#8221; of the product with similar functionality to the mobile app &#8212; though of course there are differences, such as not being able to literally swipe on content to signal interest/disinterest, as you do on Xayn&#8217;s mobile apps.</p>
<p>Xayn isn&#8217;t a browser itself, per se, though it&#8217;s crossing the streams a bit (and can self-describe as a &#8220;browsing engine&#8221;) &#8212; since, as well as private search, it also offers an in-app browsing experience by populating a feed with snippets of content organized in the form of a discovery/news feed.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll likely notice a short lag on loading the software in a desktop browser (also true on mobile) as Xayn&#8217;s AI figures out what to populate this feed with. It seems marginally longer the first time you fire the software up &#8212; when it&#8217;s starting from scratch (localizing the content to your country) vs repeat visits when the AI will have your individual browsing signals to work with.</p>
<p>On the desktop Xayn, you can signal a like or dislike on a particular piece of content by hovering the mouse next to the green (to like) or pink (to dislike) bar, which appear on the left and right sides of the content box respectively, and then clicking on the up (or down) thumb icon that pops up. So it&#8217;s actually a left click to like.</p>
<p>And if you really don&#8217;t need another feed in your online life you can switch off the discovery view &#8212; and have only a search bar on loading.</p>
<p>Search results are displayed by default in a similar grid of rectangular content panes to the discovery feed. Which is a little lacking in information density for this information worker&#8230;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2194910" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194910" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194910" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png 2442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=1536,991 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=2048,1322 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-27-at-09.22.00.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194910" class="wp-caption-text">Sample search result page as seen on Xayn&#8217;s WebBeta version (Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Xayn&#8217;s learning AI can be toggled off whenever you like, by clicking on the brain icon in the top right. Say if you want to browse &#8216;unwatched&#8217; &#8212; i.e. without the stuff you&#8217;re looking at being used as learning material for the AI to decide what else you&#8217;ll get shown (both for content in the feed and search results).</p>
<p>You can also reset the learning manually by clearing your browsing data &#8212; if you want to purge the whole thing and start again.</p>
<p>Another carrot to entice users is no ads: Xayn is ad-free &#8212; which of course isn&#8217;t the case with other non-tracking private search engines (like DuckDuckGo or Qwant), which tend to rely on showing contextual ads.</p>
<p>And in another break from the search industry &#8216;norm&#8217;, its AI&#8217;s search algorithms are <a href="https://github.com/xaynetwork/xayn_ai">open source</a>.</p>
<p>Other features available on the desktop version of Xayn include a &#8216;deep search&#8217; offering that it says lets users dive into a topic via &#8220;a simple click to be shown a personal reference library of relevant content&#8221;; and &#8216;collections&#8217; &#8212; a bookmark-like offering which lets users &#8220;collect and store their favorite web content by creating, filling, and managing collections&#8221;.</p>
<p>Plus, as well as being ad-free itself, Xayn has baked in an ad blocker &#8212; blocking ads on third party sites for a &#8220;noise-free&#8221; browsing experience as it puts it.</p>
<p>Its first focus for the desktop is Chromium-based browsers and Firefox &#8212; so Safari users will need to switch to a supported browser to kick the tyres of its WebBeta.</p>
<p>The mobile version of Xayn&#8217;s product launched back in December and has been downloaded more than 250,000 times worldwide since then, according to the startup.</p>
<p>Three months after launch it says users were already conducting 100,000+ active daily searches &#8212; feeding in the browsing data and interest-based swipes that the AI uses to train and improve the personalized content discovery which is core to Xayn&#8217;s value proposition. And because it&#8217;s doing all this learning and reranking on device it&#8217;s able to tout its user-specific search results as &#8216;privacy safe&#8217;.</p>
<p>It also tries to avoid a filter bubble type effect by consciously injecting variance &#8212; so its algorithms don&#8217;t always just feed users more of the same.</p>
<p>Both the desktop and mobile version of Xayn use a technique called Masked Federated Learning to tailor the user&#8217;s web experience without compromising their privacy.</p>
<p>Google is also of course working on evolving its own ad targeting technology &#8212; currently it&#8217;s piloting a technology called FloCs (aka &#8216;federated learning of cohorts&#8217;) to put browser users in interest buckets for ad targeting purposes, as it works on deprecating tracking cookies. But its core business remains people profiling and selling your attention to advertisers &#8212; something Xayn definitely isn&#8217;t doing.</p>
<p>“We started Xayn as a direct response to the false privacy vs convenience dilemma and quickly proved that it’s possible to solve this trade-off so users are no longer losers. In fact, with each update, our fantastic team of engineers and designers demonstrates all over again how privacy, quality, and great UX go hand in hand,” said Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, co-Founder and CEO, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to copy what&#8217;s already out there but instead re-think it and create something new. With Xayn, you can find your favorite part of the Internet &#8212; either by actively searching the web or by browsing through the discovery feed that offers personalized content suggestions from the entire Internet. Either way, your privacy is always protected.”</p>
<p>“In creating Xayn’s web version, we have taken all the elements that made the app great and adapted them to the desktop browser window,” added Julia Hintz, its head of design, in another statement.</p>
<p>“The privacy-protecting algorithms, the intuitive design, and the smooth animations have found their way into the web version. Users can switch effortless between mobile and desktop without leaving their familiar environment. This is key for the seamless, deep interaction experience that makes Xayn special.”</p>
<p>In the web version of the product, Xayn says users&#8217; personal data stays privately within the browser.</p>
<p>Asked about the security of the desktop product, a spokesperson told us: &#8220;Desktop computers are less safe than smartphones in general. However, Xayn protects personal data by using decentralized privacy-preserving machine learning in combination with encryption. From the pure technical point of view, Xayn is actually a browser within a browser on a desktop device. On desktop devices, Xayn runs in a sandbox in the respective browsers and this is how it protects personal data from unwanted third-party access.”</p>
<p>Future features Xayn plans to add includes the ability for mobile and desktop users to synchronize their personalized experience across multiple devices, while keeping their privacy intact, so the AI’s learnings can go with them wherever they&#8217;re online.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/privacy-oriented-search-app-xayn-raises-12m-from-japanese-backers-to-go-into-devices/">Earlier this summer</a>, Xayn announced a $12 million Series A funding round led by the Japanese investors Global Brain and Japanese telco KDDI, along with participation from prior backers including Berlin&#8217;s Earlybird VC &#8212; bringing its total financing to $23M+. Unsurprisingly, then, Asia (starting with Japan) is now a big focus for the Berlin startup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China’s National Press and Publication Administration has <a href="http://www.nppa.gov.cn/nppa/contents/279/98792.shtml">released a notice</a> imposing limits on online gaming for minors. On September 1st, video game companies will have to restrict gaming time to three hours a week — from 8 PM to 9 PM on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>With this new set of restrictions, Chinese authorities want to tackle addition to online games. According to the National Press and Publication Administration, online gaming has an impact on both the physical and mental health of minors.</p>
<p>In order to implement those time limits, game companies will have to leverage a real name-based registration system. In 2018, Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/tencent-to-tighten-age-verification-checks-for-gamers-amid-government-crackdown/">started using this system</a> to limit playtime on Honor of Kings, a widely popular mobile game.</p>
<p>Back then, limits weren’t as strict though as children up to aged 12 could play one hour per day, and up to two hours per day for children between 13 and 18. At the time, authorities were concerned about worsening myopia among minors.</p>
<p>During the signup flow, users have to go through an ID verification system, which means that you can only have one account associated with your real name. Regulators will regularly check whether gaming companies comply with local regulation.</p>
<p>It’s going to be interesting to see how the new rules affect video games as a whole. Online gaming is mentioned specifically, which could mean that solo games won’t be restricted going forward. Similarly, it’s unclear whether console games and foreign games will have to implement the new real name-based registration system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some young gamers will also be tempted to circumvent the restrictions by signing up on a foreign server. It’s also worth noting that adult players will still be able to play 24/7.</p>
<p>Following the news, Tencent has <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bwz0NBjj9vqKjBTMsi-W9A">issued a statement</a>. “Tencent expressed its strong support and will make every effort to implement the relevant requirements of the Notice as soon as possible,” the company says.</p>
<p>As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week">noticed</a>, NetEase <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTES/">shares</a> are currently down 8% compared to yesterday’s closing price. NetEase is another popular Chinese game development company and its activities aren’t as diversified as Tencent’s activities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[HAAS Alert says it will use the funding to scale sales and outreach efforts and prioritize R&#038;D with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) technology partnerships.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HAAS Alert, a SaaS company that provides real-time automotive collision prevention for public safety and roadway fleets, has raised $5 million in seed funding that the company says it will use to scale sales and outreach efforts and prioritize R&amp;D with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) technology partnerships.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by R^2 and Blu Ventures and joined by TechNexus, Stacked Capital, Urban Us, Techstars, Ride Ventures and Gramercy Fund.</span></p>
<p>HAAS Alert relies on cellular-based sensors to ingest roadway hazard data from the environment surrounding a vehicle and its predictive technology to digitally alert drivers through their vehicle systems. HAAS Alert&#8217;s proprietary digital alerting system, Safety Cloud, can be found on a range of fleet vehicles in the public and private sector, from fire trucks, ambulances and police vehicles to tow trucks, construction and waste vehicles, school buses and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emergency responders, towing operators, construction and work zone crews and similar municipal fleets have extremely high death and injury rates from collisions,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Agulnek, HAAS Alert&#8217;s senior vice president of connected vehicle, told TechCrunch</span>. &#8220;They also really form the backbone of our communities, and every driver encounters them on the road daily. Many of these jobs are inherently risky to begin with, and yet struck-by incidents still rank as a leading cause of death for all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>HAAS Alert sees advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and V2X as the solution, so it built its service to start with those at the highest risk on our roads, and grow from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, this is not about using connected vehicles for entertainment and general connectivity – it is specifically about safety,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Agulnek</span>. &#8220;By connecting and protecting these folks, we can immediately bring a connected vehicle experience to all drivers and infrastructure in a way that also makes communities safer. We think that solving for safety with first responders and roadway workers is the most critical component to advancing mobility to the next stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, Safety Cloud is present on vehicles in more than 750 public agencies and private organizations that have sent more than 1 billion alerts collectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>HAAS Alert represents a growing number of startups looking to leverage V2X technology to reduce the risk of collisions, and funding is a big piece of the puzzle. Not only does the software cost money to build and keep updated, but the hardware and human-power costs associated with installing sensors, both on public infrastructure and within vehicles, aren&#8217;t cheap. HAAS Alert hopes to reach 10 billion driver safety alerts by 2022, and to do that, it&#8217;ll need to attract the automotive sector. Currently, the company works mainly with fleets, but it says the more fleets that are on its platform, the more automotive customers it will attract and vice versa.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We charge reasonable fees for fleet and agency customers to activate their roadway assets on Safety Cloud, and we charge a subscription fee to automotive customers to license the safety alerts, software and other services we provide,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Agulnek said</span>.</span></p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s actively installing its HA-5 Transponder hardware on vehicles across the nation, which allows equipped vehicles to automatically send digital alerts to approaching drivers when emergency fleets activate their flashing lights. These alerts give road users a heads up to the existence of response personnel on or near the roadway, giving drivers time to slow down or move over.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agulnek says the hardware setup is quick and easy with minimal downtime, but fleets also have the option of integrating Safety Cloud without hardware via the vehicle&#8217;s existing CAD, GPS or telematics system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All that is needed to add Safety Cloud alerts to a vehicle is a software update to receive data via the vehicle’s existing telematics capabilities and display driver alerts in the infotainment screen and/or instrument cluster,&#8221; Agulnek said. &#8220;We are working on a project right now with a car manufacturer where it took less than a week to implement alerts inside their vehicles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Computations are done either in the cloud or on the edge of the chips inside the hardware, which means the alerting logic can reside in HAAS Alert&#8217;s cloud, in a vehicle OEM&#8217;s cloud, in the vehicle&#8217;s head unit or a hybrid multi-location architecture, according to Agulnek.</p>
<p>A fleet management platform, the Situational Awareness Dashboard, comes standard with the Safety Cloud and is designed to enable coordinating agencies across jurisdictions to work together. HAAS Alert also includes potential add-ons for specific industries. For example, responder-to-responder (R2R) features a set of lights attached inside a vehicle that sends notifications to responders when other Safety Cloud-equipped vehicles are in active response mode and approaching the same intersection. FleetFusion allows customers to integrate real-time data from Safety Cloud into internal dashboards, third-party applications and traffic management centers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra, now a public company, ran into a problem during its first commercial launch (the mission carried a test payload contracted by the U.S. Space Force as part of its Space Test Program) that meant the rocket never made it to orbit. On Saturday, the rocket ignited all its engines at liftoff time on the pad in Alaska, but one of the five engines failed immediately after, which resulted in a rather remarkable hover and drift before but managed to get enough lift to ascend skyward.</p>
<p>Amazingly, despite the initial wobble and sideways list, the rocket did manage to climb to a max altitude of around 50KM (or around 164,000 feet) before the company issued a shutdown command and the rocket safely returned to Earth. That meant it didn&#8217;t reach its target, an orbital destination for the simulation of the payload deploy involved in its contracted test.</p>

<p>“We regret that we were unable to accomplish all mission objectives for the U.S. Space Force; however, we captured a tremendous amount of data from this test flight,” said Chris Kemp, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Astra in a press release issued by the company about the launch. “We will incorporate learnings from this test into future launch vehicles, including LV0007, which is currently in production.”</p>
<p>Astra last flew in December, when one of its test launches reached space, but fell just short of achieving orbital velocity. Astra at the time said that they were confident all that would be required to attain a good orbit were software tweaks to the navigation system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ola Electric is in advanced talks to raise between $250 million to $500 million in a new financing round as the Indian firm looks to scale its electric vehicle manufacturing business in the South Asian market, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital is in advanced talks to the lead the round, which values Ola Electric between $2.75 billion to $3.5 billion (up from $1 billion in its previous fundraise in 2019), sources told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. Singapore&#8217;s Temasek is also holding conversations, the people said.</p>
<p>The talks come at a time when ride-hailing giant Ola, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/ola-electric-softbank/">initial parent firm of Ola Electric</a>, is looking to file for an initial public offering. The firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/">recently raised $500 million</a>, has signed up a few bankers and is looking to file for the IPO later this year, according to a third person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not final yet so they may change, sources cautioned.</p>
<p>The firm is looking to raise as much as $1 billion, the person said, cautioning that the matter is not final. Indian media first wrote about the IPO talks.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ola Electric launched its first electric scooter, called Ola S1, that is priced at 99,999 Indian rupees, or $1,350. The electric scooter offers a range of 121 kilometers (75 miles) on a complete charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ola is the best product in the market currently with features significantly better than peers. Incumbents, despite all their resources have launched products which appear as another variant of an ICE product and lack the punch. We have in general been specifically disappointed with both Bajaj and TVS on this front,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein wrote to clients in a report earlier this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;While startups such as Ather have made significant efforts on the product, the steep pricing, significantly slow pace of manufacturing scale up, restricted launch in only a few cities earlier were the key drivers for weak sales. The crucial differentiators for Ola are the software based features, range, peak speeds, and acceleration (fastest EV scooter now), boot space, and colour options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ola / Ola Electric declined</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ho Chi Minh City-based <a href="https://vietcetera.com/en">Vietcetera</a>, a digital medial network originally created for millennials and Gen-Z, will broaden its target demographic after getting $2.7 million in pre-Series A funding. The capital was raised over two rounds this year, led by media-focused venture firm North Base Media.</p>
<p>Other investors included Go-Ventures, Gojek’s corporate venture arm; East Ventures; Summit Media; Genesia Ventures; Hustle Fund; and Z Venture Capital, the corporate venture arm of Z Holdings, which is owned by SoftBank Group and Naver Corporation.</p>
<p>Vietcetera was founded in 2016 by Hao Tran and Guy Truong and now claims an audience of 20 million users per month. Its advertisers include AIA Life Insurance, Google, Facebook, Nestlé, MasterCard, Vingroup and Tiki. Tran told TechCrunch that Vietcetera will also monetize by “prioritizing original content licensing and development.”</p>
<p>The network was first created for millennials and Gen-Z audiences who wanted “content going beyond showbiz, sensational news and entertainment.” To serve more groups of readers, Vietcetera will launch new vertical brands in 2022 focused on women’s content, real estate and personal finance.</p>
<p>North Base Media was founded in 2013 by Marcus Brauchli, former lead editor of the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, and Media Development Loan Fund chief executive officer Saša Vučinič to back digital media startups in markets where mobile internet penetration is growing. Its other portfolio companies include The News Lens, Atlas Obscura, Rappler and Majarra.</p>
<p>Vietcetera’s new funding will be used on content, including new shows and podcasts, mobile app development, franchise and content licensing, and potential acquisitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://urbanbase.com/">Urbanbase</a>, a Seoul-based company that develops a 3D spatial data platform for interior planning and design, announced today it has raised $11.1 million (13 billion won) in a Series B+ round as it scales up.</p>
<p>This round of funding was led by Hanwha Hotel &amp; Resort, which is a subsidiary of South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Corporation.</p>
<p>Urbanbase, founded in 2013 by chief executive officer and a former architect Jinu Ha, has now raised $20 million (approximately 23 billion won) in total.</p>
<p>Existing investors did not join this round. The company had raised Series A funding of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/korean-startup-urbanbase-gets-1-8m-to-turn-apartment-floor-plans-into-virtual-reality/">$1.8 million</a> and an additional $1.2 million in 2017 and its first Series B round in April 2020, from backers that included South Korea-based Shinsegae Information &amp; Communication, Woomi Construction, SL Investment, KDB Capital, Shinhan Capital, Enlight Ventures, CKD Venture Capital, and Breeze Investment, Ha said.</p>
<p>The latest funding will be used for enhancing its B2B SaaS, investing in R&amp;D for advanced virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and 3D tools, which are considered core technologies of metaverse that is its new business Urbanbase plans to enter, according to Ha. Global metaverse market size is projected to increase $280 billion by 2025 from $30.7 billion in 2021, based on Strategy Analytics’ report.</p>
<p>Companies that focus on opportunities in the so-called &#8220;metaverse&#8221; have been growing as part of a next-generation approach to building viable business models in areas like virtual and augmented reality, and all the hardware and software and new tech that are being built for them. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-tech-wants-you-to-live-in-a-virtual-world-prepare-for-real-problems-11630056626">Big tech corporations, ranging from Facebook, Intel to Microsoft, are targeting to move in the area</a>. Apple also waded into the area of virtual reality, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/apple-said-to-be-working-a-high-priced-standalone-vr-headset-as-debut-mixed-reality-product/">working on developing a high-end VR headset.</a></p>
<p>Urbanbase also plans to upgrade its home interior software platform, Urbanbase Studio, that has functions to transform 2D indoor space images into 3D displays via Urbanbase’s patented algorithm, visualize interior products in augmented reality and analyze spatial images based on the AI technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Urbanbase claims 50,000 monthly active users with 70,000 registered B2C users. The company has about 50 B2B customers.</p>
<p>“Most of our B2B clients are large conglomerates in South Korea and Japan, for example, LG Electronics, Japan-based Mitsubishi Real Estate Service, Nitori Holdings, Dentsu Group and SoftBank, but we would like to extend our B2B clients base to small, midsized companies and bring more B2C users after closing the Series B+ funding,” Ha mentioned.</p>
<p>Urbanbase is seeking an acquisition target in prop-tech and construction technology sectors, Ha told TechCrunch. Urbanbase currently focuses on developing the interior tools for apartment buildings because about 70-80 percent of total households in South Korea and Japan live in apartments, Ha said, adding that it will diversify its portfolio by acquiring a startup that covers different types of residence.</p>
<p>It currently operates the platform in Korean and Japanese, but it will add English language service prior to entering in Singapore in the end of 2021, Ha said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a busy summer for Clubhouse. The hit social audio app rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/">new messaging features</a> and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/clubhouse-android-worldwide-launch/">Android app</a> over the last few months and now the company is turning its attention to enhancing its core audio experience. Clubhouse announced Sunday that its rooms will now be infused with spatial audio to give the app’s listeners a richer sense of hanging out live with a group of other people.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Clubhouse’s Justin Uberti about the decision to add spatial audio, which has the effect of making different speakers sound like they’re coming from different physical locations instead of just one spot.</p>
<p>Uberti joined Clubhouse in May as its head of streaming technology after more than a decade at Google where he created Google Duo, led the Hangouts team and most recently worked on Google’s cloud gaming platform Stadia. Uberti also created the WebRTC standard that Clubhouse was built on top of.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things you realize in these group audio settings is that you don’t get quite the same experience as being in a physical space,&#8221; Uberti said.</p>
<p>While Clubhouse and other voice chat apps bring people together in virtual social settings, the audio generally sounds relatively flat, like it’s emanating from a single central location. But at the in-person gatherings Clubhouse is meant to simulate, you’d be hearing audio from all around the room, from the left and right of a stage to the various locations in the audience where speakers might ask their questions.</p>
<p>To pull off the new audio tricks, Clubhouse is integrating an <a href="https://www.highfidelity.com/blog/what-is-spatial-audio">API from Second Life creator Philip Rosedale’s spatial audio company High Fidelity</a> and blending it with the company’s own custom audio processing, tuned for the chat app.</p>
<p>High Fidelity’s HRTF technology, which stands for “Head Related Transfer Function,” maps speech to different virtual locations by subtly adding a time delay between stereo channels and replicating the way that high and low frequencies would sound entering the ear depending on a sound’s origin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result, long used in social VR, gives virtual social experiences a sense of physical presence that good records have been pulling off for ages. Think listening to Pink Floyd’s <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> in stereo with good headphones but instead of sound effects and instruments playing around your head, you’re hearing the people you’re hanging out with arrayed in virtual space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="x2nPR6jvRC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/skittish-andy-baio-virtual-events/">Skittish is what you&#8217;d get if you crossed Animal Crossing with Clubhouse</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Skittish is what you&#8217;d get if you crossed Animal Crossing with Clubhouse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/skittish-andy-baio-virtual-events/embed/#?secret=x2nPR6jvRC" data-secret="x2nPR6jvRC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Uberti, Clubhouse’s implementation will be subtle, but noticeable. While the audio processing will “gently steer conversation” to put most speakers in front of the listener, Clubhouse users should have a new sense that people are speaking from different physical locations.</p>
<p>The new audio features will roll out Sunday to the majority of iOS users, reaching the rest of Clubhouse&#8217;s iOS and Android users within the next few weeks. The experience will be available to everyone in time, but users will also have the ability to toggle spatial audio off.</p>
<p>Clubhouse will use the same virtual soundstage techniques to give large rooms a sense of sounding large while making more intimate rooms sound like they’re actually happening in a smaller physical space. And because most people use headphones to participate on Clubhouse, most of the app’s users can benefit from the effects possible through two-channel stereo sound.</p>
<p>“You have this notion of people [being] in a space, in a room&#8230; We try to mimic the feel of how it would be in a circle with people standing around talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uberti also notes that spatial audio could give regular Clubhouse users a less obvious benefit. It’s possible that regular, non-spatialized audio in social apps contributes to the pandemic-era phenomenon of Zoom fatigue. As the human brain processes virtual audio like a phone call or group audio room, it differentiates between speakers in a different way than it would in a natural in-person setting.</p>
<p>“Your mind has to figure out who’s talking. Without spatial cues you have to use timbre&#8230; that requires more cognitive effort,” Uberti said. &#8220;This could actually make for a more enjoyable experience aside from more immersion.”</p>
<p>It’s too early to know how Clubhouse’s many subcommunities will take to the spatial audio effects, but it could enhance experiences like comedy, music and even ASMR on the app quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Someone tells a joke and it often feels really flat,” Uberti said. “But on Clubhouse, when you feel the laughter come from all around you, it feels a lot like a comedy club experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The biggest news of the week again comes from Beijing&#8217;s ongoing effort to dampen the influence of the country&#8217;s tech giants. Regulators are now going after the exploitative use of algorithm-powered user recommendations. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We also saw a few major acquisitions this week. Xiaomi is acquiring an autonomous vehicle startup called Deepmotion, and ByteDance is said to be buying virtual reality hardware startup Pico.</span></p>
<h2>Algorithmic regulation</h2>
<p>Beijing has unveiled the draft of <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/news/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions">a sweeping regulation</a> to rein in how tech companies operating in China utilize algorithms, the engine of virtually all lucrative tech businesses today from short videos and news aggregation to ride-hailing, food delivery and e-commerce. My colleague Manish Singh wrote an overview of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">policy</a>, and here&#8217;s a closer look at the 30-point document proposed by China&#8217;s top cyberspace watchdog.</p>
<p>Beijing is clearly wary of how purely machine-recommended content can stray away from values propagated by the Communist Party and even lead to the detriment of national interests. In its mind, algorithms should strictly align with the interest of the nation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Algorithmic recommendations should uphold mainstream values&#8230; and should not be used for endangering national security (Point 6).</p></blockquote>
<p>Regulators want more transparency on companies&#8217; algorithmic black boxes and are making them accountable for the consequences of their programming codes. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Service providers should be responsible for the security of algorithms, create a system for&#8230; the review of published information, algorithmic mechanisms, security oversight&#8230; enact and publish relevant rules for algorithmic recommendations (Point 7).</p>
<p>Service providers&#8230; should not create algorithmic models that entice users into addiction, high-value consumption, or other behavior that disrupts public orders (Point 8).</p></blockquote>
<p>The government is also clamping down on discriminative algorithms and putting some autonomy back in the hands of consumers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Service providers&#8230; should not use illegal or harmful information as user interests to recommend content or create sexist or biased user tags (Point 10).</p>
<p>Service providers should inform users of the logic, purpose, and mechanisms of the algorithms in use (Point 14).</p>
<p>Service providers&#8230; should allow users to turn off algorithmic features (Point 15).</p></blockquote>
<p>The regulators don&#8217;t want internet giants to influence public thinking or opinions. Though not laid out in the document, censorship control will no doubt remain in the hands of the authorities.</p>
<blockquote><p>Service providers should not&#8230; use algorithms to censor information, make excessive recommendations, manipulate rankings or search results that lead to preferential treatment and unfair competition, influence online opinions, or shun regulatory oversight (Point 13).</p></blockquote>
<p>Like many other aspects of the tech business, certain algorithms are to obtain approval from the government. Tech firms must also hand over their algorithms to the police in case of investigations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Service providers should <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">file with the government if their recommendation algorithms can affect public opinions or mobilize civilians (Point 20).  </span></p>
<p>Service providers&#8230; should keep a record of their recommendation algorithms for at least six months and provide them to law enforcement departments for investigation purposes (Point 23).</p></blockquote>
<p>If passed, the law will shake up the fundamental business logic of Chinese tech companies that rely on algorithms to make money. Programmers need to pore over these rules and be able to parse their codes for regulators. The proposed law seems to have even gone beyond the scope of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">European Union&#8217;s data rules</a>, but how the Chinese one will be enforced remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Lei Jun bets on autonomous cars</h2>
<p>In Xiaomi&#8217;s latest earnings call, the smartphone maker said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/xiaomi-reports-record-64-revenue-growth-acquires-deepmotion-for-77-3-million/">will acquire DeepMotion</a>, a Beijing-based autonomous driving startup, to aid its autonomous driving endeavor. The deal will cost Xiaomi about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/xiaomi-reports-record-64-revenue-growth-acquires-deepmotion-for-77-3-million/"> $77.3 million</a>, and &#8220;a lot of that will be in terms of stock&#8221; and &#8220;a lot of these payments will be deferred until certain milestones are hit,&#8221; <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4451824-xiaomi-corporation-xiacf-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Wang Xiang, Xiaomi president on the call.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s founder Lei Jun earlier hinted at the firm&#8217;s plan to enter the crowded space. On July 28, Lei <a href="https://weibo.com/1749127163/KqOGhlxWM?from=page_1003061749127163_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1629974084772">announced</a> on Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent, that the company is recruiting 500 autonomous driving experts across China.</p>
<p>Automation has become a selling point for China&#8217;s new generation of electric vehicle makers, often with companies conflating advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) with Level 4 autonomous driving. Such overstatements in marketing material mislead consumers and make one question the real technical capability of these nascent EV players.</p>
<p>Xiaomi has similarly unveiled plans to manufacture electric cars through<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/"> a separate car-making subsidiary</a>. The ADAS capabilities brought by DeepMotion are naturally a nice complement to Xiaomi&#8217;s future cars. As Wang explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that there&#8217;s a lot of synergies with [DeepMotion&#8217;s ADAS] technology with our EV initiatives. So I think it tells you a couple of points. Number one is, we will roll out EV business. And I said in our prepared remarks, we&#8217;ve been very focused on hiring the right team for the EV business at this point in time, formulating our strategy, formulating our product strategy, et cetera, et cetera. But at the same time, we are not afraid to apply it and integrate other teams if we find that those will help us accelerate our plan right.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that DeepMotion, founded by Microsoft veterans, specializes in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuiyuan-yang-a5a29224/">perception technologies and high-precision mapping</a>, which puts it in the vision-driven autonomous driving camp. A number of major Chinese EV makers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/"> rely on consumer-grade lidar</a> to automate their cars.</p>
<h2>ByteDance goes virtual</h2>
<p>ByteDance is said to be buying Beijing-based VR hardware maker Pico for 5 billion yuan ($770 million), according to Chinese VR news site <a href="https://www.vrtuoluo.cn/526238.html">Vrtuoluo</a>. ByteDance could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Advanced VR headsets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/china-watches-and-learns-from-the-us-in-ar-vr-competition/">are often expensive</a> due to the cost of high-end processors. Experts observe that most VR hardware makers are yet to enter the mass consumer market. They are hemorrhaging cash and living off generous venture money and corporate deals.</p>
<p>ByteDance might be buying a money-losing business, but Pico, one of the major VR makers in China, provides a fast track for the TikTok parent to enter VR manufacturing. As the world&#8217;s largest short video distributor and an aggressive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/bytedance-gaming/">newcomer to video games</a>, ByteDance has no shortage of creative talent. We will see how it works on producing virtual content if the Pico deal goes through.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>This is the second post in a series on the Facebook monopoly. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/todays-real-story-the-facebook-monopoly/">first post</a> explored how the U.S. Federal Trade Commission should define the Facebook monopoly. I am inspired by Cloudflare’s recent <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/">post</a> explaining the impact of Amazon’s monopoly in its industry. </em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps it was a competitive tactic, but I genuinely believe it more a patriotic duty: guideposts for legislators and regulators on a complex issue. My generation has watched with a combination of sadness and trepidation as legislators who barely use email question the leading technologists of our time about products that have long pervaded our lives in ways we don’t yet understand. </em></p>
<p><em>I, personally, and my company both stand to gain little from this — but as a participant in the latest generation of social media upstarts, and as an American concerned for the future of our democracy, I feel a duty to try.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reached his Key Largo moment.</p>
<p>In May 1972, executives of the era’s preeminent technology company — AT&amp;T — met at a secret retreat in Key Largo, Florida. Their company was in crisis.</p>
<p>At the time, Ma Bell’s breathtaking monopoly consisted of a holy trinity: Western Electric (the vast majority of phones and cables used for American telephony), the lucrative long distance service (for both personal and business use) and local telephone service, which the company subsidized in exchange for its monopoly.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, all three government branches — legislators, regulators and the courts — parried with AT&amp;T’s lawyers as the press piled on, battering the company’s reputation in the process. By 1982, a consent decree forced AT&amp;T’s dismantling. The biggest company on earth withered to 30% of its book value and seven independent “Baby Bell” regional operating companies. AT&amp;T’s brand would live on, but the business as the world knew it was dead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is, undoubtedly, the greatest technologist of our time. For over 17 years, he has outgunned, outsmarted and outperformed like no software entrepreneur before him. Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/08/ftc-alleges-facebook-resorted-illegal-buy-or-bury-scheme-crush">refiled</a> its sweeping antitrust case against Facebook.</p>
<p>Its own holy trinity of Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp is under attack. All three government branches — legislators, regulators and the courts — are gaining steam in their fight, and the press is piling on, battering the company’s reputation in the process. Facebook, the AT&amp;T of our time, is at the brink. For so long, Zuckerberg has told us all to move fast and break things. It’s time for him to break Facebook.</p>
<p>If Facebook does exist to “make the world more open and connected, and not just to build a company,” as Zuckerberg wrote in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm">2012 IPO prospectus</a>, he will spin off Instagram and WhatsApp now so that they have a fighting chance. It would be the ultimate Zuckerbergian chess move. Zuckerberg would lose voting control and thus power over all three entities, but in his action he would successfully scatter the opposition. The rationale is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>The United States government will break up Facebook. It is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when.</li>
<li>Facebook is already losing. Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp all face existential threats. Pressure from the government will stifle Facebook’s efforts to right the ship.</li>
<li>Facebook will generate more value for shareholders as three separate companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>I write this as an admirer; I genuinely believe much of the criticism Zuckerberg has received is unfair. Facebook faces Sisyphean tasks. The FTC will not let Zuckerberg sneeze without an investigation, and the company has failed to innovate.</p>
<p>Given no chance to acquire new technology and talent, how can Facebook survive over the long term? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">In 2006</a>, Terry Semel of Yahoo offered $1 billion to buy Facebook. Zuckerberg reportedly remarked, “I just don’t know if I want to work for Terry Semel.” Even if the FTC were to allow it, this generation of founders will not sell to Facebook. Unfair or not, Mark Zuckerberg has become Terry Semel.</p>
<h2>The government will break up Facebook</h2>
<p>It is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when.</p>
<p>In a speech on the floor of Congress in 1890, Senator John Sherman, the founding father of the modern American antitrust movement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">famously said</a>, “If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessities of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity.”</p>
<p>This is the sentiment driving the building resistance to Facebook’s monopoly, and it shows no sign of abating. Zuckerberg has proudly called Facebook the fifth estate. In the U.S., we only have four estates.</p>
<p>All three branches of the federal government are heating up their pursuit. In the Senate, an unusual bipartisan coalition is emerging, with Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) each waging a war from multiple fronts.</p>
<p>In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has called Facebook “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-pelosi-facebook/pelosi-slams-facebook-as-part-of-the-problem-on-election-misinformation-idUSKBN27T2DR">part of the problem</a>.” Lina Khan’s FTC is likewise only getting started, with unequivocal support from the White House that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html">feels burned</a> by Facebook’s disingenuous lobbying. The Department of Justice will join, too, aided by state attorneys general. And the courts will continue to turn the wheels of justice, slowly but surely.</p>
<p>In the wake of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">scathing 2019 New York Times op-ed</a>, Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/11/zuckerberg-responds-to-hughes/">said</a> that Facebook’s immense size allows it to spend more on trust and safety than Twitter makes in revenue.</p>
<p>“If what you care about is democracy and elections, then you want a company like us to be able to invest billions of dollars per year like we are in building up really advanced tools to fight election interference,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>This could be true, but it does not prove that the concentration of such power in one man’s hands is consistent with U.S. public policy. And the centralized operations could be rebuilt easily in standalone entities.</p>
<p>Time and time again, whether on Holocaust denial, election propaganda or vaccine misinformation, Zuckerberg has struggled to make quick judgments when presented with the information his trust and safety team uncovers. And even before a decision is made, the structure of the team disincentivizes it from even measuring anything that could harm Facebook’s brand. This is inherently inconsistent with U.S. democracy. The New York Times’ army of reporters will not stop uncovering scandal after scandal, contradicting Zuckerberg’s narrative. The writing is on the wall.</p>
<h2>Facebook is losing</h2>
<p>Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp all face existential threats. Pressure from the government will stifle Facebook’s efforts to right the ship.</p>
<p>For so long, Facebook has dominated the social media industry. But if you ask Chinese technology executives about Facebook today, they <a href="https://twitter.com/ruima/status/1396567863280889857?s=20">quote</a> Tencent founder Pony Ma: “When a giant falls, his corpse will still be warm for a while.”</p>
<p>Facebook’s recent demise begins with its brand. The endless, cascading scandals of the last decade have irreparably harmed its image. Younger users refuse to adopt the flagship Facebook Blue. The company’s internal polling on two key metrics — good for the world (GFW) and cares about users (CAU) — shows Facebook’s reputation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg-facebook.html">is in tatters</a>. Talent is fleeing, too; Instacart alone <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-ceo-hire-is-part-of-monthslong-raid-of-facebook-staff">recently poached</a> 55 Facebook executives.</p>
<p>In 2012 and 2014, Instagram and WhatsApp were real dangers. Facebook extinguished both through acquisition. Yet today they represent the company’s two most promising, underutilized assets. They are the underinvested telephone networks of our time.</p>
<p>Weeks ago, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that the company no longer considers itself a photo-sharing app. Instead, its focus is entertainment. In other words, as the media widely reported, Instagram is <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?s=20">changing</a> to compete with TikTok.</p>
<p>TikTok’s strength represents an existential threat. U.S. children 4 to 15 already spend over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/kids-now-spend-nearly-as-much-time-watching-tiktok-as-youtube-in-u-s-u-k-and-spain/">80 minutes a day</a> on ByteDance’s TikTok, and it’s just getting started. The demographics are quickly expanding way beyond teenagers, as social products always have. For Instagram, it could be too little too late — as a part of Facebook, Instagram cannot acquire the technology and retain the talent it needs to compete with TikTok.</p>
<p>Imagine Instagram acquisitions of Squarespace to bolster its e-commerce offerings, or Etsy to create a meaningful marketplace. As a part of Facebook, Instagram is strategically adrift.</p>
<p>Likewise, a standalone WhatsApp could easily be a $100 billion market cap company. WhatsApp has a proud legacy of robust security offerings, but its brand has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification">tarnished</a> by associations with Facebook. Discord’s rise represents a substantial threat, and WhatsApp has failed to innovate to account for this generation’s desire for community-driven messaging. Snapchat, too, is in many ways a potential WhatsApp killer; its young users use photography and video as a messaging medium. Facebook’s top augmented reality talents <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-hires-ar-leader-from-facebook-niantic-s-scanning-acquisition?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_content=article-6167&amp;utm_source=sg">are leaving for Snapchat</a>.</p>
<p>With 2 billion monthly active users, WhatApp could be a privacy-focused alternative to Facebook Blue, and it would logically introduce expanded profiles, photo-sharing capabilities and other features that would strengthen its offerings. Inside Facebook, WhatsApp has suffered from underinvestment as a potential threat to Facebook Blue and Messenger. Shareholders have suffered for it.</p>
<p>Beyond Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook Blue itself is struggling. Q2’s earnings may have skyrocketed, but the increase in revenue hid a troubling sign: Ads increased by 47%, but inventory increased by just 6%. This means Facebook is struggling to find new places to run its ads. Why? The core social graph of Facebook is too old.</p>
<p>I fondly remember the day Facebook came to my high school; I have thousands of friends on the platform. I do not use Facebook anymore &#8212; not for political reasons, but because my friends have left. A decade ago, hundreds of people wished me happy birthday every year. This year it was 24, half of whom are over the age of 50. And I’m 32 years old. Teen girls run the social world, and many of them don’t even have Facebook on their phones.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg’s newfound push into the metaverse has been well covered, but the question remains: Why wouldn’t a Facebook serious about the metaverse acquire Roblox? Of course, the FTC would currently never allow it.</p>
<p>Facebook’s current clunky attempt at a hardware solution, with an emphasis on the workplace, shows little sign of promise. The launch was hardly propitious, as CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/tech/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr/index.html">reported</a>, “While Bosworth, the Facebook executive, was in the middle of describing how he sees Workrooms as a more interactive way to gather virtually with coworkers than video chat, his avatar froze midsentence, the pixels of its digital skin turning from flesh-toned to gray. He had been disconnected.”</p>
<p>This is not the indomitable Facebook of yore. This is graying Facebook, freezing midsentence.</p>
<h2>Facebook will generate more value for shareholders as three separate companies</h2>
<p>Zuckerberg’s control of 58% of Facebook’s voting shares has forestalled a typical Wall Street reckoning: Investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/facebook-board-rejects-proposals-to-reduce-zuckerberg-s-power#:~:text=Zuckerberg%2C%20who%20has%20served%20as,controlling%20stake%20in%20the%20company.">are tiring</a> of Zuckerberg’s unilateral power. Many justifiably believe the company is more valuable as the sum of its parts. The success of AT&amp;T’s breakup is a case in point.</p>
<p>Five years after AT&amp;T’s 1984 breakup, AT&amp;T and the Baby Bells’ value had <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/01/02/71446/index.htm">doubled</a> compared to AT&amp;T’s pre-breakup market capitalization. Pressure from Japanese entrants battered Western Electric’s market share, but greater competition in telephony spurred investment and innovation among the Baby Bells.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T turned its focus to competing with IBM and preparing for the coming information age. A smaller AT&amp;T became more nimble, ready to focus on the future rather than dwell on the past.</p>
<p>Standalone Facebook Blue, Instagram and WhatsApp could drastically change their futures by attracting talent and acquiring new technologies.</p>
<p>The U.K.’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns-u-k-says-11628768015">recent opposition</a> to Facebook’s $400 million GIPHY <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">acquisition</a> proves Facebook will struggle mightily to acquire even small bolt-ons.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has always been one step ahead. And when he wasn’t, he was famously unprecious: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348082/zuckerberg-facebook-house-committee-emails-app-development-speed-copying-innovation">Copying is faster than innovating</a>.” If he really believes in Facebook’s mission and recognizes that the situation cannot possibly get any better from here, he will copy AT&amp;T’s solution before it is forced upon him.</p>
<p>Regulators are tying Zuckerberg’s hands behind his back as the company weathers body blows and uppercuts from Beijing to Silicon Valley. As Zuckerberg’s idol Augustus Caesar might have once said, carpe diem. It’s time to break Facebook.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The ownership of startups is often a mystery. In the absence of a public registry, it is difficult to figure out who owns what. Since most startups incorporate in Delaware, the Delaware Division of Corporations holds relevant information, but you may not be able to get all the information you need, and putting it together from the legal paperwork will be challenging.</p>
<p>To understand a startup&#8217;s capital structure, you must have access to its capitalization table, also known as cap table. The cap table shows shareholder information, current ownership stakes along with economic and voting rights, future equity purchase rights, vesting schedules and purchase prices. All of this information is compiled into a format that founders and investors can digest easily, allowing them to calculate payouts in various exit scenarios, analyze equity dilution from new hire equity grants, and understand the impact of additional funding rounds.</p>
<p>Initially, startups might collect this data using Excel spreadsheets, but as the ownership structure grows more complex, it becomes more difficult to follow and document, and the cost of errors become a big problem. This has led to the development of a cap table management software industry.</p>
<p>However, the way in which various cap table data items are organized and accounted for varies among the different service providers. Without a standard, it is impossible to automatically synchronize data between software platforms, making it difficult to switch vendors as well as to ensure that all parties are on the same page.</p>
<p>Now, a coalition of Silicon Valley law firms and startup vendors is forming to address this issue. <a href="https://medium.com/@opencaptable/announcing-the-open-cap-table-coalition-6c2764396e71">In a Medium post from July 27</a>, the Open Cap Table Coalition stated its intention to &#8220;improve the interoperability, transparency, and portability of startup cap table data.&#8221; Since standardization means fewer billable hours for lawyers and less lock-in for software platforms, it may go against the short-term interest of some participants. However, the coalition reflects Silicon Valley&#8217;s way of doing business &#8211; as AnnaLee Saxenian, the Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Information noted in her influential 1994 book &#8220;Regional Advantage&#8221;, the Valley is a place where intense competitors become partners and informal co-operation and exchange become institutionalized.</p>

<p>As such, the founding members certainly deserve praise. Eliminating inefficiencies allows the ecosystem to move faster and allows players to concentrate on creating value. However, if only founders and investors can see the data, the open cap table coalition will fall short of its potential. For the open cap table to be truly open, the information that determines equity value must be accessible to all equity holders, including startup employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/the-sec-should-do-more-to-make-startup-equity-compensation-transparent/">I have written on TechCrunch in the past</a> about the abuse potential of startup equity compensation, a highly opaque and practically unregulated market. Employees are often swayed by the allure of stock options without understanding what these securities are and how they are valued. Successful IPO stories portraying employees as instant millionaires create an impression that startup equity offers a fast track to financial prosperity. However, success is the exception, not the rule, when it comes to startups, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-13/work-for-uber-wind-up-in-debt">wrong investment decisions can result in an employee going into debt.</a> Further, it can be damaging to the startup and the ecosystem in the long term if employees&#8217; expectations are not in line with the startup&#8217;s financial reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty much nothing destroys trust between shareholders and startups quicker than poor communication, especially around issues such as the status of the cap table,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/introducing-the-open-cap-table-coalition/">wrote Aaron Solomon, head of strategy for Esquire Digital</a>, in support of the open cap table initiative. The exact same is true for employee trust in the company and its leadership — miscommunication around equity issues can be detrimental. As Travis Kalanick discovered first hand, messing with employee equity can backfire.</p>
<p>“We are going to IPO as late as humanly possible,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/06/09/uber-ipo-travis-kalanick/">Kalanick said in June 2016</a>. “It’ll be one day before my employees and significant others come to my office with pitchforks and torches. We will IPO the day before that.” However, waiting for employees to lose their temper is a risky game; you may wake up a day too late instead of the day before. Nowadays, when it is harder to find good employees than to raise money, transparency with both capital and human capital providers is vital.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3492151">interviewed startup lawyers and founders in Silicon Valley</a> to understand why they don&#8217;t share more information with employees. There was a recurring fear of liability as well as disagreement over disclosure formats. Now, when the industry&#8217;s influential players decide on a cap table format, it is possible to also form an agreement on how these data should be shared with employees. If the coalition takes on this challenge, it could easily change the industry by establishing a voluntary standard that everyone can rally around.</p>
<p>Capital/labor relationships in startups are inherently imbalanced, since employees contribute human capital but are denied information and voting rights. It is possible to partially rectify this imbalance by providing employee equity-holders with bottom-line information on what they stand to gain under various exit scenarios. Making information accessible and easy to understand for employees can help startups attract talent and maintain positive culture.</p>
<p>Saxenian’s book on Silicon Valley&#8217;s regional advantage describes also how employee stock options contributed to the transformation of Silicon Valley in the 1970s. However, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111045">as capital markets and regulations have changed, employee, entrepreneur, and investor relationships have been negatively impacted</a>, resulting in ongoing friction over liquidity and risk allocation. Today, by establishing real equity transparency, Silicon Valley can retain its competitive edge. Until the Open Capital Table Coalition engages in this challenge, it cannot claim to foster a genuinely open community.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups have a seemingly intractable problem: a lack of diversity. Despite research showing that diverse founding teams have a <a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/the-pipeline-myth-ethnicity-fund-managers">higher rate of return than white founding teams</a>, one characteristic of startups remains relatively unchanged: the dearth of BIPOC and women founders, investors, board members, and counsel in the venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why should we care? Venture capital has provided early funding for the most innovative and profitable companies of our time — Apple, Amazon, Google (now Alphabet), just to name a few. These companies have changed the way we live, work and play by impacting how we communicate, how we process information, and how we buy goods. With approximately one-quarter of U.S. professionals employed by the high-tech sector — comprising about 5% to 6% of the total workforce, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech">according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> — imagine how much more innovation could happen with more diverse individuals at the table who bring different life experiences and perspectives. And we’re already seeing states enacting laws, and companies changing their practices, to help make this happen in the public company realm.</p>
<p>Many founders of VC-backed startups are <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Diversity-Report-FINAL-2.pdf">white, male, and Ivy League or internationally educated</a>. Women-founded companies <a href="https://elevate.vc/women-and-minority-founders-in-the-venture-capital-pipeline/">receive a fraction of VC investments</a> compared to all-male founded companies. In 2020, women-led startups received <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">only 2.3% of all VC money</a>. As of June 2021, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">less than 20%</a> of total VC deals went to a startup with at least one female founder.</p>
<p>When looking at BIPOC representation in the VC ecosystem, the numbers are even more abysmal. <a href="https://www.blckvc.com/">Three percent of VC investors are Black</a> and <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Diversity-Report-FINAL-2.pdf">1.7% of VC-backed startups have a Black founder</a>. The number of Latinx founders in VC-backed startups is even lower — <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Diversity-Report-FINAL-2.pdf">1.3%</a>. Plus, only <a href="http://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_crunchbase_diversity_report.pdf">2.4% of funding</a> was allocated to Black and Latinx founders from 2015 to August 2020. And, on the startup boards of high tech companies, <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=446005007069124126126096030089113093121054088068002056077030109087123114088066082110030012116061009062052103001114086009100082039039001011046064119015115076095066077033039015094011102005093075125103092095087083103097116125088005011084022091023008078104&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">women hold a mere 8% of the board seats</a>.</p>
<p>But the lack of diversity extends beyond who gets funding or who is in the boardroom; it is also a problem in the executive suite. In California, Asian Americans were among the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8bce29f730fc7358d4bc35/t/5ff66a62cc85ca2d29e2d858/1609984611034/Race-Gender-And-The-Double-Glass-Ceiling.pdf">least likely to be promoted</a> to manager or executive positions, and <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech">less than 2% of high-tech executives are Black</a>.</p>
<p>This lack of diversity in the VC ecosystem is a structural problem that has no easy solution. While some VC firms have begun allocating funds for trainings and mentorship programs, additional steps need to be taken.</p>
<p>For example, laws on board diversity have already passed in a few states, but they apply only to public companies and typically focus on gender diversity. The laws generally fall into one of three categories — they mandate, encourage, or require disclosure of board diversity. In 2018, California led the way with <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB826">SB 826</a>, California’s board gender diversity law, which required public companies headquartered in California (irrespective of where they were incorporated) to have a minimum of one woman on each of their boards by the end of 2019. By the end of this year, the minimum threshold increases to two if the board has five directors and three if it has six or more directors. (In the statute, female is defined as “an individual who self-identifies her gender as a woman, without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth.”)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The law has already had an impact: between 2018 and March 2021, the number of board seats held by women in such companies <a href="https://www.calpartnersproject.org/wocclaimyourseat">increased by a whopping 93.6%</a>, but the law is <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/06/21/20-15762.pdf">currently being challenged</a> in the courts.</p>
<p>While legislation regarding gender diversity on public company boards has been passed in certain states, even fewer laws address the issue of the lack of minorities on boards. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/business/economy/corporate-boards-black-hispanic-directors.html">Only 12.5%</a> of the board members of the 3,000 largest public companies come from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups despite the fact that these groups comprise 40% of the U.S. population. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/center-for-board-effectiveness/articles/missing-pieces-board-diversity-census-fortune-500-sixth-edition.html">Deloitte and the Alliance for Board Diversity reported</a> data that Fortune 500 board seats were held by individuals identified as African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino(a), and Asian/Pacific Islander at the rates of 8.7%, 4.1%, and 4.6%, respectively, in 2020.</p>
<p>In order to address this underrepresentation, California’s <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB979">AB 979</a> requires that a public company headquartered in California has at least one director from an “underrepresented community” by the end of 2021, with the minimum number increasing by the end of 2022. That definition includes someone who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian or Alaska Native, or who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.</p>
<p>In addition to California, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017A/bills/2017a_hjr1017_enr.pdf">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3394&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101">Illinois</a>, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1061533">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s4278?intent=support">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2019&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=R&amp;billNbr=0114&amp;pn=0736">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=23B.08.120">Washington</a> have also enacted some type of board diversity measure. <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/asp/CGABillStatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB5930">Connecticut</a>, <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=193&amp;year=2021">Hawaii</a>, <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H4153">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(nuuxjmlb15uwpr3gdmowgn4u))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=2019-SB-0115">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1070641">New Jersey</a>, <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Measures/Overview/HB3110">Oregon</a>, and <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA131-HR-344">Ohio</a> have proposed legislation, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Non-governmental initiatives are also being considered. As an example, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-to-advance-diversity-through-new-proposed-listing-requirements-2020-12-01">NASDAQ proposed</a> new listing standards to the SEC requiring disclosure of board diversity. <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-commitments/diversity-and-inclusion/launch-with-gs/pages/commitment-to-diversity.html">Goldman Sachs</a> announced that it would manage initial public offerings only for companies with at least one diverse board member.</p>
<p>These kinds of laws, however, may be difficult to implement in startups. In order to change the narrative on diversity in startups, change cannot be limited to the board but rather should have a multi-pronged approach focused on diversifying (1) employees in middle and executive management, (2) directors in the boardroom, and (3) the VC firms and other funders.</p>
<p>With startups, board diversity mandates similar to the one passed in California would likely not work in the early stages given the size of these boards. However, creating a culture where diversity is prioritized can manifest itself in other ways.</p>

<p>For example, limited partners who invest in VC funds could contractually obligate their general partners to consider diverse candidates for their firms as well as the board and management of any portfolio companies. VCs can also continue to diversify the limited partners that invest in their funds by eschewing their immediate networks and more actively reaching out to groups historically underrepresented in the startup ecosystem, such as HBCUs. In fact, some VCs are using <a href="https://actoneventures.com/diversity-rider/">diversity riders</a> in term sheets to do just that. VCs also need to take a hard look at what type of questions they ask their BIPOC and female founders and consider how they may differ in ways that are detrimental to those historically underrepresented in startups.</p>
<p>We are missing opportunities to foster further innovation by not taking more concrete action to add diversity to the startup ecosystem. There is no magic bullet to address the lack of diversity in the startup ecosystem. However, there are steps that founders, VCs, and limited partners can take to make strides in the right direction.</p>
