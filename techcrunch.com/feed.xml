										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China&#8217;s top chipmaker, is under mounting pressure as reports of its CEO&#8217;s looming departure and a potential U.S. sanction concern investors.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department is looking to add dozens of companies, mostly Chinese and including partially state-owned SMIC, to its trade blacklist, <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported on Friday. The move would effectively restrict SMIC from buying key components from U.S. suppliers to build advanced chipsets.</p>
<p>Telecoms equipment and smartphone making giant Huawei, which counts SMIC as a supplier, has been struggling with phone production after the Trump Administration added it to the trade blacklist and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/us-commerce-department-updates-rules-to-further-limit-huaweis-chip-access/">cut off its key chip access</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, the U.S. government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">reportedly</a> added SMIC to its defense blacklist, which would bar American investors from buying securities from the company.</p>
<p>SMIC and the Commerce Department cannot be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The reports arrived amid SMIC&#8217;s management shakeup and what appears to be internal politics at the chipmaking firm. SMIC recently appointed Chiang Shang-Yi, formerly a co-chief operating officer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), as vice-chairman. Days later an alleged resignation letter from Liang Mong Song made rounds online, and in it, the co-chief executive of SMIC said he was unaware of Chiang&#8217;s appointment and the hiring had prompted him to quit.</p>
<p>SMIC subsequently issued a statement saying<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-champion-chip-maker-checks-if-co-ceo-still-wants-to-work-there-11608117694"> it is &#8220;verifying&#8221;</a> the executive&#8217;s intention to quit, sending the company&#8217;s shares <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55f1cafb-91b8-4ddf-8b83-be8f5f71d327">plummeting</a>.</p>
<p>The fate of SMIC and TSMC is tightly linked to that of Huawei. TSMC, once an important supplier to Huawei, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/tsmc-reportedly-stops-taking-orders-from-huawei-after-new-u-s-export-controls/">reportedly halted orders</a> from the Chinese firm following new U.S. export controls. There were hopes that SMIC could be a replacement, but industry observers have long argued that the Chinese chipmaker is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smic-everything-you-need-know">years behind its Taiwanese rival</a> on making state of the art chipsets for phones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has pulled &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-a-retro-futuristic-fantasy-with-huge-potential-if-you-can-ignore-the-cyberjank/">most anticipated games in recent years</a>, from its PlayStation Store after a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjq1h/rcyberpunkgame_console_bugs_questions/">flood of complaints</a> and ridicule over compatibility issues and bugs from customers.</p>
<p>The gaming giant <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336">said</a> it is offering full refunds to any customer who purchased CD Projekt’s title from the PlayStation Store &#8212; though customers need to ask for it. Last week, CD Projekt announced that &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; had been pre-ordered more than 8 million times. A day later (Friday), the company said its revenue from digital pre-order sales alone exceeded all of Cyberpunk 2077&#8217;s production, marketing, and promotional costs.</p>
<p>Daniel Ahmad, Senior Analyst at Niko Partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1339762629422804993">said</a> the delisting of a much-anticipated title is unprecedented in the gaming industry. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever really seen something like this in the industry before. The only thing that comes close is when Warner Bros. delisted &#8216;Batman Arkham Knight&#8217; from PC due to technical issues, but that was from the publisher themselves. This is the platform holder delisting the game.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said CD Projekt could have delayed the release of &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; by another year and avoided the situation it has landed itself in. “&#8217;Cyberpunk 2077&#8242; was expected to become a 30 million+ seller prior to launch. But the state of the game and CDPR&#8217;s handling of the situation post launch has led to this.”</p>
<p>CD Projekt released &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; a game that was first unveiled seven years ago, on December 10 following multiple delays. Shares of CD Projekt were down more than 13% at the time of publishing.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment “strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund,” the company said Friday. &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; title is also plagued by bugs and other glitches on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjq0z/rcyberpunkgame_pc_bugs_questions/">other platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt acknowledged that more attention should have been paid to make the game “play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.” The company also said it would offer refund to unsatisfied customers, but many users said they had not received their money back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like people didn&#8217;t see this coming for a few months now,&#8221; said Niko Partners&#8217; Ahmad. &#8220;From the many delays of the game prior, to developers and QA pointing out issues, to last gen footage of the game being deliberately hidden / taken down (as admitted by CDPR) and more. There are multiple lessons to learn from this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An important one being that management /production processes need to improve. It turns out crunching non stop for months doesn&#8217;t make a game good. It negatively impacts not just the health of devs, but the game too There will also be wider impacts on the industry when it comes to guidelines for marketing, certification and refunds from a publisher and platform holder level Anyway, will be interesting to see how CDPR respond and how they can salvage the lost goodwill they built up over years,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent is further strengthening its ties with music giant Universal Music Group as it continues to dominate the Chinese music streaming market.</p>
<p>A consortium led by Tencent and comprising <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/china-music-corp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="china-music-corp">Tencent Music Entertainment, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the internet giant&#8217;s music spinoff, is set to buy an additional 10% equity stake in UMG from French media conglomerate Vivendi SA, TME <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consortium-including-tencent-music-entertainment-group-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-additional-equity-interests-in-universal-music-group-301195812.html">said</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>The round values <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/umg" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="umg">UMG <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at 30 billion euros, or $36.8 billion, and will increase the consortium&#8217;s stake in the music company to 20%. TME continues to hold a 10% equity interest in the consortium, of which other members are not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021 and is subject to regulatory approvals, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tme" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tme">TME <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> noted.</p>
<p>In August, TME and UMG <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/">said</a> they were launching a joint label to discover, develop and promote Chinese artists domestically and to the world.</p>

<p>Tencent has been pally with all three music label giants, which have been licensing content to the Chinese firm&#8217;s music-focused apps. Both Warner Music and Sony Music Entertainment bought shares in TME when the latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/tencent-music-ipo/">went public in Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Music&#8217;s SEC filing earlier this year showed that it had <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-now-owns-10-of-universal-9-of-spotify-and-nearly-2-of-warner-music-group/">sold a small stake</a> to Tencent. And one should be reminded that Tencent also had a deal with Spotify from 2017 when the two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/">swapped stakes</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When an accident on a building site resulted in the death of their friend, the founders of <a href="https://safesitehq.com/">Safesight</a> were inspired to launch the platform to digitize safety programs for construction. The data from that gave birth to a new InsurTech startup this year, <a href="https://getforesight.com/">Foresight</a>, which covers workers&#8217; compensation. The startup has now released, for the first time, news that it raised a $15 million funding round back in May this year, with participation from Blackhorn Ventures and Transverse Insurance Group. To date, it has raised $20.5 million from industrial technology venture capital firms, led by Brick and Mortar Ventures and Builders VC.</p>
<p>Foresight launched in August of this year but has already covered $30M in risks. The company says it is now on pace to reach $50M in underwritten premium in 2021. By leveraging the data from sister company Safesite, the platform says it has been able to reduce workers comp incidents by up to 57% in a study conducted by actuarial consulting firm Perr &amp; Knight.</p>
<p>Foresight’s algorithm leverages Safesight data to predict incidents, highlight risks, and informs underwriting. By wrapping Safesite risk management technology and services into every policy, Foresight provides a path to lower incident rates and lower premiums for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of the $57Bn national workers compensation market, Foresight focuses on policies ranging from $150K to $1M+ in annual premiums. The company says this segment has been largely overlooked by well-funded InsurTech startups such as Next <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/insurance-1d9d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="insurance-1d9d">Insurance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Pie, which provide small business policies under $50K in annual premiums.</p>
<p>Foresight and Safesite were developed by longtime friends and co-founders David Fontain, Peter Grant, and Leigh Appel.</p>
<p>Fontain said: “Foresight strengthens the correlation between safety and savings while providing the fast and easy user experience InsurTechs are known for. We leverage purpose-built technology to drive behavioral shifts and provide an irresistible alternative to traditional workers compensation coverage.”</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/darren-bechtel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="darren-bechtel">Darren Bechtel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the founder and managing director at Brick &amp; Mortar Ventures commented: &#8220;We first invested in 2016 and have known the founders since 2015 when it was just the two of them, squatting at a couple of empty desks inside another portfolio company’s office. Their initial vision was both elegant and powerful, and the demonstrated impact of their solution on safety performance, even in early interactions with the product, was impossible to ignore.”</p>
<p>Foresight now covers Nevada, Oklahoma, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. The company expects to launch workers compensation in the eastern US and a general liability line in early 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7 Labs</a>, the makers of a computer vision platform that helps AI teams &#8220;automate&#8221; and future-proof their training data workflows as advances in AI continue, has picked up $3 million in funding. Leading the seed round is Amadeus Capital Partners, with participation from Partech, Nathan Benaich’s Air Street Capital and Miele Venture.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Singularity University alumnus Alberto Rizzoli and former R&amp;D lead at RSI, Simon Edwardsson (the same team behind &#8220;seeing&#8221; app Aipoly), the V7 Labs platform promises to accelerate the creation of high-quality training data by 10-100x. It does this by giving users the ability to build automated image and video data pipelines, organize and version complex data sets, and train and deploy &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; vision AI models.</p>
<p>“For companies to build computer vision solutions that deliver business value, they must continuously collect, label and retrain their models,” explains V7 Labs’ Rizzoli. “When we built Aipoly in 2015, we needed to build and maintain our own tools, whilst keeping up with the rapid state of the art of AI, because no third-party SaaS products were available”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast-forward to today and Rizzoli says that many of the best computer vision companies are now turning to SaaS platforms like V7 to solve this problem. “There’s a lot to think of when building an AI startup, and ‘how can we efficiently store and query 100 different video data sets’ is something you only think of when you’re mid-flight in trying to deliver your service.</p>
<p>“V7 codifies industry best-practices for organizing data, labelling and launching computer vision models for real-world problems”.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088643" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088643" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> V7 Labs</p></div></p>
<p>The browser and cloud-based platform claims the ability to quickly upload and render large image/video data sets “without lag,” and enable labelling to be automated (to varying degrees) without the need for prior training data. V7 has also been designed to make it possible to keep track of a very large number of labels per image/video, supporting thousands of annotations per image and millions of images per data set. Crucially, Rizzoli tells me it is possible to train, deploy and run computer vision models within the platform “in a few clicks without having to worry about DevOps”.</p>
<p>“Customers will soon be able to audit those models &#8212; and their corresponding training sets &#8212; to debug, test data quality, discover failure cases and eliminate any unwanted bias,” he adds, noting that these are all huge unsolved pain-points in the AI industry.</p>
<p>To that end, V7 Labs&#8217; existing 100 or so customers include Tractable, GE Healthcare and Merck. It is growing fastest within medical imaging, in part because it offers support for DICOM annotation and HIPAA compliance, both must-haves in healthcare.</p>
<p>However, measured by the quantity of data processed on the platform, Rizzoli tells me that routine “expert inspections” are the most popular tasks. “These include dozens of companies using AI to look for damage or anomalies in cars, oil rigs, power lines, pipelines or roads,” he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese tech giants have drawn international criticism after research showed they have technologies that enable the authorities to profile Muslim Uyghurs.</p>
<p>The cloud computing unit of Alibaba, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alibaba-cloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alibaba-cloud">Alibaba Cloud, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> developed a facial recognition algorithm that can identify a person&#8217;s ethnicity or whether a person is &#8220;Uyghur&#8221;, according to <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/alibaba-uyghur">research</a> from surveillance industry publication IPVM.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1723306.shtml">defended</a> its controversial &#8220;<a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1623846.shtml">vocational training programs</a>&#8221; imposed upon its Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others, as part of what the government calls counter-terrorism efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba <a href="https://www.alizila.com/statement-from-alibaba-group-regarding-recent-reports-of-the-companys-facial-recognition-technology/">said</a> in a statement that it is &#8220;dismayed&#8221; to learn that Alibaba Cloud tested a technology that included &#8220;ethnicity as an algorithm&#8221; and that &#8220;racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates Alibaba’s policies and values.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups, and we have eliminated any ethnic tag in our product offering. This trial technology was not deployed by any customer. We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to target or identify specific ethnic groups,&#8221; the company added.</p>
<p>A security breach from last year revealed that a &#8220;smart city&#8221; surveillance system hosted on Alibaba Cloud could detect people&#8217;s ethnicity or label them Uyghur Muslim, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed/">reported</a> earlier. At the time, Alibaba said as a public cloud provider, it &#8220;does not have the right to access the content in the customer database.&#8221;</p>

<p>IPVM also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/12/huawei-uighurs-identify/">found</a> earlier this month that Huawei and artificial intelligence unicorn Megvii, known for its facial recognition product Face++, jointly developed a technology that could alert the Chinese government when the system detected the face of a member from the Uyghur community.</p>
<p>As China&#8217;s tech upstarts seek overseas growth, they increasingly find themselves stuck between the demands of Beijing and international scrutiny over their stance on human rights issues.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is one of Alibaba&#8217;s fastest-growing segments and the giant is eyeing to attract more international customers. Last year, Alibaba Cloud was the biggest player in the Asia Pacific region and the third-largest Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider globally, <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-named-by-gartner-as-third-biggest-global-provider-for-iaas-and-first-in-asia-pacific_596191">according to</a> research firm Gartner.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit grew 60% year-over-year to account for nearly 10% of the firm&#8217;s revenues in the <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf">three months ended September</a>. As of the quarter, approximately 60% of A-share listed companies, those that are based in mainland China and trade in RMB, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are customers of Alibaba Cloud, the company claimed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a period of public feedback, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> adjusted some its plans for a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">new verification process, </a>set to roll out next year. The company suspended public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/twitter-pauses-account-verifications-after-critics-slam-it-for-verifying-charlottesville-rally-organizer/">verification applications in 2017</a> and since appears to have rethought a few aspects of what information the platform should signal to its users, blue checks and beyond.</p>
<p>One big verification-adjacent change around the corner: Twitter plans to add a way of distinguishing bots and other automated accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; It can be confusing to people if it’s not clear that these accounts are automated,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;In 2021, we’re planning to build a new account type to distinguish automated accounts from human-run accounts to make it easier for people to know what’s a bot and what’s not.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2020/08/05/twitter-users-may-have-changed-their-behavior-after-contact-russian-trolls">not all bots are good bots</a>, but automated accounts have flourished on the platform since its early days and bots remain some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakebot?lang=en">most useful</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot">whimsical</a> and otherwise beloved sources of tweets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Beg13AVmjE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/twitter-to-relaunch-account-verifications-in-early-2021-asks-for-feedback-on-policy/">Twitter to relaunch account verifications in early 2021, asks for feedback on policy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter to relaunch account verifications in early 2021, asks for feedback on policy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/twitter-to-relaunch-account-verifications-in-early-2021-asks-for-feedback-on-policy/embed/#?secret=Beg13AVmjE" data-secret="Beg13AVmjE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is also working on a better way to handle accounts for users who have died, and plans to introduce a memorialization process in 2021. Twitter says that memorialized accounts, like bots, will become &#8220;a new account type&#8221; making them distinct from normal users. The idea grew out of the same spirit as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/twitter-election-labels/">Twitter&#8217;s labels for political figures</a>, which sought to provide contextual info about users that can be seen at a glance.</p>
<p>Taking more than 22,000 pieces of feedback on the new verification process into account, Twitter will no longer require a profile bio or header picture to verify users, calling its former thinking &#8220;too restrictive.&#8221; It&#8217;s also redefined a few of its eligible verification categories, expanding &#8220;sports&#8221; to include esports and adding more language around digital content creators into the entertainment category.</p>
<p>Twitter also apparently received a lot of suggestions calling for additional verification categories for scientists, academics and religious figures. Until it spins out more categories, those users can seek verification under the &#8220;activists, organizers, and other influential individuals&#8221; catch-all category.</p>
<p>Verification applicants will need to apply under a particular category and provide links or other information supporting their application. The new &#8220;self-serve&#8221; verification process will be available through account settings on both mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>Twitter will implement the new account verification policy on January 20, 2021, three years after freezing the process. The company did not specify when public verification applications will be accepted again, but it sounds like the wait won&#8217;t be too long and the company plans to share more soon. Starting on the 20th, Twitter will begin sweeping out inactive verified accounts and others that don&#8217;t meet its new bar for a &#8220;complete account.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">adjusted policy</a>, a complete account — and one eligible for verification — must have a verified email or phone number, a profile image and a display name. Anyone who&#8217;s verified but doesn&#8217;t meet those criteria will receive notifications of the required changes, which must be made before January 20.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s new policy also lays out the company&#8217;s right to revoke verification for accounts in &#8220;severe or repeated violation&#8221; of the platform&#8217;s rules. It sounds like new policy could lay a clearer path for the company to take against users who break the rules, though that ultimately will come down to enforcement rather than written policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification,&#8221; Twitter wrote in the post.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/968243242184491008">paused the verification process</a> in November, 2017 following a public outcry over its decision to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-verifies-charlottesville-rally-boss-jason-kessler-who-called-slain-protesters-death-payback-time">verify Jason Kessler.</a> Kessler infamously organized the Unite the Right event in Charlottesville, Virginia that gathered neo-Nazis and white supremacists, ultimately leaving one peaceful counter protester dead. The pause was extended the next year as the company decided to direct more resources toward election integrity.</p>
<p>With the midterms and the general U.S. election behind it, Twitter has returned to its effort to rethink the verification process and what it symbolizes for users on the platform. The company is also experimenting with new features that could dial down harassment, toxicity and misinformation.</p>
<p>Twitter recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">added friction to the retweet process</a> in an effort to slow the spread of misinformation, though it <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1339350208942125066">rolled the change back</a> after the election. Twitter&#8217;s latest test: A new pop-up that displays shared interests and a profile bio when a user goes to reply to someone they don&#8217;t follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-innovation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aurora-innovation">Aurora Innovation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sent offers Thursday to more than 75% of employees at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Advanced Technologies Group, just a week after announcing plans to acquire the self-driving subsidiary, according to a source familiar with the post-merger integration plans.</p>
<p>Uber ATG Toronto, which employs about 50 people where the subsidiary conducted its research and development work, did not not made the cut, according to a source. Nor has Uber ATG&#8217;s chief scientist Raquel Urtasun, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/uber-hires-raquel-urtasun-to-lead-a-new-atg-self-driving-unit-in-toronto/">led the Uber ATG R&amp;D team</a>. It was previously confirmed that Uber ATG CEO Eric Meyhofer would not join Aurora once the deal closed. Until today, it was unclear if Urtasun, a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as the co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI, would be moving over to Aurora. Urtasun is considered a leading expert in machine perception for self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Of the 1,200 people who work at Uber ATG, more than 850 received emailed offers from Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson. In the email, an excerpt of which TechCrunch has viewed, Urmson said the decision of who to pick was difficult. He noted that the decisions were based on Aurora&#8217;s specific business needs such as areas of overlaps, relative impact and management reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aurora wouldn&#8217;t comment on the offers, but did confirm that Uber&#8217;s Toronto office was not being integrated into the newly combined company. An Uber spokesperson also confirmed that the Toronto R&amp;D lab would not be integrated into the joint organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an independent company focused on our long-term growth and success, we must be thoughtful about where and how we spend resources. To deliver on our mission, we weave research into our development process and engineering work, rather than having a separate research and development team,&#8221; an Aurora spokesperson wrote in an email statement. &#8220;We have immense respect for Raquel Urtasun and her team. The impact they have made on both the ATG team, and the industry in general, is incredible. While she and her team will not be continuing on with Aurora, we wish them tremendous success.&#8221;</p>
<p>If every Uber ATG employee who received an offer accepts, it would more than double Aurora&#8217;s size. Before the acquisition was announced, Aurora had about 600 employees working out of its offices in Palo Alto, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Texas. Uber ATG had offices in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.</p>
<p>Aurora and Uber had been in talks for months before reaching a complex deal that will value the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">combined company at $10 billion</a>. Aurora is not paying cash for Uber ATG, a company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/uber-atg-1-billion-toyota-denso-vision-fund-spin-out/">valued at $7.25 billion</a> following a $1 billion investment last year from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber is handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora, which will give it a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders in Uber ATG will now become minority shareholders of Aurora.</p>
<p>At the time the deal was announced, Urmson told TechCrunch that the next 60 days would be spent bringing the two teams together and &#8220;dispassionately looking at what is the technology that accelerates our first product to market and then amplifying that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ned-desmond" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ned-desmond">Ned Desmond, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a longtime publishing executive who spent more than half a dozen years at Time Inc. before becoming the chief operating officer of both TechCrunch and Engadget for more than eight years, has joined the investment firm <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a> as a senior operating partner.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s seemingly a good fit for both sides.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sosv" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sosv">SOSV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; which is currently managing a $277 million flagship fund alongside some smaller vehicles &#8212; has become known for its popular accelerator programs, including <a href="https://hax.co/">Hax</a>, a program focused around nascent hardware startups, and <a href="https://indiebio.co/">IndieBio</a>, SOSV&#8217;s life sciences-focused accelerator.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the outfit, founded by serial entrepreneur Sean O&#8217;Sullivan in 1995, has now funded so many startups &#8212; roughly 1,000 of them &#8212; that it recently sought out Desmond to work with them, connect them, shine a light on their work and help them raise follow-on funding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s work that has become intuitive for Desmond, who among other things was heavily involved in organizing TechCrunch&#8217;s multiple events around the world each year, along with its signature Battlefield competitions, which collectively feature dozens of nascent startups annually.</p>
<p>Indeed, soon after Desmond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/so-long-techcrunch/">resigned</a> from TechCrunch last summer in search of a new challenge (and some needed downtime), O&#8217;Sullivan reached out to him, asking if he might join SOSV to help with its marketing and sales efforts, as well as to provide coaching and connections to its startups.</p>
<p>By O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s telling, SOSV could use the help more than ever.</p>
<p>The outfit has had its share of successes. It was the lead investor in the electric bike company Jump Bikes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/uber-acquires-bike-share-startup-jump/">acquired</a> by Uber in 2018 for an undisclosed amount. It&#8217;s an early investor in the 3D printing company FormLabs (valued at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2018/08/01/3-d-printing-startup-formlabs-venture-capital-unicorn-1-billion-valuation-financing-jeff-immelt-forbes-30-under-30-alumni-max-lobovsky/#69e047fc7471">more than $1 billion</a> during its last round in 2018). It also wrote an early check to the peer-to-peer car-sharing company <a href="https://www.getaround.com/">GetAround</a>, which was hard hit by the pandemic but whose business has since reportedly rebounded such that it was able to raise $140 million in Series E funding in October. (It has raised $600 million altogether.)</p>

<p>Not last, SOSV is an investor in the lab-grown meat producer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/memphis-meats" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="memphis-meats">Memphis Meats, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which raised <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-memphis-meats-funding/lab-grown-meat-producer-memphis-meats-raises-161-million-in-funding-led-by-softbank-idUSKBN1ZL2OO">$161 million</a> in new funding at the start up of the year, led by SoftBank.</p>
<p>Still, SOSV is in the same boat as many seed-stage investment firms. It&#8217;s working with a lot of very new teams for whom the pandemic has been rough. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q3-2020-global-venture-report/">According to Crunchbase</a>, seed funding in the third quarter was down 32% year over year and down 11% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>While the buzzier, more established companies have had no problems in fundraising &#8212; many are having to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/technology/this-is-insanity-start-ups-end-year-in-a-deal-frenzy.html">bat back overeager investors</a> &#8212; newer, unproven teams without established connections have found it harder to land seed-stage and Series A checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a super tough market,&#8221; says O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;Angels have completely dropped out. Seed investing is down massively.&#8221; Except in life sciences, especially in the U.S.,&#8221; says O&#8217;Sullivan, &#8220;it&#8217;s tougher for every company because you can&#8217;t move quite as fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>What of Zoom and related talk by VCs of the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/vcs-covid-19-were-doing-fine-thanks">extra time they now have to meet with new startups</a>? O&#8217;Sullivan suggests with a laugh that there&#8217;s no shortage of posturing in the industry. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s always doing &#8216;great,&#8217; &#8221; he notes. &#8220;But I&#8217;m a Catholic guy. I have to be honest,&#8221; and there&#8217;s &#8220;nothing quite like going to meet with a company and working with them across the table. When you&#8217;re working with them remotely, it&#8217;s just a slower process.&#8221;</p>

Ghosts! Jack-o-lanterns! Dancing skeletons!</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve got another one. Rolled out just in time for tomorrow&#8217;s Season 2 finale of The Mandalorian, this one brings The Child (or, as the world has taken to calling him, &#8220;Baby Yoda&#8221;) into your living room.</p>
<p>Want to check it out yourself? You just need to search for the right thing. <strong>This is the way:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Google.com in the browser of an iOS or Android device</li>
<li>Search for &#8220;The Child,&#8221; &#8220;Baby Yoda&#8221; or [The Child&#8217;s actual name here which I&#8217;ll omit because spoilers].</li>
<li>Scroll down until the &#8220;View in 3D&#8221; button appears. Tap it, then the &#8220;View in your space&#8221; button. (Depending on your device, you might need the Google search app installed. It worked by default on a Pixel.)</li>
<li>Wait until the camera view pops up, then wave your camera around a bit. Once the camera figures out where the floor is, he should appear. Be sure to bump your volume up.</li>
</ol>
<p>I just tested it myself and it worked well, albeit better on some devices than others. It was fast and flawless on a Pixel, but the lighting was bugging out hard on my iPhone.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a camera button that&#8217;ll let you snap photos and videos, and you can drag/pinch to move him around the room or rotate him in place for better shots. Have fun!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic has underscored, and often exacerbated, the mental health crisis that exists across the world. Even the spread of remote work is part of the problem: As everyone stays at home, the lack of interaction and watercooler chat has left employees without in-person interaction.</p>
<p>The need for a solution has helped tech-powered mental health solutions raise funding to meet increased demand. In the latest development, it emerged that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyra-health" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lyra-health">Lyra Health, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a platform that focuses on providing workforces with mental health care, has filed paperwork to raise a $175 million Series E at a $2.25 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The paperwork was uncovered by <a href="https://primeunicornindex.com/lyra-health-secures-175m-series-e-round/">Prime Unicorn Index</a>. While it is not clear whether the company has closed the round, filings in Delaware usually appear after part or all of the funding has been secured. Prime Unicorn Index notes that the terms surrounding this Series E round include a “pari passu liquidation preference with all other preferred, and conventional convertible, meaning they will not participate with common stock if there are remaining proceeds.” It also noted that Lyra Health&#8217;s most recent price per share is $27.47, an up round from the Series D, which priced shares at $14.21.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We are reaching out to the company and investors for a response to the filing. One investor noted that the round has not closed yet.</p>
<p>Past backers of the company include Adams Street Partners, Tenaya Capital, Meritech Capital Partners, IVP and Greylock.</p>
<p>We seem to be in a period of rapid growth rounds getting raised in quick succession for the most promising startups. As with Discord &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">confirmed a $100 million round</a> just six months after raising $100 million &#8212; Lyra Health also recently raised funding &#8212; specifically <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/lyra-health-gains-unicorn-status-after-110m-series-d/">a $110 million Series D</a> that catapulted it above a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="95qBJQ2NHy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">Update: Discord confirms raising $100M, sources say at a valuation of up to $7B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Update: Discord confirms raising $100M, sources say at a valuation of up to $7B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/embed/#?secret=95qBJQ2NHy" data-secret="95qBJQ2NHy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That effectively means the startup doubled its valuation in a handful of months, suggesting rapid growth or key validation. As reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2020/08/25/lyra-health-hits-11-billion-valuation-as-coronavirus-boosts-need-for-teletherapy/?sh=1b581bf66938">Forbes</a>, Lyra Health was set to bring in around $100 million in revenue by the end of the year at the time of its prior fundraise.</p>
<p>There have been a number of categories of technology that have seen a bump of usage and interest during this coronavirus pandemic, and sadly &#8212; or perhaps usefully, depending on how you look at it &#8212; mental health and wellness startups, aimed at helping our well-being in this trying time, have been one of them. Just last week, the meditation app Calm raised $75 million at a $2 billion valuation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UDKc2TWNau"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">Calm raises $75M more at $2B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Calm raises $75M more at $2B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/embed/#?secret=UDKc2TWNau" data-secret="UDKc2TWNau" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Burlingame, California-based Lyra Health wants to live in offices everywhere. The company helps employers give their employees a suite of safe and confidential tools to support their mental health needs. This is a tricky space to play in, considering that mental health can still feel taboo in workplaces and employees might feel uncomfortable turning to their employers for support. Still, in a world where in-office perks are no longer available, mental health might be a key investment to help startup retention.</p>
<p>Once an employee joins Lyra, the company creates a set of recommendations for the now-patient based on a survey. Lyra Health then can connect patients to its network of thousands of therapists for appointments, consultations and check-ins. The flywheel continues.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Lyra Health has brought on 80,000 new users, to a total of 1.5 million users last reported.</p>
<p>Tech-enabled mental health care has found tailwinds as the coronavirus pandemic leads to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm">surge of telehealth</a>, as in-person doctor’s appointments could leave patients at risk. Indeed, Lyra Health started Lyra Blended Care, which pairs video therapy with online lessons and exercises rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>

Lockheed VP and GM of Commercial Civil Space Lisa Callahan says that the collaboration has been surprisingly smooth and fruitful.</p>
<p>Speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space</a>, Callahan expressed her excitement for being able to take part in such an endeavor to begin with: &#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t want to do that? That&#8217;s pretty awesome,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A lot of our workforce wasn&#8217;t around in the Apollo days, so they&#8217;re really excited to be a part of this next generation and bringing astronauts back to the moon — and for me personally, the fact that we&#8217;re going to bring the first woman to the moon is just amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She explained that Lockheed is working on the ascent module, while Northrup Grumman and Draper are working on other components, and Blue Origin, the prime contractor, is making the descent module.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really fun combination of the entrepreneurial, from the Blue Origin perspective, with some of the heritage companies that Lockheed and Northrop Grumman and Draper provide going back to the Apollo days, to bring a kind of national time together for this national priority,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>One might fairly expect a bit of friction between the old rivals and the newcomer, but according to Callahan it&#8217;s been extremely constructive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a merging of different cultures, and I think everyone on the team is growing because of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Blue Origin has been a great prime, they&#8217;ve really welcomed everybody in a sort of&#8230; what I&#8217;ll call a badge-less environment. I don&#8217;t think if you were sitting in one of the technical interchange meetings that we have, you would even know who works for who. Because we just bring the best of breed and who has the right experiences to do the job we&#8217;ve got to the table. So it&#8217;s really been quite seamless, and we&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>All despite the pandemic, which has caused nearly every company to change the way it operates. Callahan said that this has really put existing efforts to modernize operations into focus rather than upend their plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been investing for probably the last five years or more in what we&#8217;re calling digital transformation — so, digital collaboration tools, building digital twins of our spacecraft, so multiple people can work on the design at the same time,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The silver lining, if you want to think about it that way is&#8230; COVID has just helped to accelerate those. It&#8217;s teaching us that we can really collaborate in this kind of virtual environment in ways that maybe we&#8217;d never thought of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lockheed&#8217;s next big milestone is the delivery of its Orion spacecraft to Kennedy Space Station in Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited. We&#8217;ll be delivering that system over the VAB [NASA&#8217;s Vehicle Assembly Building], and it&#8217;ll go through its launch prep for a launch that will happen in 2021. And that will be the first time Orion will have launched off of the Space Launch System,&#8221; Callahan said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://uipath.com">UiPath</a>, the robotic process automation startup that has been growing like gangbusters, filed confidential paperwork with the SEC today ahead of a potential IPO.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uipath" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uipath">UiPath, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Inc. today announced that it has submitted a draft registration statement on a confidential basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for a proposed public offering of its Class A common stock. The number of shares of Class A common stock to be sold and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. UiPath intends to commence the public offering following completion of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sec-a9ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sec-a9ff">SEC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> review process, subject to market and other conditions,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company has raised more than $1.2 billion from investors like Accel, CapitalG, Sequoia and others. Its biggest raise was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/uipath-rpa-series-d/">$568 million led by Coatue</a> on an impressive $7 billion valuation in April 2019. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b/">raised another $225 million</a> led by Alkeon Capital last July when its valuation soared to $10.2 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XtaRJpvR6k"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/uipath-rpa-series-d/">UiPath nabs $568M at a $7B valuation to bring robotic process automation to the front office</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UiPath nabs $568M at a $7B valuation to bring robotic process automation to the front office&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/uipath-rpa-series-d/embed/#?secret=XtaRJpvR6k" data-secret="XtaRJpvR6k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time of the July raise, CEO and co-founder Daniel Dines did not shy away from the idea of an IPO, telling me:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re evaluating the market conditions and I wouldn’t say this to be vague, but we haven’t chosen a day that says on this day we’re going public. We’re really in the mindset that says we should be prepared when the market is ready, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s in the next 12-18 months.</p></blockquote>
<p>This definitely falls within that window. RPA helps companies take highly repetitive manual tasks and automate them. So for example, it could pull a number from an invoice, fill in a number in a spreadsheet and send an email to accounts payable, all without a human touching it.</p>
<p>It is a technology that has great appeal right now because it enables companies to take advantage of automation without ripping and replacing their legacy systems. While the company has raised a ton of money, and seen its valuation take off, it will be interesting to see if it will get the same positive reception as companies like Airbnb, C3.ai and Snowflake.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social gaming platform <a href="https://recroom.com/">Rec Room</a> has scored some new funding as it aims to bring its once VR-centric world to every major gaming platform out there.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a $20 million Series C led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/madrona-venture-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="madrona-venture-group">Madrona Venture Group <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Existing investors, including First Round Capital, Index, Sequoia and DAG, also participated in the round. They&#8217;ve raised just shy of $50 million to date.</p>
<p>The platform has been around for years serving as a social hub and gaming platform for virtual reality users. In recent years, the company has tried to scale its ambitions past being known as the &#8220;Roblox of VR&#8221; and scale its capabilities to meet its young user base. This year was big for the platform doing just that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Nick Fajt estimates that the company has tripled its total audience since this time last year as the company has made a concerted drive on new platforms. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While a substantial portion of Rec Room&#8217;s audience still comes from its bread-and-butter VR audience, the platform&#8217;s base of console users has grown substantially in 2020 and, by the end of next year, Fajt expects that mobile will have grown to be Rec Room&#8217;s most common point of entry. Meanwhile, m</span>obile Android remains one of the last major gaming platforms on which <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rec-room" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rec-room">Rec Room <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> still doesn&#8217;t have a home.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Against Gravity is building a VR world that won’t stop growing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/against-gravity-is-building-a-vr-world-that-wont-stop-growing/embed/#?secret=d7iKzr103C" data-secret="d7iKzr103C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the company&#8217;s big aims heading into the new year is scaling their creation tools, which allow players to build their own experiences inside the game. More than 1 million of the platform&#8217;s 10 million registered users have engaged with creator tools, building 4 million distinct rooms on the platform. Next year, Fajt plans to scale up creator payments estimating that by the end of 2021 they&#8217;ll have paid out $1 million to their network.</p>
<p>Fajt says he wants creation tools on Rec Room to be more accessible to the general player base than other platforms, including Roblox, aiming to keep tools simple for now and push everyday users to invest time in the creation platform.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Roblox has an incredible business, that’s certainly no secret,&#8221; Fajt tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We want breadth of expression over depth of expression; we want anyone who comes into to Rec Room to be able to build.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the slow maturation of the VR market, Fajt says the company doesn&#8217;t plan on moving away from its VR roots anytime soon. The company has just updated its popular battle royale mode Rec Royale for the new Quest 2, as well as on iOS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.umba.com/">Umba</a>, a digital bank for emerging markets and aiming first at Africa, has secured a $2 million seed funding round from new investors including Lachy Groom, ex-Head of Issuing at Stripe; Ludlow Ventures; Frontline Ventures and Act Venture.</p>
<p>Currently operating in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kenya" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kenya">Kenya <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Nigeria, Umba offers a digital financial service alternative to legacy African banks. Its mobile app gives customers a free checking account, free instant peer-to-peer money transfers, lending, deposits, BillPay and cash back. This is in contrast to the generally high-cost barriers found among traditional banking institutions in African countries.</p>
<p>Right now it’s available in Kenya and Nigeria, which have a combined population of over a quarter of a billion people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/umba" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="umba">Umba <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> competes with Kudao, Carbon, Eversend and &#8220;Chip or cash&#8221; methods.</p>
<p>Umba’s CEO Tiernan Kennedy said: “From the outset we built our platform to serve multiple markets, currencies and payment infrastructures. This flexibility is an extremely important consideration as it’s much harder to upgrade your systems at a later date. For example, bank and debit card penetration is high in Nigeria, so Umba is deeply integrated into those payment methods, while across Kenya and East Africa mobile money is dominant so our platform is tightly integrated with those services, too.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ludlow-ventures-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ludlow-ventures-llc">Ludlow Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> partner Brett deMarrais said: “Umba is the first investment we’ve made in the African market and it’s one we were excited to participate in. The team at Umba have an excellent service that drives down the cost of banking for their customers and democratizes access. The move away from physical branch infrastructure was already underway and it has accelerated this year. It’s clear the African market is maturing and that we’re entering a very interesting phase.”</p>
<p>The news comes shortly after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> $200 million acquisition of Nigerian payment service startup Paystack as well as the acquisition of DPO Group for $288 million and Sendwave for $500 million, showing a booming ecosystem breaking records in venture rounds and acquisitions.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast (<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For the first time in donkey&#8217;s years, we didn&#8217;t have our full crew this week. Instead, we had just <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">myself</a> &#8212; we had to survive without <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> while he took the week &#8220;off&#8221; to &#8220;relax.&#8221;</p>
<p>But our depleted ranks did not mean that news was waiting for us to reassemble. Indeed, there was a mass of stuff to get through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlanta-based Presso <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/dry-cleaning-robotics-startup-presso-raises-1-6m-as-it-shifts-focus-to-hollywood/">raised $1.6 million</a> for its in-unit dry cleaning tech, which we thought was neat.</li>
<li>OpenSensors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/opensensors-secures-4m-for-air-monitoring-platform-which-allows-offices-to-be-more-covid-safe/">raised $4 million</a> for its air-monitoring tech after a history of bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Lantern, which helps folks plan for their death, is having a big year. It <a href="https://lantern.co/">raised $1.4 million</a>.</li>
<li>Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">raised $65 million</a>, the same week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">Robinhood came under fire</a> by the Massachusetts securities group, and the SEC. Robinhood will pay $65 million to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges without admitting wrongdoing.</li>
<li>In the world of product, we chatted about <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/new-reader-homepage">Substack&#8217;s new Reader service</a>, which we seem to like. (We also chatted about <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/journalists-will-learn-influencing-isnt-easy/">this</a> Taylor Lorenz piece.)</li>
<li>It was also prime season to chat a little about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">what&#8217;s new in the Bitcoin world</a>, and take a peek at the stock market&#8217;s recent over-success. Roblox, see you in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for everyone who made it to the end, here are the pieces <a href="https://www.axios.com/creators-income-revenue-snapchat-cameo-substack-66457b1b-a9ab-4065-b0c6-58baa81edec4.html">from Axios</a> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/onlyfans-is-not-only-popular-but-hugely-profitable">and The Information</a> that we mentioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, perhaps the best-known American crypto company, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-b140a9dfc9f5">announced</a> today that it has filed confidentially to go public. The company&#8217;s debut was expected, having been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/">reported earlier in the year</a>.</p>
<p>As the well-funded unicorn has filed confidentially, its debut looks to be an early-2021 affair. What sort of flotation the company will pursue is not clear at this stage. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announcement is anodyne, as releases of this sort tend to be. The text of the short blog post does not mention whether Coinbase will pursue a traditional IPO or direct listing, but Slack&#8217;s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190204005225/en/">similar message</a> from early 2019 was similarly devoid of information; Slack went public via a direct listing last year before agreeing recently to sell to Salesforce.</p>
<p>Coinbase raised extensive known capital while private, including a $300 million Series E in October of 2018. Its August, 2017 Series D was worth a hair over $100 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase">according to Crunchbase data</a>. Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth and IVP are among the investors that led rounds into the crypto-focused fintech company.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase reported to consider late 2020, early 2021 public debut&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/embed/#?secret=TeO6HCxgtp" data-secret="TeO6HCxgtp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It is not clear how large Coinbase&#8217;s revenues have grown, or how profitable or not its operations have proven in recent years. While there has been some reporting about its historical growth, how the company has fared more recently is opaque. Therefore, how well Coinbase&#8217;s impending public valuation will compare to its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/coinbase-series-e--25f6f746">$8 billion private valuation</a> is hard to guess.</p>
<p>The company is going public amidst a surge of interest in cryptocurrencies, the prices of many having risen in recent months. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">TechCrunch explored the trend earlier today.</a></p>
<p>Coinbase has also been in a number of controversial spots in 2020, including the loss of dozens of employees after its CEO declared that the company would not participate in any political matters that were not, in his view, directly tied to the company&#8217;s mission.<b> </b>The ensuing dialogue about the company&#8217;s decision <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">was loud</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Roblox and Affirm now taking an early-2021 tack for their own IPOs, we can add Coinbase to the list of companies we expect to float in January.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijaysundaram/">Vijay Sundaram</a> is the Chief Strategy Officer of Zoho Corporation, the parent company of ManageEngine. He leads or is involved in multiple functional areas from corporate strategy and execution to channel management, business development and enterprise sales.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As consumers, most of us <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/cybersecurity-protect-me.html">don’t mind providing companies</a> like Google, Facebook and Twitter with our personal data, as long as we get access to the services and solutions we want to use. However, many people don’t realize that these companies function as data-collecting surveillance organizations, integrating data collection into their business models in clandestine ways.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to users, many companies allow third parties to place embed codes on their websites, capturing user behavior to either harvest or sell to other parties. This practice of &#8220;adjunct surveillance,&#8221; as Zoho Chief Evangelist Raju Vegesna describes it, has become common practice given a lack of resistance from users, investors and other business leaders.</p>
<p>To anyone paying attention, it has become painfully evident that the surveillance pendulum has swung too far. Companies are collecting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">and sharing</a> user data with impunity. In fact, adjunct surveillance has become so egregious that a wave of data privacy laws has sprung up in recent years: the EU&#8217;s GDPR, California&#8217;s CCPA, New York&#8217;s SHIELD Act and Brazil&#8217;s LGPD, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s time for tech leaders to take a stand by formally, and visibly, taking a privacy pledge.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Due to increased government regulation and public awareness, business leaders are starting to see the writing on the wall. However, it&#8217;s not enough to rely on lawmakers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing/">regulators&#8217; activity</a>. It is also not enough to be<em> legally</em> compliant, burying the notices in legalese or fine print. Such Machiavellian maneuvers may technically be legal, but they&#8217;re certainly not moral.</p>
<p>It’s time for tech leaders to take a stand by formally, and visibly, taking a privacy pledge.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t let advertising companies track your users without their knowledge</h2>
<p>Even if your business depends upon selling user data to third-party advertisers, it is vital that you inform your users about what you&#8217;re doing with their data. In some cases, it very well may be legal to withhold such information from users; however, that doesn&#8217;t make it right.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1996, ManageEngine — then doing business as Zoho — has refused to allow any third-party advertisements on any of its websites or products. In an effort to block all adjunct surveillance, they don&#8217;t allow the embedding of any third-party tracking codes anywhere on their sites. Although social media share buttons may seem innocuous, they should be removed as well, as the buttons can essentially function as Trojan horses.</p>
<h2>Inform your customers about any third-party integrations that may track their data</h2>
<p>If your enterprise is financially reliant on such activity, it needs to be transparent about it. Take Google as an example: Many of us don&#8217;t have a problem using Gmail because we value the service enough to provide the search behemoth with our data. However, when Google leverages our user data to enter into partnerships with credit card and healthcare companies on the sly, that is a different story entirely.</p>
<p>Google partnered with Ascension hospitals back in 2018 on &#8220;Project Nightingale,&#8221; a data-sharing initiative that was not revealed to Ascension patients. Although subsequent investigations found that Google had not technically violated HIPAA, or any other laws for that matter, it is likely that the public wouldn&#8217;t even know about this initiative had it not been for this <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790">scoop</a>. Also, it&#8217;s highly unlikely that this type of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/the-coming-fight-over-who-controls-digital-health-data/">surreptitious health data partnership</a> is an anomaly.</p>
<p>As another example, Google also secretly partnered with Mastercard in an effort to compete with Amazon and capture consumer retail spending data. After an exposé revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/31/google-and-mastercard-reportedly-partner-to-track-offline-purchases/">clandestine partnership</a>, both companies claimed that they didn&#8217;t have any personally identifiable information for any customers. According to Google, they utilized double-blind encryption technology that protected all user data, which had been aggregated and anonymized. Despite this frequently made argument that all the users&#8217; personal data had been &#8220;de-identified,&#8221; at no point were Mastercard or Google users made privy of the deal. In all likelihood, this Mastercard partnership is not a one-off for Google. Through an <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/">AdWords blog</a>, Google claims to have access to 70% of all credit and debit card users&#8217; activity.</p>
<p>The moral of the story? Don’t be like Google.</p>
<h2>Use encryption tools to protect customer data transmitted over public networks</h2>
<p>If your business sends user data over public networks, ensure all server connections use encryption with strong ciphers. Follow the hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) and the transport layer security (TLS) protocols to ensure there is always a secure connection between web browsers, your corporate server and all third-party servers. Not only does the TLS protocol allow both parties to be authenticated, but it also encrypts the data, ensuring that no third parties can eavesdrop or otherwise interfere with the data transfer process.</p>
<h2>Consider investing in internal data centers</h2>
<p>If economically feasible, companies should store customer data in self-owned data centers, or own the servers inside these data centers. By not relying on third-party data centers and public cloud offerings, not only will you bolster your data privacy initiatives, but you&#8217;ll also likely save money over time. Additionally, your company will benefit as more and more users begin to value companies that go out of their way to protect user data.</p>
<p>As a private company, ManageEngine has never been beholden to external shareholders, which has allowed executives to look at things through a philosophical lens as opposed to a financial lens. From the outset, they&#8217;ve always placed a premium on user privacy, which is why the current surveillance landscape has garnered such ire within their organization. To be sure, they&#8217;ve left some money on the table by taking such a hard line on privacy.</p>
<p>However, as Vegesna frequently asks, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of being financially profitable if your business is morally bankrupt?&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now we're making it easier and more secure for you to contact our reporters and editors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past few years, some of the biggest stories on TechCrunch have come from you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/google-employees-demand-company-stop-selling-tech-to-police/">internal employee battles</a> at some of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies, reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/t-mobile-layoffs-sprint/">unexpected layoffs</a> during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/bird-lays-off-about-30-of-workforce-amid-covid-19-pandemic/">the pandemic</a>, uncovered safety violations, seen how Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">paid teens to snoop</a> on their private data, revealed a major hack that a company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/03/stockx-hacked-millions-records/">tried to cover up</a>, and exposed workplace discrimination, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/nso-group-fleming-contact-tracing/">secretive startups</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/">government wrongdoing</a>.</p>
<p>We have been able to report on these important issues in large part because sources have reached out with information that companies and governments don&#8217;t want to come to light.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re making it easier and more secure for you to contact TechCrunch reporters and editors.</p>
<p>Today, we are launching our own SecureDrop, a tip submission system that allows you to securely and anonymously reach out with information, files and documents for us to investigate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2068864" style="width: 2330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2068864" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2068864 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg" alt="" width="2320" height="1638" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg 2320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=768,542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=680,480 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=1536,1084 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=2048,1446 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/securedrop-hero.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2320px) 100vw, 2320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2068864" class="wp-caption-text">This is what TechCrunch&#8217;s SecureDrop looks like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>SecureDrop is a system designed to allow us to communicate with you while protecting your identity from virtually all kinds of tracking. It works in part thanks to the Tor anonymity network, which bounces and encrypts your internet traffic through several servers on its way to its destination in order to make tracking almost impossible. Accessing Tor — and our SecureDrop — requires use of the free-to-use Tor Browser. That means we won&#8217;t know who you are, unless you tell us.</p>
<p>We know what sources risk in revealing information that the powerful want to keep secret.</p>
<p>Rest assured, our SecureDrop is physically controlled by TechCrunch, and anything you submit to SecureDrop is encrypted and can only be viewed by TechCrunch editors. The software itself, maintained by the nonprofit <a href="https://securedrop.org/directory/techcrunch">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, goes through regular security audits and will be kept up-to-date with the latest fixes.</p>
<p>You can access instructions on how to use our SecureDrop by going to: <strong>techcrunch.com/securedrop</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
