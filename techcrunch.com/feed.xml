										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As schools move more widely into reopening their doors for in-person learning, many educational institutions have also learned a critical lesson in the last year. Having better tools to teach remotely are critical for situations when the physical experience has to be shut down, but even when things are &#8220;back to normal&#8221;, better tech can still enhance what educators and students can do, and to whom teaching can be delivered. Now, a startup betting on virtual learning in higher education &#8212; and investing in the innovation to deliver that &#8212; is announcing a round of funding as it continues to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="http://engageli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engageli</a>, which has built an online teaching platform from the ground up &#8212; providing not just its own built-in-house video technology to deliver lectures and enable conversations, but tools to enable students to &#8220;sit&#8221; in study groups to work together; and features to share and annotate lecture notes, take quizzes and more &#8212; has picked up $33 million in funding.</p>
<p>CEO Dan Avida &#8212; who co-founded the company with his wife Daphne Koller (the Coursera co-founder) and Serge Plotkin &#8212; said the startup will be using to continue building more tools and scaling its platform and opening it up to more schools, specifically the bracket of higher learning colleges and universities that it targets as customers, as these institutions continue to embrace the promise of better video tools both for delivering live lessons, and also to develop more on-demand and other features around Engageli&#8217;s video platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At first the priority was on the best synchronous experience,&#8221; Avida said in an interview of the priorities of universities when it came to remote learning. &#8220;Now everyone is much more focused on multi-modality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding, a Series A, is being co-led by Maveron and another (unnamed) investor and also includes participation from Corner Ventures, Good Friends, Educapital, and what Engageli describes as several &#8220;prominent individual technology executives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, the funding is coming only seven months after the startup first emerged from stealth in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/engageli-comes-out-of-stealth-with-14-5m-and-a-new-approach-to-teaching-by-video-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2020</a>, and investors from the $14.5 million seed round that it announced at the same time are also participating. The startup has now raised over $47 million and is not disclosing its valuation.</p>
<p>While there are now dozens, maybe even hundreds, of tools to help students learn things without being inside a traditional classroom, Engageli has taken a slightly different approach from the pack by building its video-based platform from the ground up with educational aims in mind.</p>
<p>This is already a step change, when you think about it, from the likes of Teams from Microsoft, Google Classroom, or Zoom. These are three of the most commonly used video platforms in educational settings, but they are all based on technology that was, essentially, originally built with more enterprise and generic purposes in mind.</p>
<p>From this, Engageli has worked on expanding the platform with tools that enhance not just the video experience, but enhance it in ways that make sense for educators and learners.</p>
<p>Up to now, these have focused on both the kinds of conversations that students can have with each other and the teacher, and ways for the teacher to keep their students engaged, by way of quizzes, notes that they can download and annotate and Q&amp;A channels. For now, Engageli is focused on building its own technology, but over time you can see how the platform might open up to link up with bigger learning management systems and the other tools that institutions might already be using regularly.</p>
<p>Avida said that Engageli is not yet disclosing any metrics on engagement time, customer or user numbers or any other figures. For now, he said the startup is picking up university customers across the U.S., in the UK and Israel (where the founders hail from and all originally cut their tech teeth in the country&#8217;s military units), where classes are already handling up to &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of concurrent students.</p>
<p>He also added that even as more schools return to in-person learning, he is expecting a boost of new users in the fall quarter because the genie, so to speak, is out of the bottle with remote learning and the fact that it can continue to be effective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before the pandemic there were tens of millions of students online, half of all students were taking some form of online course, and we expect this to go much further, not unlike online grocery or telemedicine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One professor described it to me like this: the trough of disillusionment&#8221; &#8212; a reference to the Gartner Magic Quadrant visualization &#8212; &#8220;is very shallow here. We ain&#8217;t going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is also a sentiment that educators also seem to be picking up.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to go back once you raise the bar on engagement. With Engageli, I felt the experience was the most like a real classroom. Students are sitting at tables, I can quickly see what they are doing, they can ask others at their table questions, they are chatting and interacting,” said Dr. Theodora Christou, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, in a statement. “I finally have an easy way to lead meaningful group work and case studies online. I would choose Engageli over any other existing tool that my university offers.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding and growth come at a time when we&#8217;re indeed seeing a wider wholesale adoption and development of more tools to accommodate digital modes of learning, in many cases also to complement what is happening offline, and also in younger age groups, too.</p>
<p>Just in the last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquires-clever-the-us-based-edtech-portal-for-up-to-500m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot acquired Clever</a> in the U.S. to bring on a popular platform used by many K-12 schools to manage their online learning interctions, and yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StuDocu raised funding</a> for a platform that crowdsources, rates and shares university class notes, a platform that has now passed 15 million students and is growing very fast. All of these spell higher expectations for better technology in the future, something Engageli will also be hoping to engage.</p>
<p>“Dan Avida and his team at Engageli, that includes professors, talented technologists and accomplished ed-tech executives, are uniquely suited to building a digital education solution that actually feels like a classroom and functions even better than some in-person courses,” said Jason Stoffer, Partner at Maveron, in a statement. “Pandemic or not, every school needs Engageli to drive better outcomes for students, whether they’re taking remote classes full time or opt to tune in digitally when they need the flexibility. We’re passionate about leveling the playing field in higher education, and Engageli’s unique platform will help institutions reach and support the needs of every type of student.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Pay users in the U.S. can now send money to GPay users in India and Singapore, Google said on Tuesday, making its first push into the remittances market.</p>
<p>The company has partnered with Western Union and Wise, both of which have integrated their services into Google Pay. This is the first time either of the cross-border payments firms have inked such a deal.</p>
<p>Josh Woodward, Director of Product Management at Google, told TechCrunch in an interview that the company is kickstarting its cross-border payments feature with India and Singapore and intends to expand this worldwide by the end of the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As we do with a number of Google products, we will test, learn, and iterate and then start scaling,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, Western Union will power cross-border payments on Google Pay in over 200 countries, while Wise &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly known as TransferWise</a> &#8212; will extend the support in over 80 countries.</p>
<p>When Google Pay users in the U.S. attempt to send money to someone in India or Singapore, they will be informed about the exact amount that the recipient will receive. From within the Google Pay app, users also get to choose which payments provider &#8212; Wise or Western Union &#8212; they wish to use and how long it would take for the recipient to receive the money.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2150295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PayFriend-Hero.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></p>
<p>The remittance feature currently allows only Google Pay’s US users to send money to those in India and Singapore &#8212; and not the other way around. Woodward said the company picked India and Singapore in part because of how crucial they are in the remittances world.</p>
<p>India was the largest receiving country for remittances in 2019, receiving more than $80 billion in the year, according to the World Bank. The U.S., meanwhile, is the largest sender. Eventually, Google intends to enable fully cross-border remittances worldwide.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: The cross-border payments is only available for person-to-person payments. (Businesses on GPay in the U.S. can’t send money to individuals or businesses in India, for instance.)</p>
<p>The partnership with Google will help Wise and Western Union to expand their presence in several markets and more aggressively compete with rivals such as PayPal, which has a wider reach. Wise and Western Union will shoulder the liability and risk.</p>
<p>Nearly 250 million people across the world send over $500 billion in cross-border remittances annually, a report by Citi said last month. But the space is ripe for disruption. &#8220;The fees are extremely high. It is embarrassing that we have not solved this issue so far,&#8221; Citi analysts wrote. Global average cost for sending money is around 6.5%.</p>
<p>Western Union said in a statement that receivers will pay no charges and will get the exact value in their local currency as chosen by the user in the U.S. Wise said it will charge the actual foreign exchange rate and additional transfer fees, which will wary from country to country. (&#8220;The easiest way to find out how much it’ll cost is to find a friend on Google Pay, select Wise as a partner, tap Pay, and enter the amount you’d like to transfer,&#8221; it said.)</p>
<p>In either case, Google will not levy any additional fee to customers. Also, until June 16, Western Union will offer unlimited free transfers when sending money with Google Pay, and Wise will make the first transfer free for new customers on transfers up to $500.</p>
<p>“The pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on communities, customers and colleagues in many parts of Asia, especially in India and Latin America. This convenient channel will help people continue supporting one another in these trying times as they reimagine how they can pay and move money worldwide,&#8221; said Shelly Swanback, President of Western Union Product and Platform, in a statement.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes months after Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">redesigned the GPay app in the U.S.</a>, and made a push into banking services with checking accounts feature from lenders such as Citi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lisbon-based food delivery startup <a href="https://www.kitch.io/">Kitch</a> hopes to hands back control to restaurants dogged by the mess of food delivery apps today, by aggregating the apps onto one tablet and platform. Restaurants then get one place to manage all their delivery orders, track couriers, and update their menus across all the delivery apps. It’s now raised a €3.25 ($4M) Seed round led by Atlantic Food Labs, with the participation from Market One Capital and the company’s initial investors, Seedcamp and Lisbon-based Mustard Seed MAZE.</p>
<p>Launched in March 2020 Kitch developed its own proprietary technology to support independent restaurants<br />
Rui Bento, co-founder and CEO at Kitch said: “We are committed to making available and to keep developing the tools that enable restaurants to retain their independence and to regain control of their digital businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Huber, Partner at Atlantic Food Labs said: &#8220;Kitch has shown remarkable traction within a very short time, in a market that continues to grow rapidly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the Kitch app, restaurants create an online store, enabling them to sell their dishes on delivery and takeaway and can own a relationship with their customers. Kitch takes care of payments, deliveries, and customer support and interfaces with apps such as Uber Eats, Glovo, and Deliveroo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Say what you will, Nothing has been doing a fine job milking its upcoming launch for all it’s worth. The company has spent the last several month’s teasing the arrival of its first product. The launch will find the company entering the already extremely crowded earbuds category in June, with the arrival of the simply named Ear 1.</p>
<p>Founder Carl Pei teased the forthcoming product in a blog post today, while adding that the company was still a ways off from fully achieving its mission statement of hardware products that simply disappear.</p>
<p>“For those hoping for a disappearing act overnight, Ear 1 falls short,” Pei writes. “The greatest visions are not realized with the flip of a switch, but instead through countless small successes. Ear 1 is just the start. Design is still top secret but what we can tell you is that Ear 1 combines notes of transparency, iconic form, and refined  functionality. It is the starting point that will define the artistry, confidence and craftsmanship that will carry our products and services for years to come.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pre-launch hype around the company and product is certainly understandable. Beyond teasing the launch piece by piece, Pei has earned goodwill as the co-founder of OnePlus. The company grew at an impressive rate, courtesy of quality smartphones at an affordable price point, all while maintaining a direct line to its fanbase.</p>
<p>The forthcoming product maintains OnePlus’ simple naming scheme. “Can you guess what the sequel will be called?” the executive asks rhetorically. “Good. Us too.”</p>
<p>OnePlus has also entered the earbuds game, including, most recently, the launch of the fully wireless OnePlus Buds.</p>

<p>The $38 million raise is comprised of $20M in debt financing from Swedbank and Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK), with a loan amounting to $12M from Swedbank (partly underwritten by the Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN) under the guarantee of investment credits for companies with innovations) and SEK issuing a loan amounting to $8M (partly underwritten by the pan-EU European Investment Fund (EIF)); along with $18M through a directed share issue to Ilija Batljan Invest AB.</p>
<p>The share issue of 937,500 shares has a transaction share price of $19.2 &#8212; which corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $860M for the solar cell maker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back in 2019 <a href="https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20190304">SoftBank </a>also put $20M into Exeger, in two investments of $10M &#8212; entering a strategic partnership to accelerate the global rollout of its tech and further extending its various investments in solar energy.</p>
<p>The Swedish company has also previously received a loan from the Swedish Energy Agency, in 2014, to develop its solar cell tech. But this latest debt financing round is its first on commercial terms (albeit partly underwritten by EKN and EIF).</p>
<p>Exeger says its solar cell tech is the only one that can be printed in free-form and different colors, meaning it can &#8220;seamlessly enhance any product with endless power&#8221;, as its PR puts it.</p>
<p>So far two devices have integrated the Powerfoyle tech: A <a href="https://www.exeger.com/news/first-self-charging-helmet-by-poc/">bike helmet with an integrated safety taillight</a> (by POC), and <a href="https://www.exeger.com/news/introducing-urbanista-los-angeles-solar-powered-headphones-with-virtually-infinite-playtime/">a pair of wireless headphones</a> (by Urbanista). Although neither has yet been commercially launched &#8212; but both are slated to go on sale next month.</p>
<p>Exeger says its planned second factory in Stockholm will allow it to increase its manufacturing capacity tenfold by 2023, helping it target a broader array of markets sooner and accelerating its goal of mass adoption of its tech.</p>
<p>Its main target markets for the novel solar cell technology currently include consumer electronics, smart home, smart workplace, and IoT.</p>
<p>More device partnerships are slated as coming this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don’t label our rounds but take a more pragmatic view on fundraising,&#8221; said Giovanni Fili, founder and CEO. &#8220;Developing a new technology, a new energy source, as well as laying the foundation for a new industry takes time. Thus, a company like ours requires long-term strategic investors that all buy into the vision as well as the overall strategy. We have spent a lot of time and energy on this, and it has paid off. It has given the company the resources required, both time and money, to bring an invention to a commercial launch, which is where we are today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fili added that it&#8217;s chosen to raise debt financing now &#8220;because we can&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same answer as when asked why we build a new factory in Stockholm, Sweden, rather than abroad. We have always said that once commercial, we will start leveraging the balance sheet when securing funds for the next factory. Thanks to our long-standing relationship with Swedbank and SEK, as well as the great support of the Swedish government through EKN underwriting part of the loans, we were able to move this forward,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Discussing the forthcoming two debut gizmos, the POC Omne Eternal helmet and the Urbanista Los Angeles headphones &#8212; which will both go sale in June &#8212; Fili says interest in the self-powered products has &#8220;surpassed all our expectations&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any product which integrates Powerfoyle is able to charge under all forms of light, whether from indoor lamps or natural outdoor light. The stronger the light, the faster it charges. The POC helmet, for example, doesn’t have a USB port to power the safety light because the ambient light will keep it charging, cycling or not,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Urbanista Los Angeles wireless headphones have already garnered tremendous interest online. Users can spend one hour outdoors with the headphones and gain three hours of battery time. This means most users will never need to worry about charging. As long as you have our product in light, any light, it will constantly charge. That’s one of the key aspects of our technology, we have designed and engineered the solar cell to work wherever people need it to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This is the year of our commercial breakthrough,&#8221; he added in a statement. &#8220;The phenomenal response from the product releases with POC and Urbanista are clear indicators this is the perfect time to introduce self-powered products to<br />
the world. We need mass scale production to realize our vision which is to touch the lives of a billion people by 2030, and that’s why the factory is being built now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart has hit the market to raise about $1 billion at up to $30 billion valuation in a pre-IPO financing round, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">sold majority stake to Walmart for $16 billion in 2018</a>, initiated fundraise possibilities with some investors earlier this year and has since grown more serious and hired bankers.</p>
<p>In recent months, the company has also internally discussed pushing its public listing timeline to early next year, the people said, requesting anonymity as details are private. (The firm still intends to file for an IPO later this year. A listing takes an additional few months. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-flipkart-ipo-spac-idCAKBN2AW114-OCATC">reported</a> last year that Flipkart might list overseas in 2021.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several major investors of Flipkart declined to comment on fundraise talks early this month and the e-commerce firm didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. An early Flipkart investor, who has since sold all its stake, said it made sense that the e-commerce group was planning to raise some capital as the market currently has no shortage of it.</p>
<p>11 Indian startups have turned unicorn this year, more than half of them last month, as some high-profile investors including Tiger Global and Falcon Edge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">double down on the world&#8217;s second largest internet market</a>.</p>
<p>Flipkart, which was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/walmart-invests-additional-1-2-billion-in-indias-flipkart-to-increase-stake/">valued at about $24.9 billion last year when it raised $1.2 billion</a> in a round led by Walmart, hasn&#8217;t finalized the new investment and the deal size as well as the valuation may change, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>In an earnings call in November last year, Walmart said Flipkart and its payments entity PhonePe had reached an all-time high monthly active customers base. In an earnings call in February this year, Judith McKenna, President and Chief Executive Officer of Walmart International, said Flipkart&#8217;s GMV growth was impacted by a 53-day national lockdown in India in the first half of the last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the business rebounded and exited Q4 with strong momentum, delivering GMV growth roughly double that of the full year,&#8221; said McKenna, adding that more than 250 million customers in India engaged with the e-commerce platform during last year&#8217;s festival sales.</p>
<p>India was hit by a second wave of the coronavirus in early April, which has again prompted some states to enforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/walmarts-flipkart-to-cover-insurance-for-all-sellers-in-india-and-waive-additional-fees/">restrictions on servicing of non-essential items</a> on e-commerce platforms. Flipkart announced on Tuesday that it is working to strengthen its grocery infrastructure as it expands the new category.</p>

<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm competes neck to neck with Amazon in India. The American e-commerce group has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested over $6.5 billion in the South Asian market</a>.</p>
<p>Both the firms are struggling to aggressively expand their footprint in India, where physical stores continue to drive the vast majority of retail sales. An additional heavily-funded player <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">arrived in the market last year to further increase the competition</a>.</p>
<p>E-commerce platform JioMart, a joint venture between Reliance Retail (India’s largest retail chain) and Google and Facebook-backed Jio Platforms (India’s largest telecom operator), launched last year in over 200 cities and towns across the nation.</p>
<p>At stake is one of the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce markets that is poised to grow even further as more first-time internet users begin to shop online. India’s e-commerce market is estimated to reach more than 300 million shoppers by 2025, according to estimates by Bain &amp; Company. These shoppers would have bought items worth more than $100 billion from online platforms, the firm projected.</p>
<p>In recent years, Flipkart and Amazon have made a number of bets to expand their reach in India. Both of them have rolled out support for Hindi language (Flipkart has added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/walmarts-flipkart-makes-local-languages-push-to-win-small-indian-cities-and-towns/">several additional Indian languages as well</a>), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/">partnered with neighborhood stores</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;34% of the population [in India] are millennials, young people. By 2030, there is an estimate that this young population of millennials and GenZ will be 75% of the total population. 700 million Indians are digital today. And I also want to just quickly acknowledge that Digital India vision of the Government of India, which has actually enabled this. So you have a unique combination of a big market, completely digital, getting wealthier and very young,&#8221; said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of Flipkart, in February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even the most sanguine industry observer has to be stunned at times by the pace of dealmaking right now. Not quite halfway through 2021, startups are routinely closing new rounds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/tiger-global-leads-100-million-investment-in-indian-social-commerce-dealshare/">just months apart</a> and sometimes seeing their valuations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/mobile-bank-current-raises-220-million-series-d-triples-valuation-to-2-2b/">triple</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/">quadruple</a> with every new round.</p>
<p>Maybe they will all become trillion-dollar companies. It&#8217;s more likely, however, that they will not, which is where year-old <a href="https://about.caplight.io/">Caplight</a> comes in. Led by Javier Avalos, a former investment banker who recently spent more than three years with the secondaries platform Forge, Caplight is developing tech to enable institutional investors to take long and short private company positions via synthetic, cash-settled derivatives, so whether or not they own any actual shares in certain startups, they can bet on their rise or fall.</p>
<p>Caplight isn&#8217;t the first company drawn to the idea. Another young startup in New York, Apeira Capital, is also looking to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/overvalued-startups-could-be-shorted-by-new-firm-11607337001">&#8220;short&#8221; overvalued startups</a>.  More, Avalos and his cofounder, Justin Moore, a former engineering manager at Forge, could also face competition, from their old firm, for example, as well as Carta, the venture-backed company that makes software to manage equity stakes in other startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, Avalos thinks he&#8217;s on to something. Caplight already has $400 million worth of interest from more than 30 institutions, he says. It also just closed on $1.7 million in pre-seed funding led by Fin VC, with participation from Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, Clocktower Ventures, and Dash Fund. We talked with him late last week to learn more; below are excerpts from that chat, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were at Forge, which helps people buy and sell pre-IPO shares. What opportunity did you see while working there?</strong></p>
<p>JA:  I think what platforms like Forge have done really well is build tech solutions for startup employees, for startup founders, and for the companies themselves, and that&#8217;s great. What we&#8217;re really focused on are larger institutions who need true liquidity, meaning higher frequency of trading, whether that&#8217;s <b> </b> buying and selling option contracts, or entering swap-type agreements. [They need a way] to quickly move in and out of positions, as well as hedge themselves.</p>
<p>Caplight [aims to become the] infrastructure that enables any other fund that is looking to take directional positions in private companies. It&#8217;s meant to be the plumbing that connects that fund to a market, but not just the marketplace &#8211;all of the infrastructure that comes with that. So holding assets in prime brokerage; being able to quickly settle transactions through clearinghouses; being able to provide [the] data to inform a mark to market to value those contracts.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Even more specifically, what are you offering?</strong></p>
<p>JA: So we [want to] allow institutional investors to hedge their private company stock &#8212; to generate income on their private company stock by selling out-of-the-money option contracts, for instance. We also allow institutional investors to take short or long positions [and] we&#8217;re doing all of our transactions synthetically, so the underlying shares don&#8217;t don&#8217;t actually have to move.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is that private company stock used as collateral or encumbered in any way? Do you need the permission of the startup?</strong></p>
<p>JA: The pre-IPO stock <em>can</em> be used as collateral. It doesn&#8217;t always need to be though. The great thing about building a synthetic platform is you can inject liquidity into the market by working with sellers who don&#8217;t actually own the stock. If I&#8217;m a hedge fund, and I don&#8217;t own shares of a pre-IPO company, but I still want to express a short interest &#8212; a negative view on that company &#8212; I could use Caplight to do that. I&#8217;d just need to hold other tradable securities as collateral. That&#8217;s part of the beauty of what makes this a marketplace that can have very rapid settlement and execution.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So if a hedge fund wants to go short, it just needs to needs to find another party on your service who&#8217;s willing to take that trade? </strong></p>
<p>JA: What you need is two parties &#8212; one who one who&#8217;s interested in going short on the name, and another who&#8217;s interested in going long on the name. Beyond that, you need a model that helps these parties arrive at not just an agreed-upon valuation of the company today, but also where they&#8217;re comfortable striking a contract at some point in the future, and then a methodology for valuation at any point in time in between those two points.What we&#8217;re talking about here is a methodology to create a mark to market on what the value of that contract is at any given time between the time you enter the contract and the time you ultimately go to settle the contract. Those are really the three main ingredients that are needed here.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you develop this methodology? How automated is it?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;re in the process of building that out now. There&#8217;s quite a bit of work, as you can imagine, that goes into that. And part of the mandate that we have having raised this pre seed funding is to go out and find the best talent to come in and help us with this.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Assuming some of these inputs would include fund-raising announcements, any announced revenues, and where things are trading on the secondary market, what are other inputs might surprise people?</strong></p>
<p>JA: Maybe a less obvious one is that when public mutual funds own private tech companies&#8217; stock, they have to report out on at least a quarterly basis where they&#8217;re marking those positions, and that&#8217;s all public information. So that&#8217;s another alternative data set that we would love to pull into our platform in product form.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why does your company make sense now versus earlier in time? Does it tie to smart contracts?</strong></p>
<p>JA: Smart contracts are are definitely an enabler. But I think it&#8217;s more of a function of where we are in the markets. Forge alone is [ approaching a billion dollars a quarter of volume] and that&#8217;s just one platform. When you sum up all the activity, we think there is $20 billion of transaction volume, meaning pre IPO shares that are trading hands each year. For that size marketplace to exist without the ability to have directional bets on top of that, or hedging that is made very easy, it just didn&#8217;t make sense to us that hedging and derivative-type transactions don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is a work in progress. In the meantime, what&#8217;s to stop Forge or Carta from doing what you&#8217;re doing?</strong></p>
<p>JA: It&#8217;s something I spend a lot of time thinking about. It goes back to a point that I mentioned earlier, which is that I think Carta and Forge have done a really good job of building tech solutions that serve the companies, and I think a lot of future growth from Carta and Forge and some of the other players is pegged on their ability to develop company relationships. And when you have a lot of [your] growth pegged on building out these relationships &#8212; a lot of the valuation that&#8217;s being ascribed to Forge and Carta and other secondary platforms is tied their ability to maintain those relationships &#8212; to turn around and stand up a marketplace that allows institutions to go short on the same companies that you&#8217;re fighting to build relationships with is a direct conflict.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serialized fiction app <a href="https://www.radishfiction.com/">Radish</a> will be acquired by Kakao Entertainment in a transaction valued at $440 million. Kakao Entertainment is owned by Kakao, the South Korean internet giant whose services include its eponymous messaging platform. Radish founder Seungyoon Lee will hold onto his role as its chief executive officer, while also becoming Kakao Entertainment’s global strategy officer to lead its growth in international markets.</p>
<p>Radish claims millions of users in North America, and the acquisition will help Kakao Entertainment expand its own webtoons and web novel business there, and in other English-speaking markets. Radish will retain management autonomy and continue operating as its own brand.</p>
<p>The news comes as another South Korean internet giant, Naver, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/with-new-owner-naver-wattpad-looks-to-level-up-its-user-generated-ip-factory/">completes its acquisition of Wattpad</a>, in a deal that also focuses on intellectual property.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Founded in 2015, Radish originally focused on user-generated content, but now the core of its business is <a href="https://radishfiction.com/users/RadishOriginals">Radish Originals</a>, or serial fiction series designed specifically for the app. The company said the launch of Radish Originals in 2018 helped propel its growth, with revenue increasing more than 10 times in 2020 from the previous year.</p>
<p>Radish monetizes content through its micropayments system, which allows users to read several free episodes before making payments of about 20 to 30 cents to unlock new episodes (users also have the option of waiting an hour to unlock episodes for free). About 90% of its revenue now comes from Radish Originals.</p>
<p>The acquisition means that Radish Originals’ intellectual property will now be adapted by Kakao into webtoons, videos and other content, increasing their reach. Since 2016, Kakao Entertainment has adapted several web novels including “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim?,” “A Business Proposal” and “Solo Leveling” into webtoons and other media.</p>

<p>Lee told TechCrunch that Radish started exclusively distributing several of Kakao Entertainment’s most popular original series, like “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim?” last month. It plans to launch more content from Kakao Entertainment’s portfolio and are also “looking at ways in which we can make original localized novel adaptions of Kakao’s popular stories,” he added.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Kakao Entertainment CEO Jinsoo Lee said, “Radish has firmly established itself as a leading web novel platform and yet we see even greater growth potential… With the combination of Kakao’s expertise in the IP business and Radish’s strong North American foothold, we are excited about what we can achieve together.”</p>
<p>The acquisition has been approved by Radish’s board of directors, which includes a representative from SoftBank Ventures Asia, its largest investor, and the majority of its shareholders. Radish’s other backers include Lowercase Capital, K50 Ventures, Nicolas Bergruen, Charlie Songhurst, Duncan Clark and Amy Tan, the best-selling author.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota has tapped Japanese company ENEOS to help develop the hydrogen fuel cell system that will power its futuristic prototype city Woven City.</p>
<p>The vision for the 175-acre city, where people will live and work amongst all of Toyota’s projects, including its autonomous e-Palette shuttles and robots, is to build a fully connected ecosystem powered by hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Woven Planet, the innovation-focused subsidiary of Toyota that is in charge of the project, announced Monday that ENEOS, a Japanese petroleum company that’s investing heavily into hydrogen, will help make Toyota’s “human-centered” city of the future. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This new partnership not only signifies Toyota’s backing of hydrogen over electric, but it also could help Japan achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two companies will work together to test the feasibility of a hydrogen-based supply chain, from production to delivery to usage. To facilitate this, ENEOS will further its technological developments in hydrogen production in order to achieve a fully carbon-free supply chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As Japan&#8217;s leading integrated energy company, ENEOS has demonstrated its valuable expertise in all vital processes from hydrogen production to sales and we are confident they have the holistic perspective we require for success,” said Akio Toyoda, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation, in a statement. “To realize a hydrogen-based society, in addition to the evolution of individual technologies, it is essential to seamlessly integrate all the processes of production, delivery, and use.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota is positioning hydrogen as a top viable clean energy source for the future with this partnership, although it certainly has more electric vehicles on the market than hydrogen, including</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/toyota-to-bring-three-new-electrified-vehicles-to-u-s-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three new ones this year.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Its iconic hydrogen fuel-cell powered car, the Toyota Mirai, saw a 2021 upgrade, and it&#8217;s the same tech that Toyota used in its Kenworth T680 tractor. Toyota may still consider using electric in Woven City, a Woven Planet spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its partnership with Woven City, ENEOS will use its expertise of operating 45 commercial hydrogen refueling stations in the four major metropolitan areas in Japan to establish one outside of Woven City. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Operation of the hydrogen refueling station to be built by ENEOS is targeted to begin by the end of financial year 2023, and Toyota plans to introduce fuel cell commercial vehicles, stationary fuel cell power generators and other equipment in succession,&#8221; according to a Woven Planet spokesperson.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENEOS will also be expected to produce hydrogen derived from renewables, to help install stationary fuel cell generators inside Woven City and to work with Toyota to research hydrogen supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We believe that hydrogen energy will play an integral role in the realization of carbon neutrality on a global scale,” Katsuyuki Ota, president of ENEOS said in a statement. “By working together with Toyota to fully explore hydrogen’s potential, we believe we can make a significant contribution to the creation of new hydrogen-based lifestyles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction at the Woven City site in Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture, at the base of Mount Fuji began in February. A month later, the Toyota subsidiary launched Woven Capital, a new venture fund that will invest in technologies that will build the future of safe mobility. Woven Capital&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment is in autonomous delivery company Nuro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More investors are joining the wave to bet on lidar, the remote sensing method that uses laser light to measure distances and has garnered ample interest from automakers in recent times. But it&#8217;s also a technology that has long been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/">scorned by Elon Musk</a> partly due to its once exorbitant costs.</p>
<p>Innovusion, a five-year-old lidar company and a supplier to Chinese electric car upstart Nio, just landed a Series B funding round of $64 million. The new proceeds boost its total investment to over $100 million, not a small amount but the startup is in a race crowded with much bigger players that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, like Velodyne and Luminar.</p>
<p>Temasek, the Singaporean government&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, led Innovusion&#8217;s latest financing round. Other investors included Bertelsmann Asia Investment Fund, Joy Capital, Nio Capital, Eight Roads Ventures, and F-Prime Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovusion runs core development teams out of Sunnyvale, California and Suzhou, an eastern Chinese city near Shanghai that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">robotaxi unicorn Momenta</a> also calls home.</p>
<p>Junwei Bao, Innovusion&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, is not deterred by the industry&#8217;s existing giants. Back at Baidu where Bao oversaw sensors and onboarded computing systems for autonomous driving, he also worked on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/ford-and-baidu-put-150m-behind-lidar-for-self-driving-cars/">the Chinese search engine leader&#8217;s investment in Velodyne</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were designing things more like a college student designing in their labs,&#8221; Bao said of Velodyne.</p>
<p>Lidar was a niche market up until about five years ago, the founder explained, for the technology was mostly used by a small community of amateurs and areas such as military, surveying and mapping. These were relatively small markets in terms of shipping volume and Velodyne filled the demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were not thinking about industrialization, volume manufacturing, or roadmap extensibility. They were a pioneer and we [Baidu] recognized their value&#8230; but we also knew their weakness.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fairness, Silicon Valley-based Velodyne today is a $2.2 billion company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005930/en/Velodyne-Lidar-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Annual-2020-Preliminary-Snapshot#:~:text=Velodyne's%20active%20and%20multi%2Dsegment,%2C%20Leica%20Geosystems%2C%20and%20Motional.">supplying</a> to some of the world&#8217;s largest automakers, including Toyota and Volkswagen. It also pocketed a hefty sum of cash after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/">going public via a SPAC merger</a> last year. Innovusion&#8217;s strategy is to make sensors for automakers that are &#8220;good enough for the next five years,&#8221; according to Bao. The startup chooses &#8220;mature components&#8221; so it can quickly ramp up production to 100,000 units a year.</p>
<p>Its biggest customer at the moment is Nio, a Chinese challenger to Tesla which has backed Innovusion through its corporate venture fund Nio Capital. For mass production of its auto-grade lidar, Innovusion is partnering with Joynext, a smart vehicle arm of the Chinese auto component supplier, Joyson Electronics.</p>
<p>For now, China is the largest market for Innovusion. The startup is scheduled to ship a few thousand units this year, mainly for smart transportation and industrial use. Next year, it has a target to deliver several tens of thousands of units to Nio&#8217;s luxury sedan, ET7, which is said to have a scanning range of up to 500 meters, an ambitious number, and a standard 120-degree field of view.</p>
<p>Similar alliances between carmakers and lidar suppliers have played out in China as the former race to fulfill their &#8220;autonomous driving&#8221; promises with the aid of lidar. Xpeng, a competitor to Nio, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/">rolled out a sedan powered by Livox</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">lidar maker affiliated with DJI</a> that markets its consumer-grade affordability.</p>
<p>Price is similarly important to Innovusion, which sells lidars to automakers for about $1,000 apiece at the volume of 100,000 per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adding a $1,000 upfront cost plus another couple thousand dollars for a car that&#8217;s selling for $30,000 or $50,000 is affordable,&#8221; Bao suggested.</p>
<p>With the fresh capital, Innovusion plans to increase the production volume of its auto-grade lidar and put more R&amp;D efforts into smart cities and vehicles. The company has over 100 employees and plans to expand its headcount to over 200 this year.</p>

Co-founder and chief executive officer Andrea Baronchelli told TechCrunch more than 10,000 companies now use Aspire’s business accounts and that adoption was driven by two main reasons. The first was Aspire’s transition to a multi-product strategy early last year, after focusing on corporate cards and working capital loans. The second reason is the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it harder for companies to open accounts at traditional banks.</p>
<p>“We can go in and say we offer all-in-one financial tools for growing businesses,” he said. “People come in and use one thing first, and then we offer them other things later on, so that’s been a huge success for us.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2018, Aspire has raised about $41.5 million in funding so far, including a Series A announced in July 2019. Its investors include MassMutual Ventures Southeast Asia, Arc Labs and Y Combinator.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aspire raises $32.5M to help SMEs secure fast finance in Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/aspire-seriesa/embed/#?secret=P9ZNCWtHvu" data-secret="P9ZNCWtHvu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Baronchelli said Aspire’s business account users consist of two main segments. The first are “launchers,” or people who are starting their first businesses and need to set up a way to send and receive money. Launchers typically make less than $400,000 a year in revenue and their Aspire account serves as their primary business account. The second segment are companies that make about $500,000 to $2 million a year and already had another bank account, but started using Aspire for its credit line, expense management or foreign exchange tools, and decided to open an account on the platform as well.</p>
<p>The company has customers from across Southeast Asia, and is particularly focused on Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. For example, it launched <a href="https://aspireapp.com/company-incorporation-singapore">Aspire Kickstart</a>, with incorporation services for Singaporean companies, at the start of this year.</p>
<p>Bill Pay, its newest feature, lets business owners forward invoices by email to Aspire’s AI-based digital assistant, which uses optical character recognition and deep learning to pull out payment details, including terms and due dates. Then users get a notification to do a final check before approving and scheduling payments. The feature syncs with accounting systems integrated into Aspire, including Xero and QuickBooks. Baronchelli said Aspire decided to launch Bill Pay after interviewing businesses and finding that many still relied on Excel spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Aspire’s offerings overlap with several other fintech companies in Southeast Asia. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/singapore-based-volopay-raises-2-1-million-seed-round-to-build-a-financial-control-center-for-businesses/">Volopay</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">Wise</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/revolut-lets-customers-switch-to-revolut-bank-in-10-additional-countries/">Revolut</a> offer business accounts, too, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/here-are-the-94-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-2/">Spenmo</a> offers business cards. Aspire plans to differentiate by expanding its stack of multiple products. For example, it is developing tools for accounts receivable, such as invoice automation, and accounts payable, like a dedicated product for payroll management. Baronchelli said Aspire is currently interviewing users to finalize the set of features it will offer.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to close the door that others might come toward a multiple product approach, but if you ask me what our position is now, we are basically the only one that offers an all-in-one product stack,” he added. “So we are a couple years ahead of the competition and have a first-mover advantage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While consumers and businesses continue to use their purchasing power to spin the wheels of the globalized economy, one of the companies that&#8217;s built a technology platform to help that economy operate more smoothly is announcing an investment to double down on growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zencargo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zencargo</a>, which has built a digital platform to enable freight forwarding &#8212; the process by which companies organize and track the movements of items they are making and selling (and the components needed for those items) &#8212; has raised £30 million (about $42 million). Alex Hersham, the CEO who co-founded the company with Richard Fattal (CCO) and Jan Riethmayer, said that London-based Zencargo will be using the funding to open offices in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and the U.S.; to more than double its headcount to 350 from 150 today; and to begin to make moves into trade finance &#8212; a critical lever for facilitating the trading activities that are the bread and butter of Zencargo&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by <a href="https://dplus.partners/">Digital+ Partners</a>, with <a href="https://www.hvcapital.com/">HV Capital</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/logistics-startup-zencargo-raises-20m-to-take-on-the-antiquated-business-of-freight-forwarding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led its previous round</a>, also participating. Zencargo is not disclosing its valuation, but the company &#8212; which provides services both to companies and distributors like Amazon to ship goods to its fulfillment centers, and brands like Vivienne Westwood, Swoon Furniture, and Soho Home &#8212; said that it is on track to make £100 million in revenues this year, and £200 million in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That is against the backdrop of some major world events that have both proven to be challenges as well as opportunities for the startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lfg7upBJLr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/logistics-startup-zencargo-raises-20m-to-take-on-the-antiquated-business-of-freight-forwarding/">Logistics startup Zencargo raises $20M to take on the antiquated business of freight forwarding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Logistics startup Zencargo raises $20M to take on the antiquated business of freight forwarding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/logistics-startup-zencargo-raises-20m-to-take-on-the-antiquated-business-of-freight-forwarding/embed/#?secret=lfg7upBJLr" data-secret="lfg7upBJLr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brexit in the U.K. has created quite a mess for moving goods in and out of the country and into Europe (difficult but ultimately a net positive for Zencargo: it helps facilitate some aspects of that movement for its clients). COVID-19, meanwhile, has impacted economies (again: a difficult impact but also a positive, in that people are spending more money on goods for themselves and less on travel, leading to more demand for shipping those goods around the globe).</p>
<p>The Suez Canal blockage, on the other hand, also continues to loom (not great: Hersham said that Zencargo and others are still dealing with the fallout of those delays, although it&#8217;s highlighted the need for blended approaches when it comes to moving goods, with some items shipped slower by sea, and others faster by air or road). And there is the growing priority of how shipping impacts carbon footprints (an area of opportunity, interestingly: Zencargo can provide more efficient routing, and also services to consider how to carbon offset shipping activities).</p>
<p>The more general challenge that Zencargo is tackling goes hand in hand with our existence as consumers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Many of us do not blink an eye when we go online or to a store to procure something, and we get whatever that happens to be right away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But the simplicity of wanting and subsequently obtaining goods sits on top of a huge, and hugely complex, logistics operation. It might involve components, assembly or growing and processing things, shipping from one place to another, passing through multiple distribution and shipping hubs, customs, retailers and finally delivery to your store, or directly to you &#8212; a logistics chain that, taking all the world&#8217;s goods into account, has been estimated to be <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/how-big-is-the-logistics-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worth up to $12 trillion annually</a>. Freight forwarding is the process by which all of that logistics works as it should, and in itself accounts for hundreds of billions of dollars in spend, and potentially <a href="https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/business-news/report-inventory-inaccuracy-returns-cost-retailers-1-75-trillion-revenue-td-29261/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 trillion in costs</a> when things go awry.</span></p>
<p>Traditionally, a lot of freight forwarding work has been done offline, a messy process involving paper and faxing, prone to mistakes, over- and under-supply based on sales and typically hard to scrutinize because of the lack of centralized information. Companies like Zencargo &#8212; along with others in the same space like Flexport &#8212; have built digitized platforms to manage all of this, tracking items by SKU data, matching shipments with real-time insights into sales and demand, and balancing different kinds of freight options to provide the right items at the right time. (Zencargo works across sea, air and land freight, with sea accounting for about half of all of its traffic, Hersham said.)</p>
<p>Zencargo&#8217;s services arguably will continue to see demand growing in line with the growth of the logistics industry, but the curveballs of the last several years, and in the last 12 months in particular, that have impacted the shipping business lay out an interesting road ahead for the startup in the future.</p>
<p>“The freight industry has struggled to keep pace with innovation. Archaic processes are still in place across the board, resulting in widespread inefficiencies,” said Patrick Beitel, managing director and founding partner at Digital+ Partners, in a statement. “Zencargo’s cutting edge technologies, plus deep industry experience and knowledge, are transforming the supply chain, and that marries up perfectly with Digital + Partners’ mission to back companies with best-in-class technology and exceptional management teams. We are honoured to join them on the next stage of their journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toronto-based Wattpad is officially part of South Korean internet giant Naver as of today, with the official close of the $600 million cash and stock acquisition deal. Under the terms of the acquisition, Wattpad will continue to be headquartered in, and operate from Canada, with co-founder Allen Lau remaining CEO of the social storytelling company and reporting to the CEO of Naver&#8217;s Webtoon, Jun Koo Kim.</p>
<p>I spoke to Lau about what will change, and what won&#8217;t, now that Wattpad is part of Naver and Webtoon. As mentioned, Wattpad will remain headquartered in Toronto — and in fact, the company will be growing its headcount in Canada under its new owners, with significant new hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Wattpad itself, last year was one of our fastest-growing years both in terms of revenue and company size,&#8221; Lau said. &#8220;This year will be even faster; we&#8217;re planning to hire over 100 people, primarily in Toronto and Halifax. So in terms of the number of jobs, and the number of opportunities, this puts us on another level.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the company is remaining in Canada and expanding its local talent pool, while maintaining its focus on delivering socially collaborative fiction, Lau says that the union with Naver and Webtoon is about more than just increasing the rate at which it can grow. The two companies share unique &#8220;synergies,&#8221; he says, that can help each better capitalize on their respective opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naver is one of the world&#8217;s largest internet companies,&#8221; Lau told me. &#8220;But the number one reason that this merger is happening is because of Webtoon. Webtoon is the largest digital publisher in the world, and they have over 76 million monthly users. Combined with our 90 million, that adds up to 166 total monthly users — the reach is enormous. We are now by far the leader in this space, in the storytelling space, in both comics and fiction: by far the largest one in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other way in which the two companies complement each other is around IP. Wattpad has demonstrated its ability to take its user-generated fiction and turn that into successful IP upon which original series and movies are based. The company has both a Books and a Studios publishing division, and has generated hits like Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;The Kissing Booth&#8221; out of the work of the authors on its platform. Increasingly, competing streaming services are looking around for new properties that will resonate with younger audiences in order to win and maintain subscriptions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Storytelling app Wattpad raises $51M at a $398M valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/embed/#?secret=0OtglVukMb" data-secret="0OtglVukMb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Wattpad is the IP factory for user-generated content,&#8221; Lau said. &#8220;And Webtoons also have a lot of amazing IP that are proven to build audience, along with all the data and analytics and insight around those. So the combined library of the top IPs that are blockbusters literally double overnight [with the merger]. And not just the size, but the capability. Because before the acquisition, we had our online fiction, we have both publishing business, and we have TV shows and movies, as well; but with the combination, now we also have comics, we also have animation and potentially other capabilities, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key to Wattpad&#8217;s success with developing IP in partnership with the creators on its platform isn&#8217;t just that it&#8217;s user-generated and crowd-friendly; Wattpad also has unique insight into the data behind what&#8217;s working about successful IP with its fans and readers. The company&#8217;s analytics platform can then provide collaborators in TV and movies with unparalleled, data-backed perspective into what should strike a chord with fans when translated into a new medium, and what might not be so important to include in the adaptation. This is what provides Wattpad with a unique edge when going head-to-head with legacy franchises, including those from Disney and other megawatt brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do we have the fan bases — it&#8217;s data driven,&#8221; Lau said. &#8220;When we adapt from the fiction on our platform to a movie, we can tell the screenwriter, &#8216;Keep chapter one, chapter five and chapter seven, but in seven only the first two paragraphs,&#8217; because that&#8217;s what the 200,000 comments are telling us. That&#8217;s what our machine learning story DNA technology can tell you this is the insight; where are they excited? This is something unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Naver and Webtoon, Wattpad gains the ability to leverage its insight-gathering IP generation in a truly cross-media context, spanning basically every means a fan might choose to engage with a property. For would-be Disney competitors, that&#8217;s likely to be an in-demand value proposition.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Today as we dig deep into <strong>Expensify</strong>, its history and its current ramp toward the public markets after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">reaching $100 million in ARR</a>, a quick note on where we are in the world of exits.</p>
<p>If you are bored of IPOs, consider it a luxury. For years, the unicorn market was all hype and no liquidity. But in the last year or so, the public market has been a welcome and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">lucrative exit path for a host of unicorns</a>. The same excitement that has led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">record venture capital results</a> in the private sector has been at play amongst public investors, boosting the value of many a former unicorn as they left their startup days behind them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">an April pause</a> led to some concern that the IPO market was cooling. News out today details an IPO climate that is warming once again. For Expensify, and other unicorns on the sidelines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">like <strong>Robinhood</strong></a>, it’s good news.</p>
<p>For one company in particular, warm IPO markets could not have come back at a better time. Let’s talk about Expensify.</p>
<h2>A deep dive into Expensify ahead of its IPO</h2>
<p>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec-1/">continuing series</a> of deep dives on the most interesting startup companies continues this week, with the kickoff of our look at Expensify. Unlike some other companies we’ve profiled as part of our EC-1 series, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">like Tonal</a>, perhaps, you’ve probably used Expensify’s software.</p>
<p>So you know the company in question. What you might not have known is just what a wild ride Expensify has been on during its startup life. From the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">introduction to the Expensify series</a>, I present the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most interestingly, this is a story about just not giving a damn about what anyone goddamn thinks, an approach to life and business that led to more than $100 million in annual revenue, and an IPO incoming on what looks to be a very quick timetable. Prodigious revenues, 10 million users and only 130 employees running the whole shebang — that’s a hell of an achievement in only 13 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">first main piece here</a>. The rest will be coming out over the next few weeks. Get hype!</p>
<h2>Startups and venture capital</h2>
<p>We have a lot to get through, so please excuse the following list of bullets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/fair/">This founder raised millions to build Fair, a neobank for immigrants</a> &#8212; The core promise of fintech is that it should apply technology to an ossified, inequitable and often iniquitous financial system. <strong>Fair</strong> wants to do that for immigrants via a neobank. And it’s doing it with alternative capital. Super cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/babel-40-million-funding/">Crypto asset manager Babel raises $40M from Tiger Global, Bertelsmann and others</a> &#8212; By this point in the business cycle, we should not be shocked at $40 million Series A rounds. Especially if <strong>Tiger</strong> is involved. In this case <strong>Babel</strong> is the recipient of the outsized round, with the startup busy at work building “a suite of [crypto] asset management products and services tailored to enterprise clients around the world,” Rita reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/blind-raises-37m-to-double-down-on-workplace-gossip-and-career-advice/">Blind raises $37M to double down on workplace gossip and career advice</a> &#8212; If your friends don’t send you Blinds on what is going on at their workplace, are you really friends? Maybe. But <strong>Blind</strong> has found a big niche with its focus on providing verified-ish gossip on companies you can name. Also journalists love it. As do, Danny reports, investors.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/indy-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-20m-fund-aimed-at-underrepresented-founders/">Indy VC firm Sixty8 Capital launches $20M fund aimed at underrepresented founders</a> &#8212; According to Ron, <strong>Sixty8 Capital</strong> is launching a “new $20 million fund aimed at providing early-stage funding for underrepresented founders” from “smack dab in the middle of the United States.” It’s not alone in raising capital in the Midwest; TechCrunch reported that <strong>M25</strong> recently raised a new fund as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">Snack, a ‘Tinder meets TikTok’ dating app, opens to Gen Z investors</a> &#8212; What is more Gen Z than a <strong>Tinder-TikTok</strong> mobile app tie up? How about <strong>Snack</strong> allowing its young users to invest in its upcoming round? The kids are just fine, it turns out. This is great.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4 lessons I learned about getting into Y Combinator (after 13 applications)</h2>
<p>Can you imagine making 13 attempts at something before attaining a successful outcome?</p>
<p>Alex Circei, CEO and co-founder of Git analytics tool Waydev, applied 13 times to Y Combinator before his team was accepted. Each year, the accelerator admits only about 5% of the startups that seek to join.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competition may be fierce, but it’s not impossible,&#8221; says Circei. &#8220;Jumping through some hoops is not only worth the potential payoff but is ultimately a valuable learning curve for any startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an exclusive exposé for TechCrunch, he shares four key lessons he learned while steering his startup through YC&#8217;s stringent selection process.</p>
<p>The first? &#8220;Put your business value before your personal vanity.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The tech giants</h2>
<p>Tech’s bigger players have been busy today, giving us quite a lot to chew on. <strong>Facebook</strong>, for example, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-instagram-for-kids-state-attorneys-general-letter/">taking fire from state lawyers</a> arguing that its idea of building an <strong>Instagram</strong> for kids is a bad idea. Not that the complaints will stop Facebook from doing whatever it wants, but the level of criticism is notable. Facebook doesn’t have a lot of political goodwill to spend, these days.</p>
<p>Facebook is also following in <strong>Twitter’s</strong> footsteps in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-pop-up-read-before-you-share/">asking users</a> to read articles before they share them. Because the world going digital has not yet stopped humans from being in need of chronic correction.</p>
<p>In order of descending market capitalization, <strong>Spotify</strong> is next on our list. The company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/spotify-adds-timestamped-podcast-sharing-and-other-social-features/">improving its social sharing capabilities</a>, in essence boosting the ability of its users to share podcasts intelligently. As Sarah reports, “Spotify will also now allow users to share a time-stamped link to a podcast, which allows users to tune into a particular moment of the podcast episode.”</p>
<p>Thank everything, and it’s about time. Even if everyone who listens to my show uses Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>Finally, enterprise storage, security and collaboration company <strong>Box</strong> is in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">middle of a very public fight with an activist investor</a>. In short, Box’s growth is slowing. While the company’s leadership is confident that it can restart its growth engine, outside parties want more control. Yoof.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>The fun thing about setting up something new like <a href="https://discord.gg/ScueBBye">our Discord server</a> is that it’s new. The tough thing about setting up something new (like <a href="https://discord.gg/ScueBBye">the Discord server</a>) is that it needs <strong><em>folks like you</em></strong> to come make it great. <a href="https://discord.gg/ScueBBye">Join us!</a> (New this week, a room about fintech and one dedicated to space!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Micromobility startups are following the lead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/the-station-the-biggest-spac-ever-and-reading-the-micromobility-permit-tea-leaves/">EV companies going public</a> via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, a financial instrument that came back en vogue in 2020.</p>
<p>Bird Rides, the California-born micromobility company that now operates in more than 100 cities across the United States, Europe and the Middle East, plans to merge with Dallas-based blank-check company Switchback II Corporation, reports <a class="c-link" href="http://dot.la/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://dot.LA" data-sk="tooltip_parent">dot.LA.</a> Switchback was formed in 2019 and led by former executives at oil and gas driller RSP Permian, Scott McNeill and Jim Mutrie.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird is the second scooter company this year to eschew the traditional IPO path and instead opt for the trendy SPAC tool. In February, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helbiz, a micromobility startup in Europe and the U.S., also became a public company via SPAC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a merger with GreenVision Acquisition Corp. Many micromobility companies saw ridership fall during the pandemic last year, so we might expect to see more go the SPAC route in order have access to capital quickly, without the time or expense of a traditional IPO process. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird has not responded to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of 2020, Bird was valued at $2.85 billion. It has had its struggles, particularly during the pandemic when revenue dropped to $95 million in 2020, a 37% decrease from the previous year, according to the pitch deck viewed by dot.LA. In 2020, Bird <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/bird-lays-off-about-30-of-workforce-amid-covid-19-pandemic/">laid off 406 employees</a>, or about 30% of its workforce, to cut costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impending transaction valued the company at $2.3 billion below its valuation last year, according to the pitch deck. With this merger, Bird will have access to cash, which the company will likely use to pay off its debts and fund its European expansion in a push for profitability. Last month, the company announced intentions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">spend </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 million to double its European operations by expanding to 50 new cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p>The pitch deck reveals a number of other financial and ridership details. For instance, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird expects to achieve profitability by 2023 after trimming this year’s losses to $96 million and next year’s to $28 million. It would also need to make $815 million in revenue in 2023 to be profitable, and the company expects to make $188 million this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The financials included in the slides reveal a company quickly burning through the $1.1 billion of cash it has raised since 2017, with a $226 million adjusted EBITA loss in 2019 and a $183 million loss last year,” writes dot.LA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pitch deck also shows ridership rebounds after the lockdown, with an 81% increase in topline revenue over the past month, but much of that could be attributed to springtime weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird is one of the three cities that recently won a permit to operate in New York City’s pilot e-scooter program in the Bronx</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a win that might be contributing to the company’s future prospects, even as it lost bids for Paris, Chicago and San Francisco. As more cities are creating a favorable regulatory environment for shared micromobility, better hardware continues to emerge and the industry further consolidates, making high growth an achievable possibility for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg first reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac">Bird’s conversations with Credit Suisse</a> to go SPAC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November last year, and according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime?irclickid=VYsws-TynxyLR-8wUx0Mo3kkUkBx-eVV%3AzvEyc0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;utm_term=theverge.com">The Information</a>, Bird has been raising $100 million in convertible debt from its existing investors, debt that could be converted into stock, but the company hasn’t confirmed the deal yet. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LiveWire, Harley-Davidson’s electric motorcycle, is being spun out as a standalone brand, complete with a new logo and brand identity.</p>
<p>Harley-Davidson first unveiled the LiveWire electric motorcycle in 2018 with a listing price of $29,799, placing it on the higher end for motorcycles. It went into production the following year, with some bumps, including a brief halt to production due to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/18/harley-davidson-has-resumed-production-of-the-livewire/">charging-related problem</a> on one of the motorcycles. The “first LiveWire-branded motorcycle” will launch on July 8. Its public debut will come a day later at the International Motorcycle Show, Harley-Davidson said Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers had trouble selling the bike to younger, newer motorcycle riders, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-harley-davidson-electricbike-focus/harley-struggles-to-fire-up-new-generation-of-riders-with-electric-bike-debut-idUSKBN1WM10N">Reuters reported</a> in 2019. Part of the issue was the price, which is in the same category as a Tesla Model S, dealers told the news wire at the time. Given that Harley-Davidson’s core constituency is still baby boomers, who are beginning to age out of the products, the question is whether a new spin out and rebranding can attract younger (and affluent) riders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two companies will share technological advancements and LiveWire will “benefit from Harley-Davidson&#8217;s engineering expertise, manufacturing footprint, supply chain infrastructure, and global logistics capabilities,” Harley-Davidson said Monday.</p>
<p>LiveWire will have dedicated showroom locations, starting in California, and a “virtual” headquarters with hubs in Silicon Valley and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Harley-Davidson is one of the most recognizable motorcycle makers in the country, but its sales have struggled in recent years. The company’s annual revenue dropped nearly 24% in 2020 compared to the previous year, though some of that is likely due to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The company also cut 700 jobs from its global operations last summer, in a restructuring plan known as “The Rewire.”</p>
<p>More recently, the company debuted a five-year strategic plan dubbed “The Hardwire.” Included in the plan is to further invest in the electric market. The company has already started moving in this direction with the release last November of its Serial 1 Cycle e-bicycles. Its Rush/Cty Speed model can hit speeds of up to 28 mph and comes in at $5,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/may-mobility/">May Mobility</a> is one the most exciting companies to enter the transportation space in the past decade. The autonomous shuttle company has a fleet of autonomous low-speed shuttles spread out between Detroit, Grand Rapids and Providence. Recently, May launched a Lexus-based autonomous shuttle. The company has raised $83.6 million in funding, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/toyota-leads-50-million-investment-in-autonomous-shuttle-startup-may-mobility/">$50 million Series B led by Toyota Motor Corp</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Toyota AI Ventures Founding Managing Director Jim Adler will sit down with May Mobility Chief Product Officer Nina Grooms Lee and May co-founder and CEO Edwin Olson to discuss how that Series B deal came about. We&#8217;ll talk about what made May stand out to Toyota, and vice versa, and how the teams have worked together since.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also talk about what to expect out of the ever-changing and growing mobility industry.</p>
<p>Following the interview, Grooms Lee, Olson and Adler will weigh in on startup pitches from the audience. Yup, that’s right. Our ECL audience will once again have the chance to pitch our seasoned tech professionals. Attendees can virtually “raise their hand” as soon as our virtual doors open and throw their hat in the ring for an opportunity to make a 2-minute elevator pitch. Imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="http://servicenow.com">ServiceNow</a> announced that it was acquiring <a href="http://www.lightstep.com/">Lightstep</a>, an applications performance monitoring startup that has raised more than $70 million, according to Crunchbase data. The companies did not share the acquisition price.</p>
<p>ServiceNow wants to take advantage of Lightstep&#8217;s capabilities to enhance its IT operations offerings. With Lightstep, the company should be able to provide customers with a way to monitor the performance of applications with the goal of detecting problems before they grow into major issues that take down a website or application.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Lightstep, ServiceNow will transform how software solutions are delivered to customers. This will ultimately make it easier for customers to innovate quickly. Now they&#8217;ll be able to build and operate their software faster than ever before and take the new era of work head on with confidence,&#8221; Pablo Stern, SVP &amp; GM for IT Workflow Products at ServiceNow said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ben Sigelman, founder and CEO at Lightstep sees the larger organization being a good landing spot for his company. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always believed that the value of observability should extend across the entire enterprise, providing greater clarity and confidence to every team involved in these modern, digital businesses. By joining ServiceNow, together we will realize that vision for our customers and help transform the world of work in the process [&#8230;], Sigelman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lightstep is part of the application performance monitoring market with companies like Datadog, New Relic and AppDynamics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">which Cisco acquired in 2017</a> the week before it was scheduled to IPO for $3.7 billion. It seems to be an area that is catching the interest of larger enterprise vendors, which are picking off smaller startups in the space.</p>
<p>Last November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/">IBM bought Instana</a>, an APM startup and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/ibm-is-acquiring-turbonomic-valued-at-963m-in-2019/">bought Turbonomic for $2 billion</a> at the end of last month as a complementary technology. Being able to monitor apps and keep them up and running is crucial, not only from a business continuity perspective, but also from a brand loyalty one. Even if the app isn&#8217;t completely down, but is running slowly or generally malfunctioning in some way, it&#8217;s likely to annoy users and could ultimately cause users to jump to a competitor. This type of software gives customers the ability to observe and detect problems before they have an impact on large numbers of users.</p>
<p>Lightstep, which is based in San Jose, California, was founded in 2015. It raised $70 million from investors like Altimeter Capital, Sequoia, Redpoint and Harrison Metal. Customers include GitHub, Spotify and Twilio. The deal is expected to close this quarter.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m the founder of an early-stage, two-year-old fintech startup. We really want to move to San Francisco to be near our lead investor. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I heard International Entrepreneur Parole is back. What is it, and how can I apply?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Joyous in Johannesburg</strong></p>
<p>Dear Joyous,</p>
<p>Today for the first time, <em>international</em> startup founders can sigh a breath of relief because there is new hope for immigration! This hope comes in the form of a little-known pathway to live and work legally in the United States. This pathway is now possible because, effective today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-09609.pdf">withdrew</a> the proposed rule to remove the International Entrepreneur Parole Program. This development is FANTASTIC for startup founders everywhere!</p>
<p>DHS believes that “qualified entrepreneurs who would substantially benefit the United States by growing new businesses and creating jobs for U.S. workers” should be able to benefit from “all viable” immigration options. The <a href="https://nvca.org/pressreleases/implementation-of-international-entrepreneur-rule-by-biden-administration-will-spur-job-creation-and-innovation/">National Venture Capital Association</a> is “thrilled” at the news, and so am I!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) allows founders to request a 30-month immigration status, with the possibility of a 30-month extension as well. Spouses of those with IEP can qualify for work permits. There’s no limit to the variety of fields in which startups can qualify — we’ve had interest from founders in everything from autonomous drone delivery to AI for law enforcement; anticancer drug discovery to satellites.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/international-entrepreneur-rule/international-entrepreneur-parole-video/">qualify</a>, you need to show that:</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If the last 10 years practicing family medicine have taught me anything, it’s that there is a desperate need for innovation in healthcare. I don’t just mean in terms of medical treatments or protocols, but really in every aspect. As a physician, I’ve worked with my fair share of &#8220;the latest and greatest&#8221; innovations both in my outpatient practice and at hospitals.</p>
<p>As I shifted into my current position, I’ve come across some products that were distinguished winners, eventually going on to become not just highly successful but the new gold standard in the industry. Others, unfortunately, never even got off the ground. Often, in the back of my mind, I felt like I could always tell which ones had the staying power to transform healthcare the way it needed to be transformed.</p>

	</p>
<p>When it comes to ensuring the success of your product, service or innovation, following these three golden rules will put you on the right track. It’s no guarantee, but without getting these three things right, you’ve got no shot.</p>
<h2>Design for outcomes first</h2>
<p>Stephen Covey coined the phrase: &#8220;Begin with the end in mind.&#8221; It’s the second of his 7 Habits. But he could have also been writing about habits for health tech innovators. It’s not enough to develop a “new tool” to use in a health setting. Maybe it has a purpose, but does it meaningfully address a need, or solve a problem, in a way that measurably improves outcomes? In other words: Does it have value?</p>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, pharmaceutical and research firms set out upon a global mission to develop safe and effective vaccines, to bring the virus under control and return life around the world to something approaching &#8220;normal&#8221; … and quickly. In less than a year, Pfizer and Moderna crossed the finish line first, bringing novel two-jab mRNA vaccines to market with extraordinary speed and with an outstanding efficacy rate.</p>
<p>Vaccine makers started with an outcome in mind and, in countries with plentiful vaccine access, are delivering on those outcomes. But not all outcomes need be so lofty to be effective. Maybe your innovation aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve patient compliance with at-home treatment plans.</li>
<li>Reduce the burden of documentation on physicians and scribes.</li>
<li>Increase access to quality care among underserved, impoverished or marginalized communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Alertive Healthcare, one of our portfolio companies, wanted to meaningfully improve round-the-clock care for when patients couldn’t get in to see their physicians and developed a platform for clinical-grade remote patient monitoring. Patients download an easy-to-use app that sends intelligent alerts to providers, reducing documentation and decreasing time to treatment. Patients enrolled in the app reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke by 50%. That’s compelling value and an example of designing for outcomes.</p>
<p>When designing for outcomes, it’s also important to know precisely how you’ll measure success. When you can point toward quantifiable metrics, you’re not only giving yourself goals in your product design and development, you’re also establishing the proof points that sell your product into the market. Make them as meaningful and measurable as possible, as soon as possible.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
