					<description><![CDATA[Valuations are up because software company growth will persist longer than most analysts and investors expected, making the present value of software companies' future cash flows larger, even if they had yet to grow into those later projections.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some well-known VC firms have spent the last few months crunching data while working to chart, graph, and map the world of venture investing. Happily for you and I, they&#8217;ve been pretty free with their time and data, helping us better understand today&#8217;s market for high-growth, software startups.</p>
<p>Last week The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021/">dug into data from Battery Ventures</a>, which worked to explain some of the gains software companies have made in recent years in terms of their valuation multiples. The short gist is that multiples expansion &#8212; the repricing of software companies <em>higher</em> for each dollar of revenue they command &#8212; could be explained in part by segmenting the companies into various growth cohorts. Once accomplished, it&#8217;s easy to see that the fastest-growing software startups are enjoying the most price appreciation.</p>
<p>And as one Battery investor explained, growth rates de-risk valuation multiples.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The logic is sound enough. I can doodle on it in a future column if you&#8217;d like. But today, instead of retreading familiar ground, we&#8217;re diving into <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2021/?from=feature">new data from Bessemer</a>, a VC group that should be familiar to Exchange readers thanks to <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">its cloud index</a> that we refer to quite often. Regardless, Bessemer&#8217;s 2021 cloud report is out, and it assists some of the work we did with Battery&#8217;s charts.</p>
<p>What we can do with Bessemer&#8217;s dataset is extend the argument from Battery&#8217;s report: Sure, strong growth rates de-risk multiples, but what the new report indicates is that growth <em>rates</em> themselves amongst cloud companies (modern software, SaaS, call it what you will) should prove more durable than nearly anyone historically expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You can quickly see the synthesis. <em>If</em> growth rates de-risk rising multiples, we can infer some logic to higher-growth companies being valued more richly than their slower-growing peers. But that doesn&#8217;t get us to understanding why multiples <em>themselves</em> might be rising, provided we wanted to find some argument for why they are <em>sane</em>. More durable growth rates, however, provide a possible answer.</p>
<p>Why? The longer a company can keep up its growth rate from year to year, the larger it will be in the future. Modern software companies do have a history of growth-rate-retardation over time, but nearly never <em>negative</em> growth rates.</p>
<p>More durable growth today implies more cash generation in the future. Up go valuations, and, for the fastest-growing today, the bump in worth comes with the valuation downside protection inherent in quick growth.</p>
<p>Got all that? If not, don&#8217;t worry — I have charts. Let&#8217;s keep going.</p>
<h2>A theory for why software valuations aren&#8217;t irrational (maybe)</h2>
<p>The key reason that startup and public-company software valuations are so high is because investors are willing to pay those prices. Hungry for yield on their capital, buying growth via software has been a trade for some time. It was even accelerated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">last summer</a> as the pandemic gripped the global economy.</p>
<p>Suddenly software was not just a possible place to bet on growth, it was also a durable place to stash cash, because without software the world would stop. And that couldn&#8217;t happen, so most folks kept paying their software bills.</p>
<p>You might think that the valuation gains companies saw as other stocks fell out of favor would fade. After all, if they got a bump and the bump faded, surely they would lose some air from their balloon. Kinda? But mostly it appears that software valuations have stayed pretty damn aloft. And this brings us to the future.</p>
<p>Check out the following chart, via the Bessemer report (and shared with permission), that I will explain immediately afterwards:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/mary-donofrio/">Bessemer partner Mary D&#8217;Onofrio</a>, one of the report&#8217;s lead authors and part of the growth team, told us that the x-axis is a public software company&#8217;s last-year&#8217;s growth rate, while the y-axis is what it is managing in the current year. And that 0.8x? That&#8217;s the correlation.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los-Angeles based startup Canoo revealed its newest — and now third — electric vehicle, a pickup truck that does away with the sharp corners and huge engine housing of both comparable EV trucks and legacy diesel pickups and is aimed at both commercial customers and weekend warrior-minded consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck, which Canoo says is the most space efficient on the market, was leaked Wednesday evening in advance of an official reveal set for Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three Canoo vehicles all share a design language. But the important part, and the cornerstone of Canoo, is the foundation. Canoo uses the same platform architecture on all of its vehicles, only altering the cabins, or top hats, with each new model. Canoo’s proprietary platform is like a thin, flat skateboard that houses the critical components of the EV powertrain. The company said this type of design gives its truck a similar flatbed size as a best-selling traditional pickup.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck will open for preorders in the second quarter of 2021, with deliveries set to begin as early as 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck clocks in at 184 inches in length (in comparison, Tesla’s Cybertruck is 231 inches long and the Rivian R1T is 218 inches). But where Canoo’s model stands out is in its pull-out bed extension, which stretches the truck bed from six feet to a fully enclosed eight feet, and extends the length to a more competitive 213 inches. It also boasts up to 600 horsepower and has a battery range of more than 200 miles. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124145" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124145" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124145 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg" alt="Canoo-PickupTruck" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canoo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Canoo&#8217;s other vehicles, the pickup has all kinds of options to change it. There are dividers for the truck bed, for instance as well as a camper shell that can turn it the vehicle into a van. There&#8217;s even a rooftop tent — at least in its photos — which suggested that Canoo is thinking about an accessories business to go along with its vehicles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_12.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2124148 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_12.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also cargo storage area that has a fold down work table and additional electrical outlets, side tables that can flip down, a hidden step to the truck bed that contains even more storage, and a roof rack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our pickup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and is designed to be exponentially more productive,” Canoo executive chairman Tony Aquila said in a statement. “This truck works for you. We made accessories for people who use trucks – on the job, weekends, adventure. You name it, we did it because it’s your platform and she’s bad to the bone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last December, Canoo went public through a merger agreement with special acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp., with a market valuation of $2.4 billion. It joined a string of EV automakers and charging infrastructure companies that Fisker Inc., Nikola Corp. and Lordstown Motors in forgoing a traditional IPO on the road to a NASDAQ listing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter Spaces, the social network&#8217;s Clubhouse rival, is working towards a public launch in April, the company announced in comments made in a public Twitter Space audio room on Wednesday. According to the Space&#8217;s host, Alex aka <a href="https://twitter.com/akkhosh">@akkhosh</a> on Twitter, the company intends to make it possible for anyone to host a Twitter Spaces room of their own sometime in April.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, very soon,&#8221; the Twitter employee noted. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch immediately reached out to Twitter to fact check his statements on Wednesday. Given that, in the context a broader conversation about a beta product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">that just rolled out to testers on Android a week ago</a> &#8212; and for joining Spaces only &#8212; his comments could have been interpreted to mean that Android <em>beta</em> <em>testers</em> would also gain the ability to host their own Spaces by April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That would still be a fairly quick pace of development for a product that only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">launched into public testing</a> late last year.</p>
<p>However, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed that we can take Alex at his word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can absolutely confirm that he meant everyone on Android and iOS, not just beta testers,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch. In other words, the company is making Twitter Spaces available to the public user base in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The speed of development now taking place at Twitter has been notable. In just a few months, Twitter has launched its audio chat room feature to public testing and has quickly iterated on the product to tweak elements like it <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1364647741641527296">titles and descriptions</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1365443249389793282">scheduling options</a>, support for <a href="https://twitter.com/c_at_work/status/1365431726550343680">co-hosts and moderators</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1365836725751148545">guest lists</a>, and more. When forthcoming changes are announced &#8212; like Android support, co-hosts, or scheduling options, for example &#8212; they&#8217;re promised to roll out in a matter of weeks, not months.</p>
<p>A few other ideas were also discussed during yesterday&#8217;s Twitter Spaces session. The company said it&#8217;s considering support for using music in Spaces and thinking about better ways of integrating tweets.</p>
<p>For the former, the goal would be to offer Spaces&#8217; hosts some sort of welcoming music they could play for their listeners. The company has also discussed the idea of offering users the way to tweet inside the Space directly, where tweets would not be displayed on your public timeline. There are various ways this could be accomplished &#8212; for example, by offering an ephemeral, fleeting chat room inside the Space, similar to Twitter&#8217;s older live video app Periscope, or by offering a dedicated timeline just for the Space itself, which could be more complex to build.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some concerns with rushing a product like Twitter Spaces to launch. In Spaces&#8217; competitor, Clubhouse, users are still regularly reporting dealing with verbal abuse and bad actors who are looking to take advantage of the platform as a place to hustle or scam people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less clear to what extent Twitter Spaces has been impacted by similar issues, as its product is still non-public. But one Twitter Spaces user who joined during yesterday&#8217;s session talked about how their recent Twitter Space was hijacked by a fan group who attempted to take over the discussion. While these particular hijackers would be placated by having the ability to run their own Spaces session, it&#8217;s easy to imagine how a coordinated effort to derail a Twitter Space could still be a problem in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Twitter, in the early days of Spaces, had spoken publicly about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">it would first ensure that</a> &#8220;women and those from marginalized backgrounds&#8221; &#8212; a group of people who &#8220;are disproportionately impacted by abuse and harm on the platform,&#8221; a product designer had said &#8212; would be the first testers of the product to ensure it&#8217;s built with safety in mind. But in the weeks that have followed, there has not been as much said about Twitter Space&#8217;s anti-abuse measures or policies, as the team&#8217;s focus has been directed more on the product itself, and its various bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Even when taking the <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/twitter-analyst-day/default.aspx">time to speak to analysts</a> and investors or sit down for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder">interviews</a>, Twitter execs and product leaders have tended to gloss over <em>why</em> it keeps building new tools &#8212; like its Stories feature Fleets and now, Spaces &#8212; to encourage conversations from those who are too afraid to tweet.</p>
<p>The fact is that many are afraid because Twitter has not yet successfully made its platform a place where users aren&#8217;t trolled, abused, or attacked &#8212; for sometimes even the most benign statements or missteps.</p>
<p>One feature that could potentially help protect users by holding abusers accountable is recording Spaces.  Twitter earlier said it aims to build in a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321158/twitter-spaces-record-conversation-kayvon-beykpour">natively record Spaces conversations</a>. When on the record, fewer people may be willing to speak abusively, perhaps. That could encourage more thoughtful conversations but could still potentially scare other users off from trying the product.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the jury is still out on Twitter Spaces and Clubhouse&#8217;s long-term potential. There&#8217;s a question as to whether some of these platforms will see dwindling usage when the world re-opens as the pandemic ends and the conference and networking circuits heat back up. In that light, Twitter Spaces may end up having more long-term staying power as it&#8217;s connected to Twitter&#8217;s broader product and p<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">lans to make its platform a place for creators to organize</a>, and eventually monetize their fan bases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the deluge of climate focused companies flooding public markets, it&#8217;s getting hard to keep track of who&#8217;s doing what, where they&#8217;re traded and how they&#8217;re performing. That&#8217;s why the folks at <a href="https://www.energyimpactpartners.com/">Energy Impact Partners</a> have <a href="https://eipclimateindex.com/?page_id=6">set up an index tracking tech companies that are focused on sustainability, energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p>
<p>For the past few months the firm, whose investors include some of the largest energy consumers and utilities in the world, has been working on setting up the index of representative climate tech offerings that are available on public markets and discovered one thing &#8212; these companies are crushing returns compared to the overall market.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2020, EIP Climate Index has outperformed NASDAQ by approximately 2.8 times &#8212; it&#8217;s up 127% compared to 45% for the NASDAQ. Of the companies on the list, about 20 out of the 27 companies are new offerings that have been public less than a year and have outperformed NASDAQ during that period. About16 of them are up over 100% during that time. That&#8217;s true even with the overall index down about 20 percent from its January peaks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The index isn&#8217;t actually available for public investment, it&#8217;s an educational tool more than anything else, but it does show the breadth of companies working on climate-related solutions and reveals the overwhelming appetite of public market investors to back these companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s been a really incredibly positive run in the climate tech run in the public markets and not just from SPACs,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaylekann/">Shayle Kann</a>, a partner at Energy Impact Partners. &#8220;Part of our motivation for creating this climate tech index let’s see if we can put together as diverse a group of companies as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Included in the EIP index are companies like Beyond Meat, which is a sustainability darling, and businesses that are a bit longer in the tooth like hydrogen fuel cell companies Ballard Power and Bloom Energy. The companies run the gamut from electric storage to renewable energy production, to vehicle charging and infrastructure to alternative protein providers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea was, how was the sector, if you include all this stuff, performing as a whole. We created this index and tried to be inclusive. It has been dramatically outperforming the market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the EIP list is intended to be informative, there&#8217;s no reason someone couldn&#8217;t take this index and turn it into an exchange traded fund for the industry. Most of the ETFs that are currently on the market are focused narrowly on energy production, or infrastructure, this index is potentially the first to track the broadly diversified world of companies focused on mitigating the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>
<p>There are even additive manufacturers in the mix like Desktop Metal, which Kann said had a huge climate component to its technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Additive manufacturing has a fairly strong climate case in reduced waste, reduced transportation, electrification of the manufacturing process,&#8221; Kann said. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a signal that early stage private investors can take note of too, said Kann.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It provides a broader pathway to public markets. The companies that see their share prices run up here. What it suggests for us and for everybody else in this venture capital world is the exit pathways are improved when this index does well,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we&#8217;ve made our way through this pandemic, it has forced businesses to rethink and accelerate trends. One such trend is the movement to no-code tools to allow line-of-business users to create apps and workflows without engineering help. To help answer that demand, ServiceNow released a couple of new tools today as part of their latest release.</p>
<p>Dave Wright, the chief innovation officer at <a href="http://servicenow.com">ServiceNow</a>, says that COVID has forced more teams to work in a distributed fashion, and that has in turn has advanced the idea of putting software building into the hands of every employee.</p>
<p>&#8220;So because people haven&#8217;t had the same support networks and are distributed, you need to be able to produce software that has a consumer grade feel to it. And if you could get that in place, then you can get people to use the system. If you get people to use the system, then you start to get better employee productivity and employee engagement,&#8221; Wright explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This has typically revolved around the three main areas of focus on the ServiceNow platform &#8212; customer service, IT and HR &#8212; but in order to step outside those three categories, the company has decided to develop a new area called Creator Workflows, which are designed to help workers build new workflows suited to their needs.<br />
	<div class="article-block block--callout block--right" >
		<h4 class="block--callout__title">Low code/no code is hot</h4>
		
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/whats-ahead-for-no-code-and-low-code-startups/">What&#8217;s ahead for no code startups</a></li>
<li><a>Tracking growth of no code/low code startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/how-one-vc-firm-wound-up-with-no-code-startups-as-part-of-its-investing-thesis/">VC firm makes no code startups part of core investing thesis</a></li>
</ul>
	</div>
	<br />
The company has come up with a couple of new tools to help these Creators: AppEngine Studio and AppEngine Templates, which work together to help these folks build these no-code workflows wherever they work across an organization.</p>
<p>AppEngine studio provides the main development environment where users can drag and drop the components they need to build workflows that make sense for them. The templates take that ease of use a step further by providing a framework for some common tasks.</p>
<p>The new release also incorporates a couple of recent acquisitions: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/servicenow-acquires-loom-systems-to-expand-aiops-coverage/">Loom Systems</a> and <a href="https://blogs.servicenow.com/2019/servicenow-acquires-attivio-cognitive-search-platform.html">Attivio</a>. The company has taken the latter and repurposed it to be a platform-wide search tool called AI Search.</p>
<p>&#8220;It allows you to deliver contextualized consumer grade results. So it means that we can personalize the results that you get from a search back to you so that it&#8217;s more relevant to you and more focused on giving you that context that you really need to make sure you get actionable information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another company that they purchased was Loom Systems, which gave the company an AIOps component and the ability to inject that AI across the platform. Gab Menachem, who was CEO and co-founder at Loom prior to the acquisition, says the process of becoming part of ServiceNow has been smooth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vendors in this space find themselves kind of giving customers a science project. In ServiceNow the whole focus of this year has been to incorporate [Loom] into the workflow and make work flow naturally, so that employee productivity would be boosted, and the engagement will be high. And that&#8217;s what we focus on, and I think it was a really easy transition into a big company because it just made all of our customers a lot happier,&#8221; Menachem said.</p>
<p>This new tooling is available starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">went public yesterday</a> after seeing tremendous growth in 2020, and that&#8217;s not just good news for the company&#8217;s employees and investors — there are also startups like <a href="https://gamefam.com/">Gamefam</a> hoping to take advantage of the platform&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>Roblox has a whole ecosystem of millions of developers and creators building on its game platform, and some are banding together to create their own teams and studios. (We profiled several of those teams earlier this year in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/how-robloxs-creator-accelerator-helps-the-gaming-giant-build-new-platform-opportunities/">an article about the company&#8217;s creator accelerator</a>.) But Gamefam founder and CEO Joe Ferencz said his startup is &#8220;the first and only fully-dedicated, professional game publishing company on Roblox.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Gamefan currently has 37 full-time employees and eight live games, including <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/54865335/Ultimate-Driving-Westover-Islands">Ultimate Driving</a> and <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5652023420/NEW-MAP-Hot-Wheels-Open-World">Hot Wheels Open World</a>, and Ferencz said there are another 10 in development. Collectively, those games are seeing 48 million monthly visitors and generating six figures in monthly revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ferencz described the team as &#8220;gaming industry professionals working hand-in-hand with the top up-and-coming Roblox creators.&#8221; For example, Ultimate Driving creator TwentyTwoPilots also serves as Gamefam&#8217;s creative director.</p>
<p>Ferencz himself has worked as a manager Ubisoft and Mattel, where he worked on franchises including Hot Wheels, and where he recalled seeing the emergence free-to-play mobile gaming: &#8220;I said to myself, &#8216;The next time there’s this big platform shift, I want to be a part of this.'&#8221; The rise of Roblox and user-created games provided him with that opportunity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124126" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124126" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2124126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?w=680" alt="Joe Ferencz" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gamefam</p></div></p>
<p>At the same time, Ferencz said he was excited about the opportunities that Roblox provides to escape from the &#8220;orthodoxies&#8221; of free-to-play gaming, where the economics often drive game design decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roblox truly is the metaverse for this younger generation,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;What they are finding here is something that transcends gaming, it&#8217;s human co-experience. What that means is that each game needs to have a very distinctive and attractive immersion to it in way that mobile free-to-play doesn’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, part of Roblox&#8217;s appeal is the fact that individual creators don&#8217;t need to work with large teams or publishers, but Ferencz said, &#8220;Superstar developers and creators are thinking about bigger and bigger games, the sophistication is really evolving at a rapid pace.&#8221; That, in turn, means bigger teams, and &#8220;when you have bigger teams, you have more process, you need to know how to structure high-performing teams and drive positive teamwork between people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the business gets bigger, you need people focused on the business opportunities, dedicated marketing functions, a dedicated live operations team,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That’s what we offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferencz and Gamefan&#8217;s business team have been involved in the Roblox platform for several years now, but he admitted, &#8220;Although we get it, we don&#8217;t get it exactly the way people who have been playing on it since they were 10 and developing for it since 15 get it &#8230; We respect that and lean into that.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qxwi2l4fiMw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>So one of the key elements to the Gamefam approach, he said, is to make sure the creators are driving the game development process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that there needs to be a visionary or a team of visionaries on each project, and that they need to decide what is right,&#8221; Ferencz said. &#8220;There will then be a team around them that is part of a consensus process, that the visionaries are responsible for bringing along for a ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as he thinks about Gamefam&#8217;s future, Ferencz said the company could eventually publish games on other platforms. Don&#8217;t expect it to happen anytime soon, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus is UGC gaming, and Roblox is the only place that matters in UGC gaming today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We plan to build a huge brand and media business hand-in-hand with the Roblox platform. In the long term, if other platforms become relevant, then course we will be looking to evaluate and expand on those platforms —but the truth is, right now we couldn’t be more all about Roblox.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> has raised a $40 million Series B funding round — Addition is leading the round. The company has been building an open source library for natural language processing (NLP) technologies. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">Transformers</a> library on GitHub — it has 42,000 stars and 10,000 forks.</p>
<p>Existing investors Lux Capital, A.Capital and Betaworks also participated in today’s funding round. Other investors include Dev Ittycheria, Olivier Pomel, Alex Wang, Aghi Marietti, Florian Douetteau, Richard Socher, Paul St. John, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman.</p>
<p>With Transformers, you can leverage popular NLP models, such as BERT, GPT, XLNet, T5 or DistilBERT and use those models to manipulate text in one way or another. For instance, you can classify text, extract information, automatically answer questions, summarize text, generate text, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are many different use cases for NLP. A popular one has been support chatbot. For instance, challenger bank <a href="https://monzo.com">Monzo</a> has been using Hugging Face behind the scenes to answer questions from its customers. Overall, around 5,000 companies are using Hugging Face in one way or another, including Microsoft with its search engine Bing.</p>
<p>When it comes to business model, the startup has recently <a href="https://huggingface.co/pricing">launched</a> a way to get prioritized support, manage private models and host the inference API for you. Clients include Bloomberg, Typeform and Grammarly.</p>
<p>With the new funding round, the company plans to triple its headcount in New York and Paris — there will be remote positions too. Interestingly, the company is also sharing some details about its bank account.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has been cash-flow positive in January and February 2021. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/hugging-face-raises-15-million-to-build-the-definitive-natural-language-processing-library/">a $15 million round</a> a little over a year ago — 90% of the previous round is still available on the bank account. And the company’s valuation saw a fivefold increase. This shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise as you can negotiate better terms if you don&#8217;t actually need to raise.</p>
<p>And it looks like Hugging Face is on the right path as the company is hosting a vibrant community of NLP developers. You can browse <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets">datasets</a>, take advantage of them and contribute as Hugging Face is becoming the central brick of NLP enthusiasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-08/taiwan-has-enough-water-to-keep-chipmakers-humming-till-may">A weekend statement from the Taiwanese government</a> over its ability to provide water to the nation&#8217;s chip manufacturers in the face of an unprecedented drought make it clear that climate change is a direct threat to the foundations of the tech industry.</p>
<p>As reported by Bloomberg, Taiwanese president <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tsaiingwen/posts/10157345136286065">Tsai Ing-wen took to Facebook on Sunday</a> to post about the nation&#8217;s capacity to provide water to its citizens and businesses in the face of the worst drought the nation has faced in 56 years.</p>
<p>The nation said that it would have sufficient water reserves to ensure manufacturing of semiconductors by companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wouldn&#8217;t stop.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These chips sit at the foundation of the tech industry and any disruption in production could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. Already, supply constraints have caused stoppages at automakers like General Motors and Volkswagen, and chip manufacturing facilities are running close to capacity.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has emphasized the need for the U.S. to strengthen its semiconductor manufacturing supply when it<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html"> issued an executive order last month</a> to address ongoing chip shortages that have idled manufacturing plants around the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taiwan’s water shortage and its effect on semis is a wake up call for every technology investor, every founder and the entire venture ecosystem. It is complexity theory made manifest and only serves to show that scalable, data-driven solutions rapidly deployed across large industrial markets are our only hope in correcting the course,&#8221; wrote Vaughn Blake, a partner at the energy-focused investment firm Blue Bear Capital.</p>
<p>Taiwan&#8217;s water woes and their ability to severely impact the semiconductor industry aren&#8217;t new. They were even flagged<a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-cos-water-woes/"> in a 2016 Harvard Business School case study analysis</a>. And TSMC is already working to address its water consumption.</p>
<p>By 2016, TSMC had already worked to improve its water purification and recycling efforts — necessary for an industry that consumes between 2-9 million gallons of water per day. (Intel alone used 9 billion gallons of water in 2015). At least some of TSMC&#8217;s fabrication facilities have managed to achieve recycling rates of 90% on industrial wastewater, according to the Harvard case study.</p>
<p>But as Moore&#8217;s Law drives down the size and increases the demand for even more precision and fewer impurities in the manufacturing process, water use at fabs is going up. Next generation chips may be consuming as much as 1.5 times more water, which means better recycling is needed to compensate.</p>
<p>For startups, we need to be looking at ways to lower the cost and improve the performance of wastewater recycling and desalination, both increasingly energy-intensive propositions.</p>
<p>Some companies are doing just that. These are businesses like <a href="https://blueboson.eu">Blue Boson</a> out of the UK, which purports to have developed a quantum-based water treatment technology. Its claims sound more like science fiction, but its website touts some of the best research universities in the world. <a href="https://www.fido.tech">Fido</a>, a leak detection company also out of the UK tracks potential spots where water is wasted, and both <a href="http://pontictech.com">Pontic Technology</a> and Micronic are American companies developing water and fluid sterilization systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.numixmaterials.com/technology">Numix</a>, another purification startup, seems designed to remove the heavy metals that are part and parcel of industrial manufacturing. And Divining Labs out of Los Angeles is using artificial intelligence to better predict and manage stormwater runoff to collect more resources for water use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upton Sinclair said, &#8216;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on him not understanding it,'&#8221; Blake of Blue Bear Capital wrote. &#8220;Well, to all the founders and investors out there, it looks like all tech is climate tech for the foreseeable future, lest there be no tech at all.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s government has reached an agreement with trade unions and business associations over labor reforms that will see delivery platform couriers recognized as employees, it <a href="https://prensa.mites.gob.es/WebPrensa/noticias/laboral/detalle/3958">said today</a>.</p>
<p>Once such a law is passed, the development could have major ramifications for platforms operating in the market &#8212; which include the likes of Deliveroo, Glovo and UberEats, to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ministry of Labor and Social Economy, the trade union organizations CCOO and UGT and the business organizations CEOE and CEPYME have reached an agreement to establish the employment status of workers dedicated to the delivery or distribution of any consumer product or merchandise through platforms digital,&#8221; the ministry said in a <a href="https://prensa.mites.gob.es/WebPrensa/noticias/laboral/detalle/3958">statement</a> (which we&#8217;ve translated from Spanish)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The agreement recognizes the presumption of employment of workers who provide services through digital delivery platforms, in line with the Supreme Court ruling,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The presumption of employment is recognized for workers who provide paid distribution services through companies that manage this work through algorithmic management of the service or working conditions, through a digital platform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agreement on the reform means the government can now start to move forward with the legislative process after many months negotiating on exactly how to change labor laws.</p>
<p>The timing looks especially interesting as the European Union is also considering how to improve conditions for gig workers more broadly &#8212; so Spain&#8217;s plan to legislate, ahead of other EU countries, to recognize a subset of gig workers as employees could be influential in shaping wider regional policy.</p>
<p>Wider reforms in Spain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/spains-ten-year-plan-to-put-startups-in-the-economic-driving-seat/">aimed at supporting growth of digital business </a>also come with a strong social inclusion component, with the government saying no one should be left behind in a drive to modernize.</p>

<p>The labor reform agreement follows a number of legal challenges in Spain in recent years over the classification of delivery riders. There have been varying outcomes in the courts but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">last year</a> Spain&#8217;s Supreme Court ruled against homegrown delivery platform, Glovo, in a case relating to the employment classification of a courier &#8212; putting a stamp of finality on the matter as it also declined to refer questions to Europe&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>Delivery platforms in the market have suggested the impact of the planned reform could result in thousands of couriers losing their source of income.</p>
<p>Up to 30,000 couriers are reported to provide services on delivery platforms in Spain.</p>
<p>There have also been accusations that platforms are being unfairly singled out as a politically easier target vs other more established industries which also rely on labor provided by &#8216;<em>autónomos</em>&#8216; (self-employed) workers.</p>
<p>However delivery startups have been less vocal about what a legal requirement to put couriers on the payroll would mean for their business model &#8212; or, indeed, their (ongoing) quest for profitability.</p>
<p>Responding to news of Spain&#8217;s labor reform agreement, Mark Tluszcz, CEO at Mangrove Capital Partners &#8212; who has been a long time critic of the gig platform business model &#8212; told TechCrunch: &#8220;We have long taken the view that gig platforms would have to go through significant structural changes driven by individual countries’ laws. Unless gig workers are recognized as employees, we risk creating a subclass of workers that don’t have adequate rights or social coverage. The pandemic has clearly illustrated the need to ensure all workers have protections and it is increasingly difficult for gig platforms to argue otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Workers must see algorithmic workings</h2>
<p>In an interesting additional component to the reform agreement announced today, the government said the incoming legislation will require that workers&#8217; legal representatives are informed of the criteria powering any algorithms or AI systems that are used to manage them and which may affect their working conditions.</p>
<p>Its statement specifies that this includes algorithmic systems that are related to access to employment and for any rating systems that monitor performance or profile workers.</p>
<p>This component looks like it&#8217;s taking inspiration from a number of recent legal challenges in Europe which have focused on ride-hailing platforms&#8217; algorithmic management and drives&#8217; access to data the platforms hold on them.</p>
<p>James Farrer, a former Uber driver who successfully challenged the company&#8217;s employment classification in the UK &#8212; where the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Supreme Court recently held that the challenging drivers are workers</a> &#8212; and who is also involved in the more recent algorithm and data access challenges, has set up a not-for-profit with the aim of establishing a data trust for drivers for the purpose of collective bargaining.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nzFTLIiwo3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">UK Uber drivers are taking the algorithm to court</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;UK Uber drivers are taking the algorithm to court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/embed/#?secret=nzFTLIiwo3" data-secret="nzFTLIiwo3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Spain&#8217;s unions appear to be taking a similar tack by pushing for access to the algorithmic rules that are used to manage couriers as a tool to tackle the power asymmetry between platforms and workers.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Uber sent us this statement in response to the Spanish government&#8217;s announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the past few weeks, thousands of couriers across the country have come together to stand against this proposed regulation that would deprive them from the independence they value most. At Uber, we are fully committed to raising the standard of work and giving independent workers more benefits while preserving flexibility and control. We want to work with all relevant parties across Spain to improve independent work, instead of eliminating it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Deliveroo also sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“This proposal goes against the interests of riders who value flexible work, restaurants who benefit from delivery services and customers who value on-demand delivery. Thousands of riders who took to the streets to protest their desire to remain self-employed have had their voices ignored.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="gmail_default">&#8220;</span>Delivery platforms have put forward constructive proposals to enable riders to work flexibly with additional security and have warned that forced reclassification will lead to less work for riders, will hurt the restaurant sector and will restrict the areas where platforms can operate. Unfortunately these messages have also been overlooked.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="gmail_default">&#8220;</span>Nothing has been finalised and we will continue to argue that the Government should provide riders with flexibility and security, which is what they want. We will continue to engage with the Spanish Government to seek alternative ways forward. We urge the Government to listen to riders and urgently think again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glovo declined to make a statement at this time.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Uber has been lobbying for deregulation for platform workers in Europe ahead of the EU&#8217;s consultation process on improving gig work &#8212; seeing the possibility of a pan-EU framework as an opportunity to reshape regional employment rules to better mesh with modern working patterns. However the move has led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">criticism that it&#8217;s trying to lower EU standards</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud today announced the launch of a new support option for its Premium Support customers that run mission-critical services on its platform. The new service, imaginatively dubbed Mission Critical Services (MCS), brings Google&#8217;s own experience with Site Reliability Engineering to its customers. This is not Google completely taking over the management of these services, though. Instead, the company describes it as a &#8220;consultative offering in which we partner with you on a journey toward readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Google will work with its customers to improve &#8212; or develop &#8212; the architecture of their apps and help them instrument the right monitoring systems and controls, as well as help them set and raise their service-level objectives (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/nobl9-raises-21m-series-b-for-its-slo-management-platform/">key feature</a> in the Site Reliability Engineering philosophy).</p>
<p>Later, Google will also provide ongoing check-ins with its engineers and walk customers through tune-ups architecture reviews. &#8220;Our highest tier of engineers will have deep familiarity with your workloads, allowing us to monitor, prevent, and mitigate impacts quickly, delivering the fastest response in the industry. For example, if you have any issues&#8211;24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week&#8211;we’ll spin up a live war room with our experts within five minutes,&#8221; Google Cloud&#8217;s VP for Customer Experience, John Jester, explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new offering is another example of how Google Cloud is trying to differentiate itself from the rest of the large cloud providers. Its emphasis today is on providing the high-touch service experiences that were long missing from its platform, with a clear emphasis on the needs of large enterprise customers. That&#8217;s what Thomas Kurian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/thomas-kurian-on-his-first-year-as-google-cloud-ceo/">promised to do</a> when he became the organization&#8217;s CEO and he&#8217;s clearly following through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is expanding its monetization options for video creators. For anyone watching videos posted by those creators, that probably means you&#8217;ll see more ads.</p>
<p>Facebook App Monetization Director Yoav Arnstein wrote in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators"> a blog post</a> that creators will now be able to include in-stream ads in videos that are as short as one minute — previously, the minimum was three minutes. Those ads will usually play after 30 seconds of a shorter video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we’re exploring in-stream ad formats that increase engagement through rewards or product interaction — intending to help content creator payouts grow while providing a good viewing experience for people and a way for advertisers to reach relevant audiences,&#8221; Arnstein wrote, adding that the company is &#8220;especially focused on short-form video monetization&#8221; and will be testing a way to include ads that look like stickers to Facebook Stories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/facebook-ad-breaks/">splits the revenue</a> from these ads with the video creators, and it says it&#8217;s also updating the program criteria. To participate, Facebook Pages must  nowhave 600,000 minutes of viewing time across all videos (previously only videos of three minutes or longer had counted) for the last 60 days and five or more active or Live videos.</p>
<p>On the Live side, Arnstein wrote that Facebook is moving its in-stream advertising program out of invite-only mode, allowing creators with 60,000 minutes of Live viewing in the last 60 days to participate. And it will be investing $7 million to encourage the adoption of Stars (a virtual currency that fans can use to support creators) by offering free Stars.</p>
<p>Non-advertising products are also continuing their international rollout. Arnstein wrote that paid online events (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/facebook-paid-online-events/">launched last summer</a>) are available in 20 countries, with plans to expand to 24 more (including Argentina, Hong Kong and Ireland) in the coming weeks, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/facebook-expands-fan-subscriptions/">fan subscriptions</a> are available in more than 25 countries and will be introduced in another 10 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey).</p>

His previous company, Nautilus Labs, which specialized in ocean fleet logistical planning, raised <a href="https://nautiluslabs.com/pr/nautilus-secures-11m-in-funding-led-by-m12-to-build-artificial-intelligence-for-ocean-shipping/">an $11 million Series A back 2019</a>.</p>
<p>After leaving the startup, DiMare says he met up with Chiau at a San Francisco diner, where the pair discussed the challenges and opportunities in mapping the ocean floor. Today Bedrock is announcing that it has raised an $8 million seed round led by Eniac Ventures, Primary Venture Partners, Quiet Capital and R7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company notes that more than 80% of the ocean remains unmapped. And those parts are often at fairly low resolution. As the CEO puts it in a press release tied this morning’s news, “A far greater percentage of the surfaces of the Moon and Mars have been mapped and studied than our own ocean floor has.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmLd1Gn0ZNk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The funding will go toward developing partnerships and building out the company’s robotics and cloud platforms. The team, which currently includes some participants from the recent Shell-sponsored XPrize ocean floor competition, should be expanding, as well.</p>
<p>Among the chief uses for the technology is laying undersea cable. “As of now, it’s done in basically a one-off basis,” says DiMare. “I know that if I need to lay a cable between the United States and China, I’m going to guesstimate the most efficient route and do a survey over that area and hope that it generally returns information that I need to lay a cable. But if I find something, I need to reroute it.”</p>
<p>Off-shore wind farms are a major potential growth category for the company as well. “Right now we’re not working with any oil companies,” says DiMare. “We didn’t know if we were going to have to go down that route. Thankfully, offshore wind has just absolutely exploded. There’s just so much work to be done in the offshore wind space that we can literally just focus on that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there were any doubt about a cryptocurrency boom, we need look no further than at the explosion of growth of certain companies in the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such company is </span><a href="http://www.blockfi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi</span></a>, which<span style="font-weight: 400;"> today announced it has closed on a massive $350 million Series D funding that values it at $3 billion. While this news in and of itself is certainly attention-getting, it’s even more impressive when you consider the startup just raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/blockfi-just-gathered-up-50-million-to-lend-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-holders-who-dont-want-to-cash-out-yet/https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/blockfi-just-gathered-up-50-million-to-lend-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-holders-who-dont-want-to-cash-out-yet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last August at a $450 million valuation. The latest financing brings its total equity raised since inception to about $450 million, with the company raising $100 million across its seed and Series C rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zac Prince &#8212; who comes from a background in consumer lending &#8212;  founded BlockFi with Flori Marquez in 2017. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based startup raised $1.6 million in a seed round of funding that closed in 2018 and was led by ConsenSys Ventures and included participation from SoFi.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince describes BlockFi as a financial services company for crypto market investors that offers a retail and institutional-facing suite of products. On the retail side of its platform, people can use its mobile app to earn a yield on their crypto holdings (6% on Bitcoin, 8.6% on stablecoins), buy and sell crypto and get low-cost loans secured by the value of their crypto portfolio “so they can get liquidity without selling,” he said. Specifically, clients can buy and sell digital assets (from Bitcoin, Ethereum and Link to Litecoin, PaxG and multiple stablecoins) directly on BlockFi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is also a lender and provider of trade execution services to institutions participating in digital asset markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a model that seems to be working in a big way. Since the end of 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi has seen its client base grow from 10,000 to more than 225,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, BlockFi has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">265,000 funded retail clients and over 200 institutional clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s lent over $10 billion to its retail, corporate and institutional clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, BlockFi has also accomplished the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased the number of assets on its platform to $15 billion, compared to $1 billion last March &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a 0% loss rate across its lending portfolio since inception.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bumped its monthly revenue to over $50 million, up from $1.5 million a year prior.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosted its headcount to about 530 people, compared to 100 last March.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In less than six months since we completed our Series C, Bitcoin and other digital assets have assumed a central role in many investors’ portfolios and in broader financial markets,” Prince said. “Our conviction that digital assets are the future of finance has been vindicated by our client base, which grew 10 times year over year in 2020 and has more than doubled since the end of 2020.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investor Bain Capital Ventures, partners of DST Global, Pomp Investments and Tiger Global co-led the Series D, which included participation from a slew of other firms including existing backer Valar Ventures, Breyer Capital, S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">usquehanna Government Products, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump Capital and Paradigm, among many others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi employees who have been employed for more than one year have the opportunity to receive liquidity on a portion of their equity via a secondary tender offer as part of the financing round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi believes that investor enthusiasm for the Series D round reflects both the company’s strong business growth, as well as “broader conviction in cryptocurrencies as an asset class.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Individual investors, institutional asset managers and corporate treasury departments are all exploring avenues to invest in cryptocurrencies,” the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal for BlockFi has always been for it to facilitate cryptocurrencies going mainstream &#8211; and each day provides more evidence that is exactly what is occurring,” said Marquez, who serves as the company’s SVP of operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital Ventures Partner Stefan Cohen agrees. He believes there are currently limited banking services available for crypto holders, which puts BlockFi in an opportune position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin has already eclipsed $1 trillion in market cap and is likely headed higher to fulfill its store of value promise. As wealth accumulates to BTC holders, most will look for ways to earn yield or borrow against their holdings for more traditional asset purchases such as homes, cars and education,” he wrote via email. “BlockFi stands alone as the leader in bringing simple, secure, everyday</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">financial services to cryptocurrency holders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s exponential growth over the past year proves “there was clearly a huge need for BlockFi&#8217;s services,” Cohen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their vision was to build an easy-to-use, trusted platform to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream, and they&#8217;ve truly succeeded,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Cohen said Bain Capital has had a long-term thesis on Bitcoin becoming a store of value and has actively invested in “picks-and-shovels businesses” that enable what is now a $1 trillion-plus market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trusted financial services are a critical pillar of the space, and we view it as a highly strategic component of the market,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup has plans to launch in the second quarter a </span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/__;!!CX2e5RWqcItE!9EVtgnLwn71K2TvXxf4vaOipLnFOWx6bLP_OKEBjZqm6YTNEpW52kOSSFQ4yX7bq0Q$"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will give BlockFi clients the ability to earn Bitcoin cash back on every transaction. It plans to use the new capital to continue growing its product suite, expand into new global markets and for strategic acquisitions. The company also plans to double its headcount by year’s end, according to Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi already has a global presence and retail clients in over 100 countries. Last year, it opened institutional client service offices in London and Singapore.  This year, the startup is looking to add regional support in Europe, APAC and LatAm for its retail clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past week, BlockFi was making headlines for other reasons. The company was the victim </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of an</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-lending-platform-blockfi-attacked-092823993.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “unusual assault”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on March 7 when an attacker spammed the platform with fake sign-ups and abusive language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company acknowledges that it became aware that an unauthorized third party began attempting bulk sign-ups on its platform on March 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not know the origin of the email addresses used for these ‘sign-ups’  but they did not come from us and they were </span>not<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the emails of BlockFi clients,” the company told TechCrunch. “In general, we would characterize the event as vulgar spam&#8217; and the total number of valid emails affected was less than 1,000.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company maintains that no data from BlockFi was accessed and its data was not compromised.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our clients’ funds and data were safeguarded throughout the incident,” the company added. “Since then, our engineering and security teams have taken steps to prevent events like this from happening in the future. In addition, we reached out directly to all of the valid email recipients to apologize for the incident.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Warehouse automation company Nimble Robotics today announced that it has raised a $50 million Series A. Led by DNS Capital and GSR Ventures and featuring Accel and Reinvent Capital, the round will go toward helping the company essentially double its headcount this year.</p>
<p>Founded by former Stanford PhD student Simon Kalouche, the system utilizes deep imitation learning – a popular concept in robotics research that helps systems map and improve through imitation.</p>
<p>“Instead of letting it sit in a lab for five years and creating this robotic application before it’s finally ready to deploy to the real world, we deployed it today,” says Kalouche. “It’s not fully autonomous – it’s autonomous maybe 90, 95% of the time. The other 5-10% is assisted by remote human operators, but it’s reliable on day one, and it’s reliable on day 10,000.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nimble is one in a long list of robotics companies to get a boast from Covid-19. The pandemic has driven both explosive growth in ecommerce and interest in automation, contributing to a significant excitement around the warehouse fulfillment tech. Nimble has also benefited from the rapid deployment of its systems.</p>
<p>“We’re not the first robotic pick, place and pack company that’s out there. We’ve grown really fast and have a lot of robots deployed in production,” Kalouche tells TechCrunch. “A lot of people have robots in the corner of a warehouse. Right now, we have heaps of robots deployed, and we’re growing really quickly. These are robots that are in production and picking tens of thousands of real orders every single day for each of our customers.”</p>
<p>In addition to the large funding round, the company is also adding two impressive names to its Board of Directors: Sequoia Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, Fei-Fei Li and Kitty Hawk/Udacity’s Sebastian Thrun.</p>
<p>“Nimble addresses both reliability and integration concerns,&#8221; Li, who’s also a seed investor, said in a release tied to the news. &#8220;Their robots have been picking reliably in production, at scale for over a year for some of the world’s largest retailers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scott Galloway, the New York University professor, author, and tech entrepreneur, is taking the wraps off a $30 million Series A round for his newest company, <a href="https://www.section4.com/">Section4</a>, a platform for business &#8220;upskilling&#8221; that has now raised $37 million altogether.</p>
<p>The company is premised on the belief that millions of workers need help to stay competitive and employable, yet not all have access to, or interest in, costly graduate school programs. In fact, Section4 thinks more affordable &#8220;sprints&#8221; &#8212; or two- to three-long week courses taught by prominent professors from top schools that can also be mind expanding &#8212; is the way to go.</p>
<p>Whether that thesis proves out remains to be seen, but Section4 &#8212; whose new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from Learn Capital and GSV Ventures &#8212; says early indications are good and that it already has 10,000 alums from dozens of countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with Galloway yesterday about who, specifically, Section4 aims to serve, what percentage of its students is outside the U.S., and how universities feel about their professors participating in a startup that could eat into their own revenue. Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why start this company?</strong></p>
<p>SG: Graduate education was transformative in my life, and I enjoy teaching, and we thought there was an opportunity &#8212; because of the pandemic and changing behaviors &#8212; to start an online ed concept that tried to deliver 50% to 70% of the value of an elite MBA elective at 10% of the cost and 1% of the friction.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is this competition then for shorter executive MBA programs?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I would say not even exec MBAs, because part-time MBAs  get a certification that is still incredibly valuable in the marketplace. And we don&#8217;t offer that. It&#8217;s somewhat competitive [instead] with executive education, the bring-50-people-from-Pfizer-in-for-two-days-and-charge-a-bunch-of-money-and- have-them-eat-lunch-together-on-campus-in-Palo Alto-and-throw-some-professors-at-them-for-some learning. I would argue that we&#8217;re competitive with that. It&#8217;s incredibly expensive, both financially but just trying to gather 40 or 50 executives.</p>
<p>Also, quite frankly, it&#8217;s a little bit exclusionary because a company like Verizon can only send 100 people to Wharton&#8217;s exec ed, and we&#8217;re hoping that we can run thousands of people from these companies through our programs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So these are companies that are your customers, not individuals seeking betterment for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>SG: It&#8217;s both. The funnel is: organically people sign up. And the idea is that the course costs $700, $800 versus $7,000, which is what it costs to take an elective at an elite business school right now. So for example, 120 people have organically, individually signed up on their own who work at Google. Then our expectation is that over time, these companies will approach us and say, &#8216;We would like to buy a certain number of seats or a membership that covers 100 or 1,000 of our employees.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: You say Section4 has already taught 10,000 students; when did you start offering your programming?</strong></p>
<p>SG: In March of last year. Our first course had 300 people; the course I just wrapped up had 1,500, so it scales pretty well.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different about it is our completion rates, which are 70%-plus. The curse of online ed is that completion rates are really low because video doesn&#8217;t capture people or create an intensity, and we try to be a mix of synchronous and asynchronous, so [there is] project work and teams, live streams with the professor, and live one-on-one sessions with a TA. It&#8217;s meant to hold people accountable and engage them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re promising students access to top professors like yourself. How do the schools for which they teach feel about this? They&#8217;re perhaps helping build the brand of the school, but are there also competitive concerns?</strong></p>
<p>SG: For some yes, for some no. Some universities have asked their faculty to take a pause and not engage in any type of relationship like this, but some universities embrace it. Several students who have taken our course have sent us messages saying they are now going to apply to a full-time MBA program because they see the value and they want the certification. So I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s purely complimentary, but it&#8217;s also not purely competitive.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is your economic relationship with these professors?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I&#8217;m not going to disclose the exact economic agreement. What I will say is that we see attracting these superstars and retaining them as key to our value proposition. And so our aim is that this is the greatest compensation per podium hour that they&#8217;re going to receive. If you have a course with 800 people, and they&#8217;re each paying $800, that&#8217;s $640,000. As you can imagine, there is a lot of gross margin capital that can be deployed or can be paid to the professor.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are most of the students gravitating to this platform coming from inside or outside of the tech industry?</strong></p>
<p>SG: Fifty of the Fortune 100 [companies] have people who&#8217;ve taken our class so far, and it&#8217;s all walks. It&#8217;s pharma, it&#8217;s big AG, it&#8217;s big tech, it&#8217;s big oil. I would say we probably overindex in tech because these organizations are generous in terms of giving employees tuition remission, and I think, to a certain extent, my brand is bigger in the tech community and initially, that was kind of the awareness we had.</p>
<p>The other big cohort is middle-market companies, 10- to 500-people companies where a director there either didn&#8217;t have the opportunity or the inclination to go back to business school, but still would like a taste of supply chain from an MIT professor.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of your students are outside the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I think it&#8217;s about 30% international. We have every continent covered.</p>
<p>We also try to reserve at least 10% of our class for scholarships. We have a rigorous scholarship process, where you send us an email saying you can&#8217;t afford it, and you get a scholarship. And a lot of our scholarships go to people internationally, because $800 in Rwanda is real money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With prices ranging from $15 to $50, the strawberries grown by the vertical farming startup <a href="https://www.oishii.com/shop">Oishii</a> aren&#8217;t going to be found in just any grocery store.</p>
<p>Instead, the nearly five year-old startup is taking what its co-founder Hiroki Koga called the Tesla approach and targeting the highest end of the market in a New York City &#8212; a place where culinary decadence is <em>de rigueur. </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First of all our product. It’s almost a completely different cultivar. It has higher levels of sweetness and aroma &#8212; about two to three more times sweetness in our strawberries. People are paying for that extra experience,&#8221; Koga said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The approach is working, with the company sold out of all of its crop for the foreseeable future, Koga said. Oishii (which means &#8220;delicious&#8221; in Japanese) has also managed to convince investors, raising $50 million in financing so that it can expand its take on the vertical farming business.</p>
<p>The market is already fairly crowded with bigger, better financed startups including Bowery Farms (whose facility is steps away from Oishii&#8217;s growing space in Kearny, NJ) and Plenty, so what brought an investment firm backed by some of Japan&#8217;s biggest businesses (<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota Motor Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) from Oishii&#8217;s farm to the negotiating table?</span></p>
<p>To hear Koga tell it, it was the strawberries.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strawberries have been said to be the holy grail of vertical farming. It takes five to ten times longer to do a complete R&amp;D cycle for a strawberry. You need to nail every single growing step,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;I’ve been in this industry for a long time since it emerged in Japan. Cracking the code for strawberries has been my personal dream.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So <a href="https://mirai.sparx.co.jp/en/">SPARX&#8217;s Mirai fund</a>, which includes investments from Toyota, Sumitomo and the asset management firm SPARX, joined investors like the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sony Innovation Fund, PKSHA Technology, Social Starts, and several prominent angel investors to pour $50 million into the company. </span></p>
<p>“<span class="il">Oishii</span> is the farm of the future,” said SPARX Group Co. President and Group CEO Shuhei Abe<b>. </b>“The cultivation and pollination techniques the company has developed set them well apart from the industry, positioning <span class="il">Oishii</span> to quickly revolutionize agriculture as we know it.”</p>

<p>Koga has been thinking about vertical farming for nearly his entire professional career. First exposed to the industry as a young consultant with Deloitte back in the early part of the new millennia, Koga moved to the U.S. to pursue an MBA at Berkeley in 2015. It was just as the vertical farming industry was beginning to take off in the U.S. and Koga found investment firms tapping him to do due diligence on the emerging businesses coming into the market.</p>
<p>From that work, Koga knew the time was ripe to bring a new model to market, so he set about to launch Oishii. A mutual friend introduced him to his co-founder and Oishii&#8217;s chief operating officer, Brendan Sommerville, who was pursuing an MBA at UCLA at the time, and Oishii was born.</p>
<p>The thesis was to bring Japanese quality produce to the U.S. and starting with bespoke strawberries would offer the company a path to profitability on a potentially more accelerated timeframe than its competitors, Koga said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem the industry is facing is the commercial viability of the business model,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;We have to start with a crop that is profitable and when i thought about what could that be, I thought Japanese strawberries are a truly unique product that people will pay a premium for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The two moved East to prove out their thesis because New York represented a branding and culinary capital for the two West Coasters.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We wanted to launch a very strong brand and a very differentiated product we wanted to launch in a place with a very strong culinary culture,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to strawberry literally everything is shipped from California and a little bit from Florida we wanted to prove that we could do this locally and have strong demand in New York.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The city&#8217;s top chefs have been eating up the company&#8217;s &#8220;omakase&#8221; berry since it first cropped up back in 2018.  Dominique Ansel, the Instagram-famous pastry chef who invented the cronut, love them. So do the folks behind the Chef&#8217;s Table at Brooklyn Fare (now in Manhattan) <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2018/1/2/16812710/brooklyn-fare-price-increase-2018">where a full meal with wine will run a couple roughly $1300</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124035" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124035" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2124035" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png 1896w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124035" class="wp-caption-text">Celebrity</p></div></p>
<p>With its new $50 million harvest, Oishii&#8217;s going to expand production to reach more domestic and international markets, Koga said. And the company plans to expand into other cultivars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The omakase berries are the &#8216;Roadsters&#8217;, but we actually have the model s and the model three in the pipeline already,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to make this accessible to everybody.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>That means expanding from the company&#8217;s current facility, which is roughly the size of a few tennis courts, to another location (also in Kearny), which Koga said will be roughly the size of a football field.</p>
<p>Vertical farms pose an interesting opportunity for all sorts of investors, and Koga theorized that there could be alternative financing models for Oishii as the company proves out its technology at scale.</p>
<p>Technologically, Oishii centers its vertical farms around the pollinators that strawberries need to fertilize their plants. That means it&#8217;s basically built around a massive beehive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The entire hive lives inside our farm. We’ve optimized the whole environment not just for strawberries but for the bees,&#8221; Koga said. That means the company could potentially expand its indoor cultivation to other pollinated fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, melons, and grapes, etc. [and] most of the vegetables.. If we apply the bee pollination technology to any of these crops, then it’s a matter can we conquer each of those [other cultivation] steps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Beyond the bees, Oishii is doubling down on automation through the development of proprietary berry picking technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">What we realized quickly is that it’s probably faster if we develop it ourselves,&#8221; Koga said of the company&#8217;s robots. &#8220;We got our prototype of a harvesting robot in a matter of two months. The visual recognition went very quickly [because it was indoors].&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company also operates as a carbon neutral business, according to Koga. The company offsets its energy consumption and plans to be going all renewable at its next growing location. &#8220;It is our intent to keep on growing like that so there&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;re doing [in farming] that&#8217;s worse,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX now has 60 more Starlink satellites in orbit – it launched its latest full complement of the internet broadband spacecraft early this morning from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Just last Thursday, SpaceX launched its last batch of 60, and this past week it also confirmed that it&#8217;s expanding its beta of the Starlink internet service to additional markets around the world, including Germany and New Zealand.</p>
<p>This is the 21st Starlink launch overall, and the sixth this year, with as many as three more launches tentatively planned for later this month, weather and schedule permitting. The simple reason it&#8217;s pursuing such an aggressive launch pace is that the more satellites it adds to its constellation in low-Earth orbit, the more customers it can sign up and serve. Starlink is currently in beta, but it&#8217;s now open to anyone to sign up depending on geography, with SpaceX taking a deposit and offering a rough timeline on projected availability.</p>

<p>So far, Starlink service is open to people in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Germany and New Zealand, but the plan is to achieve &#8220;near global coverage of the populated world&#8221; by the end of this year. Adding satellites to the constellation not only helps expand geographic reach, but also improves network performance. SpaceX says that currently, the beta should provide speeds ranging from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s, with latency falling between 20ms to 40ms, but that both of those metrics should improve over the coming months as more spacecraft join the network, and as SpaceX rolls out additional ground stations.</p>
<p>Already, there are anecdotal reports that Starlink&#8217;s service bests the competition in rural and hard-to-reach areas where ground infrastructure for alternative services like cellular internet, or legacy satellite from geosynchronous spacecraft-based networks have been disappointing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Primary care startup <a href="https://goforward.com">Forward Health</a> is looking to expand its tech-powered, personalized healthcare model across the U.S., and will use a new $225 million Series D raise to help make it happen. The new capital comes from Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, SoftBank, Mark Benioff – and recording artist The Weeknd – among others. I spoke to Forward Health co-founder and CEO Adrian Aoun about his company&#8217;s plans for this fresh capital, and we also chatted briefly about how The Weeknd got involved.</p>
<p>Forward, which currently operates clinics in select U.S. markets including LA, New York, Chicago, SF and Washington, D.C., has a number of distinguishing features, but most notable are likely its tech-first approach that includes a full biometric assessment upon first visit, and its business model, which eschews insurance providers altogether and instead works based on a single flat membership fee.</p>
<p>Aoun and his co-founders created Forward Health with the idea of building a healthcare business that&#8217;s aligned with its customers in terms of incentives, which is why they sidestepped insurance altogether. That&#8217;s led to a focus on customer service and long-term patient relationships and outcomes, which Aoun says are stronger because they&#8217;re not bound by an individual&#8217;s relationship with their employer, for instance, which is often the case when an employer foots the bill for healthcare via company-provided insurance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The average person in the Bay Area is with their employer for about two and a quarter years,&#8221; Aoun told me. &#8220;So your employer is kind of sitting there thinking, if you get the flu, you&#8217;re missing three days of work – I&#8217;m out some money.&#8221; That means they&#8217;ll do things like institute programs to remind employees constantly to get their annual flu vaccine, and do other things to make that happen like provide on-premise shots. But Aoun says they&#8217;re optimizing for short-term outcomes, not long-term health – because that&#8217;s where their incentives tell them to optimize.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123975" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123975" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123975" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123975" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Forward Health</p></div></p>
<p>But when long-term healthcare programs, like lifestyle shifts that can lessen the potential of truly dangerous outcomes like heart disease and cancer, come into play, an employer who expects you to stick around for a few years at most is far less incentivized to want to fund that. Forward Health, which aims to attract subscribers and, for lack of a better term, minimize churn, actually is incentivized to make those long-term outcomes positive for everyone who comes through the door.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of why one focus with this new funding is to debut new doctor-led programs tailored to treating conditions that individual patients might be predisposed to – like heart health, if heart disease runs in your family, or specific types of cancer, if there&#8217;s a history of that, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got our [in-clinic] body scanners, our blood tests, our gene sequencing – we basically collect on the order of about 500 biometric data points,&#8221; Aoun said. &#8220;The idea is you and your doctor then figure out which which kind of programs make sense for you based upon those.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Aoun says he&#8217;s actually at fairly high risk for developing heart disease, so there&#8217;s a Forward program that includes doing a heart risk analysis, blood tests, and regular at-home monitoring of key risk factors like blood pressure and weight. Another program for cancer prevention includes measures designed to help lessen the risk of contracting the top five cancers in terms of prevalence — so Forward created a dermatoscope for that, which is essentially a skin scanner to map out an individual&#8217;s moles and skin features and alert them of any changes.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Forward launches &#8216;Forward At Home&#8217; primary care service to address COVID-19 healthcare crunch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/forward-launches-forward-at-home-primary-care-service-to-address-covid-19-healthcare-crunch/embed/#?secret=Anj6kuHrXi" data-secret="Anj6kuHrXi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This builds on work that Forward began at the outset of COVID-19 — its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/forward-launchesafarward-at-home-primary-care-service-to-address-covid-19-healthcare-crunch/">&#8216;Forward at Home&#8217;</a> program, which includes sending patients home with specialized sensors for remote care. Another specialized program tailored to COVID-19 actually offers monitoring specific to the disease in order to track a patient&#8217;s progress safely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now launching programs for all the top diseases to help you get ahead of them,&#8221; Aoun said. &#8220;And whatever kind of programs you&#8217;re using, you walk away with plans that are tailored to you, again, to counsel you not only on the potential risks for the things like the cancer and heart disease, but also to be proactive, with guidance from diet, to exercise, to stress, and to sleep, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The programs are supported by Forward&#8217;s 24/7 worldwide care support team, which subscribers can access via their mobile app. It&#8217;s also complemented by the check-ins with your physician via the &#8216;Forward at Home&#8217; in-home virtual visits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123976" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123976" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Forward Health</p></div></p>
<p>While Forward is already rolling these out, it has plans to continue to develop new ones, and it&#8217;s also monitoring results in order to understand how they&#8217;re working for users, and will be sharing that data once it has collected a significant sample. I asked Aoun how Forward can scale this kind of personalized care – especially now that the startup plans to open additional locations in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Basically, Aoun said that Forward approached it as an engineering problem. He argues that most solutions in healthcare see the fundamental issue as a labor problem — but trying to scale that, with the salaries that medical professionals command, and the limited availability of skilled talent, makes no sense. Especially because consumers are naturally looking for improvements in their standard of care over time, in the same way they expect improvements in the products they buy or services they use.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on a chain of increasingly specific medical professionals to address individual health risks and needs, Aoun said Forward identified that there&#8217;s a massive amount of overlap in preventative care courses of action. The Forward team focused on breaking the fundamental elements down into what equate roughly to reusable Lego blocks, which can be recombined with relative speed and repeatability to produce a program that&#8217;s nonetheless tailored to an individual&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>Combined with Forward Health&#8217;s longitudinal approach to care, these programs and their recombinant nature should prove a good dataset from which to assess how a direct, client-focused primary care model affects overall health.</p>
<p>And, because I promised, I&#8217;ll leave you with how Aoun says The Weeknd got involved in the Series D.</p>
<p>&#8220;He literally just walked by one of our locations, and walked in and was like, &#8216;This is awesome,&#8217; and then asked a friend, who asked a friend, who asked a friend to get connected,&#8221; he told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three and a half years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/google-debuts-tez-a-mobile-wallet-and-payments-app-for-india/">launching Google Pay in India</a>, the Android-maker is paving the way to tap its users’ transaction data for monetization purposes &#8212; though it plans to give them ample warning, and the option to opt-out.</p>
<p>Google said on Thursday that it will roll out an update to Google Pay next week that will ask users to choose whether they wish to share data with the company.</p>
<p>Currently, Google makes limited use of users’ data based on their behaviour on the app, for instance, to prominently display relevant offerings. But the company has so far not used its users’ transactions data for monetary purposes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That changes starting next week. Users can choose to prevent Google from making any usage of their data, even those that are not transactional, the company said. And by default, users are assumed to be opting-out of sharing their data with Google, the company said.</p>
<p>But for those users who do agree to share data with Google, the company will be using it to make personalized offers. The company asserted that it will not show ads to Pay users and reiterated that it will not sell their data to anyone and the transaction history will not be shared with any other Google product for targeting ads.</p>
<p>Ambarish Kenghe, VP of Product Management at Google, told TechCrunch in an interview that Google is offering this option to users &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; so that they have a better understanding of what data they are sharing with Google.</p>
<p>Users can choose to change their mind at a later date, and they can also choose to delete records of certain transactions. Those who do not agree to share data with Google won&#8217;t lose access to any of Pay app&#8217;s features, the company said.</p>
<p>The move is not a reaction to any regulatory notice from New Delhi, said Kenghe. For what it is worth, plenty of apps in the country tap a user’s transaction history to offer them deals &#8212; and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-backed-app-lenders-use-phone-data-to-hassle-borrowers-11574969095">sometimes go</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/google-cracks-down-on-personal-loan-apps-in-india-following-abuse-and-outcry/">extreme lengths</a>. And unlike Google, very few have been transparent.</p>
<p>“We sincerely hope that people will appreciate the ability to easily see and control how their data is used, and enjoy delightful product experiences irrespective of the choices they make on Google Pay,” <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/03/your-privacy-at-heart-of-google-pay.html">wrote</a> Kenghe in a blog post.</p>
<p>“As India embraces digital payments, we remain committed to bringing the industry along to ensure that we keep raising the bar to deploy state-of-the-art data security and privacy measures and put the users in-charge of how their data is used.”</p>
<p>Google, which competes with Walmart-backed PhonePe and SoftBank-backed Paytm in India, has amassed over 70 million users on its payments app in the country.</p>
<p>But despite the scale, Google Pay doesn&#8217;t make any money for peer-to-peer transactions between users because the underlying railroad &#8212; UPI &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">doesn&#8217;t support a business model</a>.</p>
