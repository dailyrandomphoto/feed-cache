										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another travel startup that found itself scrambling to pivot as the Covid-19 pandemic took off is now announcing a huge round of funding after finding its feet and proving that it can grow, even under adverse circumstances. <a href="https://avantstay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AvantStay</a> &#8212; which has built a platform where it decorates and then lists properties owned by others for people to rent out for vacations or other short-term stays &#8212; has raised $160 million in a Series B round of funding. The company saw revenues grow tenfold in the last two years and its total number of properties to balloon to over 1,000, and now it will use the new funding for expansion, specifically adding more properties to its platform; and to continue developing its technology as it expands into more aspects of the property rentals business.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tarsadia Investments and</span> <span class="s3">3L Capital (which led its Series A) co-led this round, with participation also from previous backers </span>Plus Capital, Bullpen Capital, and Convivialite; new, strategic investors <span class="s3">Capital One,</span> Saluda Grade, Coller, Grerenhawk, Stephen Pagliuca, Fred Tuomi, Jerry Coleman and Jay Mckee; and celebrity investors including Paul George and Shawn Mendes.</p>
<p>AvantStay&#8217;s basic premise is based around kitting out and then handling the rentals for high-end homes as a viable alternative, or even improvement on, the experience that a typical guest might have had in a five-star hotel; and it has harnessed technology in aid of that. The tools that it has built include Voyage, its proprietary operating system to manage properties; a concierge app to help its guests with services before, during and after stays; its front-end booking platform; and a recently launched real estate platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247902" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The concierge service is part of AvantStay&#8217;s strategy of complementing its rentals as many amenities as guests might have in high-end hotels &#8212; and among its tech investment plans, it wants to continue extending the services that can be offered on it. The startup will also continue to evolve the real estate business, where it helps connect vacation property investors with properties, acting as the broker and then the sole agent for renting those homes out. (But to be clear, it does not own properties itself.)</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based AvantStay has been around since 2017 and had only raised $25 million in the last four years. In that context, this funding is significant &#8212; and large for a Series B &#8212; and underscores some of the traction the company has been having, especially at time when vacationing all but grounded to a halt. The company said that in the last two years it added more than 700 homes and 80 new destinations (some in part by way of six acquisitions that it has made in that time), and it grew revenues 10x.</p>
<p>In all, Sean Breuner, AvantStay&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Reuben Doetsch (the CTO), said that 750,000 guests stay in its network of properties, with the average number per homes being seven guests. It&#8217;s currently not profitable, but it actually did tip into profitability during the pandemic, cutting lots of costs and also shifting to longer-term rentals aimed at corporates.</p>
<p class="p3">Airbnb has created and leads the market for private home accommodation &#8212; and it happens to be one of 60 partners that AvantStay has secured for marketing the homes on its platform &#8212; but Breuner believes the opportunity to develop a business distinct from that, aimed specifically at the opportunity with higher-end properties, still has a lot of growth left in it in its own right, in part because there are still a lot of consumers and business travelers that have yet to accept that they could have an experience better than what they have at high-end hotels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers are starting to meet the demand from an experience perspective in rental homes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has always lagged hotels by a wide margin. But the experience now matches the needs and requirements of what a guest is looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Since we led AvantStay’s Series A investment over two years ago, we’ve watched the company not only grow their supply and revenue tenfold, but also navigate one of the worst possible macro shocks that occurred in the hospitality industry,” said Jodi Kessler, a partner at 3L, in a statement. “Their incredible execution and resilience, combined with a massive tailwind in the travel sector for AvantStay’s product makes us excited to double down on and support the team as they continue to build both a world-class hospitality brand for travelers, and a vertically integrated platform through which individuals and institutions can invest in short-term rental properties.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora&#8217;s self-driving trucks are hauling goods for Uber Freight customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pilot was officially announced Wednesday, Aurora&#8217;s self-driving trucks, which always have two vehicle safety operators on board, have been working with Uber Freight for about a year, according to a spokesperson. The news marks a progression from those early tests to a formal commercial pilot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247544" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hauling goods via the Uber Freight platform is notable. The real opportunity, which the companies also plan to do, is integrate Aurora&#8217;s trucking subscription service into Uber Freight. The trucking subscription service called Aurora Horizon can be thought of as an overarching digital and logistics companion to the self-driving system. Under Aurora Horizon are several other products, including a mission control system that integrate with a carrier or network&#8217;s system and app to communicate dispatching and routing, monitor vehicle health, and handle incident response and a roadside assistance program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora plans to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/aurora-shines-spotlight-on-autonomous-truck-tech-strategy-ahead-of-spac-merger/">autonomous trucking business</a> by the end of 2023. If the pilot with Uber Freight succeeds, carriers with subscriptions to Aurora Horizon will be able to access Uber Freight to haul more goods. Aurora&#8217;s pitch is that this will improve efficiency for carriers and ensure trucking capacity isn&#8217;t underutilized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement Wednesday is also a reminder of Aurora and Uber&#8217;s close ties. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Aurora acquired Uber ATG</a>, the company&#8217;s self driving unit, aa year ago. As part of that complex deal, Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. Aurora was privately held at the time, a status that changed in 2021 when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company. Aurora became a publicly traded company in November. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber Freight has been making its own moves. The logistics business, which spun out of Uber in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">acquired Transplace</a> for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital earlier this year. The acquisition is part of Uber Freight&#8217;s aim to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expand into Mexico.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost three million Americans a year are denied a mortgage. Most don&#8217;t even know where to start or understand what’s would qualify them. The system has become complex and confusing, causing people to never make it onto the housing ladder at all. This is in contrast to the mortgage industry, which is leaving these people on the table by being geared only to those who are ready and qualified to buy, a relatively small percentage of those who&#8217;d actually like to.</p>
<p>Fintech startups like NerdWallet, Lower.com, Divvy, and Landis, have appeared in recent years trying to, for instance, make it easier to save for home loans. But there’s clearly plenty of room for more entrants, especially ones that can hand-hold consumers through the complex process.</p>
<p><a href="http://quo.com">Quo</a> is a relatively new startup with what it claims is a fresh approach to homeownership. Its consumer-oriented app shows users where they are today in terms of their financial position and goes through what mortgage qualification criteria they need to hit in order to secure a home loan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s now raised has raised $7.2M in a seed funding round led by <a href="https://signalfire.com/">SignalFire</a>, with participation by Justin Mateen and current investors Soma Capital, Global Founders Capital, and others.</p>
<p>Alongside that, it’s also acquired Uncapped Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage startup based out of Nashville, and re-branded it to QuoHome. QuoHome provides mortgage brokering services for Quo users once they are ready to buy.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new funding will be used to accelerate the growth of the QuoHome coaching app. Quo claims its users have amassed $200M in home buying power and are working towards $1.2Bn in homes, growing at over 100% CMGR.</p>
<p>The Quo product works by connecting to your credit, savings, and income information to build a financial profile. It then compares your information to mortgage underwriting guidelines to assess how much you can afford today and the bar you need to hit across credit, debt, and savings to afford the home you want.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It then finds shortcuts for you to be able to afford a home faster, such as working out what debts you should pay off, versus saving that money for a down payment.</p>
<p>Quo was founded in 2018 by Tucker Haas and Neel Yerneni while they were seniors at Stanford University with the mission to make building wealth more equitable, starting with homeownership.</p>
<p>Haas says he grew up in a household that struggled with home financing for years after they got into economic problems.</p>
<p>“Having grown up in a low-income household, I had firsthand experience with a broken financial system. Quo is our way of driving at the mission of making building wealth more equitable,” he said. “Since launching the Beta in June, our members now manage over $21M in home savings with Quo and are building towards almost half a billion dollars in homes. With our $7.2M in funding led by SignalFire, we’re proving there’s a more aligned and accessible way to approach this industry.”</p>
<p>Josh Constine of Signalfire commented: “I think the big trend here is economic uncertainty spurring a new wave of fintech for savings and homeownership as the middle-class tries to find some stability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest move to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">placate European competition regulators</a>, Google has offered a set of commitments to France&#8217;s antitrust watchdog &#8212; in the hopes of settling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">costly</a> (for it) intervention over legally mandated payments for displaying snippets of news publishers&#8217; content.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">Back in July</a>, France&#8217;s <em>Autorité de la Concurrence </em>slapped the tech giant with a fine of half a billion euros over a series of suspected breaches in how it negotiated with news publishers to remunerate them for reuse of their content.</p>
<p>The backstory here is the European Union agreed a reform of digital copyright rules, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">back in 2019</a>, which (among other changes) extending copyright law to cover snippets of news publishers&#8217; content that were being routinely reused by aggregators like Google News.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247885" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While there was plenty of criticism of the reform at the time, the directive has given the bloc&#8217;s news publishers leverage over Google and does appear to have contributed to the adtech giant&#8217;s decision to abandon its earlier hard line stance &#8212; of saying it would never pay a penny for news content &#8212; in favor of creating its own content licensing product aimed at news publishers.</p>
<p>However that News Showcase product looked like a cynical attempt by Google to more cheaply circumvent legal requirements by using a global news licensing vehicle to bundle compliance with a growing number of national laws on news content remuneration (see also: Australia, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">earlier this year</a> passed a law requiring Google and Facebook engage in mandatory negotiations with publishers over content reuse) &#8212; and grab itself sweeping rights to publishers&#8217; content in the process &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly the sort of &#8216;bad faith&#8217; behavior that Google is being called out for in France.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TjEYsLdk9w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/embed/#?secret=TjEYsLdk9w" data-secret="TjEYsLdk9w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France was one of the first EU Member States to transpose the pan-EU copyright directive into national law, and the <em>Autorité </em>has taken an aggressive approach to enforcing complaints over Google&#8217;s compliance with the new rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, for example, when Google sought to evade application of the law in the country &#8212; by stopping displaying snippets of local publishers&#8217; content unless publishers gave it free authorization to show them &#8212; the watchdog slapped down the practice, finding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">last year</a> that it was likely to be abuse of a dominant market position; and telling Google it could not just unilaterally withdraw the content.</p>
<p>It also ordered Google to negotiate in good faith with publishers to pay for displaying their legally protected content &#8212; giving it three months to do so. After which, following a number of complaints by French publishers, the <em>Autorité</em> stepped in again to investigate Google&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p>And it went on to apply interim measures in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">July</a>, based on its preliminary concerns.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the <em>Autorité</em> believes Google has applied &#8220;unfair and discriminatory settlement conditions&#8221;; and is likely to have sought to circumvent the law on &#8220;related rights&#8221; &#8212; although its investigation continues in parallel with the intervention.</p>
<p>The latest development now is that the <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/google-proposes-commitments-part-investigation-merits-related-rights-case-autorite"><em>Autorité </em>has now published details</a> of a set of commitments Google has offered to try to resolve the investigation. The watchdog is consulting on the proposals &#8212; inviting interested third parties, publishers and news agencies to submit comments before January 31, 2022.</p>
<p>It will then hold a hearing with relevant parties and could choose to close the case &#8212; if it decides Google&#8217;s commitments are acceptable &#8212; at which point it would make them binding on Google.</p>
<p>It could also opt to amend and beef up the commitments. So Google&#8217;s offer is by no means the final word.</p>
<p>Over in the UK, meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority is undertaking a similar procedure in relation to Google&#8217;s planned deprecation of tracking cookies to migrate to alternative ad targeting tech &#8212; with the CMA currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">consulting on commitments Google has offered around its Privacy Sandbox proposal</a> (and in that case if they are accepted Google has said it will apply them globally) &#8212; underlining the growing influence European regulators are having over the future shape of Big Tech.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">an in-train procedure related to Google&#8217;s News Showcase T&amp;Cs</a>. So Google is likely facing more antitrust action on this front in Europe.</p>

<h2>What is Google offering in France?</h2>
<p>The <em>Autorité </em> said Google has proposed the following &#8220;remedies&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google undertakes to &#8220;negotiate in good faith&#8221; with press publishers and news agencies that so request, the remuneration for any reproduction of protected content on its services in accordance with the modalities laid down in Article L.218-4 of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriété intellectuelle) and according to transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria.</li>
<li>Google undertakes to communicate the information necessary for a transparent evaluation of the proposed remuneration, as provided for in Article L.218-4 of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriété intellectuelle).</li>
<li>Google undertakes to make a proposal for remuneration within three months of the start of negotiations;</li>
<li>In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the negotiating parties will have the option of referring the matter to an arbitration tribunal to determine the amount of remuneration. Google undertakes to pay the fees of the arbitrators and the arbitration proceedings in the first instance;</li>
<li>Google undertakes to take the necessary steps to ensure that the negotiations do not affect the indexation, ranking or presentation of protected content;</li>
<li>Google undertakes to take the necessary steps to ensure that the negotiations do not affect any other economic relationship that may exist between Google and the news publishers and news agencies;</li>
<li>An independent trustee approved by the Autorité will ensure the implementation of the commitments made and may, if necessary, call on the services of a technical, financial or intellectual property expert.</li>
<li>The commitments will apply for a period of five years.</li>
</ul>
<p>In its own <a href="https://france.googleblog.com/2021/12/nos-engagements-sur-les-droits-voisins.html">blog post</a> about the proposals (written in French), attributed to Sébastien Missoffe, VP and CEO of Google France<i>, </i>Google points to recent deals it&#8217;s inked with local publishers (such as AFP) &#8212; claiming this sums to &#8220;significant progress&#8221; on reaching an <em>entente cordiale</em> on the news numeration issue, while acknowledging negotiations with other French publishers are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Google condenses what it&#8217;s proposing &#8212; and what it hopes will end the expensive litigation, with Missoffe suggesting the proposals will &#8220;open a new chapter in the area of ​​Neighboring Rights&#8221; &#8212; under the following three subtitles: &#8220;Specific offers on neighboring rights&#8221;; &#8220;Respect for the choices of the publishers&#8221;; and &#8220;More transparency and independent supervision&#8221;.</p>
<p>And we could perhaps further condense that to an offer of &#8216;specific respect, supervised&#8217;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly notable that both the <em>Autorité&#8217;s </em>intervention over news and the CMA&#8217;s investigation of Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox have led to an offer &#8212; by Google &#8212; of an monitoring trustee to verify compliance, underlying how little trust advertisers and publishers have in the tech giant doing the right thing when no one is looking.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">first set of commitments Google offered the CMA</a> did not go far enough to convince the wider market which feeds Google&#8217;s ad coffers that it would play fair &#8212; leading Google to come back with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">enhanced commitments</a> (including the offer of the monitoring trustee and a slight extension to the length of time the commitments would be enforced).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether publishers in France will be content with Google&#8217;s first offer &#8212; or also push for greater assurances that the tech giant will play fair over news remuneration.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, signs off its blog post by claiming its &#8220;objective&#8221; is to &#8220;conclude definitive agreements, in compliance with the law, and to open a new chapter with press editors&#8221;. But the prospect of a $592M fine has doubtless helped concentrate minds in Mountain View vis-a-vis compliance with French law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of these commitments, Google will continue to invest, as we have for years, in products and training to support journalism,&#8221; Missoffe adds in remarks that are of course irrelevant to the specific issue of compliance with French law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Launched in 2006, education startup<a href="https://www.coursehero.com/"> Course Hero</a> started its life away from the attention of venture capital. After launching, the company waited eight years to raise a $15 million Series A. Then, after going another nearly six years without raising venture capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">Course Hero closed two financings in 2020.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coursehero.com/blog/course-hero-series-c-funding/">Yesterday</a>, the edtech company announced yet another tranche of capital: a $380 million Series C at a $3.6 billion valuation. The financing, led by Wellington Management with participation from new investors Sequoia Capital Global Equities, OMERS Growth Equity and D1 Capital Partners, as well as existing investors, brings a 227.3% increase to Course Hero’s valuation in a little over a year. The business has been cash flow positive and profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis for over 5 years, it claims.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247628" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The raise comes as a stark contrast to CEO and co-founder Andrew Grauer&#8217;s comments in 2020, when he spoke on the “risk and reward of raising capital.”</p>
<p>“If you raise too much money early on, you can get misaligned expectations based on different time horizons set up by different terms of incoming shareholders or investors,” he said. Course Hero’s rapid capitalization today thus suggests that Grauer now thinks that the startup has graduated past a point of dealing with unfavorable incentives from its investors.</p>
<p>And to be fair, his new vision for the company makes a good argument for why he needs so much capital in this given moment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2247631 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png" alt="" width="959" height="501" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png 2700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=2048,1070 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founder believes that Course Hero has evolved past its main business model &#8211; a place where students can come to access more than 80 million course-specific study resources and guides &#8211; into a platform play. Going forward, Course Hero will formalize its mass consolidation mindset, as we’ve seen through its acquisitions of Symbolab<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">,</a> LitCharts, CliffsNotes, and QuillBot, as a business strategy.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re working to build a platform that serves the entire learning journey, almost like a productivity suite for learning,” he said. “Each business will continue to build their products and brands, and there&#8217;s an opportunity for us to build an ecosystem to integrate the products into each other that create more value for learners and educators.&#8221; PR speak side, the capital will be used to fuel acquisitions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/03/edtech-2021/">And we know edtech is full of them.</a></p>
<p>Grauer estimates that he can grow Course Hero from gaining 2 million subscribers per year to 50 million subscribers per year by 2030 by serving more than just as a “study platform for students and a resource for educators.” Going forward, students will be able to go to coursehero.com like they traditionally have, but also navigate to its broader product and brand suite.</p>
<p>“The last two years we have seen a bigger shift in advancing pedagogy online and the way that we evaluate and assess student comprehension is evolving as a result,” he told TechCrunch. “All of these changes require better, more affordable and effective resources, tools and services to meet the needs of today’s students and educators.”</p>
<p>The co-founder explained that he plans to use the new capital to acquire businesses operating in new verticals, subject areas, grade levels and countries. &#8220;This definitely includes a focus on technical topics and skills as well as tool-driven product solutions,&#8221; he added. And clearly, there’s still solid room to grow.</p>
<p>Grauer said that Course Hero hasn’t yet to “fully dive into crypto and Web 3” a movement that could definitely use some translation help to the legions of people who haven’t fallen down the rabbit hole just yet. As the company’s total addressable market becomes more broader, and hopefully diverse, Course Hero will need to evolve to support a whole range of learning needs &#8211; not just requests for 24/7 homework help or study guides on the latest lit assignment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the same way that PayPal and Stripe radically changed online payments by allowing any online service to embed payments, the race is on to have the same impact on crypto assets. To this end, players such as <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a> (raised $29.1M) and <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/">MoonPay</a> (raised $555M) have risen to the fore. But in the Summer of this year, a similar, UK-based startup called Ramp (not to be confused with US ‘trad-fi’ startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">Ramp</a>) de-cloaked like a Klingon battleship in space, with a $10.1 million <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/london-based-startup-ramp-raises-7-1m-to-become-the-paypal-for-crypto-20210615">seed round</a>, and even had hard-won approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under its belt.</p>
<p>The company is now clearly on a roll.</p>
<p>Ramp has now raised a $52.7 million Series A round led by Balderton Capital. Existing investors NFX, Galaxy Digital, Seedcamp, Firstminute Capital also participated, alongside angel investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise) and Francesco Simonesci (TrueLayer), and the investment will see Balderton’s General Partner, Rana Yared, join the Ramp board. The startup has now raised a total of $63 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Szymon Sypniewicz (CEO) and Przemek Kowalczyk (CTO, CPO), Ramp has a non-custodial, full-stack payment infrastructure. The idea here is to open up digital assets to more businesses and users by making it possible to send or receive crypto without having to go through an exchange like Coinbase, for instance.</p>
<p>Ramp allows anyone that wants to offer crypto-enabled services to do so via its SDK in a few hours, without the need to set up their own on-ramping stack to an exchange, an extremely time-consuming and potentially costly business.</p>
<p>This is, of course, very advantageous to Ramp, because it forces users to move between Ramp-powered services without having to jump through multiple verification hoops. Faster for the users, but also great for Ramp.</p>
<p>In part because of this ease of use, it’s managed to partner up with more than 400 developers, including Mozilla, Browser, Dapper Labs, and DeFi apps like Aave, Argent, Trust Wallet, and Zerion. It is also the exclusive on-ramping partner for Sorare, the blockchain-based, global sports video game, and Flow, the blockchain which specializes in NFT marketplaces and digital assets.  </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Furthermore, users of the Opera browser can top-up crypto wallets from within the app, or Sorare NFT game players can buy and sell virtual players via Ethereum. In addition, the NFT-based game Axie Infinity used Ramp to shorten its onboarding process from two hours to minutes.</p>
<p>The ultimate vision is to facilitate crypto transactions for banks’ or other financial institutions’ end-users within their banking apps. This would be where TradFi meets DeFi.</p>
<p>Ramp has also recently received regulatory approval from US FinCen &#8211; the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enables the company to operate legally in the US. And in Poland, it has become the first on-ramping company to <a href="https://medium.com/rampnetwork/ramp-got-open-banking-license-60be108a9df2">receive</a> an open banking license from The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) in 2020.</p>
<p>Szymon Sypniewicz, Ramp co-founder and CEO, said: “There is so much potential in unlocking cryptocurrency and digital assets beyond today’s narrow and restrictive use cases. We’re on a mission to provide instant access to cryptocurrencies through a provider they can trust.”  </p>
<p>On its competitive position against Wyre and MoonPay, a spokesperson said Ramp is focusing on transaction transparency and regulatory approval, hence the FCA and FinCen stuff: “While several competitors prefer to embed some of their fees in conversion rates, Ramp prides itself on showing its fees up-front so that consumers know exactly what they are paying for.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An analyst note from JP Morgan has thrown a wrench into the valuations market for technology shares. And while the impact of the missive is being felt most sharply among public companies, its impacts could show up in the valuations of yet-private technology firms as well.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The note changed the bank&#8217;s valuation perspective regarding a number of technology companies. In response to what <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/cloud-stocks-adobe-cloudflare-zscaler-plunge-on-jpmorgan-downgrades.html">CNBC described</a> as a &#8220;wave of downgrades&#8221; from JP Morgan, investors pulled the rug on a few notable tech companies. Here&#8217;s a partial list of the damage from yesterday&#8217;s trading, after the downgrades were made public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zscaler: -7.84%</li>
<li>Datadog: -6.54%</li>
<li>Cloudflare: -8.98%</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You get the picture.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more important is that the note connected rising interest rates to an anticipated decline in the value of various technology shares. To wit: &#8220;With rates climbing, this adds risk to higher multiple software stocks trading over 20 times revenue,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/cloud-stocks-adobe-cloudflare-zscaler-plunge-on-jpmorgan-downgrades.html">per a CNBC quote</a> of the note. (A longer list of upgrades and downgrades from the communiqué can be found <a href="https://247wallst.com/apps-software/2021/12/14/jp-morgan-makes-big-changes-to-software-stock-ratings/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If tech companies valued at more than 20x revenues see their valuations decline as rates rise, it would create a downward compression effect on tech valuations more generally. Put simply: If the tech companies with the richest valuations were dragged closer to a 20x multiple, it would slash the worth of nearly every tech company, period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney+ is the latest streaming app to add support for Apple&#8217;s SharePlay, the iOS 15 feature that offers a co-viewing experience over FaceTime video calls on iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV devices. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/">announced</a> during Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, SharePlay rolled out with the iOS 15.1 update, soon offering co-viewing experiences <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/">across a variety of apps</a>, including NBA, <a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-latest-get-shareplay-update-adds-new-us-page-during-facetime-calls">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-shareplay-iphone-ipad-facetime-192948698.html">Twitch</a>, Paramount+, and Showtime, as well as Apple&#8217;s own apps like Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Fitness, among others.</p>
<p>Disney+, however, has been a long-awaited addition to this lineup, as Apple had announced during WWDC that the streaming service would be among those supporting the new feature.</p>
<p>Today, the companies are making good on that promise with the release of a Disney+ app update that will allow subscribers to use the SharePlay feature on Apple&#8217;s iOS, iPadOS and tvOS devices. Disney says the feature will be compatible globally across the entire Disney+ catalog from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. This includes its new titles like Marvel Studios&#8217; &#8220;Hawkeye,&#8221; &#8220;Welcome to Earth,&#8221; and its upcoming Disney+ premieres, like &#8220;Encanto&#8221; which arrives on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24), and the &#8220;The Book of Boba Fett,&#8221; which becomes available starting on Dec. 29.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Once updated, users will be able to host and attend SharePlay sessions that allow up to 32 people to co-watch Disney+ together. This could make for an easy way for a family who can&#8217;t be together for the holidays to have a Disney movie night, for example, or a way to entertain the kids by having them stream Disney+ with friends back home while out of town for a holiday trip, among other things.</p>
<p>The SharePlay feature itself is relatively easy to use as it&#8217;s built into the FaceTime app. To use the feature, you&#8217;ll first start the FaceTime call, then open the Disney+ app. A notice will appear at the top of the screen alerting you that SharePlay is available. You&#8217;ll tap play on the content you want to watch and begin watching with everyone else on the call. The playback controls are available to everyone else on the SharePlay session, allowing each user to press play, pause, rewind or fast forward.</p>
<p>Disney notes that each participant can choose the audio and subtitles in the language of their choice when streaming on their device. The feature also offers multiple viewing options for viewers, allowing people to watch the streaming content on their Apple TV while still FaceTiming with friends and family on their iPhone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SharePlay has been one of the more interesting features in the iOS 15 release, as it seems like a natural next direction for the FaceTime software in an age where social distancing and remote work have become the norm, and apps like Zoom have crossed into consumer territory. In addition to supporting co-watching, users can also screen share over SharePlay, even launching apps and browsing together &#8212; great for anything from online shopping to offering aging family members remote tech support.</p>
<p>To use SharePlay to stream Disney+, all participants must be running at least iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1, and they&#8217;ll need to be a Disney+ subscriber.</p>
<p>Though Disney is embracing SharePlay, its own in-app co-viewing feature, <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-plus-introduces-group-watch">called GroupWatch</a>, will continue to be available to all subscribers in the same country across compatible devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re very excited to launch SharePlay on Disney+ for Apple users in time for the holidays and ahead of several highly-<br />
anticipated premieres,&#8221; said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of Product &amp; Design, Disney Streaming, in a statement. &#8220;With thousands of movies and shows and a growing content catalog of new titles and originals, SharePlay provides another opportunity for personal friends and family around the world to come together and create new memories with their favorite stories on Disney+,&#8221; he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new app is an extension of The List's e-commerce marketplace, merging content, social networking and live commerce.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gothelist.com/gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The List</a> joins the social commerce movement with a new app connecting consumers with global luxury brands and retailers to offer a personalized discovery and shopping experience.</p>
<p>Focused on sourcing hard-to-find items, the app launch is buoyed by $3.5 million in seed funding backed by a group including American Designer and Rachel Zoe, who is both an investor and advisor to the New York-based company.</p>
<p>The List, with offices in Dubai and Lisbon, was founded in 2016 as an e-commerce marketplace and works with authorized, professional sellers. Its new app is an extension of the marketplace, merging content, social networking and live commerce.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247603" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The foundation of our business is to help retail stores and brands join the e-commerce wave that is happening,” The List founder and CEO Andreas Skorski told TechCrunch. “We built machine learning and computer vision into the supply chain so they can plug and play into a store. We also have multiple APIs to sync and digitalize inventory to create a product catalogue.”</p>
<p>App features include the ability to livestream with a retailer, brand or personal shopper, ask questions in real time and receive recommendations or in-store presentations. Shoppers can follow their favorite brands and stores and engage when images or videos are shoppable. They can also upload a photo of an item to the seller network and get its sourced fast and at the best possible price.</p>
<p>On the seller side of the app, you can set up a digital store in minutes and determine how their brand and products will be presented and promoted. The List takes care of the entire fulfilment process, including insurance, taxes and duties, as well as store-to-door express delivery to 190 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For years, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1280/social-commerce/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China led in social commerce</a>, but it became a more popular concept in the United States during the global pandemic.  As such, Grand View Research reported earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/social-commerce-market-size-worth-3-369-8-billion-by-2028--cagr-28-4-grand-view-research-inc-301207167.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global social commerce market</a> was forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion by 2028 from growing annually by over 28% between now and then.</p>
<p>Social commerce is also proving to be global, with companies across the world finding success is this sector and attracting venture capital to back it up. For example, in November, Facily, a Brazil-based social commerce marketplace, closed on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/brazilian-social-commerce-marketplace-facily-quietly-raises-366m-in-less-than-a-year-now-valued-at-850m/">$250 million Series D round</a>. Prior to that, Evermos an Indonesian social commerce startup, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/indonesian-social-commerce-startup-evermos-lands-30m-series-b/">$30 million in Series B funding</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The List works with over 150 retail partners around the world, and while the U.S. is The List’s largest market, the app launch will help it grow into additional markets and offer products in different languages.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow aggressively and add to its 55-person workforce. Over the past year, The List saw growth on both sides of its business model, with several hundred people joining the supply side, and on the consumer side, revenue jumped by a couple thousand percent, Skorski said. In fact, this year’s Black Friday in November contributed to the best month ever in company history, he added.</p>
<p>“Digital sales has taken a dominant role, much like how restaurants have iPads at tables,” Skorski said. “The same will happen in the retail space, and it will be a matter of who gets there faster. We are creating this world to enable true storytelling in its best form.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we last checked in with <a href="https://www.cequence.ai/">Cequence Security</a> in February 2019, the company had just closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/cequence-security-hauls-in-17m-series-b-investment-to-help-protect-applications/">a $17 million Series B</a> and was concentrating on security to protect business logic. While it still does that, it has shifted focus to API security, and today it announced a $60 million Series C.</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures led the latest round with participation from new investors Icon Ventures, Telstra Ventures and HarbourVest Partners along with existing investors Shasta Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital and T-Mobile Ventures. The company said it has now raised $100 million.</p>
<p>CEO Larry Link said that the startup was seeing more vulnerabilities through APIs with customers, and they began to shift the focus of the Cequence analytics engine to find those kinds of vulnerabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We now will discover what your API footprint looks like. [Without having] to instrument it, we&#8217;re finding things, and then we detect [any] abuse that&#8217;s going on on those API endpoints, and then we can mitigate that. So that&#8217;s how the product has evolved,&#8221; Link told me.</p>
<p>He said that Cequence looks at approximately 150 data points to determine if the activity is something to worry about.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we look at individual requests first, and then we look at clustering of requests second, and then we look at the intent of those requests third, and that&#8217;s where we tease things out like, &#8216;Hey, this is an account takeover attack, or this is a credential stuffing attack, or this is an inventory manipulation attack,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Link said the company grew 2.5x over the last year and that there is a lot of room for growth. &#8220;We&#8217;re not releasing our revenue numbers, but it&#8217;s a very healthy growth rate and pretty high ARR for this kind of the business, and that&#8217;s why we wanted to raise this Series C, because we have a lot of opportunity. We need to fuel that,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has just over 100 employees today and could reach as high as 250 by the end of 2022, depending on how the business goes. Link said that as the company expanded over the last year and moved at least partly remote, the workforce has grown more diverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in the value of a diverse workforce. We think it gives us better insight and is a better platform to grow and expand the company. So the recent change in the last year and a half where some jobs need to be HQ-based, but most of our jobs can be working from anywhere. And this is kind of a new transition that we&#8217;ve seen, and it&#8217;s enabling us to get, I think, a better quality workforce and also a more diverse workforce,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is Link&#8217;s fifth startup. His previous job before joining Cequence was VP of Sales at Palo Alto Networks. The founders hired him after starting the company to add an experienced industry veteran to run the show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has quietly removed all references to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">its child sexual abuse scanning feature</a> from its website, months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">announcing that the new technology</a> would be baked into iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">Back in August</a>, Apple announced that it would introduce the feature to allow the company to detect and report known child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM, to law enforcement. At the time, Apple claimed — unlike cloud providers that already offered blanket scanning to check for potentially illegal content — it could detect known illegal imagery while preserving user privacy, because the technology could identify known CSAM on a user’s device without having to possess the image or device, or knowing its contents.</p>
<p>Apple faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">a monumental backlash</a> in response. Security experts and privacy advocates expressed concern that the system <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">could be abused</a> by highly resourced actors, like governments, to implicate innocent victims or to manipulate the system, while others ridiculed being ineffective at identifying images of child sexual abuse.This led to dozens of civil liberties groups calling on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the controversial feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Despite a publicity blitz that followed in an effort to assuage fears, Apple relented, announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">delay to the rollout of the CSAM scanning feature</a>. The company said &#8220;based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it looks like the feature might have been scrapped altogether.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/">MacRumours</a> first noticed that all mentions of CSAM have been quietly scrubbed from <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">Apple’s Child Safety webpage.</a> Up until December 10, this page included a detailed overview of CSAM detection and a promise that the controversial feature would be &#8220;coming later this year in updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey.&#8221; The updated version of the page removes not only the section on CSAM detection but also scrubs all references to the technology and a section offering links to documents explaining and assessing the CSAM process. Now, Apple&#8217;s Child Safety page only contains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-safety-feature-messages/">a reference to Communication safety in Messages</a> and expanded guidance for Siri, Spotlight and Safari Search, the former having debuted on iOS 15 earlier this week.</p>
<p>Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer told TechCrunch that &#8220;nothing has changed&#8221; with respect to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">September statement</a> announcing the delay to its feature, but would not say for what reason the references to its CSAM feature were removed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We have 72% growth, 70% gross margins, nine-figure revenues and a 27x multiplier. There's more to be said, but perhaps this begins a slightly more conservative pricing regime for software companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">final IPO that TechCrunch is tracking in 2021</a> had a solid run-up to its first day&#8217;s trading. Samsara, an IoT platform company, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/samsara-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301445145.html">priced</a> its public offering last night at $23 per share, the top end of its range.</p>

<hr />
<p>In selling 35 million shares, the company had gross initial proceeds of $805 million from its IPO. That number could scale by 5.25 million shares, or $120.75 million in gross value, if the company&#8217;s underwriting banks purchase shares that they have the option to.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Samsara worth at $23 per share?</h2>
<p>There are two valuations that we care about regarding Samsara&#8217;s IPO. We want its simple, or non-diluted, valuation. And we want its fully diluted valuation. The latter number will include more total shares, adding equity that has been vested through options and the like, but not yet exercised.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">our prior calculations</a>, here&#8217;s where the numbers sit for the now-public entity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsara simple IPO valuation $23 per share: $11.6 billion</li>
<li>Samsara fully diluted IPO valuation at $23 per share: $12.4 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>Our math also indicated that Samsara is worth around 27x its most recent run rate at the latter valuation. That&#8217;s a multiple that many companies would have killed for in the past, but compared to recent norms it feels a bit, well, small?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">API security is all the rage these days, pushed into the limelight following a spate of high profile security incidents that saw reams of user data exposed or exfiltrated. Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">spilled</a> users&#8217; private account information; Experian <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/">exposed</a> the financial histories of millions of Americans; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-sues-two-companies-engaged-in-data-scraping-operations/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-to-protect-user-data-from-web-scrapers/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/10/this-week-in-apps-facebooks-other-clubhouse-rival-apple-details-att-app-store-trial-nears/">Clubhouse</a> all had user data scraped <i>en masse</i> because of their poorly secured APIs.</p>
<p>For companies like Noname Security that aim to solve API security problems, business is booming. The Palo Alto-headquartered company today announced it&#8217;s raised $135 million in Series C funding, pushing the startup over the $1 billion valuation mark, making it the latest startup to join the cybersecurity unicorn club.</p>
<p>The round was led by Georgian and Lightspeed, with participation from Insight Partners, Forgepoint, and others. The funding comes just six months after Noname closed a $60 million round of funding at Series B, less than a year after raising $25 million at Series A after emerging from stealth last December. For those keeping count, that&#8217;s $220 million raised by the company to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Noname helps companies proactively discover and remediate API security issues by analyzing configuration settings, network traffic, and code to prevent misuse. APIs, in simple terms, allow two or more things to talk to each other over the internet, including hardware and software. APIs are pretty much everywhere, even if you can&#8217;t see them. But without controls in place, APIs can be abused to siphon off tons of sensitive or private internal data from a company&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to use the new investment to expand its research and development, and improve its go-to-market strategy. Noname now claims to support one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies, and has tripled its headcount in the past six months to more than 200 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2018, <a href="http://Forethought.ai">Forethought</a>, a startup looking to put AI to work across customer service,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/forethought-wins-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-sf-2018/"> won the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> and soon after landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/forethought-snares-9m-series-a-in-wake-of-battlefield-win/">a $9 million Series A</a>. Well, three years later that company just landed a $65 million Series C, and it&#8217;s rolling along.</p>
<p>Steadfast Capital led the latest round with participation from existing investor NEA and new investors Sound Ventures and K9 Ventures along with individual investors including actress Gwyneth Paltrow and former NBA player Baron Davis. The company has now raised $92 million.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Deon Nicholas says that like many companies, his benefited as the pandemic forced companies to digitally transform faster than they might have, and this was particularly true in the customer service market where Forethought&#8217;s products are aimed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247623" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This explosion in digital transformation, as well as I would say just the loss of human productivity [during the early part of the pandemic] led to a lot of businesses to turn to artificial intelligence, and obviously to Forethought, to help with this digital transformation,&#8221; Nicholas told me.</p>
<p>He says that the new money should help take advantage of the rapid growth the company has been experiencing. In the last year, they have seen ARR grow 5x, while tripling the number of customers.</p>
<p>The company now has three main customer service products. First it has the Assist, which helps CSA&#8217;s find the information they need to solve a problem quickly, Solve is a chatbot to help answer simple questions and route the more complex ones to human CSAs and Triage uses AI to route the call to the most knowledgeable CSA to get the call answered most efficiently.</p>
<p>He says the goal is to help humans perform better using AI. &#8220;One of the things that we&#8217;ve focused on is being a human-centered AI platform. And that&#8217;s what has really come through&#8230;with our mission, and really our mission is to unlock human potential through artificial intelligence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a Black co-founder Nicholas is keenly aware of the numbers out there when it comes to funding for Black founders. In fact, in the first half of 2021, just 1.2 percent of venture money went to startups with a Black founder, according to<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/"> data from Crunchbase</a>. And that was a big improvement over last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many ways, investors are making these gut decisions that they think are based on the company or the metrics or whatever, but oftentimes it&#8217;s based on their [idea] of what they think a founder should look like. And often if you don&#8217;t fit that mold, whether that&#8217;s because of your appearance, your skin color or your particular background, it can be tough because you&#8217;re battling these implicit judgment biases,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes he hopes for from his startup&#8217;s journey, is that his story inspires young people of color looking to start a company. &#8220;One of my hopes is that my personal story becomes one that can help the next generation of entrepreneurs see that there are examples of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today, the company is up to 145 employees and with the new cash, Nicholas expects to reach around 250 by the end of next year. He recognizes the need for diversity, especially in a business that caters to customer service agents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care about building an organization that is not only representative, but as you know, more diverse organizations lead to better decision making and just better products. Not to mention that when we think about the industry we serve, customer service…it&#8217;s global. It&#8217;s broad,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So for the people we serve, it&#8217;s very important that the people building the technology, as well AI and things like that, it&#8217;s very important that we understand and are representative of the people we serve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company could move beyond customer service over time, with Nicholas saying the company is looking at adjacent areas like sales. With $65 million, the company can afford to put some R&amp;D resources into other areas, while still contributing to AI research and refining and building on the current customer service focus.</p>

Cylus’ solution offers continuous monitoring and 360-degree real-time protection for all rail systems, regardless of size and geography, enabling real-time threat detection, advanced forensics and mitigation, simplified security operations and more. CylusOne takes just a few hours to install, requiring zero downtime, fully integrating with new and legacy systems with no changes to the network architecture required, providing full visibility within seconds. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Israel-based company announced today it has closed $30 million in a Series B round to help protect trains and metros.

Israeli serial entrepreneur Zohar Zisapel, a member of Cylus’ board, also joined the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With rising government investment in critical infrastructure and growing cybersecurity regulations in the U.S., Cylus will use the current funding to fuel its growth globally in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. The company also plans to continuously update its rail cybersecurity platform by adding more specialists in cybersecurity, traffic management and onboard/trackside systems and strengthening its AI and machine learning capabilities, chief executive officer and co-founder of Cylus <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-levintal/">Amir Levintal</a> told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The railways are such an essential part of our critical infrastructure, and really, of our everyday lives, that it is crucial that this industry gets the level of cyber protection it demands and needs,” Levintal said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cylus enables maximum interoperability (train-track coupling) while protecting stationary and moving systems in trains, Levintal continued. He also said that its integrated platform approach allows clients to engage with a single rail cybersecurity solution provider instead of multiple vendors. Other competitors offer only a partial solution for rail cybersecurity, such as those designed solely for onboard systems without signaling protection (or vice versa), Levintal added. </span></p>

Cylus’ platform is already in place across many of the world’s leading railway operators, and we believe it will become the ubiquitous platform used across the industry.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company has since seen a trend of owning fewer items, but of those that are purchased, they are of higher quality, made better, longer lasting and retain some resale value.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rebag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebag</a>, which buys, sells and trades luxury items like handbags and accessories, raised a $33 million Series E round following a year of technology development and category expansion.</p>
<p>We profiled Rebag back in 2015, when its name included two “g&#8217;s,” (gotta love URL availability) and had raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/online-designer-bag-reseller-rebagg-gains-4-million-in-seed/">$4 million in seed funding</a> to go after incumbents like The RealReal.</p>
<p>Novator led the latest round, with participation from existing investors, including General Catalyst, to bring the company’s total funding to date to $101 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247503" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Charles Gorra, founder and CEO of Rebag, declined to talk about valuation, but did say it was “a steep evolution from the last time.” The “last time” was a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rebag-series-d--0cd9e9c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million Series D round</a> in 2020, also led by Novator.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Online Designer Bag Reseller Rebagg Gains $4 Million In Seed Funding To Take On TheRealReal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/online-designer-bag-reseller-rebagg-gains-4-million-in-seed/embed/#?secret=8Vzc5reJKz" data-secret="8Vzc5reJKz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At that time, Rebag’s path was uncertain, with the global pandemic, Gorra explained. He took the $15 million to have some buffer as the company weighed its options. What happened was that the company ended up with two strong years of revenue growth — 50% in 2020 and 70% estimation for 2021 — basically close to triple the amount of growth over the two-year period, he said.</p>
<p>“It was a function of COVID generating digitization of underpenetrated industries, in particular luxury,” Gorra added. “Before COVID, purchases of luxury goods was 8% in the U.S. and now it is closer to 20%. Luxury stores can be uncomfortable, so our goal was how to make that experience more approachable.”</p>
<p>The company has since seen a trend of owning fewer items, but of those that are purchased, they are of higher quality, are made better, are longer lasting and retain some resale value. That’s important in the luxury space because Rebag’s average ticket is $2,000, so when you spend that kind of money, you want to build trust, Gorra said.</p>
<p>In the past 12 months, new categories, like fine jewelry and watches, grew four times. Gorra cites the company’s ability to triple its sourcing capabilities after launching its Clair AI and Clair Trade technology in 2020. The marketplace now has more than 30,000 items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rebag’s Clair technology suite includes proprietary software that can instantly recognize and price bags from the top 50 luxury brands, through an app or by uploading an image, and an offer from Rebag to buy it. The other software tool is an instant trade-in program for the buying and selling of items in one transaction.</p>
<p>Gorra intends to use the new capital to continue technology development on those tools, to add to Rebag’s workforce of 150 people and expand its marketing. The company currently has seven brick-and-mortar stores across New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Beverly Hills and Greenwich, Connecticut, with plans to add more in 2022.</p>
<p>“The market for venture capital is active and favorable, and we seized on that opportunity to accelerate funding,” he added. “There is a massive opportunity for the resale market — it is booming, and we believe we have created something special.”</p>
<p>Also over the past year, the company modified its retail model, adding high-tech touch points throughout the store, including the “Clair Corner,” a self-service kiosk where customers can receive an instant price quote on the item they are selling. In addition, its “Rebag Bar” in New York offers a personalized digital shopping experience, including being able to purchase and pay for resale items within an hour.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vinted raises $303M for its 2nd-hand clothes marketplace, used by 45M and now valued at $4.5B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/embed/#?secret=tpU21aSML6" data-secret="tpU21aSML6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though Gorra believes the luxury goods resale market is still in its infancy, citing that one out of 10 luxury items are transacted in the resale market, there are dozens of secondhand marketplaces for handbags and other items, also those not necessarily luxury goods.</p>
<p>The secondhand market is expected to double and reach $77 billion by 2025, <a href="https://www.thredup.com/resale/#size-and-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to ThredUp</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/unraveling-thredups-ipo-filing-slow-growth-but-a-shifting-business-model/">went public earlier this year</a> after raising over $300 million in venture-backed funding.</p>
<p>Gorra sees The RealReal and Poshmark being the closest competitors to Rebag. Even so, he says that the average ticket purchases are vastly different: The RealReal is $500 and Poshmark is $30 compared to Rebag’s $2,000, he noted.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is that Rebag controls the purchases and sales versus some of the other platforms that are peer-to-peer sales, sometimes causing those transactions to take days as each party manages their own sides.</p>
<p>“We believe our value prop is on the high-end goods market and want to be the trusted place for premium resale,” Gorra said. “We want to be a leader in this space, where we believe there will eventually be a large resale ecosystem, and we want to be a part of it.”</p>
<p><em>Update 12/15, 8:42 a.m.: The company amended its funding round size to $33 million from $35 million</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, Brazil has had a huge credit problem. It is Latin America’s largest country and has one of the highest interest rate spreads in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give you an idea of just how bad it is, reports indicated that in 2019, credit card interest rates neared </span><a href="https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/brazil/credit-card-interest-rate-nears-300-percent-per-year-in-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a staggering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">300%</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Brazil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the reasons you’re seeing so many fintechs emerge in Latin America. Interest rates this high make it very difficult for the economically challenged to ever not be economically challenged. In another example of how startups in the region are working to boost inclusion as much as innovation, <a href="https://open-co.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Co</a>, a São Paulo-based consumer credit company, announced today that it has raised $115 million in a round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247688" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Raiz Investimentos, IFC and LTS also put money in the round. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.open-co.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Co</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was created earlier this year by the merger of Geru, an eight-year-old o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nline lender, and Rebel, a four-year-old startup using AI and bank account data to underwrite risk and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">assess clients’ financial health. Its aim is to “finance consumption for Brazilians in a healthy way.” It plans to do this in a few ways, but for starters, by not charging 300% interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to good quality credit at the point and time of need is the single most important obstacle for Brazilians to achieve financial wellness, increase consumption and create wealth,” said Sandro Reiss, Open Co’s co-founder. &#8220;It&#8217;s a huge market that is still controlled by incumbents charging extremely high interest rates, which makes it difficult for people to pay back their loans. It is a vicious cycle; delinquencies are high and interest rates even higher. Our mission is to change that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Co provides clients with access to credit and access to tools that are designed to improve their financial lives, not make them worse. The process is 100% digital, with no bureaucracy involved; it claims to be fast, and the rates are lower than those of traditional banks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the need is there. An estimated 52% of the population use credit to pay for basic expenses, creating an unsecured consumer credit market of about $200 billion, of which about 70% is in revolving credit. As a result, 62 million Brazilians have overdue accounts or missed payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Co wants to give Brazilian people more options, and so far, the people seem to be welcoming those options with well, open arms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of buzz around “buy now, pay later” nowadays, but the truth is &#8212; its execs point out &#8212; that it has always existed in Brazil, a country where people usually buy things in installments with their credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the Open Co team is refreshingly transparent regarding financials. To get even more specific, the team is projecting to reach nearly $196 million in revenues in 2022, a “3x” growth compared to 2021. It also aims to allow its customers to access over $616 million in financing in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Execs say that its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business is profitable, but it is still heavily investing in growth and building better products and technology, which causes its cash requirements to be above the cash produced by operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining the results of its two predecessors, Open Co says it has helped consumers save more than $500 million in interest expenses over the years and has been increasingly establishing partnerships with merchants, retailers and service providers to be closer to its clients’ point of need when requesting credit. Overall, it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provided nearly $405 million in credit to more than 200,000 people so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consumer lending market in Brazil is massive,” Reiss told TechCrunch. “However, it is mispriced and dysfunctional for the consumers, with Brazilians being forced into paying the second-highest interest rate spread in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few factors are working in Open Co’s favor, its team believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a huge market with complacent incumbents, a population that adopts technologies early on and a supportive regulatory agenda. Last year we saw the creation of Pix, an instant payments system that allows people to transfer money in a few seconds, for free; and this year the implementation of open banking, which will reduce information asymmetry between incumbents and fintechs, started as well,” said Open Co co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rafael Pereira.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital toward its expansion plans, with “significant investments” in technology and product development. Naturally, it will also be doing some hiring. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently has 230 employees, more than 50% of whom work in tech and product.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When it comes to plans for the future, we can say that we want to give credit to people who have overdue accounts,” Pereira added. “But we don’t want to do the traditional way, with high interest rates that make it difficult for people to pay. Our mission is to break this vicious cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felipe Fujiwara, investment leader of SoftBank Latin America Fund, said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank is most excited about Open Co’s “large” opportunity to improve the quality of Brazilians&#8217; financial lives through credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Difficulty in accessing credit is one of the biggest social issues in Brazil. More than half of Brazilians are obliged to ask for credit to pay their basic expenses, and the result of the combination of demand and high interest results in 62 million people being denied credit,” Fujiwara wrote via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, he added, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has a track record in underwriting personal loans and in raising debt funding to provide better credit alternatives to consumers. At the same time, it offers merchants “the ability to meaningfully increase traffic, order value, conversion and GMV.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Besides that, it was the first fintech to use artificial intelligence to analyze customers, helping to solve the country&#8217;s credit problem, which has one of the highest spreads in the world,” Fujiwara added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Innovaccer has raised a new financing round and more than doubled its valuation to $3.2 billion from $1.3 billion in February this year as a growing number of healthcare organizations move to use the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/innovaccer-wants-to-be-the-service-that-unifies-all-healthcare-data/">San Francisco-headquartered firm&#8217;s platform</a> to put their troves of data to better use.</p>
<p>Mubadala Capital led the $150 million Series E round, pushing the startup’s all-time raise to over $375 million. Whale Rock Capital, Avidity Partners, and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors as well as existing investors including Tiger Global, B Capital Group, Microsoft’s M12 fund, and Steadview Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, most industries have adopted technology to bring efficiencies to their businesses and accelerate their growth. Healthcare industry, in comparison, has been the last frontier to adopt technology in many ways, said Abhinav Shashank, co-founder and chief executive of Innovaccer, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247857" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We haven’t been able to drive that kind of transformation. Moreover, most systems that have been built for this space are non-cloud,” he said, adding that this has resulted in troves of data sitting in siloed systems.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://innovaccer.com">Innovaccer</a> comes into the play.</p>
<p>The startup, which began its journey in India, has developed a cloud software layer that works on top of the existing systems employed by healthcare facilities and enables patients’ data to be fetched and perform analysis on.</p>
<p>Healthcare facilities “don’t need to replace their existing systems. Our cloud layer connects with a number of their existing electronic health record systems,” said Shashank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting better access enables patients to supply and make use of even more data &#8212; such as insurance or medical data generated by fitness trackers &#8212; they have on themselves. “This creates a 360-degree view of the patient.” Moreover, this allows doctors to get deeper and real-time visibility into the patient’s health status.</p>
<p>The business-to-business focused startup has amassed over 50 customers including Banner Health, and Roche in the U.S. and some in Europe. Some of its recently signed customers include One Medical, CommonSpirit, Sentara, Adventist Health, Children’s Health Alliance, Florence Health, and Zus Health.</p>

<p>As things stand today, when a hospital or any other health facility works with Innovaccer, its patients’ data remains with that facility. Other healthcare providers don’t get access to that data. This is one of the challenges that many entrepreneurs are hoping to solve.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, for instance, is hoping that his blockchain network will become a universal standard to a point that any patient anywhere in the world will be able to quickly grant permission to a doctor to view his or her records in an event of an emergency. But we are not there yet. Shashank suggested that in the coming years, as healthcare providers begin to open up, they may agree to a universal protocol and such an interoperable system would then work.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why he is optimistic is the growing interest of big tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple in the healthtech space. “They want us to succeed and we are building systems that run on top of their clouds. So there&#8217;s massive synergies in how we are all approaching the market,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which signed its first customer in 2016, has grown rapidly in recent years, he said. “Our focus has been the U.S. market. At some point, we will expand internationally as well. But given the size of the problem we have on our hands in the U.S. itself, we will remain largely focused here for the near term.”</p>
<p>The growth of Innovaccer is one of the biggest Indian SaaS success stories. Shashank, pointing to the success of many SaaS startups that began their journey in India, Australia or Southeast Asia, said for SaaS entrepreneurs, the “world has never been flatter as the delivery model is on the cloud. I don’t think it has ever been easier for entrepreneurs to build a global software company of significant size and scale,” he said.</p>
<p>Innovaccer will deploy the fresh funds to supercharge its research and development work and also hire more talent across product, engineering and customer experience roles.</p>
<p>“We have been investors in Innovaccer since 2019, and believe that the company has all the necessary pillars to define the new gold standard of how the Health Cloud should be implemented by providers, payers, and life science companies,” said Alaa Halawa, Partner and Head of the US Ventures business at Mubadala Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of tech companies have tried to create a common data framework to connect the healthcare industry, but they all fell short due to extreme industry complexities or technology challenges. But in five short years, Innovaccer has built the most successful data activation platform in the healthcare industry as proven by record rates of industry adoption. Innovaccer is likely the first and only company since the invention of the electronic health record (EHR) that has the opportunity to unify the healthcare ecosystem.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israeli SaaS security startup Atmosec raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm Glilot Capital Partners and American fund Battery Ventures.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli SaaS security startup <a href="https://www.atmosec.com/">Atmosec</a> today announced having raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm <a href="https://glilotcapital.com/">Glilot Capital Partners</a> and American fund <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a>. Its team had previously participated in <a href="https://nocamels.com/2021/04/intel-ignite-4th-cohort-10-israeli-startups/">Intel Ignite&#8217;s fourth Tel Aviv startup acceleration cohort</a>.</p>
<p>Now out of stealth mode, Atmosec wants to make it more secure for companies to use a flurry of cloud SaaS solutions, from Slack to ServiceNow. Its solution focuses on anomaly detection based on automatic monitoring to notify clients of potential issues and prevent attacks.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233538/average-number-saas-apps-yearly/">data from Statista</a>, Atmosec points out that the number of SaaS apps used by organizations is on the rise, with an average of 110 in 2021. This makes sense, but also poses security challenges, as many of them &#8220;have inadequate systems to manage third-party risk,&#8221; said Adi Dangot Zukovsky, of Battery Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is where Atmosec comes in, Dangot Zukovsky explained, &#8220;with new technology that provides cloud-native enterprises with greater visibility into their existing systems and helps them lower the risk of outsiders exploiting their third-party business applications and app-to-app connectivity paths.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Atmosec&#8217;s seed round counted with participation from other Israeli entrepreneurs in the security space, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/wiz-unveils-new-security-tool-to-protect-code-in-development-pipeline/">Wiz</a>&#8216;s CEO Assaf Rappaport, Talon Cyber&#8217;s CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, and Armis&#8217; co-founders Yevgeny Dibrov and Nadir Izrael. Co-founders Aner Gelman, Misha Seltzer, and Shaked Gitelman are themselves former executives at Armis, which recently raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/29/armis-expands-past-iot-with-300m-for-comprehensive-asset-security/">$300 million to expand beyond IoT</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s additional connection between the two startups, Gelman said: &#8220;We’re leveraging some of the technologies and concepts that we helped build out at Armis, and without giving away too many trade secrets, we&#8217;re utilizing continuous machine learning with baseline analysis that identifies anomalies in connections based on actual and potential behavior, not just configurations.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Gelman and his two co-founders all being army intelligence veterans, it is not too surprising that there&#8217;s a bit of secrecy involved. The TL;DR is that understanding the behavior helps Atmosec detect anomalies its clients need to address. But now that the company is out of stealth, it is likely that it will start sharing a bit more with its potential users on how it differentiates from competitors.</p>
<p>Having recently learned that fellow Israeli SaaS security startups Grip Security and Adaptive Shield had respectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/grip-security-raises-25m-series-a-for-its-saas-security-platform/">$19 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/adaptive-shield-lands-30m-series-a-to-build-out-its-saas-security-platform/">$30 million</a> Series A rounds, this is definitely a hot space we are keen to learn more about.</p>
