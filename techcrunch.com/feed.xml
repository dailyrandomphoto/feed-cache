										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.workplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace</a> &#8212; the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/facebook-workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally built</a> as a version of Facebook for employees to communicate with each other &#8212; now has more than 7 million users, carving out a place for itself as an app help companies communicate internally using essentially the same tools that have proven sticky in their lives with friends and family. That traction, it turns out, has been giving Workplace attention of another kind.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned that Facebook (before it was rebranded as Meta) was approached by enterprise investors offering the social network a proposition: spin off the organization, they said, and let us back it as a startup. A deal would have valued a newly independent Workplace as a &#8220;unicorn&#8221; (at least at $1 billion) according to the source.</p>
<p>A source tells us that conversations didn&#8217;t progress, primarily because Facebook (and now Meta) saw Workplace as a &#8220;strategic asset&#8221; &#8212; not because Workplace generates sales anywhere close to the billions Meta makes from advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, but important rather for presenting a more diverse face to the market. For regulators, it shows that Facebook/Meta is more than just a too-powerful social network; and for organizations, that Facebook can do more for them than just sell ads.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244190" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It helps make Facebook [and Meta] look like an adult,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>Spokespeople from Meta and Workplace said that they had nothing to share and declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear which investors were involved, but a source says that they were among those focused on late-stage, growth round investments with a view to injecting capital specifically in enterprise opportunities.</p>
<p>Their approach to fund a spun-out Workplace last year would have come at a time when late-stage and private equity investors were (and still are) ramping up their activities to snap up big, mature tech businesses. Thoma Bravo last year was reported to be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/456f2fd7-f868-4ea6-abd7-fce34e783333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $35 billion</a> to hone in on more acquisition opportunities in the space (and it&#8217;s been making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/israeli-fintech-personetics-raises-85m-for-tools-to-help-incumbents-personalize-banking-services-to-compete-with-neobanks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide</a> number of investments and <a href="https://www.bottomline.com/us/newsroom/press-releases/bottomline-be-acquired-thoma-bravo-26-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisitions</a> to that end). Bloomberg estimates that private equity acquisitions totaled <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/private-equity-s-taste-for-tech-sparks-record-80-billion-spree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more some $80 billion in 2021</a>, up more than 140% compared to 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That pace does not look like it is slowing down this year, and it includes PE firms approaching larger technology behemoths to spin out operations as they look to streamline and realise more capital from less core, or possibly unprofitable, or more generally lagging, assets. Just earlier today, Francisco Partners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/francisco-partners-scoops-up-remains-of-ibms-watson-health-unit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a deal to snap up IBM&#8217;s Watson Health business, reportedly for around $1 billion.</p>
<h2>Building a SaaS beachhead</h2>
<p>For Meta, an approach to spin out Workplace highlights developments on two fronts.</p>
<p>On the corporate side, there have been calls to break up the company &#8212; the latest development on that front from earlier this month is that the courts ruled that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission can proceed with a lawsuit mandating a sale of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/lawsuit-aiming-to-break-up-facebook-group-meta-can-go-ahead-us-court-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp and Instagram</a>, alongside, reportedly, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/the-ftc-is-reportedly-probing-metas-vr-business-for-antitrust-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate probe of its VR division</a> for antitrust violations. It&#8217;s a situation that some investors and shareholders will see as an opportunity, a tension that Meta might increasingly need to weigh up as it justifies holding on to its various assets.</p>
<p>For Workplace, the division has found itself at a key crossroads in the last several months.</p>
<p>On one side, Workplace has seen a number of key departures, including no less than its top two executives, Karandeep Anand (who this month was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named</a> chief product officer at Brex) and Julien Codorniou, who left to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/felix-capital-adds-julien-codorniou-ex-head-of-metas-workplace-susan-lin-as-newest-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner at London VC Felix Capital</a>. A number of others have also left the building to move on other opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>The logic behind some of that movement was described to me, charitably, not as a response to the bad PR that Meta has faced, but natural attrition: here was a group of people assembled to create and build Workplace from the ground up, and now that it&#8217;s a more mature product with a clearer focus, it&#8217;s the right time for new people to come in and work on the next stage. (My personal opinion: Workplace&#8217;s new head, Ujjwal Singh, feels like a solid choice to lead it right now.)</p>
<p>But even if there has been reporting <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/11/the-great-facebook-employee-exodus-that-wasnt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contradicting</a> that workers might feel worn down by Meta constantly being bashed in the court of public opinion, Workplace has not been immune to it, either. We understand that Workplace signed a huge deal with a major chain of restaurants, one of the biggest, but the customer asked to hold off on announcing the win last autumn because of the bad news cycle and &#8220;reputation issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That shit doesn&#8217;t happen to other SaaS companies,&#8221; one person said.</p>
<p>That, it seems, would have been one argument in favor of distancing Workplace further from its parent, perhaps by way of a spinout, but it seems that Meta has the opposite idea.</p>
<p>Workplace has actually changed a lot over the years since it was first rolled out as a product.</p>
<p>Founded originally as a &#8220;work&#8221; version of Facebook &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/facebook-at-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding how Facebook employees were already using Facebook</a> to communicate to each other in private groups &#8212; Workplace was launched as a response to the rise of Slack and other chat apps for the workplace. Workplace&#8217;s logic was that it had a natural advantage since billions were already using Facebook. And, bringing in a new service targeting a different kind of user, with a different business model &#8212; paid, not ad-supported &#8212; opened the door to new business possibilities for the company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s largely remained the strategy for the company even as the focus has changed for Workplace. Originally it introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/facebook-workplace-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of integrations with other workplace productivity tools</a> aimed at knowledge workers, part of a bigger effort to compete more directly against the likes of Slack and Teams. But over time, almost on accident, Workplace found an audience with deskless workers who communicated with their employers mainly by mobile. So what has emerged as the sweet spot for Workplace is being a communications app for both categories of workers simultaneously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realised that instead of asking our customers to choose between Teams or Slack and Workplace, you could have both,&#8221; a source said. &#8220;Others could handle real-time messaging communications for knowledge workers, while Workplace does asynchronous best for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that appears to be the guiding idea for Workplace&#8217;s strategy now, which has seen it recently integrate <a href="https://www.workplace.com/blog/workplace-and-microsoft-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more functionality from Microsoft Teams</a> into its platform to complement Workplace, and yesterday to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/metas-workplace-will-integrate-with-whatsapp-later-this-year-to-expand-communication-with-frontline-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce a new integration with WhatsApp</a>, which is already very popular with frontline teams, and will now become a more formal interface for Workplace communications. From what we understand, closer integrations and services involving Meta&#8217;s VR business and the Portal are also in the works.</p>
<p>While the company is not due to update on user numbers until later this year, a source told us that there are now closer to 10 million users on Workplace, with key customers including some of the world&#8217;s biggest employers like Walmart, Astra Zeneca and others.</p>
<p>While Workplace had in the past been sold to customers as a standalone product, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it will be sold as a standalone application ever again,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>Instead, it will part of a suite, for example selling business messaging plus Workplace, or along with a Facebook login feature, opening up the prospects of how Meta can engage with those businesses. (The wider sales pitch to enterprises is also likely a behind its motivation to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire Kustomer, the CRM startup</a>, although that deal has yet to close.)</p>
<p>So far from being ready to part with Workplace, it seems that Meta is now positioning it as part of a beachhead comprising a bigger SaaS business. Can it mobilize as an independent company might have done to realize that opportunity? VCs might still be waiting in the wings if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based startup <a href="https://en.getmoss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moss</a> announced earlier this week that it has closed a new $86 million Series B funding round (€75 million). The company offers corporate credit cards for small and medium companies so that they can more easily spend and track their spending.</p>
<p>Following today’s funding round, Moss has reached a valuation of $573 million (€500 million). Tiger Global Management is leading the Series B with A-Star also participating. Overall, the company has raised nearly $150 million in total (€130 million).</p>
<p>Moss could be considered as a spend management platform. It competes with other European players, such as <a href="https://www.spendesk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.pleo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo</a> and <a href="https://www.soldo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soldo</a>. What sets Moss apart from its competitors is that it offers credit cards, not debit cards. But transactions still show up in your Moss dashboard seconds after each payment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to physical cards, employees can also generate virtual cards for online payments. Every time they make a purchase, Moss customers get 0.4% in cash back on all expenses.</p>
<p>This way, small companies don’t have to share one corporate card for all expenses. Team leaders can set budgets for each employee and track expenses more easily.</p>
<p>For employees themselves, corporate cards aren’t that common in Europe. By switching to Moss they don’t have to pay out of pocket for employee expenses. They can use a Moss card and attach the receipt to the transaction. And if a restaurant doesn’t accept card payments, Moss also handles cash expenses and reimbursements.</p>
<p>In addition to card payments, you can rely on Moss for other types of payments by centralizing all your invoices in your Moss account. Moss users can set up approval rules and export payments lists for the business bank account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Finally, Moss can speed up accounting tasks as it integrates with Datev, a popular accounting software on the German market. Going forward, the startup is going to make its product more modular. You won’t have to use the entire spend management stack if you don’t need everything.</p>
<p>Overall, Moss has processed 250,000 transactions and issued 20,000 cards. The product is live in Germany and the Netherlands. The company now plans to expand to the U.K.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The mobile grocery app automates the supply chain, enabling customers to choose over 5,000 products delivered via a network of micro-fulfillment centers in less than two hours. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grocery delivery startup <a href="https://calii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calii</a> is carving out a piece of Latin America’s <a href="https://sacra.com/research/rappi-the-meituan-of-latin-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 trillion groceries and food delivery market</a> with its approach to cut inefficiencies in the food supply chain so it can bring produce and thousands of other grocery items to customers’ doorsteps in less than two hours.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260534" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260534" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2260534" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?w=314" alt="Calii" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/calii_app_screenshot_4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260534" class="wp-caption-text">Calii app</p></div></p>
<p>To continue on that mission, the company announced Friday $22.5 million in Series A funding co-led by Dalus Capital and JAM Fund, with participation from backers including Forerunner Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, Y Combinator and Base10 Partners. To date, it has raised nearly $35 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260422" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>David Eduardo Arrambide Montemayor and Maurizio Caló Caligaris, both Stanford-educated engineers, started Calii, a mobile grocery app that connects with producers and brands to automate the supply chain end-to-end and deliver more than 5,000 products, like produce, meat, seafood and prepared items, via a network of micro-fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>This not only provides customers with food savings, but reduces environmental waste by up to three times, CEO Arrambide Montemayor told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>“By cutting middlemen and reducing inefficiencies, we generate more profits for producers and pass on greater savings to our users,” he added. “Our products are priced at par or lower than traditional supermarkets, such as Walmart.”</p>
<p>Calii is operating in what has become quite a crowded space aiming to lift Latin America’s current less than 5% online grocery sales within the retail market. Arrambide Montemayor considers the company’s competitors to fall into three categories: marketplaces, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">Cornershop</a>, quick commerce, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/instant-grocery-delivery-startup-jokr-bags-another-huge-round-to-enter-unicorn-status/">Jokr</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/">Rappi Turbo</a>, and full groceries, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">Jüsto</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/colombias-merqueo-bags-50m-to-expand-its-online-grocery-delivery-service-across-latin-america/">Merqueo</a>, with the four last companies all attracting venture capital in the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What differentiates Calii from those players is pricing, speed and fewer products.</p>
<p>“Our tech-driven approach of automated micro-fulfillment centers, digitized picking and packing, machine learning and big data algorithms for SKU selection and demand forecasting and focus on ultra-fresh produce and grocery items, make us the top-rated grocery app, replacing the weekly grocery trip to the supermarket,” he added.</p>
<p>When Arrambide Montemayor and Caló Caligaris launched the company in March 2019, the team spent the first 24 months in two markets to perfect the model, user experience and unit economics.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months Calii grew more than three times in revenue. In Monterrey, its first market, the company delivers over 2,000 orders per day, and the average order value is above $40. During the same time period, the company grew its headcount by 250% to over 250 employees and operators.</p>
<p>With the funding, the company is kicking off a new phase of lightning-fast expansion and growth, Arrambide Montemayor said. It is expanding its footprint in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, with plans to be in more than 14 cities and multiple countries in the next six months.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is rolling out new complementary products, services and categories, including home appliances and electronics; Market, with over 40,000 grocery items with same-day or next-day delivery; and buy now, pay later offering Calii Pay. The funding will also enable the company to triple its headcount on its way to surpassing 10,000 daily orders.</p>
<p>“To truly crack the $1 trillion groceries market in LatAm, we understand that we cannot be a premium service, charging 20% more than supermarket; therefore, we&#8217;re rebuilding and automating the grocery supply chain from first principles, injecting tech and data in every layer, in order to deliver ultra-freshness with savings,” Arrambide Montemayor added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cana focused on identifying the basic set of ingredients, basically deconstructing beverages to figure out what makes it taste like a certain drink.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following nearly four years in the prototype phase, <a href="https://www.cana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cana Technology</a> is unveiling what it calls the “world’s first molecular beverage printer” after securing $30 million in funding from venture foundry The Production Board.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering exactly what this might be, it’s basically a SodaStream meets a computer printer. The smart connected device is about the size of a toaster, sits on your kitchen counter and can produce an infinite variety of beverages, from juice to coffee to cocktails, by recombining it with water in your home, all from one “printer” cartridge, by using a touch screen.</p>
<p>Here’s where the “molecular” technology comes into play: Cana focused on identifying the basic set of ingredients, basically deconstructing beverages to figure out what makes it taste like a certain drink, Lance Kizer, Cana’s chief science officer, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Once you remove the water, there is a small volume of drink that you are actually consuming, around 5% to 10%, so Cana concentrated those ingredients and loaded them into a cartridge that can hold more than 100 different beverages. The company has partnered with certain brands for drinks and also created their own combinations.</p>
<p>“It is all of the same ingredients that you consume in drinks, so we are not recreating them,” Kizer said. “Quality is important, and we are focusing on making beverages in a novel way, and we have now created hundreds of them.”</p>
<p>Not only do you have hundreds of drinks at your fingertips, you also can customize them to your taste: add more sugar or less sugar, and for the alcoholic drinks, more or less alcohol. While learning about the device, I was able to try a few of the drinks — cold brew coffee, root beer and a black cherry mojito — and thought the flavors were more bold than their traditional counterparts and the overall taste had a smooth finish.</p>
<p>Each cartridge holds one to three months&#8217; worth of beverages, and the device senses when the cartridge is low and automatically reorders. The cartridges are designed to be sent back for recycling, Kizer added</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cana’s goal is to rebuild the $2 trillion beverage industry while also saving waste from going into landfills and excessive water being used at the same time. CEO Matt Mahar explained that Cana’s prototype would save the typical American household roughly 100 beverage containers per month. At scale, Cana could reduce the use of plastic and glass containers, water waste and the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the global beverage manufacturing complex by more than 80%.</p>
<p>The new funding is being heavily invested into the supply chain and continued technology development, Mahar said. The company currently has 35 employees, and he expects to double that this year.</p>
<p>Mahar said the company is still working on the device’s price point, but that it will be cheaper than retail prices per use. By the end of February, he expected to have full data on both pricing and when people will be able to begin purchasing the device.</p>
<p>Bharat Vasan, president and COO of The Production Board, said the venture foundry has invested in a number of companies in the food space, and says the Cana team was attractive due to their ambitious outlook on technology and the way they combined hardware, software and science in an entirely new way of making something.</p>
<p>To him, Cana’s device “feels like the Netflix of beverage experiences,” and the same concentration technology used for drinks could be used for a number of other products, like perfume and cosmetics.</p>
<p>“It’s about changing the way things are made and shipped out,” he said. “Distributed manufacturing is made in one place and then shipped out to retailers. Now there is a different system of delivery that is directly to your house that can bypass supply chain constraints. The beverage printer is one manifestation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Raven Software&#8217;s quality assurance department &#8212; which mostly works on &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; as part of Activision Blizzard &#8212; became the first union to form at a major U.S. gaming company. With help from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), Raven Software testers launched the <a href="https://gameworkersalliance.com/about-us-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Workers Alliance</a>, which plans to focus on &#8220;improving the conditions of workers in the video game industry by making it a more sustainable, equitable place where transparency is paramount,&#8221; even beyond its own company. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/activision-employee-group-forms-union-a-first-in-video-games?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34-worker unit</a> is asking management to recognize their union during a time already marked by change: on Tuesday, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">$68.7 billion</a> in one of the priciest tech acquisitions of all time.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ItirjPOyWS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/why-microsofts-2t-market-cap-makes-its-78b-activision-buy-a-cheap-bet/">Why Microsoft&#8217;s $2T+ market cap makes its $68B Activision buy a cheap bet</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Microsoft&#8217;s $2T+ market cap makes its $68B Activision buy a cheap bet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/why-microsofts-2t-market-cap-makes-its-78b-activision-buy-a-cheap-bet/embed/#?secret=ItirjPOyWS" data-secret="ItirjPOyWS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But on the heels of that historic acquisition, Activision Blizzard has been embroiled in controversy amid ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">SEC investigations</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual harassment scandals</a>. Internally, employees started laying a grassroots foundation for worker solidarity through groups like the <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABK Workers Alliance</a>. When Raven Software<a href="https://www.polygon.com/22820273/raven-software-layoffs-walk-out-protest-activision" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> laid off 12 contractors</a> in early December, the team at the Wisconsin-based studio staged a walkout, which continued for five weeks leading up to today&#8217;s unionization announcement. The ABK Workers Alliance used its sizable social media following to<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/abk-strike-fund?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> crowdfund over $370,000</a> to assist with wages during the strike. The CWA said that this strike was the third work stoppage at Activision Blizzard after the company was sued in July 2021 over sexual harassment and misconduct claims.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This level of organizing among workers has little precedent in gaming, despite the industry being notorious for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/03/24/crunch-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over-working</a> employees or deploying <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-05-14/even-after-a-boom-year-it-s-hard-to-hold-onto-a-job-in-gaming?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass layoffs</a> due to closing studios. But only a month ago did the first voluntarily recognized gaming union form in North America at the small indie studio <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodeo Games</a>, which produces &#8220;Beast Breaker.&#8221; Vodeo&#8217;s union also works with the CWA.</p>
<p>“Today, I am proud to join with a supermajority of my fellow workers to build our union, Game Workers Alliance. In the video game industry, specifically Raven QA, people are passionate about their jobs and the content they are creating. We want to make sure that the passion from these workers is accurately reflected in our workplace and the content we make. Our union is how our collective voices can be heard by leadership,” said Raven Software tester Becka Aigner in a press release.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The pandemic trade is coming apart, and Netflix is the latest company to suffer.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/the-pandemic-trade-is-over/">got its teeth into the pandemic trade</a> and its possible conclusion yesterday. As a refresher: After the initial onset of COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdowns, changes to work environments and restriction of travel, some companies saw their values quickly appreciate as they found investor favor.</p>
<p>The reasons for some sectors gaining luster in the eyes of the investing class were manifold, but can be condensed. Companies and sectors that saw demand accelerated by the pandemic saw their share prices similarly improve. And software companies, which showed resilience thanks to customers not being able to operate without paying for their offerings, quickly appreciated, pushing their valuations higher and higher.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Until the trade ended. Software companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">began to shed their pandemic valuation gains</a> in the final weeks of 2021 and have continued to do so in the new year. For companies like Peloton, which rode a consumer demand shift that gave their products more shine, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-reportedly-pauses-bike-and-treadmill-production-amid-slowed-demand/">the trade is coming apart a little bit later</a>.</p>
<p>Netflix is the latest company to suffer. Recent earnings results were just short of a catastrophe for the U.S. streaming company. Its shares are off around 22% this morning, bringing its value down to around $174 billion from a peak of more than $300 billion set last November.</p>

And when everyone stayed home, well, Netflix did quite well.</p>
<p>But that accelerated period of growth has ended. Netflix’s latest earnings report shows that instead of the company enjoying an expanded total market for its services that earlier, faster growth might have hinted at, it may have instead taken future growth and moved it up, leaving the popular video service now in low-growth quicksand, with investor expectations above what it can deliver.</p>
<p>Today, we’re exploring whether international growth can replace lost domestic growth at the company, and what could be ahead for firms like Netflix that find themselves coming down from a period of elevated investor attention and consumer demand. Netflix is an example, but what the company is going through could be an indicator of what’s ahead for other consumer services that had a strong period of growth amid the pandemic. Who else is in danger?</p>
<h2>Understanding Netflix&#8217;s results</h2>
<p>Netflix gained 8.3 million new paid subscriptions in Q4 2021, finishing the year with 222 million paid memberships. That doesn&#8217;t sound bad out of context, but context matters. First, the company projection was 8.5 million, not 8.3 – and markets are never fond of missed forecasts. Second, the 222 million figure means this was its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/netflix-q4-2021-results-subscriber-numbers/">lowest year of subscriber growth since 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, this isn&#8217;t so much about missing the mark as it is about trust in numbers. Is Netflix capable of interpreting its situation correctly? And of forecasting accurately? Needing to address this may also explain why the company is more conservative in its Q1 2022 forecast. For the current quarter, it only expects 2.5 million new paid subscriptions, compared to 4 million in Q1 2021 – when, by the way, it expected 6 million.</p>
<p>But even if the company is adjusting its guidance, it still leaves questions about what is going on. For instance, media experts may wonder if the company is affected by increased competition or merely reaching saturation levels. Netflix dismisses the importance of these concerns, and we tend to agree. It isn&#8217;t necessarily good news, though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel this week <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1521/intel-announces-next-us-site-with-landmark-investment-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted plans</a> to build two chip manufacturing facilities outside of Columbus, Ohio. The announcement is still early stages, involving the eventual allotment of $20 billion to construct the factories designed to tackle the ongoing global chip shortage &#8212; or at least address potential future issues.</p>
<p>The company sketched a rough timeline for the first factory, with planning beginning immediately and construction following before the end of the year. That facility would come online in 2025, marking its first new manufacturing site in 40 years. The project is set to span 1,000 acres of space, with enough room to fit up to eight chip factories, if things go as planned.</p>
<p>“Today’s investment marks another significant way Intel is leading the effort to restore U.S. semiconductor manufacturing leadership,” CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a release. “Intel’s actions will help build a more resilient supply chain and ensure reliable access to advanced semiconductors for years to come.

<p>The construction phase will create 7,000 jobs, per Intel’s numbers, along with an eventual 3,000 permanent jobs once things are up and running. The Biden White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-bringing-semiconductor-manufacturing-back-to-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touted the news</a> as “another sign of the strength of the American economy,” in a statement issued yesterday.</p>

Announced on January 21, 2022, the $20 billion project spans nearly 1,000 acres and is the largest single private-sector investment in Ohio history. Construction is expected to begin in late 2022, with production coming online at the end of 2025. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intel Corporation</p></div></p>
<p>It also used the opportunity to promote policy aimed at accelerating domestic R&amp;D and manufacturing amid a COVID-fueled global supply chain crunch that has been seen as a black eye for the administration by some.</p>
<p>“To accelerate this progress, the President is urging Congress to pass legislation to strengthen U.S. research and development and manufacturing for critical supply chains, including semiconductors,” the administration writes. “The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) in June and the Administration is working with the House and Senate to finalize this legislation. It includes full funding for the CHIPS for America Act, which will provide $52 billion to catalyze more private-sector investments and continued American technological leadership.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both parties also touted the security advantages of manufacturing chips in the U.S. &#8212; no doubt a nod to increased scrutiny around manufacturers like Huawei, which proved a major target for the previous administration. The company notes that, &#8220;the Ohio site will also provide leading-edge process technology to support the U.S. government’s unique security and infrastructure needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news also comes as Intel deals with increased competition from companies like Samsung, while firms such as Apple have opted to drop the company’s chips in favor of first-party designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what has to be considered an anticlimactic ending, IBM sold off the data assets of its Watson Health unit to private equity firm Francisco Partners today. The two firms did not share the purchase price, but <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous reports</a> pegged the value at around $1 billion.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal Francisco is grabbing various pieces of the unit, including Health Insights, MarketScan, Clinical Development, Social Program Management, Micromedex and imaging software offerings. This gives Francisco Partners a broad range of health data under its umbrella.</p>
<p>When IBM <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2909534/ibm-launches-watson-health-global-analytics-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put together Watson Health</a> in 2015, it hoped to dominate the vertical by building the unit around a data-driven strategy. To that end, it began scooping up health data companies starting with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/13/ibm-acquires-health-tech-startups-explorys-and-phytel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phytel and Explorys </a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It went on to spend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/ibm-buying-merge-healthcare-for-1b-to-bring-medical-image-analysis-to-watson-health/">$1 billion on Merge Healthcare</a> and wrapped up its spending, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/ibm-acquiring-truven-health-analytics-for-2-6-billion-and-adding-it-to-watson-health/">buying Truven Health Analytics</a> the following year for $2.6 billion. Although the company had high hopes that Watson Health would help drive its artificial intelligence push, the unit failed to produce the results it was hoping for and when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/arvind-krishna-will-replace-ginni-rometty-as-ibm-ceo-in-april/">Arvind Krishna replaced Ginni Rometty</a> as CEO in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">he had different priorities</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HRwhOMftJu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ibm-reportedly-shopping-watson-health-just-as-healthcare-gets-hot/">IBM reportedly shopping Watson Health just as healthcare gets hot</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM reportedly shopping Watson Health just as healthcare gets hot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ibm-reportedly-shopping-watson-health-just-as-healthcare-gets-hot/embed/#?secret=HRwhOMftJu" data-secret="HRwhOMftJu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Francisco Partners plans to build a new standalone company with these assets, and in a somewhat surprising move, given the division failed to perform as hoped, the firm plans to keep the same management team in place, at least for now.</p>
<p>Justin Chen, principal at Francisco Partners, says that they plan to give the new company additional support to help it fulfill its potential. &#8220;Partnering with corporations to execute divisional carve-outs has been a core focus of Francisco Partners. We look forward to supporting the talented employees and management team, helping the standalone company focus on growth opportunities to realize its full potential, and delivering enhanced value to customers and partners,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IBM is making this sale just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">the healthcare vertical is heating up</a>. Last year, Oracle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">bought health records company</a> Cerner for $28 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft bought Nuance Communications</a> in a deal valued at nearly $20 billion. While both deals are pending regulatory approval, it shows how much large companies value the health vertical.</p>
<p>As a result, it was a move that clearly caught Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, by surprise. &#8220;I am very surprised because the puck is moving to more vertical solutions. I suppose it also shows potentially how poorly the unit was doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless, the deal is done, pending regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the second quarter. Given that sensitive health data is involved in this transaction, it&#8217;s possible that the deal could face additional scrutiny.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Friday episode, a run-down of key news headlines, startup funding rounds and whatever else is popping in the worlds of startups and tech. The whole gang was in the huddle this week, including our stellar production team <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris</a>, and hosting team <a href="http://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://Twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260334" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Despite the fact that it is a holiday week here in the United States, tech news was, well, as nuts as it usually is. At this point anything else would be a shock.</p>
<p>So what did we get to? All of this and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebundle&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/rebundle-raises-1-4m-for-plant-based-hair-extensions/">incredibly neat startup idea, and funding round</a>. We love a Midwest startup here on the show thanks to Alex&#8217;s roots, which means that when we got to talk about banana fiber, hair extensions, venture capital and St. Louis all at once, we were hype.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/to-reinvent-itself-in-telehealth-wheel-lands-150-million-series-c/">Wheel reinvented itself again with a $150 million Series C, </a>while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/gale-healthcare-raises-60m-to-match-nurses-with-empty-shifts/">Gale Health played matchmaker with understaffed shifts and nurses. </a></li>
<li>Plaid&#8217;s buy of Cognito, a fintech startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/plaid-buys-cognito-to-bolster-its-feature-set-as-it-moves-beyond-simply-connecting-accounts/">for around $250 million</a>. The deal had us thinking about the power of APIs, the future of fintech and why we don&#8217;t hear about more startup M&amp;A.</li>
<li>Part of the why to that question could be antitrust pressures, the sort of which that Microsoft is going to hit with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">its purchase attempt of Activision Blizzard, a gaming company</a>. Microsoft already owns several gaming studios (Mojang, Bethesda), its own gaming platform (Xbox) and has long owned and operated the key PC gaming operating system (Windows). How much more does it need to own?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">We also touched on Wordle</a>, free gaming and the open web in our gaming chat, so lots to unpack there, frankly! Send us <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your go-to starter word. </a></li>
<li>Finally, no time like the present to return to no code. At times tech is a bunch of shiny rebrands, but at other times, basic angles become non-negotiable strategies. No code, like AI and ML, is one of them. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/walnut-growing-700-in-four-months/">companies like Walnut</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/softrs-series-a-is-a-reminder-that-the-no-code-boom-continues/">Softr are snapping up the resulting rewards.  </a></li>
</ul>
<div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto">Whew! What a week. If you are tired already, do not look at the calendar. It will only terrify you.</div>

					<description><![CDATA[The grocery store and bistro offer over 1,000 locally-sourced, healthy food products, including produce, meats, baked goods, dairy and prepared meals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Contactless grocery store <a href="https://www.nourishandbloommarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nourish + Bloom Market</a> opened to the public Friday in Trilith’s Town Centre retail district in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Husband-and-wife entrepreneurs Jamie and Jilea Hemmings started the grocery store and bistro to offer over 1,000 locally sourced, healthy food products, including produce, meats, baked goods, dairy and prepared meals.</p>
<p>The Hemmings began their startup journey years ago when their oldest child was diagnosed with autism at age two. Jilea Hemmings explained that while researching the role that diet played in autism, they started a food company to take child favorites and give them a healthier spin.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260467" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When their family moved to Atlanta two years ago, they again found themselves in a situation of finding healthy foods, and decided to leverage their food and tech background into building Nourish + Bloom with a team of employees.</p>
<p>“We thought of the idea a year ago, during the pandemic, to provide a solution for customers where they wouldn’t have to wait in line or touch anything while checking out,” Jamie Hemmings told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Market users download the app and enter their payment information. When they are in the store, they scan a code at the turnstile, and that creates the digital cart. The user can walk through the store, and a combination of 30 cameras and weighted shelves monitor and track that person’s shopping. When the user leaves the store, their payment method is charged, and they receive a receipt on the app.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0_56KApryI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bistro is open for breakfast and has an all-day menu of food and drinks inspired by the Hemmings’ Caribbean and New York origins. And even though the experience is frictionless, Jamie Hemmings said there are staff members to assist shoppers.</p>
<p>In addition to shopping inside the store, people who are within three miles of Nourish + Bloom can utilize the market’s delivery robots that are temperature controlled. The user reads off their order number and the hatch opens up for them to access their purchase.</p>
<p>Prior to opening today, the market was in beta testing for two months. Autonomous grocery stores are more popular in other countries, but are gaining traction, putting Nourish + Bloom up there with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/amazon-opens-its-first-cashierless-grocery-store/">Amazon Go</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/7-eleven-is-the-next-retailer-to-test-cashierless-stores/">7-Eleven</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/walmart-partners-with-self-driving-startup-nuro-to-test-autonomous-grocery-delivery-in-houston/">Walmart</a>, which is tapping autonomous robots for delivery. Other companies, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/look-out-amazon-go-a-lisbon-startup-plans-to-offer-autonomous-stores-to-other-retailers/">Sensei</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/autonomous-retail/">Standard Cognition</a>, <a href="https://www.getzippin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zippin</a>, <a href="https://grabango.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grabango</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/aifi-emerges-from-stealth-with-its-own-take-on-cashier-free-retail-similar-to-amazon-go/">AiFi</a> and <a href="https://www.trigo.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trigo</a>, are all creating cashierless technologies.</p>
<p>“Big players are still trying to perfect this, and here are these two motivated entrepreneurs whom we have watched work on this for the last year,” Rob Parker, president of Trilith, said. “They have now accomplished it and are set to scale it.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hemmings’ company is in the midst of raising capital to expand Nourish + Bloom across the U.S. Within the next six months, they will be scouting their next location in Atlanta and also looking in Florida and Texas. Its foundation is also working with companies, like Microsoft, on creating STEM and mentorship programs for underserved populations.</p>

<p>“Companies from all sectors are welcome &#8211; but they must have business experience, be registered in a European country and active in two European countries, and have a solid financial foundation and regular income,” <a href="https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/About-us/News/News-Details_688192.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> KfW.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-previ-073b7a11?originalSubdomain=fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Previ</a>, the managing director of Chapter54, told TechCrunch that startups will be taken through several preparation stages, including mentorship programs with founders running successful enterprises across the continent, and with C-suite tech or startup executives.</p>
<p>“We have a very good knowledge of the European tech ecosystem because we are one of the most prominent investors in European tech. We are now a major investor in African tech, and we have the capacity to run innovative projects through Partech Shaker… From KfW’s view, we were a good player to run this acceleration program,” said Previ.</p>
<p>Chapter54 will match mentors with startups based on their business models, conduct webinars with different speakers and review startups’ operation roadmaps “to check if what they have designed is consistent with the reality on the ground.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Previ said that during these sessions, they will “check that the participating companies have the right level of knowledge of what it means to run a tech business in Africa, and have what it takes to hire tech people.”</p>
<p>“We are going to have a session where we will compare the gig economies in Europe and Africa, and another where we will help them do a B2C market sizing in Africa (which is not similar to Europe).”</p>
<p>“If you want to enter Africa, you have to do it properly, and as per legal requirements. You have to tweak the way you work. We are going to help them to reinvent the way they operate their businesses (to enter African markets).”</p>
<p>Chapter54 is targeting startups in growth stage with some sizable traction in the countries they operate in across Europe.</p>
<p>Partech has 15 investments in nine countries across Africa, including Wave; a U.S. and Senegal-based mobile money service provider, Tugende; a Ugandan mobility-tech company; and Trade Depot, a Nigeria and U.S.-based company that connects consumer goods brands to retailers.</p>
<p>Africa&#8217;s growing young and tech-savvy population, deepening internet penetration, developing digital infrastructure and fast uptake of modern technologies by its people has made the continent the next growth frontier. KfW said it is supporting Chapter54 to promote growth and create jobs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Israeli VC scene seems to be on a bit of a New Year roll. Hot on the heels of the news that Viola Ventures, an Israeli VC, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/israels-viola-ventures-hits-250m-for-its-new-fund-appoints-yael-alroy-as-partner/">closed</a> its sixth fund of $250 million comes news from  <a href="https://entreecap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entrée Capital</a>, another firm in the country, that has closed its fourth Israel-focused early-stage fund and its second Israel-focused early growth fund. The new funds total $300 million in new commitments, bringing Entrée Capital’s total assets under management to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Entrée says the new funds will invest primarily in the areas of deep tech, fintech, SaaS, web3 (crypto/blockchain), data/cloud Infrastructure and DevOps, as well as consumer and food tech opportunities.</p>
<p>It aims to target deals of $500,000 to $6 million, focusing primarily on Series A and B, with investments of $5 million to $15 million. This will allow it to both join and lead deals, said the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260601" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In internal moves, existing team member Adi Gozes became a partner. A former member of the 8200 Elite Intelligence unit, Adi is a former product manager and startup co-founder.</p>
<p>“We could not have found a better fit to join the partnership. Adi is passionate, empathic, has technical and founder experience, and has contributed to the firm immensely since she joined the firm,” said Avi Eyal, Entrée Capital’s co-founder and general partner.</p>
<p>Since 2011, Entrée Capital’s Israel Funds have invested in monday.com, Riskified, Rapyd, Breezometer, Identiq, Classiq, Cazoo, Glovo, Gusto, Coupang and more. To date it’s had 27 exits and IPOs and 15 unicorns.</p>
<p>“Believing in people who want to change the world is in our DNA, and as serial entrepreneurs ourselves, we know the importance of taking the first steps with world-changing founders. With companies like monday.com, Riskified, Breezometer, Classiq, and others, we have been fortunate and proud to be invested from the pre-seed stage, providing initial capital and support and then following the early investments through multiple rounds as the companies have grown,” added Eyal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s chief privacy and data protection regulator has urged EU policymakers to strengthen proposed &#8216;transparency&#8217; rules for political ads &#8212; calling instead for meaningful limits that would fully ban microtargeting for political purposes.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal to regulate political ads, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/">last fall</a>, fell very far short of that &#8212; offering what this publication characterized at the time as a very &#8220;tepid&#8221; set of political ads transparency rules, riddled with loopholes which election fiddlers and propaganda muck-spreaders would find all too easy to exploit.</p>
<p>It seems the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiórowski, takes a similar view, recommending in an <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edps_opinion_political_ads_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinion (PDF)</a> yesterday &#8212; after the usual courtesies welcoming the &#8220;overarching aims&#8221; of the Commission proposal &#8212; that the regulation needs to be strengthened and that it should include &#8220;a full ban on microtargeting for political purposes&#8221;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260565" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Political communication is essential for citizens, political parties and candidates in order to fully participate in democratic life. To preserve our democracy, we also need strong rules to combat disinformation, voter manipulation and interferences with our elections. We need to do more if we want to tackle the many risks surrounding the use of targeting and amplification techniques for political purposes,” he said in a statement accompanying his opinion.</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; call for a ban on political microtargeting is not a great surprise as Wiewiórowski has previously called for EU lawmakers to ban behavioral advertising entirely.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/">February last year</a> he warned that transparency measures may not be enough to prevent the myriad manipulative harms linked to microtargeting (such as discrimination; the exploitation of vulnerable or protected people and groups; the amplification of hate and fraud; and election interference, to name a few).</p>
<p>In his opinion on political ads now he argues that the case for a ban here is even stronger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The existing business models behind many online services have contributed to increased political and idealogical polarisation, disinformation and manipulation. Targeted advertising and amplification mechanisms have been instrumental in provoking such harms,&#8221; he argues, adding: &#8220;The EDPS considers his recommendations about online targeted advertising are even more valid in the political context, having in mind its potential negative impact on the integrity of democracy and its representative institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Targeted advertising can be used to unduly influence individuals when it comes to political discourse and democratic electoral processes,&#8221; Wiewiórowski continues. &#8220;While &#8216;traditional&#8217; offline political campaigning intends to influence voters&#8217; behavior via message that are generally available and retrievable (verifiable), the targeted advertising makes it possible to target individual voters as well as group with tailored messages, specific to the particular needs, interests and values of the target audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS concurs with the Commission&#8217;s conclusion that such practices have specific detrimental effects on citizens&#8217; fundamental rights and freedoms, including their freedoms of opinion and of information, to make political decisions and exercise their voting rights. Moreover, he is convinced that they present increasing risks not only for the fundamental rights of individuals, but also for society as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on to warn that use of personal data allows for different groups of voters or individuals to be segmented and &#8220;characteristics or vulnerabilities exploited&#8221; &#8212; such as by serving an ad at a particular moment in time or a place when a person or group may be more sensitive to the messaging.</p>
<p>And of course democratic accountability and oversight over political messaging when, in the case of ads delivered via microtargeting platforms like Facebook, there may be <em>literally hundreds of thousands</em> (or more) permutations of marketing, tweaked and tailored to specific individuals, is simply not realistic.</p>
<p>To be clear, when the EDPS talks about targeted ads, he&#8217;s specifically concerned about the use of personal data for microtargeting &#8212; and how such data may be analyzed to infer characteristics (or otherwise derive information) about individuals which is then used to selectively target that person with messages judged to be most likely to have the desired impact &#8212; so his call for a ban on political microtargeting is not a call for a blanket ban on being able to target political ads.</p>
<p>(Contextual advertising, for example, which does not rely on processing individuals&#8217; personal data to determine which ad to show &#8212; and where targeting is based on a general location, say, or limited to certain (non-sensitive) search keywords &#8212; seems unlikely to invoke the same suite of concerns.)</p>
<p>As well as calling for a full ban on political microtargeting, the EDPS wants to see further restrictions on the categories of data that can be processed for political targeting under the proposed law.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal did suggest some limits on the personal data that can be used for political targeting &#8212; focused on so called &#8220;special category&#8221; data, which refers to personal data considered the most sensitive (such as health data, political or religious affiliation, ethnic or racial origin, sexuality and so on).</p>
<p>However the EDPS wants the provision strengthened &#8212; pointing out that the Commission&#8217;s suggested limitations include two gaping exceptions which essentially make the claimed limits worthless (as TechCrunch also pointed out in our analysis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/">last year</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS considers that, in practical terms, Article 12 of the Proposal does not appear to offer any additional protection in comparison to existing Union legislation on data protection,&#8221; writes Wiewiórowski in a particularly awkward line of assessment for the Commission.</p>
<p>He goes further, too &#8212; essentially saying it&#8217;s unlikely that political microtargeting that makes use of such sensitive personal data would have a valid legal basis under EU data protection law (so, er, legally you probably can&#8217;t do that anyway) &#8212; with Wiewiórowski pointing out that current cookie consent practices are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/edps-decision-european-parliament-covid-19-test-website/">hardly renowned as paragons of compliance</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>He also highlights &#8220;the growing use of complex and often opaque algorithms&#8221; &#8212; and AI &#8212; being used for ad profiling and targeting, asserting that: &#8220;[I]t is questionable to what extent the consent of the citizen will actually be sufficiently and meaningfully informed&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also adds: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;More fundamentally, however, the EDPS questions whether practices which have been identified by the Proposal of having specific detrimental effects should be allowed at all to take place and whether the individual&#8217;s consent would be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In short, this is a very polite &#8212; but very firm &#8212; slapdown to the Commission&#8217;s whole approach (and its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6118">trumpeting</a> of an &#8220;ambitious&#8221; proposal &#8212; which it claimed last year would usher in &#8220;strict conditions&#8221; and &#8220;secur[e] the use of personal data in context of political targeting, protecting the democratic process&#8221;)<em>. </em></span></p>
<p>In essence, the bloc&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor is saying the proposal will do none of the things claimed in the Commission&#8217;s PR.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>The Commission was contacted for a response to the EDPS&#8217; opinion. At the time of writing it had not responded &#8212; but we&#8217;ll update this report if we get a comment. <strong>Update: </strong>The Commission did not provide an on the record comment. But in background remarks it defended its approach, arguing that it respects fundamental EU rights to privacy and freedom of expression and preserves plural and open democratic debate by making it easier for people to follow the money funding political messaging.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the EU&#8217;s executive is not a fan banning very much when it comes to problematic digital practices.</p>
<p>A proposal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">regulate AI </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">introduced by the Commission last year did</a> &#8212; unusually &#8212; propose some outright bans on certain use-cases. However <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations/">civil society has warned</a> the text added so many limitations, dilutions and exceptions to the suggested prohibitions it&#8217;s hard to see how they would have a meaningful effect on limiting harms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s AI Act falls far short on protecting fundamental rights, civil society groups warn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations/embed/#?secret=DPSrTP00di" data-secret="DPSrTP00di" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When it comes to microtargeting, the Commission evidently also isn&#8217;t at all keen on a ban.</p>
<p>Indeed, a number of commissioners &#8212; including EVP Margrethe Vestager &#8212; have been straight-up parroting the adtech industry talking points on the topic in recent months (per <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/139843">Politico</a>), seemingly in a bid to influence the European Parliament&#8217;s negotiating position on the legislation to prevent MEPs adding restrictions on adtech business as usual. (Not very successfully, however &#8212; given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/">MEPs just gave a thumbs up to some major limits on tracking ads</a>.)</p>
<p>Tracking industry lobbyists with links to the adtech duopoly &#8212; who of course have the most to lose if surveillance advertising actually gets banned &#8212; have argued that the survival of small businesses is dependent upon Internet users giving up their privacy en masse in order that everyone can be profiled and targeted cheaply enough to spark joy for SMEs&#8217; marketing budgets.</p>
<p>Vestager appears to have made a similar point to a European Parliament committee last November &#8212; apparently favoring transparency and user friendly controls &#8212; aka, exactly the sort of measures adtech lobbyists like to suggest to try to fend off meaningful regulation &#8212; rather than anything more substantial measures. Such as the EDPS&#8217; recommended outright ban.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Still, the Commission as a whole, and Vestager too, evidently sees the need for political ads to have different rules vs commercial marketing &#8212; so at least for there to be a <em>perception</em> that political ads are being dealt with more strictly in the EU.</p>
<p>In practice, though, their proposal looks closer to delivering yet more tedious and exhausting regulatory theatre than meaningful limits on serious harms. EU citizens should not be impressed.</p>
<p>While adtech lobbying to defend privacy-hostile microtargeting continues to try to chainlink the mass tracking, profiling and behavioral targeting of Internet users to the economic survival of SMEs, a YouGov survey earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/french-and-german-smes-oppose-tracking-based-ads-survey-finds/">Euractiv</a>) offers a very different perspective &#8212; finding a majority of French and German SMEs actually oppose microtargeting yet feel they have no choice but to use these ad tools given the market dominance of Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>So not exactly a ringing endorsement of creepy ads from (some) European SMEs.</p>
<p>Vestager &#8212; who remains the bloc&#8217;s competition chief &#8212; has made it clear for years that she&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">not a fan of boosting competition by breaking up Big Tech</a>, which could be one way to ensure SMEs have a better choice of ad tools.</p>
<p>Nor indeed is she a fan of blocking Big Tech M&amp;As which may further entrench  dominance &#8212; preferring behavioral remedies, and/or regulation, rather than stronger intervention to restore competitive balance to tipped markets.</p>
<p>Such as the ten year ban on Google using Fitbit heath data for advertising &#8212; which was one of the &#8220;commitments&#8221; Vestager accepted to waive through that particular acquisition back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">2020</a>.</p>
<p>Adtech has been a particular Vestager blindspot &#8212; as the Commission only opened a formal probe of Google&#8217;s adtech stack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">last summer</a>, lagging way behind complaints and investigations across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>When it comes to Big (ad)Tech&#8217;s market power, the Commission EVP has championed a package of ex ante rules as the best way to clean up abusive practices &#8212; aka the Digital Markets Act, which is fast making its way through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process. Although here too MEPs have found her approach lacking &#8212; since the parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">voted for restrictions on microtargeting to be added into that law</a> too.</p>
<p>The Commission is duty bound to listen to the other EU institutions as it draws up regulatory proposals. So how long it can keep sticking its fingers in its ears on the need to reform adtech is an interesting question to ponder.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company designed its product offerings to connect all of the moving pieces related to booking residential and commercial service work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six weeks after buying a new refrigerator, Anand Subbaraj found himself on the phone with customer service to address strange noises coming from the appliance. Technicians would arrive only to not have the right parts or know how to fix that particular appliance. It ultimately took six calls to customer service and eight weeks for the refrigerator to get fixed.</p>
<p>That experience got Subbaraj, who spent 14 years at Microsoft helping larger organizations improve their businesses, thinking on how he could apply that to help global brands offer better customer experiences.</p>
<p>“When I looked into it, I found that the experience was not connected at all, and technicians were not empowered to perform their job, nor could provide the on-demand experience because they lacked the tools, solutions and integrations,” he told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2016, he started Seattle-based <a href="https://zuper.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zuper</a>, a provider of productivity tools for intelligent field service management and customer engagement. Today, the company announced $13 million in Series A, led by FUSE, with participation from Sequoia Capital India and existing investors Prime Venture Partners and HubSpot. This latest round gives Zuper $14.1 million in total funding raised to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company designed its product offerings to connect all of the moving pieces related to booking residential and commercial service work: integrations for things like CRM, payroll and APIs, and features including booking tools so the right technician’s skills are tapped and all of the job information is at the technician’s fingertips so they have everything they need, from the beginning, to perform the service. A bonus is the ability to tell customers their technician’s estimated time of arrival.</p>
<p>All of this was designed so jobs are completed the right way the first time, Subbaraj said. As a result, organizations using Zuper save, on average, at least 20 hours per week, per user and improve customer satisfaction by more than 50%, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding follows explosive growth by Zuper over the past 12 months that included global traction and an annualized recurring revenue growth of seven times year over year. It achieved 140% net revenue retention, onboarded more than 100 new customers across North America, Asia and Europe and tripled the size of its team to 55 employees.</p>
<p>In addition, Zuper added over 250 new features and completed 18 new integrations with organizations, including Salesforce, Oracle Netsuite and QuickBooks. Also in 2021, the company supported more than 3 million work orders and 15 million scheduled hours of work and facilitated over $20 million of transactions through the platform.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fuzey takes in $4.5M to charge up its management tools for service-based businesses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fuzey-takes-in-4-5m-to-charge-up-its-management-tools-for-service-based-businesses/embed/#?secret=K8RswPVAj1" data-secret="K8RswPVAj1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Subbaraj plans to invest the new funding in product leadership innovation in workflows, location intelligence, dispatching, marketing and sales. He also looks to double Zuper’s headcount this year and expand its partner ecosystem.</p>
<p>With over 5 million technicians working in these kinds of service businesses, Subbaraj estimates there is a $1.1 trillion opportunity to inject some technology into this industry. He is not alone in that thinking; for example, we have reported on other companies announcing new venture capital as they develop similar technologies.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fuzey-takes-in-4-5m-to-charge-up-its-management-tools-for-service-based-businesses/">Fuzey</a> raised $4.5 million in seed funding for its “digital one-stop shop” for small businesses and independent contractors, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/puls-technologies-on-demand-home-repair-service/">Puls Technologies </a>raised $15 million for its mobile app connecting tradespeople with on-demand home repair services. There are also larger companies in the space, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/">Jobber</a>, which announced $60 million in funding.</p>
<p>“Since 2020, $420 billion was spent on home improvement and repairs as people spent more time at home, increasing the demand for skilled tradespeople,” Subbaraj said. “This has caused a tailwind for home and commercial services, and multiple players can be here. We are seeing players coming in with different things to offer the right tools.”</p>
<p>Kellan Carter, general partner at FUSE, also said via a written statement that Zuper was bringing digital technology to a field service industry traditionally slow to adopt it.</p>
<p>“The company’s product market fit coupled with a strong executive team has enabled Zuper to become a category-leading field service software provider with global scale, customer-driven growth and a robust ecosystem of partners across the entire service management tech stack,” he added. “We see significant opportunities for Zuper to continue delivering tangible ROI for its customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dublin-based <a href="https://www.exergyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exergyn</a> replaces refrigerants with solid materials, thus reducing the output of greenhouse gases. The technology could be applicable in data centers.</p>
<p>The industrial-grade cleantech company has now raised a $35 million (€30 million) Series A round led by Mercuria, an energy and commodities company, and Lacerta Partners, a family office-backed fund. Also participating was Prague-based private equity and venture capital firm McWin.</p>
<p>Exergyn has a product called a solid-state shape memory alloy (SMA) which it claims could lower carbon emissions in industries such as heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, refrigeration (HVACR), automotive and aerospace. The HVACR industry accounts for more than 10% of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259804" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These SMAs contract and relax as they absorb and release heat, doing away with refrigerants.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montreal Protocol</a>, the number one solution to global warming is to remove gases that have global warming potential.</p>
<p>In terms of competitors, the University of Maryland and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia are looking at the space, but commercial entities operating in the same space are thin. Magnetocaloric is like an expensive cousin of SMA, but it is generally considered too expensive.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A announcement, co-founder and managing director Dr. Kevin O&#8217;Toole said: &#8220;By joining forces with thought leaders such as Mercuria, Lacerta, and McWin, we can expand our offering into multiple new and exciting verticals.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking about the investment, David Haughie, managing director at Mercuria noted: &#8220;Mercuria’s ambition is for these SMAs to negate the need for refrigerants in traditional sectors such as the cooling and refrigeration industry, allowing even more cost-efficient operation, with zero HFC-driven impact on the environment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of the company’s upcoming earnings, Peloton CEO John Foley took a break from a “quiet period” to address a number of reports related to poor device sales. The executive issued a denial that the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-reportedly-pauses-bike-and-treadmill-production-amid-slowed-demand/">halting production across its entire bicycle and treadmill line</a> as demand for the devices has begun to crater amid gym re-openings.</p>
<p>Under the heading, “Rumors that we are halting all production of bikes and Treads are false,” Foley writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e’ve found ourselves in the middle of a once-in-a-hundred year event with the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we anticipated would happen over the course of three years happened in months during 2020, and into 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We worked quickly and diligently to meet the demand head-on at a time when the world really needed us, in large part thanks to how hard you worked every day. We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate statement tied to preliminary earnings, Foley states:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we discussed last quarter, we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook and optimize our costs across the company. This includes gross margin improvements, moving to a more variable cost structure, and identifying reductions in our operating expenses as we build a more focused Peloton moving forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds that the firm expects to share more information around the moves when Peloton reports its earnings on February 8. Those actions included “right-sizing” production, in response to decreased demand &#8212; though the executive was careful to push back on reporting that production on all four of its bicycle/treadmill devices will halt for weeks or months outright.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Foley also acknowledged reports of restructuring and layoffs, following a report from consulting firm McKinsey. “In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull,” he writes. “However, we now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion. And we are still in the process of considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.”</p>
<p>Such reports have been seen as confirmation that Peloton overplayed its hand amid increased adoption during the aforementioned “once-in-a-hundred year event.” The news comes after the company experienced a 76% drop in shares last year, following an astronomical rise in 2020, on the strength of pandemic demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite producing global hits like &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; in 2021, Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth quarter returns</a> show the streaming giant struggling to maintain a lead over its competitors. The company fell short of its projections for new subscribers this quarter, adding 8.3 million as opposed to its projected 8.5 million &#8212; it also projects to add just 2.5 million subscribers in Q1 2022, down from 4 million last year (the company says this is because it has &#8220;a more back-end weighted content slate&#8221; for the quarter). Overall, this year marks a downward trend in subscriber growth &#8212; it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s lowest growth year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/netflix-subscriber-forecast-misses-estimates-sending-stock-down?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2015</a> and about a 50% decrease from its pandemic-inflated 2020 numbers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time &#8212; competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering,&#8221; the company wrote in its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/FINAL-Q4-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to shareholders</a>, admitting that &#8220;competition may be affecting [its] marginal growth some.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Netflix has about 222 million total subscribers, larger conglomerates like Disney (which also owns Hulu and ESPN) have continued to expand at a more aggressive pace. Disney ended 2021 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/disneys-streaming-biz-reorg-includes-an-international-content-hub-plans-to-double-disney-footprint/">179 million total subscribers</a> across Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+, and it plans to double the number of countries that Disney+ is available in by fiscal 2023. Disney also announced the creation of an International Content and Operations group to expand its direct-to-consumer streaming internationally. HBO Max is growing too &#8212; the company said that <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1027633/and-just-like-that-sex-lives-of-college-girls-ratings-hbo-max/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December had been its most-viewed month</a> since the service’s launch in May 2020.</p>

<p>Netflix announced last week that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raised-its-prices-again/">raise subscription prices</a> in the U.S. and Canada, while in India, the platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/struggling-to-win-subscribers-netflix-cuts-prices-in-india/?cx_testId=6&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&amp;cx_artPos=2#cxrecs_s">lowered its prices</a> to try to attract more consumers after six rocky years in the massive entertainment market. Netflix is also experimenting with another new revenue stream: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-three-more-titles-globally-on-ios-and-android/">gaming</a>. The company recently acquired the gaming studio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">Night School</a> and has developed games based on its own IP, like the hit show &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; If this week&#8217;s biggest tech stories tell us anything, it&#8217;s that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">gaming can be very lucrative</a>. As expected, Netflix says it will expand its portfolio of games in 2022.</p>
<p>Another new avenue for Netflix to grow its subscriber base lies in content marketing &#8212; the company launched a website called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/netflix-launches-a-website-dedicated-to-news-about-renewals-exclusive-interviews-and-more/">Tudum</a> last month, hiring entertainment journalists and editors from publications like Allure, Vanity Fair and Bitch Media to share exclusive content about Netflix originals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While global tech and finance leaders have <a href="https://real-leaders.com/billionaire-investor-the-worlds-first-trillionaire-will-be-someone-fighting-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the world’s first trillionaire will be someone tackling climate change and that many climate <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unicorns</a> are on the way, current VC levels are dwarfed by the mind-boggling funding amounts that are needed to give humanity a fighting chance.</p>
<p>As of October, climate-tech startups had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/dealroom-climate-tech-start-ups-have-raised-32-billion-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> over $32 billion in 2021 and, <a href="https://qz.com/2079657/us-climate-startups-got-most-vc-funding-since-paris-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Dealroom and London &amp; Co</a>., U.S. VCs invested nearly $50 billion in climate-tech companies between 2020 and 2021. However, depending on whom you talk to, the climate finance <a href="http://gggi.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mind-the-Gap_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gap</a> currently sits at $2.5 trillion to 4.8 trillion.</p>
<p>To put this gap into perspective, total global VC funding (across all sectors, including climate) in 2021 was at an <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> $643 billion, and most countries in the world, aside from a handful, have a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/HND" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDP</a> under $4 trillion. Additionally, a sharp uptick in the number of climate funds and startups has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/10/31/will-this-generation-of-climate-tech-be-different/?sh=5934f0f34a62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> experts worrying about the potential of a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robday/2021/01/27/were-already-in-the-second-cleantech-bubble/?sh=d94ae797fc2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bubble</a>, and doubters may argue that traditional VC investment strategies are too risky to make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change.</p>
<p>So where precisely do VCs factor into global efforts to address climate change? Indeed, a vast portion of the investments will be allocated toward infrastructure investments, as well as emergency funding, which will not yield venture-like returns. By the same token, new policies and national programs will be spearheaded by governments, and as conditions worsen in certain countries, foreign aid agencies will be crucial players.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we won’t be looking to VCs to write billion-dollar checks, create new policy incentives, or provide shelter and food to populations in need. However, VC funds and their investment strategies and networks have unique features that give them an important position in these global efforts.</p>
<p>Below we outline five key areas where we believe VCs can play a role in addressing climate change:</p>

<h2>Backing and de-risking proven climate technologies</h2>
<p>Venture capital has a vital role to play in de-risking climate technologies, which can help bring costs down, accelerate adoption rates and transform markets to enable a decarbonized future. Any hope of addressing the climate crisis requires helping entrepreneurs to mitigate technology risks and scale their innovations quickly and cost-effectively.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 20, 2022! Today’s theme is <em>more</em>. Sure, the creator economy grew last year, but this year more major platforms are working to help power individual artists. And sure, last year was one of the best for crypto startups, but now even more big companies are getting into the mix. Oh and Peloton is having a terrible day. Let’s talk about it! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260431" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>P.S. Early Stage is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/techcrunch-early-stage-2022-is-back-live-in-san-francisco/">back in San Francisco this year</a>, so <em>see you there!</em></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-reportedly-pauses-bike-and-treadmill-production-amid-slowed-demand/">Peloton reportedly halts production</a>: Remember when you couldn’t buy a Peloton bike because there wasn’t enough supply? The company is having the opposite issue now, with more supply than demand. Shares of the 2019 IPO were down sharply today. It appears clear that the pandemic trade, once a key influencer of corporate value, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/the-pandemic-trade-is-over/">is over</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/twitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature/">Twitter rolls out NFT support</a>: If you’re a member of Twitter’s subscription service, you will soon have the ability to connect a crypto wallet and use an NFT that you own as your profile picture. This is going to make some of you happy and some of you angry. Regardless of what you think of the news, that Twitter took the time to build the feature is indicative of where the market is likely heading this year. Speaking of which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/facebook-and-instagram-may-help-you-create-and-sell-nfts/">Facebook and Instagram are apparently also getting into the NFT game</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/plaid-buys-cognito-to-bolster-its-feature-set-as-it-moves-beyond-simply-connecting-accounts/">Plaid buys Cognito</a>: After the huge Plaid-Visa deal fell through over regulatory hurdles, the fintech API company has been busy. It raised more money, pushed its valuation above $13 billion, and has since been busy building and buying other companies. Today’s news is that the company bought Cognito for around a quarter billion dollars to layer more services atop its core API business.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before the news deluge, a few notes. First, <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> wrote something lovely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/dont-underestimate-first-time-founders/">about first-time founders</a> and how market fetishization of serial founders could be leading to new entrepreneurs not getting their due. Given that a number of recent unicorns were founded by new builders instead of those going around the block for the second, third or 10th time, she may be onto something.</p>
<p>And after dodging drops in startup investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/changes-to-corporate-investing-rules-could-diminish-chinas-resilient-venture-landscape/">the Chinese venture capital market could be facing new stress</a>. Perhaps this time, really, we’ll see the declines that many anticipated.</p>
<p>And now, the newsroll:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/berlins-cherry-ventures-launches-fourth-fund-at-340m-for-early-stage-tech-and-web3/">Cherry Ventures lands $340M</a>: The German venture capital firm with an interest in early-stage tech has new capital for its third fund. It also invests in blockchain tech, Mike Butcher reports. With prior funds, the group put capital into Flink and SellerX, among other startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/2fa-compromise-led-to-34m-crypto-com-hack/">How the Crypto.com hack went down</a>: It turns out it was a 2FA compromise that caused the heavily advertised cryptocurrency firm to lose customer funds and temporarily halt withdrawals. This sort of hack might seem, well, standard at this point in time, but it’s still not? It’s still very bad? And perhaps even surprising given that bitcoin was first discussed back in 2008. I wonder what Matt Damon thinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/tbd-launch/">Sexual health is a growth industry</a>: That’s our lesson from our writeup of TBD Health, which provides “ a fresh new approach with at-home [STI] testing made available for vagina-havers.” It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/25/infinite-revenue-multiples/">reminds me of Juna</a>, which means that the at-home STI testing market has a neat competitive landscape to track.</li>
<li>Remember no-code? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/prophecy-raises-25m-for-its-low-code-data-engineering-platform/">It’s everywhere again</a>. When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/softrs-series-a-is-a-reminder-that-the-no-code-boom-continues/">covered the Softr round the other day</a>, we asked internally what had happened to all the no-code rounds. Well, here they are. Today it’s Prophecy raising $25 million for its “low-code data engineering platform.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/weavits-new-app-wants-to-be-a-shazam-for-your-thoughts/">Shazam for your thoughts</a>: Startup Weavit wants to “offer people a different way to quickly capture their thoughts in a note-taking tool with the press of a button, which are then matched to other content in a broader knowledge base” TechCrunch writes. Does the world need another note-taking tool? Apparently, the answer is yes. I kid, my brain is a colander with extra-large holes; I need all the help I can get.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/codesee-pulls-in-a-7m-secondary-seed-to-build-out-code-visualization-platform/">CodeSee does what it says on the tin</a>: There’s a startup in the market called CodeSee. What does it do? Help you <em>see</em> your <em>code</em>. Hell yeah obvious startup names. In this case, code visualization is the name of the game. Why does that matter? As Ron Miller explains, it helps folks see how code fits together. Given that my C++ never compiled I am not one to talk, but this does seem like a pretty neat idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/south-koreas-agtech-startup-greenlabs-raises-140m-series-c-to-accelerate-global-expansion/">Green Labs raises $140M</a>: Perhaps we need to hire a few agtech reporters. The space really does seem to be heating up. (Just like the planet! Heyo!) The company has now raised a total of $170 million for its digital services for the farming world, including, we write, “an app that aggregates reliable data using AI, giving more than 500,000 farmers insight into crop lifecycle.” Farming is hard, so 1.5 cheers for food growers getting new tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close us out, quantum computing. Very much akin to self-driving cars, quantum computing has always felt a little <em>not quite yet</em>. And yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/terra-quantum-raises-60m-for-its-quantum-as-a-service-platform/">Terra Quantum, a Swiss company, is now offering quantum as a service in the market</a>. Yes, you can access early quantum systems. I suppose our real question is when mainstreamization will occur. Terra, we bet, would answer that with a “soon.”</p>

<p>Whether it’s done informally via a Reddit AMA or a Twitter Space, it’s never a bad idea to directly engage with the people who use your products and services.</p>
<p>Customer personas are useful, but talking to a customer is better if you want to understand what delights them — and what they’re willing to pay for.</p>
<p>With a product advisory council (PAC), early-stage startups can tap into their customers’ hive mind. The benefits are many: PACs can validate everything from marketing campaigns to future product planning.</p>
<p>But to build one, founders must first define clear goals and create value for participants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A major Senate bill that would prevent tech companies from giving preference to their own products and services just passed a significant hurdle in Congress, bringing it one step closer to becoming law.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee voted today on the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992/text"> American Innovation and Choice Online Act,</a> moving the prominent antitrust bill toward a vote before the full Senate. The bill passed its committee vote 16-6 Thursday, with five Republicans joining Senate Democrats to press forward with the legislation.</p>
<p>The bill would prohibit tech platforms from &#8220;favoring their own products or services, disadvantaging rivals, or discriminating among businesses that use their platforms in a manner that would materially harm competition on the platform.&#8221; It would also forbid dominant platforms from preventing interoperability with other services and from leveraging another company&#8217;s data on the platform to compete against them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To accomplish its goals, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would empower antitrust enforcers with &#8220;strong, flexible tools,&#8221; including &#8220;civil penalties, authority to seek broad injunctions, emergency interim relief, and potential forfeiture of executive compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, hailed the legislation as the first major tech competition bill to head toward the Senate floor “since the dawn of the internet.” The bill could still see changes from a handful of amendments that didn&#8217;t impede its progress Thursday but may still impact its final language.</p>
<p>While it still has an uphill slog to make it into a crowded and mostly stalled out legislative agenda, the bill&#8217;s momentum was significant enough to prompt Google and Apple to both weigh in with comments earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day, millions of Americans use online services like Google Search, Maps and Gmail to find new information and get things done,” Alphabet Global Affairs President and Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;&#8230;Legislation being debated in the House and Senate could break these and other popular online services, making them less helpful and less secure, and damaging American competitiveness.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple also sought to intervene,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"> penning a letter</a> to Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, the committee’s ranking Republican Chuck Grassley as well as Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar that subcommittee’s ranking member Mike Lee.</p>
<p>“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Apple Senior Director of Government Affairs Tim Powderly wrote. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”</p>
<p>Both companies argued that the bill along with another piece of legislation, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/">Open App Markets Act</a>, would be a detriment to consumer security. The latter bill would force companies that control operating systems to allow third-party apps and app stores and allow developers to tell consumers where they could find the same software at better prices.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=8EFB46FB-24A6-4BC9-8540-26686F72EF96">group of tech companies</a> that included Yelp, DuckDuckGo, Sonos, Spotify, Proton, Match Group and the startup accelerator Y Combinator along with the venture capital firm Initialized Capital spoke out in favor of the anti-self preferencing legislation earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Findings from the United States and governments around the world reveal the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status in the market to the detriment of competition, consumers, and innovation,&#8221; the companies wrote. &#8220;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&#8230; targets self-preferencing to help restore competition in the digital marketplace and remove barriers for consumers to choose the services they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regulating the tech industry is a rare issue that inspires bipartisan cooperation in Congress — another sign that the tech industry should expect new restrictions on its business, even if those proposals still progress at a crawl.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced by by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and is co-sponsored by Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Kennedy (R-LA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mark Warner (D-VA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Steve Daines (R-MT).</p>
<p>The House version of the bill, led by House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI) and Ranking Member Ken Buck (R-CO), is already out of committee and ready for a vote.</p>
