										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On the heels of Personio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/personio-an-hr-platform-for-smes-raises-270m-on-a-6-3b-valuation-expands-into-workflow-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising a big round yesterday</a>, one of its competitors and another big startup in the area of HR has also picked up some fundning. <a href="https://www.hibob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hibob</a>, a London-based company that targets the mid-market with an all-in-one platform that handles various human resources functions, closed a Series C of $150 million. The funding values the company at around $1.65 billion, according to <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3919534,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked rumors</a> in the market earlier this week, ahead of the company confirming the news today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">General Atlantic led the round, with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Eight Roads and Entrée Capital among the others investing. Hibob last raised money about 10 months ago, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hibob-raises-70m-on-a-500m-valuation-for-its-new-take-on-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70 million round</a> in December 2020 (a round led by SEEK and Israel Growth Partners). Its valuation since then has more than tripled, a mark of how hot the market is for HR right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Hot&#8221; and HR are not two terms you might usually hear in the same sentence. The tasks that comprise human resources &#8212; in Hibob&#8217;s case, tracking attendance, time off, compensation, payroll, benefits and running surveys &#8212; usually seen as some of the more dry, and often overly officious, aspects of working life.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217458" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Covid-19 and pandemic working practices &#8212; where the vast majority of knowledge workers were sent home for the better part of a year or more (and some of us are still here in our kitchens) &#8212; have definitely changed how we interface with work, and so HR systems have suddenly come into their own as a way of tracking things, and even helping us all stay connected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hibob, which sells its platform as &#8220;Bob&#8221;, says that the last year has seen triple-digit growth in revenues, and it&#8217;s opportunity has been to present its product &#8212; which also offers collaboration and other tools &#8212; as a modern take on what HR can be to a company.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">“Our mission is to modernize HR technology,” Ronni Zehavi, Hibob’s CEO, who co-founded the company with Israel David, told me last December. “We are a people management platform for how people work today. Whether that’s remotely or physically collaborative, our customers face challenges with work. We believe that the HR platforms of the future will not be clunky systems, annoying, giant platforms. We believe it should be different. We are a system of engagement rather than record.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the company&#8217;s roots are in Israel, its modern HQ is in London with another office in New York. It has 1,500 mid-sized customers operating in 134 countries, but right now it says that some 65% those customers &#8212; which include the likes of Ebury Partners Ltd., G.Network, Revolut, and Cazoo &#8212; are in the U.K. and other European markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The funding will be used in part in an effort to tap more growth internationally to complement that existing base.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The last several years have seen a turn in HR tech that mirrors that of all enterprise IT: the explosion of funding available to startups has bred a plethora of point-solution specialists addressing singular aspects of the larger HR process, whether it is payroll, or benefits, or hiring and onboarding, or surveys and employee satisfaction, or training, or recruiting. However, the bigger gravitational pull of technology seems to always bring us back to the concept of larger platforms, which are in their own way easier to run and potentially less expensive overall. In HR, those targeting smaller and mid-sized customers like Hibob or Personio also have a precedent in the form of Workday (and more historically companies like SAP).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Personio is an interesting company to consider in comparison to Hibob: it is bigger but also has smaller businesses in its mix of customers. When it announced its funding yesterday at a $6.3 billion valuation, it noted that its next steps would be into wider workflow automation, bringing more of the data you capture in HR systems (and specifically Personio&#8217;s HR systems) into other applications in a more efficient way. It will be interesting to see whether Hibob takes a similar route, or if not, how it chooses to evolve its own platform over time. HR, being focused on people management, is in a way is at the heart of how a company runs its whole business, so there are a lot of routes it can take.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Hibob</span> has created a solution that serves and anticipates the needs of modern, evolving businesses,” said Anton Levy, co-president, MD and global head of tech at General Atlantic, in a statement. “We have tracked the company for years, and positive customer feedback further validates that <span class="il">Hibob</span>’s platform has become a mission-critical component of HR tech stacks. <span class="il">Hibob</span> will mark our sixth investment in an Israel-based company in under two years, signifying our strong conviction in the country’s market. We look forward to supporting the business’ global growth as it redefines employee engagement and HR technology.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em><strong>Update:</strong> The round in question was $135 million, not $100 million as originally noted. I apologize for the mistake!</em></p>
<p>What do you call AI these days? ML in a suit.</p>
<p>ML, or machine learning, is a big market today. That is thanks to modern corporations accreting data like hoarders and data science maturing as a work category. Evidence of the former can be found in the growth posted by Databricks in recent quarters, and the latter by just how much cash Big Tech companies are willing to drop on ML-focused roles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217106" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The market that <a href="https://wandb.ai/site">Weights &amp; Biases</a> plays in, then, is active these days. That makes it not a huge surprise that the startup just raised more than $135 million in a supersized Series C. The company is now worth around $1 billion, it said in a release. Felicis, Insight Partners, Bond and Coatue contributed to the deal.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://carta.com/data-desk/#interactive-data">to Carta data</a>, data and analytics-focused Series C rounds since the start of 2020 have median values of $43.75 million, and median resulting valuations (post-money) of around $416 million. That makes this round effectively a double-up on what we might expect the company to raise, given historical data.</p>
<p>In product terms, Weights &amp; Biases plays in the &#8220;MLOps&#8221; space, or the machine learning operations market. MLOps is analogous to DevOps, naturally, despite being a newer category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217385" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217385" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2217385 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="174" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5efd7117-1.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217385" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weights &amp; Biases. The product in question.</p></div></p>
<p>According to Weights &amp; Biases co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/l2k">Lukas Biewald</a>, the software world has a set of tools built for developers to write and deploy code well. This could include a git-style service (<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, etc.), monitoring (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/devops/devops-tools/devops-monitoring">Atlassian</a>, <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/solutions/devops/">Datadog</a>, etc.), and the like.</p>
<p>His company&#8217;s goal, he explained, is to build a similar stack of services for the ML world. And today, he explained, many ML teams are working with ad-hoc tooling or simply without software assistance.</p>
<p>The need for such a stack could be stark. A difference between the development and the ML world, according to Biewald, is that while code crashes when it fails, ML work can &#8220;behave badly&#8221; in more subtle ways.</p>
<p>Enter Weights &amp; Biases, naturally. The startup&#8217;s product life started with experiment tracking, which Biewald likened to code versioning in the DevOps stack. Git, he explained, while great for versioning code that humans write, is somewhat poor at handling different versions of computer-generated code, like that which comes from machine learning work. That&#8217;s the sort of issue that Weights &amp; Biases wants to take on.</p>
<p>The effort is certainly attracting investor attention. Felicis investor Aydin Senkut told TechCrunch that he&#8217;d had his eye on Weights &amp; Biases for some time, but that other investors wound up leading its preceding two rounds. This time &#8217;round, Senkut got into the cap table by pre-empting the company. Per Biewald, Weights &amp; Biases would have raised a similar round, albeit later, if Felicis hadn&#8217;t led the charge.</p>
<p>TechCrunch dug into the startup&#8217;s pricing scheme prior to chatting with the company. Its price list looked inexpensive compared to the productivity that Weights &amp; Biases appears intent on delivering as its builds out its service. Note that this is not a compliment per se; underpricing is a way to transfer value from the company &#8212; and investors &#8212; to customers in the near term.</p>
<p>Biewald said that Weights &amp; Biases is pricing its service so that it is easy for anyone to access. Senkut added that amid customer checks executed by Felicis during its diligence for the investment, clients said that the startup was underpricing its service by a factor of three.</p>
<p>The investor added that he was excited by the prospect as other companies like Shopify had pursued similarly long-term greed over near-term incomes.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am intrigued by what Weights &amp; Biases seems to want to build. Let&#8217;s see how far a nine-figure check that came early can get the company. The next time we talk, it will be time to home in on growth metrics more precisely and check in on the margin impacts of its free service (unless, of course, it sticks that particular item in its sales and marketing expense line item).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://nexla.com/">Nexla</a>, a company that participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield in New York City in 2017, has been building its data operations startup the old fashioned way. After launching in beta and securing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/nexla-launches-data-operations-platform-with-3-5-million-investment-at-techcrunch-disrupt/">a $3.5 million seed </a>at Battlefield, it has proceeded to build a cash flow positive business. Today with a firm financial foundation in place, the company announced a $12 million Series A.</p>
<p>Industry Ventures led the round with participation from Liberty Global Ventures, Blumberg Capital, Engineering Capital, Storm Ventures, Correlation Ventures and a number of industry angels.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Saket Saurabh says that his company has been building a data platform, and bringing together the integration, preparation and monitoring of data in one place. When he started the company in 2017, he was a bit ahead of the market, but since then the data space, particularly as it relates to machine learning, has been heating up and the company has been seeing traction with customers like DoorDash, Instacart, Poshmark and Freshworks, among others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217415" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Saurabh says that has led to investor interest, and they believed it was the right time to take on additional money. &#8220;The good thing for us is being cash flow positive is that it means that we can control our own destiny as a company, and we thought this was the right time for us to pick up capital and speed things up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that in spite of an initial pandemic slow-down last year, most of the company&#8217;s customers have seen an increase in the need for a platform like Nexla to deal with growing amounts of business data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data is essential for most businesses we work with, and I think we saw more demand [after the initial stages of the pandemic]. So for example, companies like Instacart and DoorDash certainly saw an increase in demand, and that means that they need more technology and more solutions.That certainly played a factor in our growth,&#8221; Saurabh said.</p>
<p>He adds that his customers are not other startups, but enterprises that need to deal with large amounts of data. &#8220;What benefits us is that enterprise commitment to data and technology has been there and has only grown, the need for acceleration has grown, the need for supporting new business models has grown,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike a lot of startups, that may start in small or medium-sized business, then make the move into the enterprise, Nexla&#8217;s initial customers have been larger companies. The goal with this money is actually to expand the market by offering it to smaller organizations. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just the large companies that need this. More companies are getting there earlier in the cycle. So for us, a large part of the push [moving forward] is bringing this to the masses, bringing it to the companies earlier in the growth cycle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With the new money the company plans to hire more people and reach close to 50 employees by the end of the year. Saurabh believes that being a remote company will help build a more diverse group.&#8221;I think that&#8217;s absolutely important and essential, and the fact that it&#8217;s now possible to hire people remotely, we are already building a pretty diverse, somewhat global team.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the company is building a worldwide team, it has an office presence in San Mateo, California and Saurabh hopes to have a hybrid approach when offices reopen.&#8221;We do find that in early stage small companies, it is extremely valuable and useful for people to have face-to-face time to get to get to know each other and to build trust. So we will continue on this hybrid model, where we&#8217;ll facilitate even for remote team members, opportunities to meet in person whenever it becomes safe for them to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today? Fashion.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> got together to dig into the world of fashion resale and rental. It&#8217;s no small market, giving birth to both public companies, unicorns, and startups. Most recently, well-known fashion rental player Rent the Runway filed to go public, giving us a window in its own numbers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Those figures led us to a few questions about how best to go about making money from clothes in a retail context. From our chat:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selling vs. Renting vs. Reselling: </strong>To start, we wanted to help you group startups into three buckets: those who sell customers to people, those who rent goods to customers, and those who resell pre-owned goods to customers.</li>
<li><strong>Rent the Runway&#8217;s numbers:</strong> We had some issues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">with Rent the Runway&#8217;s business model</a> given that it appears that the company is simply underpricing its clothing items given its cost structure. How Wall Street will price the company, or whether Rent the Runway is hoping to sell to a larger company came into the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Who else should we have an eye on:</strong> To close, Natasha detailed a number of startups including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/queenly-a16z-seed-extension/">Queenly</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/curtsy-a-clothing-resale-app-aimed-at-gen-z-women-raises-11-million-series-a/">Curtsy </a>and Rebag. Oh, and Depop (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/05/get-thrifty-and-your-startup-might-just-acquire-a-generation/">which recently sold to Etsy $1.6 billion</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Startups are tearing up old retail models, which we are here for. We are less here for adjusted EBITDA that reads like magical realism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Visa announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">plans to purchase Plaid for $5.3 billion</a> in January 2020, the deal represented one of the largest acquisitions of a fintech upstart by an incumbent financial powerhouse.</p>
<p>But 12 months, one pandemic and one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">DOJ antitrust lawsuit later</a>, and the credit card network provider decided the “protracted and complex litigation” necessary to consummate the acquisition would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">take too long to combat</a>. The companies abandoned the deal exactly one year after it was announced.</p>
<p>Visa and Plaid might have chosen to go their own ways in the end, but the year wasn’t a total loss for the data connectivity startup: Plaid claims its customer count grew 60% in 2020, and company execs say it has had similar growth so far this year.</p>
<p>“Despite the outcome not being what we predicted when we went in, I think we as a company grew a lot and learned a lot,” <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret">Plaid CEO Zach Perret</a> told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>More important than the continued growth could be its peek into how a company like Visa operates and figuring out what it could emulate as the startup targets global reach through deep connections with financial institutions around the world.</p>
<p>“I think we&#8217;ve benefited from having the opportunity to understand how Visa ran their business at scale. It&#8217;s very rare that one gets a look inside a company that has been operating for as many years as they have in financial services,” he added.</p>
<p>Plaid has been fairly quiet about its future plans in the wake of the failed Visa deal. As the company kicks off <a href="https://plaid.com/events/plaid-forum/">Plaid Forum</a> &#8212; its virtual conference for customers &#8212; this week, however, it&#8217;s also unveiling a suite of new data, connectivity and payments features designed to increase trust, provide better insights and expand where and how financial services are delivered.</p>
<h2>Building consumer trust</h2>
<p>For a company that sells primarily to fintech startups and (increasingly) large financial institutions, Plaid sure does talk a lot about the consumer experience. Despite its B2B focus, consumer safety and trust were topics that repeatedly came up in conversations with Plaid execs over recent weeks.</p>
<p>Perret said that’s a relic of the company’s early days when the founders worked out of a small office off of San Francisco’s Union Square while the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/us/occupy-san-francisco-is-nothing-like-the-old-days.html">Occupy movement was protesting</a> throughout the city, including right across the street from their first headquarters. “The metric I always wanted to move is: I want consumers to be less frustrated with financial services. I want them to dislike the system a little bit less,” he said.</p>
<p>Rather than build a single budgeting or bookkeeping tool, the team set out to create infrastructure that would power thousands of financial products, with the lens that if financial products went digital they would have more impact on more people, ultimately leading to better outcomes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The space industry used to be dominated by a single player: the U.S. government, which contracted out services to a handful of very large aerospace primes and put their tech to use in long-term, centrally managed programs. Things have rapidly evolved since. Due to an explosive technological acceleration and, in part, venture capital and private equity, the U.S. government is one customer among many – but it doesn’t intend on being left behind.</p>
<p>To that end, the U.S. Space Force’s (USSF) SpaceWERX office has entered into a partnership with the eleven-month-old venture capital firm <a href="https://www.embedded.ventures/">Embedded Ventures</a> that’s aimed at building out research and development opportunities that can both grow the domestic space economy and can be used to defend the country’s interests.</p>
<p>This is the first time the USSF has entered into this kind of R&amp;D agreement, called a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), with a VC firm. It’s also yet another sign that the U.S. government is looking to benefit from the practices and funding model of venture capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CRADA’s are traditionally used between the U.S. Department of Defense and startups looking to collaborate with the government. But after a few phone calls between Embedded Ventures and government officials, like Lieutenant Colonel Walter McMillan, “the rest is history,” Embedded’s co-founder Jenna Bryant said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of missed opportunity, on both the side of venture capital and the DOD, that this five-year partnership could help alleviate, Embedded co-founder Jordan Noone told TechCrunch. For one, venture capital can move much more quickly than the public entities can. VCs also have their ears to the ground on new and emerging technologies that defense interests could stand to benefit from.</p>
<p>Startups could benefit from the partnership as well. For many young companies, working with the U.S. government is a complicated, intimidating process, one characterized by long contractual timelines or highly regulated processes. Much of it comes down to education: startups making strategic decisions that will set them up to be eligible for a government contract, and it’s there that a VC firm could help.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s not a lot of positive pressures from the venture capital community to encourage these dual-use tech opportunities,” Noone said. But such opportunities can be lucrative, for those companies willing to overcome the barriers to applying for a contract.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Embedded’s part, they’re far more likely to take a risk on a company if there&#8217;s a probability that there’s a huge customer – the U.S. government – on the other side. Plus, the space technologies that could play a major role, say, twenty years from now will likely be ones that need a public-private partnership, Noone said, similar to how SpaceX was seeded in part by investments from NASA.</p>
<p>“How did we end up in an ecosystem in the venture community where Silicon Valley was birthed making technologies during the Cold War, and now they solely make consumer apps?” Noone said. “What happened in between and how do you steer the ship back where there is a national security relevance to Silicon Valley?”</p>
<p>Embedded and the USSF will meet regularly to talk progress and to set benchmarks along the way. As this is a new type of partnership under the CRADA program, involving no financial exchange between either entity, part of the goal is actually defining what a successful partnership looks like, so it could be replicated in the future. While there&#8217;s no requirement that the two entities co-invest, it may be one result of the collaboration, an Embedded spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“People in industry are always talking about, &#8216;how we can all work together, move at venture pace,&#8217; but no one&#8217;s actually doing it,” Bryant added. “It matters to me that we do something right now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Things were trending toward remote collaboration well before the world ground to a screeching halt under the heels of a global pandemic, but the past year and a half have undoubtedly been a major catalyst for rethinking the way people work. It’s a phenomenon <a href="https://www.flux.ai">Flux</a> has been thinking about for a while now, beginning development in 2019 with a team of employees who worked at places like Apple, Facebook and NASA.</p>
<p>The startup designed a web-based, real-time collaboration tool for electronics design and engineering. Today it’s announcing a $12 million seed raise, led by Outsiders Fund and featuring additional investments from Bain Capital Ventures, 8VC and Liquid2 VC. The funding will go toward expanding Flux’s development team, investing R&amp;D for additional features and increasing its marketing reach.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R63ED-crxXY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Flux cites both the explosion of remote work (which won’t be going away any time soon) and ongoing hardware constraints, such as the chip shortage, as major drivers in the interest surrounding its technology.</p>
<p>“The world has changed dramatically since the first commercial chip developers opened shop in the 1970s and 80s. Today’s chip shortage is just the latest sign of that,” co-founder and CEO Matthias Wagner said in a release tied to the news. “The supply chain challenges we’re seeing now aren’t just a pandemic problem, they stem from decades of inattention to the design process itself. We built Flux to finally address these issues and we feel very fortunate to have found so many incredible investors who share our vision.”</p>

<p>Flux says its technology is supported by “all modern browsers,” requiring no downloads. The system features a simulator, automated part-sourcing and version control. The Community Library, meanwhile, offers access to schematics, models and open source parts — a little bit GitHub, a little bit Makerbot Thingiverse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wagner tells TechCrunch that the company is taking a GitHub-style approach to monetization.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are very inspired by GitHub and how it changed the whole software ecosystem with its open and community-driven repository of reusable code. Similarly, we’re planning on having a freemium SaaS model to make it easy for anyone to get started while also offering teams and organizations the type of features they require. This model enables the hardware community to come together and build and share reusable components like parts, simulator models, and reference schematics that can be forked and improved upon. Of course, engineers will always have control over what they share and publish. As engineers ourselves, we want to empower as many engineers and teams as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to funding, the service is also using the opportunity to launch in beta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freight transportation-focused <a href="https://www.roserocket.com/">Rose Rocket</a> recently raised a $25 million round.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based startup calls the round a Series A, with <a href="https://addition.com/">Addition Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.shine.vc/">Shine Capital</a> leading the deal.</p>
<p>Per venture data <a href="https://carta.com/data-desk/#interactive-data">aggregated by Carta</a>, average logistics-themed Series A rounds since the start of 2020 have sported median cash raises of $8 million and post-money valuations of around $50 million. The Rose Rocket round certainly surpasses its sector median in dollar terms, and we presume if measured by valuation as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217078" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the money side of the Rose Rocket story isn&#8217;t the most interesting thing about the company. Its market is.</p>
<p>The startup is building in the TMS space. What&#8217;s a TMS? A good question, and one that I had to ask while digging into Rose Rocket. TMS stands for <em>transportation management software</em>, which you can think of as a wide array of products that help truckers and brokers and other players in the freight transport game get work done on a digital basis.</p>
<p>Or, as Rose Rocket co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsky/">Justin Sky</a> explained to TechCrunch in an interview, TMS is a somewhat generic moniker that one might compare to ERP (enterprise resource planning). Sky added that he often describes what Rose Rocket is building as a NetSuite for trucking companies.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s trick is, in Sky&#8217;s phrasing, going &#8220;horizontal inside of a vertical.&#8221; By that, the CEO means that Rose Rocket wants to coordinate more than a single part of the larger freight trucking landscape; instead, the company wants to coordinate <em>all</em> players, allowing for a more integrated, less chaotic market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Rose Rocket offers the same software to both freight brokers and trucking companies. If a freight broker sends work to a trucking company and both use the startup&#8217;s software, Sky said that the work can proceed as if each company was reading off the same sheet music. Instead, of say, one of the parties playing a Chopin nocturne while the other plunked out a free jazz solo.</p>
<p>Like many vertically themed software plays, Rose Rocket is taking on other market-focused software providers, but also customers&#8217; use of Excel and manual processes. Trucking as an industry, you won&#8217;t be utterly shocked to learn, is not precisely <em>fully</em> digitized yet. That could provide a large total addressable market (TAM) for Rose Rocket to sell into given how large trucking is as both <a href="https://www.trucking.org/economics-and-industry-data">a business</a> (<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4912/trucking-industry-in-the-us/">and employer</a>).</p>
<p>Results thus far seem promising, with the company claiming that its customer logo count went up by around 9x in the last year. Sure, logo count is far from GAAP, but contracted deal volume also rose by 9x over the same period, so, presumably, the company&#8217;s business is doing numbers.</p>
<p>That Rose Rocket is a Canadian company &#8212; albeit one with U.S. incorporation, essentially a requirement to raise money in North America &#8212; is notable. The Canadian startup market has come a long way since Shopify broke into the larger business consciousness. We should probably pay it more heed.</p>
<p>Per CB Insights data, Canadian startups have raised some $9.3 billion thus far in 2021, through the end of Q3. That figure is more than what the country&#8217;s upstart tech companies managed in 2019 and 2020 <em>combined</em>. The country is also on pace to hit a record number of discrete venture rounds this year. Rose Rocket is therefore part of a growing trend of larger and more frequent startup investment in the country.</p>
<p>More when someone dumps an inevitable $100 million onto Rose Rocket&#8217;s head.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the global race for technical talent, companies are on the hunt for ways to speed up and scale the hiring process to snap up the best candidates before their competitors get to them. Today, a company that has built a solution to help with one aspect of that &#8212; the interviewing process &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding that underscores that demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://karat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karat</a>, which has built what it calls the &#8220;Interviewing Cloud&#8221; &#8212; essentially, an &#8220;interviewing as a service&#8221; platform that provides customers with a way to funnel candidates to Karat&#8217;s team of trained online interviewers, engineers themselves who screen applicants for skills and problem solving abilities as part of the online assessment &#8212; has closed a round of $110 million, a Series C that values the Seattle startup at $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Tiger Global, which also led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/karat-nabs-28m-led-by-tiger-global-to-grow-its-human-powered-online-interview-platform-for-engineering-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$28 million Series B in 2019</a>. Norwest Venture Partners, 8VC, Exor, Base Partners, and Sempervirens Fund &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participated.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217376" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Karat plans to use the funding to continue building more technology and data science into its process &#8212; both to train and guide the interviewers, and to analyse the interviewing process to improve it in the future. Longer term, it might also look to bring in interviewers, skillsets, and data to grow beyond technical hiring. Technical hiring, however, remains a huge market for the startup. Working with companies like Roblox, American Express, Intuit, Compass, and Wayfair, Mohit Bhende, Karat&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said a typical day might see 500 interviews conducted on the platform (not all for one company).</p>
<p>The last time we checked in with Karat, Covid-19 was not even on the horizon &#8212; it was May 2019 &#8212; and so the focus on providing tools to get work done virtually were nice rather than essential in the bigger mix.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Karat&#8217;s position that live, technical interviews were far superior to giving actual tests seemed still to be a subject for debate.</p>
<p>Fast forward seven months and the world has completely changed, and with that so has the world of work. Karat&#8217;s tools have suddenly come into their own as a key way for companies to continue their recruiting activities, and maybe even to do them better than before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company started out sourcing people to conduct interviews by presenting it as a side-gig for working engineers. Now, Bhende says that the volume of interviews is such that those who run them on the platform now use it as their primary source of income, with a number of them making $250,000 annually via Karat. (That is not to say that they are full-time employees of Karat: Bhende confirms that they are all contractors, and all are working in compliance with their local employment laws.)</p>
<p>That shift in who is running the interview process speaks to the bigger challenge with finding people to conduct technical interviews in-house, and the push to recruit more engineers in general. As Bhende describes it, it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s job, not formally at least, in part because engineers are too busy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are not enough engineers in a company to interview engineers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Typically, one of the ways that the interviewing processed has been compressed is to rely on tests, which Karat believes are not an accurate enough way to determine a candidate&#8217;s real-world problem solving skills and ability to collaborate with others. Plus, especially now, &#8220;people crave and want human-to-human interaction,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the human aspect of the service runs strong throughout the platform, what seems to be the lever for how Karat scales is the technology that underpins the platform. Bhende notes that the company trains the people based on the data that it sources from past interviews, which in theory gives it a stronger strike rate for identifying strong candidates. It can be a tricky area, since Karat is essentially at the center of how companies build new strategies and products: recruitment ads, indeed, are often a way that information leaks out about what a company is trying to work on in secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a team of interview scientists trying to identify the perfect candidate interview,&#8221; said Jeffrey Spector the president and other co-founder of Karat. &#8220;We are a competency-driven company and so we are looking for underlying skills and questions that map to the perfect candidate.&#8221; He says these are represented as modules, which Karat might then map to what a specific company is looking for. This is also one way that an interviewer &#8212; who is not employed by the company for whom s/he is doing the interviewing for &#8212; is able to keep a wall around what might be a company&#8217;s confidential or proprietary information, while still determining if a candidate would be a good fit for the role. &#8220;It means we&#8217;re not learning every single thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Karat’s human + technology Interviewing Cloud is the way most companies will hire engineers,” said Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “We know the gap between the supply of engineering talent and demand will continue to widen and are excited to deepen our investment in the category creator and leader.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company now operates 14 locations in a mix of 700-square-foot brick-and-mortar spaces and mobile street carts. Each location hit profitability within two months after opening.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vinay Menda and Issam Freiha are two coffee-obsessed friends who came to New York from Dubai and Lebanon to study at NYU and Columbia, respectively, and started researching the New York coffee scene.</p>
<p>In the U.S, they saw a coffee shop on every corner, but found the experience slow and overpriced: the shops were either a destination place or for buying coffee to brew at home, not a quality “grab and go” kind of operation, Freiha said. They noticed their friends going to different chain coffee shops for convenience or price point, but as college students, they couldn&#8217;t afford daily $6 cappuccinos.</p>
<p>Soon after graduating, they co-founded Reshape, a venture capital fund with $100 million of assets under management. They saw how successful high-growth, mobile-first, food-retail businesses were in Asia and saw an opportunity to replicate that street vending experience in the United States.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There were a lot of cool businesses coming out of Asia and being efficient in real estate, which enables you to cut down and save money on rent and push customers to order ahead,” Menda told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The pair, who have worked together now for about seven years, founded New York-based Blank Street in May 2020 and opened their first mobile coffee cart three months later in Williamsburg in partnership with EV Foods at the Wythe Diner.</p>
<p>Their idea was to shrink their business’ real estate to make it easier to control the location, enable them to have multiple locations in one neighborhood versus one and save money to invest in other places, like lower product prices. They added some technology to improve the consumer ordering experience while also building in quality, speed and convenience.</p>

<p>Today, the company announced a $25 million Series A round, led by General Catalyst and Tiger Global, with additional strategic investors, including Warby Parker founders Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa, Harry’s founder Jeff Raider and Allbirds founder Joey Zwillinger. This latest round adds to $7 million the company raised in seed funding earlier this year.</p>
<p>Youngme Moon, a Harvard Business School professor, Blank Street board member and General Catalyst advisor, said via email that she learned about the company when she saw their mobile coffee carts popping up across the city. She saw the company was “quickly establishing itself as the newest contender in New York’s high-growth specialty coffee race.”</p>
<p>&#8220;While they&#8217;ve quickly created an impressive coffee business, I was drawn to the way the Blank Street founders are reimagining the entire micro-retail experience for urban customers,” Moon added. “Blank Street competes in a crowded, competitive landscape, yet differentiates itself through a unique customer experience by serving a high-quality product through a digitally native, mobile vendor offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company now operates 14 locations across Brooklyn and Manhattan in a mix of 700-square-foot brick-and-mortar spaces and zero emission mobile street carts, serving as a micro-retail marketplace for shops like Parlor Coffee, Gertie bagels, King Street Baking Co. and King David Tacos. Each location hit profitability within two months after opening, Menda said.</p>
<p>“What makes the model work is density,” he added. “To make a difference and impact on the consumer, we plan to have 100 locations by 2022 and enough presence so that people will know the brand.”</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward retail expansion, vendor partners and technology development. Freiha expects to have three to five locations per 20 neighborhoods, each with its own team and resources. Another focus will be on the consumer app for ordering, pick-up and a rewards program.</p>
<p>In addition, the company is now launching its “Powered By Blank Street,” a wholesale partnership agreement for local vendors to sell in new neighborhoods without having to find a storefront, provide their own labor or manage day-to-day operations. King David Tacos is the first to use this new model, which involves its breakfast tacos being sold alongside Blank Street’s coffee and tea.</p>
<p>“We want to offer the same tools to power the experience for other brands, giving them the same infrastructure we have,” Menda said. “Consumers will be able to discover new foods and it is also a great way for vendors to test out new and interesting products and get live feedback.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The entire smartwatch category had a good Q2, as numbers jumped 27% year over year. That, in turn, was up 20% from a year prior, in spite &#8212; or perhaps because of &#8212; COVID-19 concerns. The popularity of these devices are the proverbial rising tide, with most of the big players benefiting from an overall increase in adoption.</p>
<p>But one name continues to loom large in a way seldom seen in a fairly mature category. Last quarter, the Apple Watch’s active user base crossed 100 million,<a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartwatch-market-grows-27-yoy-q2-2021-apple-watch-user-base-crosses-100-million/"> according to Counterpoint Research.</a> The company took three of the top four smartwatch spots globally with the Series 6, SE and Series 3, with Samsung managing to sneak into the No. 3 slot with its latest Galaxy Watch Active.</p>
<p>The company has seen competition on the low end of the market, with an influx of sub-$100 devices, but at the premium and mid-range end, Apple continues to be utterly dominate to such a degree that top competitors like Samsung and Google are teaming up to take it on. So, what do you do when you’re Apple? You tweak. You make the screen a bit bigger, you make the charger a bit faster and, most of all, you don’t really mess with a good thing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217073" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216731" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216731" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2216731 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0330.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216731" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Some of the more outlandish rumors swirling around health-related changes proved wrong, as the company instead opted to focus on making some aesthetic changes to the device. The Series 7 marks one of the biggest changes to the device’s design in several generations, and even that isn’t what one might deem a radical departure. In fact, it’s the sort of thing you can walk around with undetected.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you’re a daily Apple Watch user, you’ll notice the difference on your wrist immediately. The upgrade from Series 6 to Series 7. The larger model (which we’ll be focusing on for the remainder of this review) bumps up from a 1.78-inch screen (measured diagonally, à la a smartphone) to 1.9 inches. That represents a 20% increase over the Series 6 and a 50% increase over the Series 3, which somehow manages to keep sticking around.</p>
<p>It’s not a radical departure, generation over generation. And certainly something like 12% larger buttons on the calculator aren’t enough to sell anyone on an upgrade. The truth is that the nature of wearables generally prohibits designers from making too radical a design change because the product needs to fit on your body. The earliest smartwatches suffered from large designs that prohibited wearability among a wide swath of users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216732" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216732" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2216732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0302.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216732" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Any increase to screen size should be counteracted by a reduction in the surrounding hardware. This is achieved, in part, by a thinning of the bezels, down to 1.7mm. The black border hasn’t gone away entirely here, but it’s noticeably slimmer, even when compared to the Series 6. In spite of this, the company still had to increase the overall size of the case, from 40/44mm to 41/45mm. As someone who’s had some issues with larger smartwatch cases in the past (I’m looking at you, Samsung), I didn’t really notice a difference with the added millimeter here. It feels the same on-wrist and while wearing it to bed. I’m not sure I’ll ever feel fully comfortable wearing a smartwatch to sleep, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Along with the added real estate comes adjustments to the UI that allow for a surprising amount of additional content &#8212; again, when dealing with a sub-two-inch screen, it really becomes a game of millimeters. According to the company, apps like Messages are now capable of fitting in more than 50% additional text than on the Series 6. In other cases, where less content is required, that means two larger font sizes added to the mix, so you get, say, bigger buttons on the passcode screen.</p>
<p>The biggest day to day change, however, is the addition of a full QWERTY keyboard for text input, either by tapping or sliding between letters with QuickPath. I’m surprised at how well both worked on the small screen. As soon as you open up the application, an “Apple Watch Keyboard Input” notification will pop up on your connected iPhone, asking if you’d like to input the text on iOS. In most instances, the answer is probably yes. But it’s nice to have the option if, you’re (gasp) going to be away from your phone for a bit.</p>

<p>The new watch features a thicker display crystal, adding some ruggedness. Watches obviously don’t have as much opportunity to shatter as phones, but I have a bad habit of taking turns a little too tightly and smacking my watch on a door jam. Nothing’s shattered yet, but there have been some close calls. This is also the first watch to add dust proofing to the existing WR50 water resistances. At IP6X, the system is completely dust-tight.</p>
<p>The edges of the display curve a touch more, meeting flush with the case, making a bit more of the display visible when viewed from the side. The new Counter watch face, which stretches the numbers along the border, take advantage of this, while the other two new screens &#8212; Modular Duo and World Time &#8212; use the additional real estate to jam in even more watch complications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216725" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216725" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2216725 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0367.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>One of the upshots of a larger case is the ability to fit in a larger battery. Apple won’t say whether it’s actually increased the capacity here, so we’ll have to wait for the inevitable teardown. It seems likely the company bumped the mAh up a bit, though, in a bid to maintain the same battery life as before. Apple promises 18 hours, and indeed, you should be able to make it through a day no problem, in spite of a larger and significantly brighter (70% when inside, per the company) always-on display.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2216727,2216739,2216733,2216732,2216731,2216730,2216728,2216726,2216725,2216724,2216723,2216721"]</p>
<p>I was hoping the addition of legitimate sleep tracking would have meant a more aggressive approach to battery life, especially as some of the competition are touting multiple days on a single charge. What we do get, at least, is a new USB-C magnetic charger that is 33% faster than the one on the Series 6, giving you an 80% charge in around 45 minutes. What that means in practical terms is a full night’s charge in less than 10 minutes. So if you’re strategic about charging, you can effectively wear it day and night.</p>
<p>The new charger is backward compatible with older Watches, in that it will charge them at their standard speed. In keeping with Apple’s effort to reduce waste, the Series 7 doesn’t ship with a wall adapter, however. But it should work with the USB-C ones you (hopefully) have lying around. The company has some new bands, as well, though the 7 is also, thankfully, compatible with all of the existing ones on Apple’s site.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216739" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2216739 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="696" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg 2392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=768,522 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=680,462 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1044 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1392 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-12-at-10.27.15-AM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The sensors are largely unchanged, and the Series 7 sports the same processor and LTE chip as before. 5G for the Series 8, perhaps? The new colors are nice. Apple sent along the Green Aluminum, which is subtler than I’d anticipated. It’s a dark olive color, which is easily mistaken for a dark gray or black in certain lighting. If you want something that pops a bit more, go with the red or blue.</p>
<p>The Series 7 starts at $399 for the 41mm and $429 for the 45mm. Prices go up accordingly based on band type and finish. If you’ve already got the Series 6, it’s a not a huge upgrade. Assuming yours is still working, maybe wait a year or two to see what Apple has up its sleeve in the future, in terms of health and other features. As is, there are enough bits and bobs to keep Apple at the top of the pack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Advice is not a new concept, but <a href="https://intro.co/">Intro</a> is putting its spin on access to in-demand experts through personalized one-on-one video calls.</p>
<p>The San Francisco company was founded in 2020 by entrepreneur Raad Mobrem, who previously founded Lettuce, an operating system for small businesses that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/08/intuit-buys-lettuce-apps-to-add-inventory-and-order-management-to-quickbooks/">acquired by Intuit in 2014</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216996" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216996" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2216996 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Raad-Mobrem-headshot.color_-e1634062562471.jpg?w=452" alt="Raad Mobrem, Intro" width="452" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216996" class="wp-caption-text">Raad Mobrem, founder of Intro. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intro</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When Mobrem was younger, he had a chance encounter with Kinko’s founder Paul Orfalea and had the opportunity to bend his ear about being an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>“In 15 minutes, I learned more about being an entrepreneur than I could have elsewhere,” Mobrem told TechCrunch. “I left our chat feeling inspired, and as I became an entrepreneur, Paul became a lifelong mentor.”</p>
<p>That conversation gave him the idea for Intro, which has a mission to provide access to people who are great at their craft. Mobrem says most of these people share a common theme: they had access to someone who was also great. If everyone had access to those types of people, they could gain that knowledge and could act on that information.</p>
<p>Users create an account on the Intro app, currently available on iOS, and browse a marketplace of style, wellness, business, home, beauty and astrology experts. The company has already curated an expert list touting stylist Rachel Zoe, interior designer Nate Berkus and dietitian McKel Kooienga.</p>
<p>On the expert side, the app offers a self-service model for scheduling, payments and video calls. The expert can set and modify their own prices, manage availability and decide how many sessions they want to offer and when.</p>
<p>Video sessions, what Mobrem calls “micro consultations,” average 15 minutes to two hours, and can price out from $30 to $200 for a 15-minute session, depending on the experts. Working with a high-caliber interior designer could run thousands of dollars, so to have a quick session on refreshing a room, “the virtual access is quite powerful, and the value is incredible,” he added.</p>
<p>Instead of charging the experts a subscription fee, Intro makes money when they do, taking 30% commission for calls the company brings in or 10% when the expert initiates a call through their booking tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To continue democratizing this kind of access, the company raised a $10 million seed investment led by Andreessen Horowitz. Joining the firm was Seven Seven Six, CAA founder Michael Ovitz, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, 23 &amp; Me CEO Anne Wojcicki, Kevin Durant, Tiffany Haddish and other strategic investors. The latest funding gives the company $12 million in total funding to date.</p>
<p>”The team at Intro is building a beautiful product in the form of a marketplace that is offering a direct line to some of the world’s leading voices and minds,” said Andrew Chen, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a written statement. ”This platform has enormous potential and is well positioned to scale across multiple disciplines. It also creates opportunities for experts and creators to monetize their followers and diversify their revenue stream in an effective way.”</p>
<p>Intro has been in beta mode, but facilitated 500 sessions within its first two months. Mobrem personally called the first customers after their sessions to find out about the experience. Many told him that as the conversations turned into advice, it was “shocking how much they could get done in a short period of time,” he said.</p>
<p>He plans to use the new funding to hire more people and recruit additional experts. The marketplace has about 75 experts so far, and he anticipates adding experts in career and business categories, parenting and everyday advice, like how to buy your first home.</p>
<p>There are other startups going after service-based providers, but Mobrem sees what Intro is doing to be a new industry catalyzed by the global pandemic. He considers telemedicine being the closest competitor to what Intro is doing, similarly driven by the global pandemic, and enabling doctors to be more efficient with their existing patient base while opening their practice up to additional patients, he said.</p>
<p>“Next up, we will be chipping away at our task list,” Mobrem added. “We think we have already built the best product that is easy to use, but we can always improve. We also want to get more experts, which we will do by helping them make more money, which means consumers will ultimately have more access.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company expects to top $1 billion in assets under management in early 2022.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alex Cyriac recalls his mother, who stopped taking medication because she didn’t have enough money for the co-pay. His friend, Shobin Uralil, and his wife had similar medical issues with their first baby.</p>
<p>It was this kind of bonding over personal experiences associated with the costs of healthcare that got Cyriac and Uralil thinking. They recognized health savings accounts as a powerful utility to save on healthcare costs, but thought the way those were run — largely by banks offering the service as an afterthought, according to Cyriac — were not putting the consumer first.</p>
<p>“We saw an opportunity to approach it differently and put the consumer first,” he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217121" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Cyriac and Uralil started <a href="https://livelyme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lively</a> in 2016 to be a modern take on the HSA for employers and individuals. Their early decision to build their own record-keeping technology stack means that the company can make its products free for individuals, who can set up recurring or one-time transactions and also don&#8217;t have to fill out forms for each claim.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217123" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217123" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217123" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png" alt="" width="1024" height="591" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png 1683w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png?resize=1536,886 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lively-investments.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217123" class="wp-caption-text">Lively investments. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lively</p></div></p>
<p>Today, the San Francisco-based company announced an $80 million Series C led by B Capital Group, which included Telstra Ventures and existing investor Costanoa Ventures. The latest funding round brings Lively’s total funding to over $120 million.</p>
<p>The new funding enables the company to build more consumer tools, scale its team and expand its offerings to financial institutions and employers. Lively started out direct-to-consumer and is now pushing into business-to-business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past 18 to 24 months, it built out that focus and saw its users double last year and then more than double this year, Cyriac said. This year, Lively partnered with BMO Harris to be the HSA provider for its members.</p>
<p>Market research firm Devenir showed that in 2020, <a href="https://www.devenir.com/research/2020-midyear-devenir-hsa-research-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSA assets were estimated to be $77.8 billion</a> held in over 30 million accounts, a figure that has doubled in the last three years. Similarly, HSA adoption has propelled Lively to $500 million in assets under management, Cyriac added. That’s after doubling its AUM every 11 months over the past few years. He expects to top $1 billion in assets early in 2022, which he said will make the company the fastest HSA provider to reach that milestone.</p>
<p>With costs rising year over year, there are fewer options for saving for long-term healthcare, and to open and fund an HSA, an individual has to be on a high-deductible health plan. Uralil says the average deductible on all health plans is now greater — <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/enrollment-changes-to-high-definition-health-insurance-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $5,000 per year</a> — than the Internal Revenue Service definition of a high-deductible health plan.</p>
<p>“It’s a function of what is happening in healthcare, consumer-driven health, with more people responsible for the financial aspects of healthcare,” Cyriac said. “Every year, more people are eligible for HSA because of the rising costs and fast adoption of healthcare plans. Lively is providing tools to make more informed decisions on how to spend that money.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Electric mobility startup Swft has raised $10 million in seed funding that it will use to expand its light-duty vehicle offerings, grow its team and scale its inventory management and supply chain systems. The company, which already has a deal to offer its three new e-bikes and new e-moped with Best Buy, is also on the lookout for more retail partnerships.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Swft officially launched in February 2020 as a direct-to-consumer business and developed over the past year within NYC-based venture advisory firm On Spec. It first brought electric hoverboards to market in December, followed by e-bikes and an e-moped in August. Now, as the company establishes itself as a brand, it&#8217;s making quick moves to build out a complete line of personal EVs over the next 18 months, according to David Liniado, co-founder and CEO of Swft and co-founder of On Spec.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The young company joins the multitudes of e-bike manufacturers that are sustaining the increased demand in the industry, with strong competition from established companies like Rad Power Bikes, VanMoof, Cowboy and Aventon. Demand is likely to continue to remain high in the coming years, according to a <a href="https://www.npd.com/news/blog/2021/the-cycling-market-pedals-ahead-in-2021/">report from market research firm NPD,</a> which found that from July 2020 to July 2021, e-bike sales grew 240%, while general cycling equipment grew only 15%. If Swft can navigate global supply chain issues and meet that demand with its low-cost vehicles, it might be able to get a piece of that pie.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216551" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Liniado thinks logistics is where Swft has an edge. The CEO previously served as Cox Automotive&#8217;s VP of new ventures and business development, which is where he got a taste for the freedom micromobility can afford. One of his co-founders, Joey Wahba was formerly the CEO of electronics manufacturing company DGL Group. Combined, the two were able to developed &#8220;a really comprehensive supply chain down to the parts,&#8221; which has allowed Swft to secure at least 90% of its expected product from its vehicle manufacturing partners in China. Liniado says Swft is also on track to have all of its stock touch down on U.S. soil by Christmas, a true holiday miracle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Expanding its lineup to reach more uses cases might help with that. In 2022, the scrappy startup intends to launch a street legal and an off-road e-motorcycle, which will be available for both consumers and commercial delivery partners. Swft also wants to build a low-speed four-wheel vehicle next year, something akin to a two-seat convertible, which Liniado says is currently being tested in the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The last of our expansion plans is the development of a three-wheel vehicle that looks most like a Vanderhall, but with our own proprietary designs, that will be ready for launch in early 2023,&#8221; Liniado told TechCrunch. &#8220;Due to our deep, longstanding relationships with our partners on the supply chain and product development side we&#8217;re really excited about how they&#8217;re all progressing.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Swft&#8217;s supply chain savvy has not only helped the company secure vehicles, but Liniado says it&#8217;s also the reason why the company can provide products at a rather nice price point. The Fleet e-bike, a beach cruiser and the Volt, a steel road bike, are both priced at $999, can hit top speeds of around 20 miles per hour and have a range of 37 and 32 miles, respectively. The heavier-duty, lowrider Zip, complete with fat tires, is priced at $1,399. For comparison, Rad Power Bikes&#8217; newest members cost around<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rad-power-bikes-reveals-more-user-friendly-next-gen-e-bike-radrover-6-plus-for-1999/"> $1,999 for the RadRover 6 Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-plus-electric-commuter-bike">$1,799 for the RadCity 5 Plus</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Our whole mantra with Swft is affordable luxury and bringing electric mobility to the masses,&#8221; said Liniado.</p>
<p>Swft aims to have 10,000 riders in the United States by the end of this year and hopes to be &#8220;many-fold above that&#8221; for next year. To get there, Swft is investing in collabs with fashion brands to get the word out, as well as finding ways to provide potential buyers with ways to test vehicles, from rent-to-own models, more partnerships and pop-up Swft stores in the second half of 2022, according to Liniado.</p>
<p>The company has aggressive plans for the future, says Liniado, so more funding will be needed soon in order to make all these dreams a reality. In the first quarter of next year, Swft aims to raise a Series A between $25 million and $50 million. Its current round of funding comes from strategic angel investors Martin Lauber, managing partner of 19 York, Mark Joseph, CEO of Mobitas Advisor and formerly CEO of Transdev and David Zwick, managing director of RedCap Technologies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[HubSpot made a total of 25 investments through its prior fund and expects to continue at the same pace with the new fund.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three years after its launch, <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot Ventures</a> is back with a $100 million fund, its CRM Platform Fund that will invest in early- and growth-stage technology companies focused on customer-first, business-to-business innovation for scaling organizations.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to help organizations grow better through relationships, access to customers and customer service,” Andrew Lindsay, senior vice president of corporate and business development at HubSpot, told TechCrunch. “We have an opportunity to invest in those to help HubSpot better serve customers.”</p>
<p>The corporate venture capital firm, for customer relationship management platform HubSpot, often invests in companies that are also HubSpot customers and has over 121,000 companies of all sizes and stages using its software that it wants to invest in, he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217223" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest fund follows a $30 million fund that the firm launched with in 2018 that was aimed at providing startups with the financial and educational resources for growth. In 2020, the company also committed $20 million to social impact investments, with its first funding going to the Local Initiatives Support Corporation’s Black Economic Development Fund.</p>
<p>It also partnered with Howard University and donated to create the university’s first Center for Digital Business, where students can receive academic and professional training to help launch careers in business and technology.</p>
<p>This year, HubSpot made 12 investments in fast-growing startups such as Clari, Descript, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/reachdesk-wraps-up-43m-to-expand-its-b2b-gifting-marketplace/">Reachdesk</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/quotapath-raises-21-3m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-help-sales-teams-better-track-commissions/">QuotaPath</a>. It made a total of 25 investments through the prior fund, and Lindsay expects to continue at the same pace with the new fund.</p>
<p>“HubSpot and Clari both work to align teams to drive revenue growth — HubSpot through its powerful CRM platform, and Clari through our purpose-built revenue operations platform,” said Andy Byrne, CEO at Clari, in a written statement. “It’s a natural fit to have the support of a company that shares our commitment to helping customers realize their fullest potential by transforming their revenue operations. We’re excited for what the future holds as we work together to bring revenue operations to every business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2217266" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217266" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2217266" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="293" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg?resize=300,293 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Andrew-Lindsay-HubSpot.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217266" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Lindsay. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> HubSpot Venture</p></div></p>
<p>The firm doesn’t typically lead investments, but participates with top investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Coatue.</p>
<p>The firm has “a strong sense of how we, as a company, work with customers,” Lindsay added. One of the unique aspects of an investment is providing value not available elsewhere on HubSpot’s platform, like insights on how to grow their business, marketing, sales, revenue and operations. In addition, not only are the invested companies often HubSpot customers, the company is in turn often customers of theirs, which means that they have the expertise to provide advice and support growth, he said.</p>
<p>Lindsay is seeing accelerated growth among CRM companies driven by the digital transformation, and HubSpot has been a beneficiary of that. For every dollar invested, the firm is seeing $5 of revenue generated by the ecosystem. He expects that to grow even faster, especially given stats showing the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/605933/worldwide-customer-relationship-management-market-forecast/#:~:text=The%20global%20customer%20relationship%20management,(CAGR)%20of%200.4%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noopener">global CRM industry</a> is poised to be a $43.5 billion market by 2024.</p>
<p>“Venture can be a force multiplier for that growth,” he added. “We are a platform that customers like working with and are easy to partner with. Not all companies are the same. Companies often have to choose their investor, and they are choosing us based on culture and approach.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, TripActions was primarily known for merging many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aspects of corporate trip booking — flights, hotels and rental cars — with expense tracking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Palo Alto-based </span><a href="http://www.tripactions.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TripActions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was among the startups that was hit very hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the global crisis resulted in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its revenue dropping to $0, according to CEO and co-founder Ariel Cohen. In March 2020, the company made headlines for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/tripactions-reportedly-lays-off-hundreds-amid-covid-19-travel-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laying off nearly 300 employees</a> in the face of a slowdown in business related to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at that point that TripActions made the decision to accelerate the timeline for its fintech expense product, TripActions Liquid, which had launched only a month before the pandemic. As the pandemic led to increased digitization across the board, employees were suddenly making spend decisions from outside the office and more merchants were accepting digital payments.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216871" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized quickly that we needed to meet the needs of our customers to manage not only travel spend, but all employee spend of company money,” Cohen told TechCrunch. “We knew that employees were dispersed and that, instead of travel, they would now be expensing home office equipment and virtual software. And so we broadened the types of expenses employees could submit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pivot has proven to be a smart move for the company, which today announced it has raised $275 million in a Series F “growth” funding round at a $7.25 billion valuation. Greenoaks led the financing, which also included “strong participation” from Elad Gil, Base partners and “all key existing financial investors.” Previous backers in the company include Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Zeev Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Group 11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TripActions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed a $155 million Series E investment</a> earlier this year at a valuation of nearly $5 billion. With the latest round, the company has raised a total of $1.3 billion since its 2015 inception &#8212; about $780 million of which was secured during the pandemic.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TripActions raises $155M at $5B valuation as corporate travel recovers from pandemic lows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/embed/#?secret=VydtWOHykY" data-secret="VydtWOHykY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing is notable for a few reasons. For one, it signals an expansion for TripActions from being a primarily “corporate travel” startup to also, more broadly, a spend management company. This means it is in the same category as fast-growing fintechs such as Brex and Ramp. But the biggest difference, in Cohen’s view, is that those two companies “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are disparate from travel” and thus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus more on SMEs while TripActions is more focused on enterprise companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just as TripActions continues to disrupt the corporate travel market, TripActions Liquid is set to replace traditional spend management solutions,” he said. “No other company is able to provide a single, unified T&amp;E [Travel &amp; Expense] solution for enterprise companies on a global scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, TripActions has more than 5,000 customers, including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Crate &amp; Barrel, Wayfair, Pinterest, Lyft, Zoom, Toast, Amplitude, Ancestry, Box, Axios, SXSW, Glassdoor, SurveyMonkey, Lennar and Qualcomm.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216877" style="width: 3001px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216877" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2216877 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg" alt="TripActions" width="2991" height="1862" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg 2991w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=1536,956 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=2048,1275 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-from-iOS-3-1.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2991px) 100vw, 2991px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216877" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TripActions</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Cohen declined to reveal hard revenue figures, he said TripActions has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels in terms of booking volume and revenue. The startup, Cohen added, has more than doubled its aggregate travel budget under management, while expense budget under management grew 1,400% over the same period. And, in the past six months, TripActions Liquid has recorded more than 500% growth in transaction volume and nearly 400% growth in active users. Recent enterprise customer wins include Heineken, Snowflake, Thomson Reuters and Adobe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TripActions presently has 1,500 employees compared to about 800 when it conducted layoffs in March of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital primarily to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double down on TripActions Liquid, its fintech payments and expense management solution, with the goal of expanding more globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also planning a “deeper” investment in Reed &amp; Mackay, an agency that it recently acquired that provides high-end support (including VIP and M&amp;E for TripActions). TripActions is also planning a broader expansion in Europe, which has grown to represent 30% of its business. Specifically, the company intends on adding more than 150 headcount in the United Kingdom, Israel and across Europe this fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to continue to invest in core travel with the goal of becoming “an essential tool for companies as they enter the future of work.” In particular, it will continue to ramp its personal travel booking offering, Lemonade, which Cohen says has grown nearly 10x in booking volume this fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A sea change is underway in the corporate travel and spend industries as companies look for powerful and streamlined travel solutions in the post-pandemic economy,” said Neil Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, in a written statement. “TripActions is rapidly gaining traction among some of the world&#8217;s largest enterprises, and no company is better positioned to lead the way as global travel recovers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investor Elad Gil, who recently raised his own fund, describes TripActions as “an N-of-1 company in a massive TAM.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has executed well and continues to do so, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re starting to see corporate travel snap back, and TripActions is well positioned to capture the opportunity,” Gil wrote via email. “And, new add-on businesses like Liquid are scaling nicely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, he believes the startup offers “lots </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of great features to make the travel experience much better, including clever features around COVID-related trip planning.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dexterity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/dexterity-exits-stealth-with-56-2m-raised-for-its-collaborative-warehouse-robots/">emerged from stealth</a> in July of last year, touting a $56.2 million Series A. The Bay Area-based robotics startup was riding high on increased demand for automation at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year later, the pandemic is, sadly, still here, and investor interest in the company has maintained along with it.</p>
<p>This morning Dexterity announced a $140 million equity funding and debt Series B, led by existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Kleiner Perkins. Obvious Ventures, B37 Ventures and Presidio Ventures also participated in the round, which brings the company’s total funding north of $200 million and sets its valuation at $1.4 billion &#8212; impressive figures for a young company that isn’t yet a household name.</p>
<p>In spite of only coming out of stealth last summer, the company has been working with customers for two years now, moving more than 14 million items in that time, across 50,000+ product SKUs, including, “loosely packed deformable polybags, to delicate hot-dog buns, to floppy tortillas, to poorly sealed cardboard boxes, to bags of earthworms, to trays and crates of consumer food, to even a molten birthday cake.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What separates the company from a lot of the warehouse/fulfillment robotics startups that tend to bubble up is its full-stack take on the category, ranging from hardware and software to deployment, working to actually install those systems in customer warehouses. And unlike companies like Berkshire Grey, Dexterity’s system is designed to integrate into existing warehouses, rather than a full ground up approach.</p>
<p>“Customers in retail, consumer goods manufacturing, and parcel handling need robots to scale quickly in order to manage the ever-increasing volume and variety of packages moving through their distribution centers,” CEO Samir Menon said in a release. “Dexterity is grateful to be at the forefront of delivering intelligent robotic systems in production across existing customer sites with the goal of rapidly transforming their warehouse operations.”</p>
<p>The company says funding will go toward deploying its first thousand robots into the world. Currently its systems are being used in North America and Japan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizations have been using social media monitoring for years to get a better idea of how they are being perceived in the world at large, to pick up on themes or urgent issues relevant to them, and to generally be more responsive in a world that&#8217;s predicated on &#8220;engagement.&#8221; Now a company called Aware, which has built a similar framework aimed at organizations&#8217; internal messaging boards, is announcing some funding &#8212; a sign of the growing interest in applying the same principles in-house.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; based out of Columbus, Ohio &#8212; has raised $60 million in a Series C round of funding. <span class="s3"><span class="s4">Goldman Sachs Asset Management (specifically its growth equity division) led the round, with past backers </span></span>Spring Mountain Capital, Blue Heron Capital, Allos Ventures, Ohio Innovation Fund, JobsOhio, Rev1 Ventures, Draper Triangle Ventures and JumpStart all also participating. The company is not disclosing its valuation but <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/166572-46/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>, which tracked the first close of this round (which was $50 million), put it at $215.50. On a straight-funding track that would put Aware&#8217;s valuation now at about $226 million. (We&#8217;ll update this if we learn more.)</p>
<p>For some more guidance on valuation, Jeff Schumann, Aware&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said that since the company&#8217;s last round &#8212; a Series B of $12 million in 2020 &#8212; growth has been &#8220;exponential&#8221;, with revenue up 175% year on year and more than 300% growth since December.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217357" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Aware plans to use the funding to continue expanding its technology, which today is focused mainly on monitoring text-based conversations on company messaging platforms like Slack, Teams, and Workplace (Facebook&#8217;s enterprise-focused service) for things like legal compliance, confidential information sharing, sentiment, toxic behavior and harassment. Schumann  said the plan is both to extend this to other mediums like video &#8212; Zoom and other videoconferencing tools being so critical these days in the workplace &#8212; as well as to continue enhancing the natural-language and other tools that it has to improve detection and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Aware is playing in an interesting, but often contentious, area of enterprise IT.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you accept that social media platforms have a role to play in making sure their platforms are not used for harassment or other toxic behavior, or for illegal activities, then the same should go for companies and the social media platforms that they use.</p>
<p>Aware already has a lot of huge enterprise customers, including AIG, AstraZeneca, BT Group, Memorial Health, MercadoLibre, Rivian, Sunlife Financial, and Wipro; the average customer has 15,000 users, but some have as many as hundreds of thousands of employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p7">Schumann said that Covid-19 has accelerated the opportunity for his company because of how much more is now being communicated over messaging compared to before the pandemic. He notes that a typical organization of 10,000 might send 180 million messages per year on Slack today, and the largest sends 1 billion &#8212; up between 300% to 1,000% on pre-Covid levels. This means that the only way to track whether anything illegal or toxic or otherwise is being passed around is by using software like Aware&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a unique opportunity here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On the other, conversations on workplace messaging platforms may be &#8220;in the open&#8221; and therefore viewable by all other employees; but a lot of them are often one-to-one, or to a select group of recipients.</p>
<p>In other words, even though it&#8217;s a work platform, it retains a semi-private nature, so it might feel like an intrusion to know that your company is actually &#8220;listening in&#8221; on what you are talking about. If the nature of the conversation is not outright illegal but might be sensitive for other reasons, that could be tough, and it definitely pushes the boundaries on how that information might potentially get used against you.</p>
<p>There have been a number of examples in recent times of how employees have baulked at that practice: a recent one involved <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jz7b/amazon-employee-warns-internal-groups-theyre-being-monitored-for-labor-organizing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon telling employees it was tracking conversations</a> in which workers were talking about labor organizing.</p>
<p>As in that Amazon example, Schumann claims that the company is focused on keeping the information that it tracks anonymized, although it&#8217;s not clear how it could then prompt an action against a specific person who was behaving in a way that violated company policies or legal regulations. In some ways, it feels like the company has changed its tune on this front over time: Aware is actually new branding. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeff_schumann/status/505099979766374401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When the startup first launched</a>, it was called &#8220;Feedcop&#8221;, and then it changed its name to &#8220;Wiretap,&#8221; both of which have&#8230; questionable&#8230; implications as concepts these days.</p>
<p>There are, in any case, a number of data points that support Aware&#8217;s aim of helping to keep conversations healthy by ferreting out the bad stuff. Schumann said on average one of every 190 private messages, and one of every 280 public messages gets flagged as &#8220;negative conversations.&#8221; And one in 149 private messages, and one in 262 public messages share passwords. One in 135 private messages, 1 in 118 public messages share c<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">onfidential data. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Messages in private groups are 135% more likely to be toxic than messages in a public environment; and one-to-one </span>private conversations &#8220;are 250% more likely to be toxic than messages in a public environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Operating on the borders of when it is okay, and when it is not okay, to listen in on conversations is bound to be something that will be a subject for debate for years to come. And it might only ultimately be settled once and for all in a legal setting. So for now, Aware&#8217;s services, and their takeup, will continue to interest customers, and investors.</p>
<p>“At Goldman Sachs, we believe in the transformative power of technology and see potential in Aware’s ability to connect fragmented data that exists within organizations across many sectors,” said David Campbell, an MD at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a statement. “The Aware team addresses information management, data protection and organizational insights at scale through their feature-rich platform that can satisfy the most demanding global enterprises, yet is simple enough to serve the mid-market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emerging out of Singapore as primarily a “company builder” in 2017, <a href="https://www.antler.co/">Antler</a> made its name as a runner of a global startup generator program and investing from a very early, pre-seed stage. It tended to throw teams together, mix in a tech stack and spit out startups at a prodigious rate. But things have progressed quickly from that base and Antler is now aiming to invest all the way from early to late-stage.</p>
<p>Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/company-builder-antler-passes-75m-raised-after-investment-from-schroders-and-ferd/">raised</a> $75M after an investment from Schroders and Ferd. It’s now saying it’s raised a further $225 million more since last year.</p>
<p>A spokesman clarified: &#8220;The previous cumulative total was 75 million across the board and now this is 300 million, across the board as well. So since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/company-builder-antler-passes-75m-raised-after-investment-from-schroders-and-ferd/">last update</a> there has been $225 million more [raised].&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He added that this figure hadn&#8217;t been previously disclosed: &#8220;Antler&#8217;s fund is not &#8216;sequential&#8217; like a lot of funds. They&#8217;re not raising one main &#8216;fund after fund after fund&#8217;, nor are they doing one fund plus a &#8216;sidecar&#8217; or something like that. They have multiple funds operational at any one time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>But, the devil is in the detail.</p>
<p>Because Antler has funding pots in all its various company-builder locations, that amount is spread fairly widely, and, if you wanted to be slightly skeptical, thinly. (It operates across Europe, Asia-Pacific (APAC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southeast Asia, Africa (Kenya) and has offices in London, New York, Singapore, and Sydney, among others. Afterall, some VC spread £225m across just one country like the UK, not the whole planet.</p>
<p>So despite releasing today that it’s raised “$300m to date”, that is only accurate up to a point, especially when you consider it was founded in 2017, so $300m in five years is not quite so significant in VC terms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors in the fund include Schroders, Vækstfonden, and Phoenix Group. </p>
<p>Antler is still concentrating on the pre-seed stage, but given the extra $225m, it says it can now offer its portfolio companies follow-on capital as they grow and scale, up to Series C.</p>
<p>In a statement, Magnus Grimeland, CEO and Founder of Antler, said: “We continue to provide support for our founders from the earliest stages, and are thrilled to be able to continue investing in them as they grow. We look forward to backing even more entrepreneurs that are redefining industries in the future.”</p>
<p>The firm is also announcing the recruitment of new partners Naman Budhdeo, Erik Jonsson, Jiho Kang, and Subir Lohani to lead its new Canada, Vietnam, Korea, and Indonesia teams respectively. Teddy Himler from SoftBank also joins as a Partner of the later-stage investment team.</p>
<p>Antler has invested in over 350 companies globally across over 30 different industries since 2018. It says that of these companies, 40% have at least one female co-founder, with 70 nationalities represented. </p>
<p>But back to those terms. Antler says it can back a startup all the way to Series C. This would depend, of course, on the terms of each deal and whether Antler had managed to follow-on with funding all the way through the life-cycle of a startup. That&#8217;s why the terms of its deals may come under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Antler’s growth has not come without cost. TechCrunch has heard from several sources that Antler’s terms for startups have been less than “founder-friendly”. I put that to CEO Grimeland to get his reaction. He admitted that this might have been the case “in the early days”.</p>
<p>He said: “I think in general we get very good feedback on our founder terms. Where we have gotten the feedback you refer to we actually made changes. We want to ensure that we are as founder-friendly as we can be, while at the same time having strong protection. I think we&#8217;re very competitive in all the markets that we&#8217;re in.”</p>
<p>Grimeland claims that because it operates in so many jurisdictions the legal framework can be quite different across territories: He told me one of the things they realized early on is that what might be common for founder terms in the US might “feel absurd” when applied to a totally different country: “In which case we actually worked with the local Angel community, to update our terms. They are very competitive and in line with what other early-stage VCs and Angels would want to see in the contract.”</p>
<p>Whatever the case, but growing at such a fast pace and spreading itself so globally, Antler is positioning itself as a potential future challenger to the likes of Y-Combinator and Entrepreneur First, which will make for an interesting story to watch in the years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance continues to be a major theme in the world of fintech, with a wide swathe of new financial services companies tapping APIs built by others to power payments and other financial transactions, and more. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.globalprocessing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Processing Services</a> &#8212; one of the big players in the building and operating of those APIs &#8212; has <a href="https://www.globalprocessing.com/gps-announces-significant-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secured</a> a huge round of funding, $300 million, which it will be using to continue expanding its business globally. London-based GPS (as it is known) already works with a lot of big names in some 48 countries &#8212; its customers include Revolut, Curve, Starling Bank, Zilch, WeLab Bank and Paidy &#8212; and has processed some 1.3 billion transactions on its platform since 2007. Now it will be looking to double down both on expanding its platform, and its geographical footprint.</p>
<p>The money is coming in the form of an investment from two big VC/PE firms, Advent International and Viking Global Investors, who together will now have a controlling stake in the company. GPS is not disclosing valuation &#8212; we have asked and will update if we learn more. It notes that Visa, which made a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201019005268/en/Global-Processing-Services-Continues-International-Growth-with-Visa-Investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in October 2020</a>, remains involved.</p>
<p>The deal will give GPS not just a cash infusion but a pair of partners that will help with making more strategic inroads into other markets, and potentially to bring in more technology to is platform. “We are delighted to partner with Advent and Viking, with their deep experience and track record in payments and fintech, and, who share our bold vision for the next generation of global payments,” said Joanne Dewar, CEO at GPS, in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217360" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is one of the bigger investments made in the area of embedded finance in recent months, but it is by no means the only one. Another big competitor in the same space, Rapyd, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $300 million</a>, back in August of this year. As a point of reference, Rapyd&#8217;s valuation in that round was $8.75 billion. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkout</a> is now valued at some $15 billion; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/railsbank-raises-70m-to-build-out-its-fintech-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railsbank</a> raised a big round also this summer; closing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 million round earlier this year</a>, Stripe (which focuses on payments APIs but continues to diversify into a whole lot more) is currently one of the biggest privately-held tech companies in the world, and there are many more in the mix.</p>
<p>The reason so many of them are doing so well is two-fold: first, there have been an explosion of new, often mobile-first, financial services targeting consumers and businesses with more intuitive experiences, better service, often better rates, and a better range of options to fit how people operate in today&#8217;s world. Second, many of the core financial services that run in these new brands are commoditized and actually very difficult to build. That&#8217;s given rise to a pool of fintechs that have done the hard work and now power these services for multiple customers by way of APIs. In theory, both the brand and the embedded finance tech provide win a little every time a customer transacts.</p>
<p>In the case of GPS, the company has been a decent player in that wider mix. In addition to having a strong list of big-name customers, it has to date issued some 190 million physical and virtual cards, integrated with some 95 issuer partners, gained a very strategic and key partner in the form of Visa, and successfully expanded into Asia Pacific and the Middle East. The latter is significant in itself since so much fintech is regionalized.</p>
<p>So in addition to riding the bigger embedded finance trend, this is likely another reason why it&#8217;s taken on this investment, and investors are interested.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“GPS provides key payments technology infrastructure, enabling the global fintech revolution. Their agile, resilient and modern cloud platform drives some of the most innovative use cases and allows fintechs to globalise through a single API,” said Peter James, director at Advent International, in a statement. “Through their customer-centric innovation, GPS has quietly established a leading position in key markets around the world with an attractive, diversified and global customer base. Together with Viking, we look forward to supporting GPS’ leadership team to expand the business’s product offering and accelerate its international reach.”</p>
