										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based fintech startup Simpl has raised $40 million as it looks to expand its online buy now, pay later service’s offerings in the world’s second-largest market.</p>
<p>Valar Ventures and IA Ventures led the six-year-old startup’s Series B round. LFH Ventures and some existing investors also participated in the round, said the startup, which has raised $83 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="http://getsimpl.com">Simpl</a> partners with popular online brands and offers their customers the ability to make purchases without paying for them at that very moment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the years, additionally, it has also developed a range of offerings including a one-time checkout feature; Bill Box, which allows customers to automate their recurring expense payouts, and splitting a bill in three parts, to build a &#8220;full-stack solution,&#8221; said Nitya Sharma, co-founder and chief executive of Simpl, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Some of Simpl’s partners include telecom network Jio Platforms, food delivery service Zomato, pharmacy 1MG, grocer BigBasket and ticketing platform MakeMyTrip.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later services have existed in India for several years but have started to gain fast traction only in recent quarters as e-commerce and digital payments increase their reach in the country.</p>
<p>One of the factors that is making these services popular among consumers is the trust deficit that exists between them and the services with which they are engaging, said Sharma, pointing to continued popularity of cash as the payment method for e-commerce firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Uber introduced the ability to let users pay driver partners with cash for the first time in its existence months after launching in India.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a service like Simpl, customers know that they don’t have to pay right away and have the ability to dispute transactions and quickly request a refund, he said. The startup uses its own underwriting technology to determine the customers to whom it can offer its services, he said. For brands, too, an easier checkout process means the conversion increases significantly, he added.</p>
<p>“We built a full-stack checkout platform that gives merchants ultimate control of the user experience and helps them build trust with consumers at checkout. Simpl is like a Khata or a Tab for online commerce. This intuitive user experience, built on the bedrock of trust, will enable a larger e-commerce market and will lead to greater adoption of mobile payments in India and the rest of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup said it has grown its monthly active merchants and active user base by 10 times in the past 18 months. Over 7,000 brands now use Simpl, the startup said. It now plans to work on further improving the consumer and merchants experience on its platform and also expand to new areas including bringing Simpl to offline neighborhood stores and building a loyalty program, said Sharma.</p>
<p>“India’s e-commerce market is at an inflection point and we believe Simpl’s solution is a key enabler in accelerating adoption of digital payments in e-commerce” said James Fitzgerald, partner at Valar Ventures, in a statement. “It significantly improves consumer experience, which is why it is quickly becoming a preferred partner for merchants. The team has shown great execution and we are excited to join their mission of democratizing e-commerce for all merchants big and small.”</p>
<p>Pay later fintech players today finance loans worth $500 million each year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent note to clients. They expect the figure to balloon to $26 billion by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual re:Invent conference, AWS today announced two new initiatives for the automotive industry. One is a new product, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-iot-fleetwise-transferring-vehicle-data-cloud/">AWS FleetWise</a>, a new service that makes it easier for automakers to collect and retrieve sensor and telemetry data from their vehicle fleets. The other is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/">AWS Automotive</a>, a broader, industry-specific initiative that brings together a range of the company&#8217;s products under a single umbrella, similar to AWS&#8217;s other industry solutions like AWS for Industrial.</p>
<p>Collecting sensor data isn&#8217;t necessarily a new thing for automakers. But FleetWise promises to provide an end-to-end solution that will give them a lot of flexibility. Maybe they want to smartly filter data right on the car to reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud, or only pull in data from specific sensors like engine temperature, or maybe they do indeed want to get all of the data. It&#8217;s up to the individual auto manufacturer to decide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/features/">what data they need</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Tzamaloukas, AWS&#8217; general manager for AWS Automotive, told me that no matter what data gets used, to get started with FleetWise, the manufacturer has to first describe and model the vehicle and its sensors, using the open source Vehicle Signal Specification that a number of automakers have already adopted.</p>
<p>AWS then provides the automakers with the source code to interact with FleetWise and collect data. The automaker&#8217;s developers can then take this code, modify it as needed and build it into the vehicle gateway, while its engineers can start building data collection campaigns to pull in data from the live vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The possibilities with data collection campaigns are endless and we are pushing the envelope in that data collection campaigns are not just time-based, are not just event-based, but it&#8217;s intelligent data filtering across your entire fleet,&#8221; Tzamaloukas explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we hope to give the automakers the ability to pull in the terabytes of data generated from all kinds of different cars out there, but at a much higher signal-to-noise ratio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tzamaloukas expects that FleetWise will be generally available in 2022 and that we&#8217;ll see cars available for purchase with it built-in around 2024. A lot of this data may stay in the automakers&#8217; back ends, but he noted that they could make some of it available to drivers as well, maybe in the form of more detailed monthly vehicle health reports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for AWS for Automotive, AWS&#8217; Dean Phillips, who heads up this initiative, told me that he sees it as a way to clarify AWS&#8217; capabilities for the industry. &#8220;We&#8217;re pretty excited about AWS for Automotive because it really helps clarify for our customers the different solutions that we have from AWS,&#8221; he said. These solutions include a number of different solutions areas that automakers can adopt as needed, ranging from cutting-edge autonomous mobility services to product engineering support, supply chain tracking and digital customer engagement solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has yet to produce its all-electric Cybertruck, but diehard fans who need to lay their hands on something new and associated with the highly anticipated and delayed vehicle can now buy a cyberwhistle for $50. Yes, a whistle.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday a link to the webpage for his 65.1 million followers to view along with a message &#8220;Blow the whistle on Tesla,&#8221; which may or may not be a nod, a dare or a threat to those former employees who have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp?sref=gni836kR">actually attempted to do just that</a>. He later tweeted, &#8220;Don’t waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clicking <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberwhistle?sku=1715672-00-A">on the link</a>, customers will see this message:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by Cybertruck, the limited-edition Cyberwhistle is a premium collectible made from medical-grade stainless steel with a polished finish. The whistle includes an integrated attachment feature for added versatility.</p>
<p><em>Note: Cyberwhistles are final sale.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>No word on what that integrated attachment reference means, but TechCrunch suspects it might be a lanyard hole so customers can wear this around their neck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As any Tesla aficionado might expect, the cyberwhistle is shaped like the Cybertruck, the all-electric truck that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/behold-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-here/">Musk revealed</a> back in November 2019. The Cybertruck was supposed to go into production in late 2021. The company has pushed that date to sometime in 2022, per its website in which potential customers can put down a $100 refundable deposit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/category/lifestyle">cyberwhistle can be found</a> housed under Tesla&#8217;s lifestyle products, which include items such as the $150 Tesla decanter, the $45 desktop charger modeled after a Tesla Supercharger, the $35 S3XY mug and several die-cast models of vehicles, including the Tesla Semi, which also has pushed the start of production to 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital mortgage lender <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a>, which announced in May that it was going public via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPAC</a>, is getting a cash infusion from its backers sooner than expected. Blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank have decided to amend the terms of their financing agreement to provide Better with half of the $1.5 billion they committed immediately instead of waiting till the deal closes.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the deal who preferred to remain anonymous told TechCrunch that with the new arrangement, capital hits the company’s balance sheet now (faster than originally planned) and puts more money on the balance sheet overall to fuel further growth. Specifically, according to an email from Better CFO Kevin Ryan to the company and obtained by TechCrunch, Better.com will have $1 billion on its balance sheet by week’s end.</p>
<p>In the email, Ryan told employees:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>We pulled forward the funding of our SPAC deal … With this new structure the company will fortify our balance sheet and position us as extremely well capitalized in a tough mortgage market. Surviving is winning and capital ensures survival … By the end of this week we expect to have $1 billion of cash on the company’s balance sheet. Quantum’s more than we have ever had. [sic] We will continue working through the process of public listing but the most important step has been taken (getting the money).</p></blockquote>
<p>The new arrangement will replace the prior agreement wherein $950 million of the $1.78 billion in committed financing from Aurora and SoftBank would have been used to purchase existing shares from Better’s stockholders rather than the company receiving it directly to its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The amended terms will not change Better’s implied valuation of $6.9 billion, the company says.</p>
<p>As for what Better plans to do with the capital, a spokesperson told TechCrunch that the money will help the company double down on existing businesses, continue to build out “a custom-first home purchase experience” and launch new products and services “that make the post-close homeownership experience as amazing as customers deserve it to be.”</p>
<p>Better, which recently added a number of new insurance products, plans to expand its offerings into other product categories, including personal loans, student loans and life insurance.</p>
<p>The company chose to go public via a SPAC rather than taking the traditional IPO route because it preferred the guarantee of execution that SoftBank offered it with the blank-check deal, CEO Vishal Garg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/better-mortgage-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in September</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: The headline and story were updated post-publication to accurately reflect the amount of the cash infusion</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea-based peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform <a href="https://www.peoplefund.co.kr/">PeopleFund</a> announced today it has closed a $63.4 million (75.9 billion won) Series C round led by Bain Capital with participation from Goldman Sachs. Returning investors in the round include <a href="http://www.clsacapital.com/fund-lendingark.html">CLSA Lending Ark Asia</a> and <a href="https://500.co/">500 Global</a>.</p>
<p>The latest funding brings the total raised by PeopleFund to about $83.6 million (100 billion won) since it was founded in 2015.</p>
<p>The Series C will support hiring AI engineers and secure alternative data to advance its credit-scoring algorithm further. PeopleFund also will beef up its machine learning-powered credit scoring system, which is one of its key differentiators, that provides a quantitative scoring model (for credit valuation), a qualitative scoring model and a demand forecasting model (for near-primer borrowers).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>PeopleFund wants to address the structural problem involving the risk of high interest-rate loans in the near-prime loan sector and offer more personalized financial products to subprime and near-prime borrowers with its data-driven technology platform, CEO and founder Joey Kim told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“For the past six years, we have been focusing on proving the performance of our data-driven risk management technology, which is the essence of consumer lending,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Our mission is to grow into the No. 1 player in the Korean non-bank lending market to provide better loan options for average Koreans that the banks underserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financing event comes five months after PeopleFund received its regulatory approval from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) to register with the government.</p>
<p>In early June, only three Korean P2P lenders out of 41 applicants were granted licenses from the FSC to operate the business legally: PeopleFund, Lendit and 8 Percent. The FSC said it will continue to review other applicants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>South Korea has passed the first law in the world dedicated to digital lending, &#8220;The Marketplace Lending Act,&#8221; in August 2020 to regulate marketplace lenders, protecting P2P consumers. The new law enables the licensed P2P lending startup to operate as an authorized financial institution to lend, raise capital from international and domestic institutions, and provide loan referral services to its customers.</p>
<p>The number of marketplace lenders in Korea has fallen from 237 to 102 between August 2020 and May 2021, per PeopleFund&#8217;s annual report in 2020.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240681" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240681" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240681 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg" alt="People Fund" width="1920" height="1105" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=1536,884 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0917.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240681" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PeopleFund</p></div></p>
<p>PeopleFund, which connects borrowers with lenders to enable lending, provides loans at an average interest rate of 11.25% per annum, about 3% to 4% lower than other non-bank lenders. Near-prime borrowers are not qualified for bank loans thus have no choice but to resort to non-bank lenders like credit card loans (or saving banks), Kim said.</p>
<p>What sets PeopleFund apart from other competitors is the lowest delinquency rate in the industry, being managed by its own alternative credit scoring system, and having strong risk management capabilities, Kim said. PeopleFund claims it has managed over $1 billion in loans as of October 2021, with a delinquency rate of 2.06%.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is its credit scoring system optimized for mid-interest loans based on about 480,000 loan customers registered on its platform. PeopleFund built a credit scoring system (CSS) 4.0 for near-prime borrowers to provide more affordable mid-rate loans to borrowers, who use the funds to refinance existing loans taken from other second-tier lenders. The refinancing loans account for 66% of its total loans, he added.</p>

<p>Kim said that its clients include near-prime borrowers and individuals and institutional investors who expect 7%-9% the ROI per annum (before tax). Its lenders are mostly retail customers the company has through its partnership with Kakao Pay.</p>
<p>“For individual and institutional lenders, we offer diversified lending opportunities at an average annual return rate of 6% to 9%. For the borrowers and the lenders, [our] AI-based data-driven underwriting process has been the core of its competitive advantage, which has been outperforming other non-bank players by a 3% to 5% gap in loss rate,” Kim said.</p>
<p>PeopleFund targets the traditional personal credit loans market in South Korea, which is estimated at around $67 billion, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company, which accounted for about 57% of market share in the personal loan of the P2P lending market as of October, expects to generate profit in 2022, Kim said.</p>
<p>“While leading online lenders in the U.S. have grown to be worth billions out of lending platforms such as <a href="https://www.upstart.com/">Upstart</a> and <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a>, Korea’s online lending is only just beginning, said Tim Chae, managing partner of 500 Global that participated in all fundraising since the seed round. “We strongly believe that PeopleFund will grow to become a clear winner with its proven track record, accelerating tech-driven innovations in the non-bank lending sector in Korea.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Investment in fintech is surging back following a brief but notable drop during the COVID pandemic. As a result, countries worldwide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/lessons-we-learned-from-the-last-week-of-fintech-earnings/">are seeing a large influx of capital</a> for fintech ventures, and both investment totals and deal counts in the fintech space are increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Although a large part of fintech funding focuses on countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, smaller countries, particularly in Asia, are making their presence known. This is hardly surprising given that Asia leads the world in fintech adoption rates.</p>
<p>Singapore is one country building a solid reputation as a hub of fintech activity, and this reputation is generating substantial investment.</p>
<h2>Singapore’s fintech investment surges forward</h2>
<p>According to KPMG, total fintech funding worldwide in the first half of 2021 <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/2021/Pulse-of-Fintech-H1-2021.pdf">reached $98 billion</a> from 2,456 deals, rebounding strongly from the COVID-inspired investing dip of 2020.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the U.S. accounted for most of the total investment at $42 billion. However, fintech funding also recovered well in Asia and the EMEA region.</p>
<p>For the first half of 2021, Asian fintech funding activity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">amounted to $7.5 billion</a> despite the lack of any notably large deals. CBInsights estimates that Asian fintech funding in Q3 is strong at nearly $6 billion, trailing only the U.S.</p>
<p>Despite its small size (less than 5 million total population), Singapore is quickly reaching investment levels of countries many times its size. Although the KPMG data shows only $614 million during the first half, the Singapore Monetary Authority&#8217;s chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, suggests a strong surge in the second half, pushing Singapore’s total to $3 billion. Given the record number of deals in the first half of 2021, Mohanty’s optimism seems justified.</p>
<p>Compare Singapore’s total to countries like Canada and the major European countries. In the first half, Canada’s total investment was $4.8 billion, while France and Germany were each in the $2 billion-$2.5 billion range. But these countries are six to 10 times the size of Singapore and have similarly larger GDPs.</p>
<p>Singapore’s investment level is also notable among countries in the Asia Pacific. The two most populated countries, China and India, generated only $1.3 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Australia had less than a billion. Singapore is swinging well above its weight when it comes to fintech investment.</p>
<h2>Fintech adoption drives investment</h2>
<p>Fintech adoption continues to grow rapidly, and the pandemic only provided additional fuel for the fire. Adoption rates in Europe, for example, <a href="https://tokenist.com/will-the-coronavirus-and-working-from-home-accelerate-fintech-adoption/">accelerated by 72%</a> in 2020 alone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Tuesday, November 30, 2021! This is the last newsletter of the month, which means that tomorrow is December. Get ready for the last few weeks of news before the Christmas/holiday news freeze sets into place. There are still a few IPOs to go, so don’t log off yet! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3</span> 4</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/is-nubanks-lower-ipo-pricing-bad-news-for-brazilian-startups/">Nubank cuts IPO price range target:</a></strong> Bellwether Brazilian tech company Nubank has reduced its price range ahead of its public offering. In short, the neobank will sell its shares for less than it expected, lowering the size of its impending capital raise and also cutting its public-market valuation. TechCrunch dug into whether the news matters for Latin American startups more broadly. (More on the company’s economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/">Facebook told to sell Giphy:</a> </strong>Remember when Facebook bought Giphy, the GIF search engine? Well, the Competition and Markets Authority, the U.K.’s competition watchdog, is telling the U.S. social networking giant to reverse that purchase. A rare moment in which a major tech company is told <em>no</em>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/facebooks-top-crypto-executive-david-marcus-is-leaving-the-company/">Also, Facebook’s crypto exec is leaving:</a> </strong>Another Facebook exec is taking off, crypto leader David Marcus. The news comes after “Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer announced he was stepping down from his role after 13 years at the company” this September, TechCrunch notes.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cyber-week-online-spending-down-1-4-to-33-9-billion-as-u-s-consumers-shopped-earlier-this-year/">Digital sales disappoint during shoppy fauxliday:</a> </strong>After disappointing online sales on Black Friday led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/black-friday-data-adds-to-evidence-e-commerce-growth-is-slowing/">TechCrunch to look into e-commerce sales growth more generally</a>, “consumer awareness of supply chain shortages and even earlier deals may have contributed to a slight decline in U.S. e-commerce sales during Cyber Week,” Sarah Perez reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into our daily digest of startup happenings, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/hashicorps-ipo-will-place-it-among-the-most-richly-valued-open-source-tech-companies/">HashiCorp’s IPO is shaping up to be a right corker</a>. The U.S. cloud infra management concern is targeting a pretty high price point for its shares, at least in revenue-multiples terms. Good news for open source startups more generally? We think so. (More on its economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">here</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241006" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/brazilian-workspace-on-demand-marketplace-beerorcoffee-snags-10m/"><strong>BeerOrCoffee raises $10M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Notably BeerOrCoffee is not an artisan, DTC, free-range consumer beverage outfit. Instead, the São Paulo-based startup offers flexible office space. TechCrunch dug into its operations and recent Series A raise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/massive-wants-to-rent-your-spare-compute-power-to-pay-for-apps/"><strong>Money, attention or compute?</strong></a> Massive, a startup, wants to offer the world’s consumers a different way to pay for apps. Not with their currency (subscriptions) or attention (ads), but with their spare compute time. We had questions, but the model sounds pretty neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/fundbox-raises-100m/"><strong>Fundbox shows that SMBs can build unicorns:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Forget the old VC rule that selling to SMBs is bad business. There are just too many successful startups out here looking to sell to small businesses for the old saw to be anything but toothless. Fundbox’s new $1.1 billion valuation is evidence of the fact, with the SMB-focused fintech adding nine figures to its accounts in a single gulp.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/"><strong>The other way to make tech money from trucking:</strong></a> Sure, we read a lot about self-driving semis and how computers will soon drive our big trucks. But, in the meantime, CloudTrucks is raising a treasury to grow its software business aimed at trucking firms that still employ human drivers. The company just closed a massive $115 million Series <em>B</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <em>for</em> startups out there looking to raise, a little venture fund news for your diversion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/sapphire-ventures-secures-largest-capital-raise-to-date-across-two-new-funds/"><strong>Sapphire Ventures raises $2B:</strong></a> For its sixth main fund and third “opportunity “ fund, Sapphire Ventures has banked 10 figures worth of capital. That’s a Smaug-level haul, and indicative, I believe, that I will annoy the firm’s Jai Das at least four times per quarter in 2021 for notes on what he’s seeing in the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/partech-raises-750-million-growth-fund/"><strong>Partech raises $750 million for second growth fund:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Normally a venture capital concern raising hundreds of millions of dollars doesn’t get my pulse up even a single BPM. However, as Partech is based in Paris, I have to admit that I found the news more than a little notable. Recall when Europe’s startup scene was considered an also-ran? That was a while ago now.</li>

<p>Jack Dorsey was Twitter’s first CEO — and also its fourth.</p>
<p>He led the platform from its launch in 2006 until he passed the torch to co-founder Ev Williams two years later. In 2015, Dorsey returned to the role, even though he was simultaneously serving as CEO of fintech platform Square.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,’” he wrote in a letter to employees.</p>
<p>“Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.”</p>
<p>The Equity podcast team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo">discussed his departure in a TechCrunch+ post</a> yesterday afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: A reset would rewrite how VCs and entrepreneurs do business</li>
<li>Amanda Silberling: Founders aren’t rock stars</li>
</ul>
<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news comes in two chunks. There’s the day’s news from huge tech concerns, and then there’s a whole mess of AWS-related news from our enterprise team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations/">European AI regulation may lack teeth:</a> </strong>Per our own Natasha Lomas, a collection of civil society organizations has come to the view that “draft legislation” in Europe “falls far short of protecting fundamental rights from AI-fueled harms like scaled discrimination and blackbox bias.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/stellantis-mercedes-benz-invest-in-solid-state-battery-developer-factorial-energy/"><strong>Mercedes invests in Factorial Energy:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, we could have put this entry in the startup section, but how frequently do we see the parent company of reigning F1 winning champions, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, in our pages? Infrequently. Regardless, Factorial is working on solid state batteries for cars, so you can see why the Silver Arrows corporate family was interested.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/twitter-expands-safety-policy-bans-posting-images-of-people-without-their-consent/"><strong>Twitter cracks down on abusive image/video posting:</strong></a> In <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">baby’s</span> CEO’s first PR crisis, Twitter announced today that it is moving to “ban sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent.” At issue is the fact that some video, well, will never get consent of say, the cops, despite being in the public interest. Twitter noted a public interest nuance, but some folks were still mad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And then, the Amazon/AWS news deluge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Karpenter is a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-launches-karpenter-an-open-source-autoscaler-for-kubernetes-clusters/">new open source autoscaling tool for Kubernetes clusters</a>.”</li>
<li>SageMaker Canvas is a “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-gets-a-no-code-ml-service/">no-code ML service</a>.”</li>
<li>AWS to highlight partners that “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-targets-the-energy-industry-with-launch-of-the-aws-energy-competency-program/">develop specialized solutions aimed at the energy industry</a>.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/awss-analytics-services-go-serverless/">AWS analytics are now serverless</a>.</li>
<li>There’s a new ML chip from Amazon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-introduces-new-trn1-chips-to-speed-up-training-of-machine-learning-models/">the Trn1</a>.</li>
<li>But that’s not all! Amazon’s cloud team also has a new ARM chip called the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/aws-launches-its-graviton-3-processor/">Graviton 3</a>.”</li>
<li>And we have even more from AWS’ big shindig <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2021/">here</a>, if that is your jam!</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps it should be pro forma for corporate boards in search of a new CEO to start by talking to the company’s longtime engineers, product managers and marketing leads.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jack Dorsey was Twitter’s first CEO — and also its fourth.</p>
<p>He led the platform from its launch in 2006 until he passed the torch to co-founder Ev Williams two years later. In 2015, Dorsey returned to the role after Dick Costolo’s stint, even though he was simultaneously serving as CEO of fintech platform Square.</p>
<p>Like many, I wondered how one person could adequately handle that level of responsibility. And apparently, so did Dorsey.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,’” he wrote in a letter to employees.</p>
<p>“Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.”</p>

<p>The Equity podcast team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">discussed his departure in a TechCrunch+ post yesterday afternoon</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alex Wilhelm: A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natasha Mascarenhas: A reset would rewrite how VCs and entrepreneurs do business</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amanda Silberling: Founders aren’t rock stars</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s too early to say whether the move will alter the founder-led ethic that permeates Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m hoping it starts a trend where mature tech companies do a better job of recognizing and rewarding employees who innately understand their culture, products and services. Case in point: Former CTO Parag Agrawal was initially hired as a software engineer, but a decade later, he’s leading Twitter’s 5,500 employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps it should be pro forma for corporate boards in search of a new CEO to start by talking to the company’s longtime engineers, product managers and marketing leads.</p>

<p>Brazil-based Nubank initially indicated that it planned to raise a maximum of $3.66 billion in its upcoming IPO, but this morning, the Latin American neobank’s holding company lowered that to $2.86 billion.</p>
<p>This public offering was coming in hot; why throttle back now? In this morning’s edition of The Exchange, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm unpack the numbers for the new proposed valuation and ask, “Does the revision matter?”</p>

<p>Collecting data to optimize B2B marketing is notoriously difficult.</p>
<p>“Practitioners tend to see each new source of information about their potential buyers — each signal type — as a substitute for the last one that didn’t work,” according to Kerry Cunningham, senior principal at account engagement platform 6sense.</p>
<p>Embracing a product-led growth mindset allows organizations to look at users as signals, “just like form-fill leads, de-anonymized website traffic, visitors to your booth, and the rest,” says Cunningham.</p>

<p>News of the omicron coronavirus variant may have suppressed retail activity over the Thanksgiving weekend, but what’s the explanation for flat online spending?</p>
<p>This year, Black Friday e-commerce totaled just $8.9 billion, compared to $9 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we should not have been surprised,” writes Alex Wilhelm. “There were warning signs.”</p>
<p>Looking back at missed Q3 estimates from companies like Shopify, Amazon and Pinduoduo, “somewhat softer e-commerce numbers simply should not be a surprise,” he concludes.</p>
<p>Due to supply-chain concerns and ongoing pandemic restrictions, retailers say consumers started shopping earlier this year. Still, this is the first time we’ve seen a decrease in Black Friday spending.</p>
<p>“The pandemic gaveth, and now seems less inclined to continue to giveth, even if e-commerce itself is still growing,” writes Alex. “It’s just that it’s growing more slowly than investors expected.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Market research</li>
<li>Prioritizing locations based on ROI</li>
<li>Customizing deals and marketing</li>

<h2>As human capital grows scarce, flexible compensation can help attract and retain talent</h2>

<p>The pandemic-fueled labor shortage has many causes, but inflexible and inadequate compensation is one of the most discussed.</p>
<p>However, employees don’t always leave because of pay. “An opaque model for allocating compensation” is often to blame for employees feeling unheard and unseen, writes Compright CEO Boyd Davis.</p>
<p>Davis explains how startups can tackle this issue by analyzing employee and market data to come up with compensation strategies that are transparent, equitable and fair.</p>
<p>The pandemic taught us to be flexible and “embrace change and be open to adjusting processes, [which] holds true for compensation planning as well,” Davis writes.</p>

<p>Music recognition service SoundHound more or less disappeared about five years ago, so it was a surprise when its SPAC backer announced the company’s IPO at a valuation of $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>That, Anna Heim notes, is five times as much as Apple paid for Shazam, its biggest competitor.</p>
<p>SoundHound turned down the volume as it quietly developed a conversational AI product it now sells to a number of leading brands. “If its SPAC deck is to be believed, it seems it is just doing magic in plain sight,” writes Anna.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Analysts and journalists from across the globe have convened in Hawaii to witness Qualcomm announce its big chip news for the year. Just a few days of sun, surf, Snapdragons and summits.</p>
<p>As promised, the latest version of the SoCal chip giant’s flagship SoC arrives with a rebrand — one that’s going to take some getting used to. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue like, say 888, but no one said chip nomenclatures were going to be easy. What’s more, the new silicon is arriving soon, with the first devices expected before the year’s up — giving handset makers more or less exactly four weeks to get them out the door.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241139" style="width: 1128px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241139" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241139 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Block-Diagram-e1638313204512.png" alt="" width="1118" height="1101" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new chip is focused on six key competencies: 5G connectivity, camera sensors, AI, gaming, audio and security — pretty much what you’d hope for from a mobile chipmaker in 2021. On the connectivity front, the SoC sports a 5G modem-RF capable of hitting up to 10-gigabit download speeds, coupled with the FastConnect 6900 Mobile Connectivity System, which it claims can best WiFi 6 speeds.</p>
<p>The new imaging system sports an 18-bit ISP, with improved dynamic range, color and speeds. It supports 8K HDR video, coupled with a new Bokeh Engine that brings Portrait Mode-style shots to video, while an Always-On ISP delivers low power consumption to tasks like face unlock.</p>
<p>The new Adreno GPU, meanwhile, promises improved graphics performance with lower power consumption, while support for lossless audio arrives on the sound side. As for security, the new platform sports a new Trust Management Engine, as well as support for Android Ready SE for digital car keys.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Snapdragon-8-Gen-1-Mobile-Platform-_Key-Visual-_Angle-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AI may be the biggest piece of the puzzle here. A new 7th Gen engine brings improved tensor acceleration. Per Qualcomm,</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest AI-based natural language processing from Hugging Face can intelligently serve as your personal assistant by prioritizing and analyzing your notifications. Working with Sonde Health, we are using on-device AI to accelerate their models that can analyze a user’s vocal patterns to determine if a user is at risk for health conditions such as asthma, depression, and COVID-19. Also, a new always-on AI system is powered by the 3rd Gen Qualcomm® Sensing Hub with more data streams being processed using lowest power AI.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imaging and AI, in particular, are key for Qualcomm this year because, let’s face it, the company’s got a lot more competition than it did only a few years back. Note the brands that have currently signed up to release devices sporting the SoC: Black Shark, Honor, iQOO, Motorola, Nubia, OnePlus, OPPO, realme, Redmi, Sharp, Sony Corporation, vivo, Xiaomi and ZTE. It’s not a bad list, as far as these things go. I should add that I cribbed it directly from Qualcomm’s press material, so it’s alphabetical (likely for political reasons), which is how you get names like Black Shark ahead of, say, Sony.</p>
<p>But you’ve got a number of big Chinese manufacturers on there, too — vivo, OPPO and Xiaomi dominate the world&#8217;s largest smartphone market. And the list is as notable for its absences than the names it includes. Huawei, is, of course, not present (unlike spinoff, Honor), as the company looks to in-house chips amid concerns with the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Beyond that, big names like Google, Apple and Samsung are notably missing. Qualcomm is no doubt feeling a pinch as more companies push to develop their own in-house silicon, many of which have sported some impressive numbers in testing. That’s not to say that Qualcomm’s dominance is over among premium handsets, but chips are an increasingly important battlefield for smartphone differentiation among hardware makers with the resources to go in-house.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Longer-term energy storage is a drag, and a lot of battery tech has been focusing on &#8220;how quickly can we charge these batteries so I can drive my EV for another couple of hundred miles.&#8221; That&#8217;s a fundamentally different problem than trying to capture the power of the sun for 12 hours, before releasing the power for the next 12 hours while the moon is doing its lazy stroll against the nighttime sky.</p>
<p><a href="https://energydome.com/">Energy Dome</a> today announced the close of its $11 million Series A fundraise, with the goal of deploying the first commercially viable CO<sub>2</sub> battery in a demonstration project in its native Sardinia, Italy.</p>
<p>The company told us that a CO<sub>2</sub> battery&#8217;s optimal charge/discharge cycle ranges from four to 24 hours, positioning it perfectly for daily and intra-day cycling. It points out that this is a fast-growing market segment, not well served by existing battery technologies. Specifically, the hope is to charge the CO<sub>2</sub> battery during the daytime when there is a surplus of solar-generated power, before discharging during the peak evening and nighttime hours, when demand for electricity outpaces what solar can deliver. Because, well, I&#8217;d hate to feel the need to spell this out for ya — but there&#8217;s no sun at night.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241199" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Built using commodity components, the company claims that its CO<sub>2  </sub>battery achieves a 75%-80% round-trip efficiency. Perhaps more interestingly, though, is that the operational life for the batteries is projected to be in the neighborhood of 25 years. If you&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on other power-storage solutions, you&#8217;ll have made a mental note that the operational life of most other solutions starts to degrade significantly by the time it hits the one-decade mark. The company projects that considering the whole lifecycle cost of its product, the cost of storing energy will be about half of the cost of storing with similarly sized lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>The tech is pretty neat — the company is using CO<sub>2</sub> in a closed-loop cycle where it changes from gas to liquid and back to gas. The company itself is named after the &#8220;dome&#8221; component of the solution — an inflatable atmospheric gas holder filled with CO<sub>2</sub> in its gaseous form.</p>
<p>When charging, the system draws electrical power from the electric grid, which drives a compressor that draws CO<sub>2</sub> from the dome and compresses it, generating heat. The heat is stored in a thermal energy storage device. The CO<sub>2</sub> is then liquified under pressure and stored in liquid CO<sub>2</sub> vessels, at ambient temperature, to complete the charging cycle. When discharging, the cycle is reversed by evaporating the liquid CO<sub>2</sub>, recovering the heat from the thermal energy storage system and expanding the hot CO<sub>2</sub> into a turbine, which drives a generator. Electricity is returned to the grid and the CO<sub>2</sub> reinflates the dome without emissions to the atmosphere, ready for the next charging cycle. The system has up to 200 MWh in storage capacity.</p>
<p>The round was led by deep tech VC firm <a href="https://www.360cap.vc/">360 Capital,</a> while a number of other investors round out the investment round, including Barclays’ Sustainable Impact Capital program, a division of the banking giant Barclays that takes an impact investment approach, Geneva-based multifamily office Novum Capital Partners and Third Derivative, a global climate technology startup accelerator founded by RMI and New Energy Nexus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch introduced a new way for streamers to fight accounts that evade channel-level bans Tuesday. The automated tool is called &#8220;Suspicious User Detection&#8221; and can spot users trying to get around bans, giving anyone moderating a Twitch channel more recourse for dealing with potentially disruptive behavior before it starts. The company announced that the new ban evasion detection tool was on the way back <a href="https://twitter.com/twitch/status/1425550623215218689">in August</a>.</p>
<p>The company says it developed the tool in direct response to community feedback calling for more robust moderation options for handling users popping up with new accounts after being banned. After an account is flagged as either a &#8220;possible&#8221; or &#8220;likely&#8221; ban evader, a channel&#8217;s moderators can choose to take action against it manually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241013" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241013" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2241013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitch-suspicious-user-tool.gif?w=600" alt="Twitch suspicious user detection tool" width="600" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241013" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitch</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241000" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Any messages sent from an account flagged as a likely violator will be automatically screened from chat, pending review by a moderator. For channels that want to be more aggressive with moderation, the same setting can be turned on for accounts flagged as possible ban evaders. Mods can also manually add users to the suspicious account list to keep closer tabs on them.</p>
<p>Twitch notes that as with any automated moderation tool, false positives are possible, though it hopes to strike a balance between proactive detection powered by machine learning systems and human intervention. &#8220;You’re the expert when it comes to your community, and you should make the final call on who can participate,&#8221; Twitch wrote in a blog post, adding that the system will improve over time after training on input from human moderators.</p>
<p>Twitch sees the new ban evasion detection system as a modular solution alongside AutoMod, which gives moderators a way to review potentially harmful messages in chat, and Phone-Verified Chat, an option that Twitch added last month that requires users to verify their accounts before chatting. Twitch users can sign up for five accounts with a single phone number, but a channel ban now impacts all accounts linked to that number, sealing up one of the easier workarounds for anyone looking to skirt the platform&#8217;s policies.</p>

<p>Twitch streamers have long been pushing the company to do more to protect creators, particularly those most vulnerable to online harassment. This year alone, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">#ADayOffTwitch</a> and #TwitchDoBetter campaigns escalated visibility for marginalized creators facing widespread abuse on the platform, prompting the company to respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve seen a lot of conversation about botting, hate raids, and other forms of harassment targeting marginalized creators,&#8221; the company tweeted at the time. &#8220;You’re asking us to do better, and we know we need to do more to address these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s longstanding lack of discovery tools already made success on the platform an uphill challenge for underrepresented creators, but targeted harassment campaigns made matters much worse. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/twitch-streamers-respond-after-huge-leak-of-creator-payout-data/">trove of Twitch payout data</a> leaked last month painted a grim picture of diversity in the upper echelons of streaming success, where top creators are nearly universally white men.</p>
<p>In May, Twitch added more than 350 tags to help users find streamers by identifiers like gender, sexuality, race and ability. The update was an overdue step to drive discovery and surface more diverse creators on the platform, but without adequate moderation tools many users worried that the system was driving targeted harassment toward their communities. In September, Twitch took the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/twitch-hate-raids-lawsuits/">unusual step</a> of filing a lawsuit against two users linked to thousands of bots powering mass harassment campaigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There has been speculation for some time that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/could-marc-benioff-be-the-next-ceo-to-move-to-executive-chairman/">Marc Benioff was ready to step back</a>, perhaps take the same path as Jeff Bezos and move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">to chairman of the board</a>. The scuttlebutt had it that Bret Taylor was in line for a promotion. Seems Benioff wasn&#8217;t ready to go out to pasture just yet, but Taylor<a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Bret-Taylor-Promoted-to-Vice-Chair-and-Co-CEO-of-Salesforce/default.aspx"> got his promotion today</a> to co-CEO at the CRM giant.</p>
<p>Taylor, who was president and chief operating officer, is now vice chair and co-CEO working alongside Benioff, rather than reporting to him. Benioff sees this as a good way to operate moving forward as the company has expanded greatly in recent years with major acquisitions like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">the $15.7 billion deal for Tableau</a> in 2019 or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">$27.7 billion Slack acquisition</a>, which Taylor spearheaded, at the end of last year.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of ground to cover, and it&#8217;s probably a hard job for one person to take it all on alone. &#8220;We’re in a new world and Salesforce has never been more relevant or strategic for our customers. Together, Bret and I will lead Salesforce through our next chapter, while living our shared values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality for all,&#8221; Benioff said in a (bland) statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Taylor, as you would expect, was grateful for the opportunity as he moves to the top of the food chain alongside Benioff. &#8220;Partnering with him to lead the company he co-founded 22 years ago is an enormous privilege. I’m thankful for our Salesforce employees, our Trailblazers, our customers, and all of our stakeholders who help us make our company and our world a better place,&#8221; Taylor said in a statement.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that the company has gone the co-CEO route. Prior to this, Keith Block held that role starting in 2018 before leaving in 2020.</p>
<p>Taylor, who at one time was CEO at early social network FriendFeed, also served as CTO at Facebook from 2009-2012. He came to Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">when it acquired Quip</a> for $750 million in 2016. He quickly moved through the ranks leapfrogging other longtime executives. He was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-president-and-coo/">promoted to president and chief operating officer</a> in 2019, placing him just below Benioff until today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been quite a week for Taylor, who was also named independent <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_news/2021/11/11-29-21_TWTR_Announcement.pdf">chairman of the board at Twitter</a> on Tuesday.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I recently wrote a piece discussing how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/not-all-money-is-created-equal-a-vcs-advice-for-founders/">all capital is not created equal</a> and we are living in a period of super-abundant funding &#8212; in many ways, the best times ever for founders.</p>
<p>In this environment, every investor has a well-honed pitch on how they can uniquely add value. Being a founder of a high-growth startup means that you will encounter many situations you never have before, so choosing an investor who will be a partner in building the business is a key decision. In this context, promises of exclusive value-add resonate deeply.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, most founders find that the actual value they receive from investors is not always as promised. I have had the opportunity to work with amazing investors who build great thought partnerships with their founders, who are invaluable in making the decisions that change the trajectories of companies and have superpowers in attracting talent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240717" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Venture investing is an apprenticeship business, and I am humbled whenever I get a chance to learn from a great investor. However, when I speak to founders, it’s more likely that the investors they picked exhibited a variety of post-funding archetype behaviors, all of which detract from value, not add to it.</p>
<p>In the spirit of helping founders look beyond the promises of value, let&#8217;s delve into some common archetypes of investor relationships that founders experience post-investment. I hope that both founders and investors will read through these archetypes with a sense of humor. Like a good episode of “Silicon Valley,” there is some exaggeration here for effect, but not much!</p>
<h2>8 disappointing investor archetypes</h2>
<p><strong>The narcissist.</strong> Narcissists are completely full of themselves, and everything is always about them — how great their firm is and how great they are. They’re so enamored with themselves that they never take time to understand what founders really want or need. Some narcissists may be well past their glory days &#8212; just figureheads riding on their former successes &#8212; and they’re not going to add value to your startup.</p>
<p><strong>The child with a hammer.</strong> This is the investor who tells you to follow their advice because, “We used to do this when I was at Google,” or, “When I was on Airbnb’s board, we did this.” They have a hammer, and every problem they see looks like the same nail to be pounded in — in the same way they did it in the one significant experience they previously had in their professional career. They lack the perspective that there could be 10 other ways to approach and solve the problem. Some investors also have a “fire the executive” hammer that can be particularly destructive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>The know-it-all.</strong> This is the investor in meetings who doesn’t want to hear anyone else’s opinions, including the founders’. “I invested in Facebook before their Series C, therefore I have all the answers.” They don’t respect founders or their fellow board members, which is damaging to vital relationships and board dynamics. They may also have silver bullets like “OKR” or “recurring revenue” that they are partial to without understanding whether these are a good fit for this business and situation.</p>
<p><strong>The lapdog (aka the cheerleader).</strong> This is the investor who is never going to deliver the hard message to you — they’ll always try to be friends with the founders because they want a recommendation to the next company. They’ll pop in to a meeting and invite you out to dinner or on a lavish ski trip. Anytime there’s a difficult situation, however, they fall back on, “Whatever the founder wants is the right answer,” instead of being a thought partner and bringing a valuable perspective.</p>
<p><strong>The service router.</strong> If you want someone with a fat Rolodex, then you’ve come to the right place with the service router. Need a CFO or a sales manager? The service router will point you to people but never aim for excellence or help a founder figure out what looks good, say, in a new VP of sales. Service routers are good at recirculating among their portfolio companies. The problem is that the talent might have done a fine job at one company but isn’t the right fit for your startup.</p>
<p><strong>The Needy Ned.</strong> This investor will drive you nuts because they want to be involved in <em>everything</em> your company does, regardless of whether they’re adding value in the process. This might be the first company they’ve been on the board of, or they might be junior in the venture firm. You’ll know you’re dealing with a Needy Ned when they’re surprised and outraged when you haven’t told them every operational detail of your business. A more difficult version of Needy Ned is someone who not just wants to be involved but is trying to grab the wheel out of the founder’s hands and do things their way.</p>
<p><strong>The numbers person.</strong> For this investor, business is a big, complex spreadsheet, and everything can be reduced to a number or a ratio. They usually come from private equity, investment banking or growth investing, and they typically throw around terms like revenue churn, ARR and “the magic number.” The trouble is, they don’t understand the story behind the numbers, and they don’t know what it takes to move them.</p>
<p><strong>The drive-by.</strong> If you want your investor to stay out of your hair after they send some funding your way, then the drive-by is for you. They’re deal machines — even before your deal is sealed, they’re already on to the next one. By the time two years go by, they have completed 10 other deals and they’re not remotely interested in you as a founder or a company. They might attend a board meeting or two, but when they do, they’ll probably be checking their email to nail down their latest deal.</p>
<h2>My thoughts for founders</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, founders fall for these archetypes every day. As you consider your funding options, here are some things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The <em>person</em> matters way more than the <em>firm</em>. Don’t buy the brand; buy the person. Perform due diligence on the person thoroughly and well. Talk to founders and dig into the references the investor gives you using your own back channels. Make sure there is a personality and style match among you, your co-founders and the existing board. In addition, make sure the investor’s knowledge and prior experience match your business.</p>
<p>Make sure both the person and the firm really understand your business. One good way to assess this is how much diligence they do on your product, and whether they personally talk to customers as opposed to reviewing call transcripts done by third parties. If an investor does not take the time to truly understand what you are building before they invest, what are the chances they will understand it after, and, more importantly, be a valuable thought partner?</p>
<p>Everyone is a good fair-weather sailor, but when there is a failure or small misstep (which, as I point out in my book, “<a href="https://anticipatefailure.com/">Anticipate Failure</a>,” will surely happen), the worst behaviors rear their ugly head. Examine how the person behaves when important decisions need to be made or when the going gets tough. One way to test is to ask the investor for references to their worst-performing companies and hear directly how they behaved when things were not going well.</p>
<p>Check for evidence of value-add and ask for it in writing in quantifiable ways in the term sheet. If they say they are going to help with hiring, ask them to write down goals for the first two quarters. If they say they can help with customers, ask exactly what amount of revenue they will commit to adding. If they say their brand will attract independent board members, ask to speak to board members they have placed.</p>
<p>If you take time to find a good fit with an investor, you will significantly maximize the chances of building something great. Even one bad investor on a board can significantly hurt the chances of your success, and I have unfortunately seen this happen a few times.</p>
<p>Don’t be lured by promises, valuations and check sizes &#8212; these are transitory, and the sugar highs from these shiny objects will last for but a short period. Keep your eye on the goal and pick your investor wisely.</p>

<p>The giving season has arrived, but an ample supply of next-gen consoles has not. Between chip shortages and resellers/bots, the chances of someone getting their hands on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without a whole lot of effort(/luck) are slim to none. It can be done! But you might not want to bet the holiday on it.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s just not gonna happen this year, there&#8217;s still plenty of stuff that should make the gamer in your life happy — accessories and nice-to-have extras that any gamer will appreciate and make their current setup a bit comfier while Sony/Microsoft/et al. catch up with demand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238323" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>Headphones</h2>
<p>Every gamer needs a good pair of headphones — skimping on this is a one-way ticket to a headache. In many of today&#8217;s most popular games, bad audio is a distinct disadvantage.</p>
<p>Trying to decide between wired and wireless? Wired could be fine if they&#8217;re gaming at a desk; for couch gaming, wireless will help &#8217;em be more comfortable and less tangled.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations for each platform</p>
<h3>For Xbox or PlayStation: SteelSeries 7X and 7P</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076127" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076127" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2076127" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=2048,1431 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076127" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey</p></div></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played pretty much every PS5 game with these. They&#8217;re just fantastic and much better than Sony&#8217;s own PlayStation-branded headsets. Comfortable, amazing sound, good battery life and quick connecting.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the cheapest but they&#8217;re definitely not the most expensive either — there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RJHH6Q8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07RJHH6Q8&amp;linkId=f3ba87c9aeb7c00ece70b849a12ee157">a new version</a> that doesn&#8217;t change much, so the (still great) last generation is on sale. Note: The 7X is for Xbox consoles and the 7P is for PlayStation — sadly there isn&#8217;t one version that works for both. Fortunately if you want something like that, it&#8217;s the next thing on the list.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>SteelSeries 7X (Xbox), <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Steelseries-Xbox-Arctis-7X-Headset-for-Series-X-S/996217534">$133 from Walmart</a> | SteelSeries 7P (PlayStation), <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/steelseries-arctis-7p-wireless-lossless-2-4-ghz-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-5-and-playstation-4-white/6436579.p?skuId=6436579&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;extStoreId=144&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtJeNBhCVARIsANJUJ2G4C3EBV8jDdDDxf_h3boxfUTDuhr2SZUgCsUvtNgmkrq53S5Ol44EaApE-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">$150 from Best Buy</a></p>
<h3>For Switch, multiple consoles or for a budget: SteelSeries Arctis 1</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2241021" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241021" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241021 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="542" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arctis-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241021" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SteelSeries</p></div></p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t as cushy or expansive-sounding as the 7 series but they&#8217;re solid, comfortable and (because they&#8217;re wired) are compatible with everything under the sun: all major consoles plus phones, and the price is definitely right. If this list seems SteelSeries heavy, it&#8217;s just because they really got it right this generation.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>SteelSeries Arctis 1, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S9886QV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07S9886QV&amp;linkId=c8b39e4f74e10c9dd3b2669a9e5102df">$50 from Amazon</a></p>
<h3>For PC: Razer BlackShark V2 or V2 Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076125" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2076125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="748" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076125" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldeway</p></div></p>
<p>This headset is understated in design, sounds great and plenty comfortable. I&#8217;ve had nothing but compliments for the sound of the mic.</p>
<p>To be honest I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s worth the extra cash for the wireless (Pro) version, since PC gamers tend to be within three feet of their computers. If you can get the wireless one on sale go for it, but the wired version is a great option when money is tight.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Razer BlackShark V2 (Wired), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086PKMZ1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B086PKMZ1Q&amp;linkId=f3b190689739a87b8149b6a8a2debb90">$75 from Amazon</a> | Razer BlackShark V2 Pro (Wireless), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FQG96RP/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08FQG96RP&amp;linkId=b2b1c0a3900f7e325f6f5608e64617bb">$140 from Amazon</a></p>
<h3>Maybe a mechanical gaming keyboard?</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1833717" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1833717" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1833717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg" alt="Symbols inspired by Paiwan culture on Ducky's limited edition Year of the Pig mechanical keyboard" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg 3861w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7706.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1833717" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Catherine Shu</p></div></p>
<p>This is a tough one. I was originally going to do a roundup of a bunch of keyboards … but, like next-gen consoles, many of the best ones are very hard to find right now.</p>
<p>If your PC-gaming loved one has a keyboard they like, you can sneak a look and get them a new one or an upgraded one of the same brand. But if you hear them talking about what &#8220;color&#8221; of mechanical switch they like or they&#8217;re talking about building their own … maybe back down. Once they go down that rabbit hole, the choices are very individual and it&#8217;s hard to get right as a gift. Maybe go with a gift card or something.</p>
<h2>Console accessories</h2>
<p>Maybe your loved one was lucky enough to get a Series X or PS5 already, or they have one coming soon. Maybe they just want to upgrade their current-gen console. Either way, they&#8217;ll probably still want a little extra gear.</p>
<h3>PlayStation:</h3>
<h4>Media remote</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_2241024" style="width: 1237px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241024" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241024 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg" alt="" width="1227" height="918" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg 1227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS5-remote.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241024" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>If someone uses their PlayStation 5 as the primary way of watching Netflix, Plex and so on, it gets old pretty fast using the rather large, heavy, easy-to-bump-off-the-couch DualSense gamepad for it. Snag one of these remote controls and no one has to learn whether &#8220;O&#8221; or &#8220;X&#8221; means cancel, or whether to use the bumpers, triggers, D-pad or analog sticks to rewind and fast forward. Honestly, this thing should probably come in the box. Super easy and convenient gift for combination gamers/cord-cutters.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FC5R4KV/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08FC5R4KV&amp;linkId=f042ba2bc68da9fa10c43f64f330f04c">$30 from Amazon</a></p>
<h4>A big hard drive expansion</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_2241030" style="width: 731px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241030" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241030 size-full" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg 721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SSD.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>On a PS4, you can just buy a big ol&#8217; external USB hard drive and plug it in. You can do the same with a PS5, but there are …<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-extended-storage/"> limitations</a>. For the most part, it&#8217;s better to upgrade the internal storage.</p>
<p>Any reasonably tech-confident person should be able to install this expansion drive for PS5s, which they&#8217;ll probably want eventually since games these days are flippin&#8217; huge. This is a one-time purchase and install that will extend the life of the console and make things simpler, especially if they have the &#8220;digital&#8221; version without a disc drive. The major brands (Samsung, PNY, Kingston) all have PS5-compatible options; just make sure it&#8217;s one of those and you&#8217;re good. One detail that&#8217;s easy to miss: Some models note that they need a heatsink to work with a PS5 but don&#8217;t actually include one in the box. THANKS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a splurge since the vanilla Xbox controllers are pretty excellent … but if the Xbox has been your loved one&#8217;s main gaming platform for years, you might be able to help them up their game a bit. The improved ergonomics, sweet D-pad, rear paddle triggers and other improvements can be game changers — no joke. You can do things with those rear paddles that would require ridiculous hand contortions to pull off otherwise. Xbox One-era controllers are compatible with Xbox Series X consoles, so this one is an investment that should work for years regardless of what gen they&#8217;re on right now.</p>

<h4>Series X storage expansion card</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_2241084" style="width: 1425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241084" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241084 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg" alt="" width="1415" height="993" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg 1415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Series-X-expansion.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1415px) 100vw, 1415px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241084" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Seagate</p></div></p>
<p>Same deal with the PlayStation: External USB drives work well enough on the last-gen Xboxes, but <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-s-storage-guide">there are limitations</a> when using them with the next-gen consoles.</p>
<p>Not that installing the PS5&#8217;s expansion card is particularly hard, but with the Xbox Series X you literally just plug it into the back. That&#8217;s it. $220 for 1 TB seems a bit expensive to me, but it&#8217;s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.seagate.com/consumer/play/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/">$150-$400, depending on capacity</a></p>
<h3>Switch:</h3>
<h4>Pro Controller</h4>
<p><div id="attachment_2241035" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241035" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2241035" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg 1258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pro-controller.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>The only thing better than having a Pro Controller is having two Pro Controllers. These things are excellent and the best way to play most games if you&#8217;re on the couch. With the Switch&#8217;s focus on multiplayer it can lead to bitterness when one person gets a sweet ergonomic Pro and everyone else is on the tiny Joy-Cons.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> While they&#8217;re not <em>quite</em> as hard to get as next-gen consoles, first-party controllers are also in short supply this year! Order early to make it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://store.nintendo.com/pro-controller.html">$70 from Nintendo</a></p>

<p>Nintendo has an ever-expanding library of retro games on its console (if you pay the monthly fee for them) and it just feels better to play them on the original controllers. However, Nintendo seemingly only makes about 50 of those per year and they&#8217;re constantly out of stock. Grab an SN30 — they&#8217;re wireless, they work with other platforms and they add analog sticks to the SNES layout so you can play any game with &#8217;90s flair. By &#8220;you&#8221; I mean your loved one, obviously.</p>

<p>The Switch can run out of space fast if you&#8217;re not careful, and it&#8217;s pretty much mandatory to grab a microSD card to expand its storage. Fortunately, expanding the Switch&#8217;s storage is easy and relatively cheap! Grab a 256 GB or 512 GB microSD card and banish storage worries once and for all.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bother paying any markups for a microSD card with Mario on it or whatever — once it&#8217;s in the console you never see it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Varies by capacity/speed. 512 GB microSDXC, as pictured above, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P7M6K35/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07P7M6K35&amp;linkId=96235896f7073a3210a9eae0a407779c">$75 from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Subscriptions and digital goods</h2>
<p>These days most gamers need to subscribe to one thing or another — on the consoles, for example, most of the online multiplayer requires a subscription. Figure out what their subscription of choice is and get &#8217;em set up with a few more months, and you know it&#8217;s a gift that&#8217;ll go to good use.</p>
<h3>Xbox: Game Pass or Live Gold</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2241045" style="width: 1022px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241045" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241045 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg" alt="" width="1012" height="788" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg 1012w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg?resize=768,598 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xbox-game-pass.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got options here. If they just want to play online, Xbox Live Gold starts at around $10 a month. If you also want to give them all-you-can-eat access to a surprisingly solid collection of games, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs around $15 a month and includes Xbox Live Gold.</p>

<p>Sony also has two different plans: PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now. Plus ($10 a month, or $5 per month if you pay by the year) is what you need for online multiplayer; Now (same pricing) gets you access to hundreds of games. Know that these are two separate subscriptions.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online is pretty bare bones, but if they want online play in Smash Bros or Mario Kart it&#8217;s a must. And, as an added little bonus, it comes with access to a bunch of NES and SNES games.</p>
<p>Wondering what the more expensive &#8220;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&#8221; is? The short version: For more than double the price, they&#8217;ll throw in access to a bunch of N64 and Sega Genesis games, plus the Animal Crossing Happy Home Paradise expansion. Maybe worth it if Animal Crossing is their thing, maybe not otherwise.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a bunch of family members who want online access, the Family plan lets you add up to eight users to one $35-per-year account, which works out to about $5 per user per year. That&#8217;s cheap!</p>

<p>Are they super into a specific game? Fortnite? Apex? Halo Infinite?</p>
<p>This is kind of hard to explain, but maaaany games these days have a system — generally called a &#8220;battle pass&#8221; — that rewards you with in-game things (think character skins or dances you can do to taunt your enemies) for logging in and playing. Some of those systems have paid tiers that offer more rewards. Buying those premium upgrades can feel like a bit of a luxury — making it, potentially, a solid gift for the person who can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t splurge on themselves.</p>
<p>One catch? Depending on the game, gifting the battle pass can be tough! The trick, in most cases, is to gift them some of the game&#8217;s respective in-game currency (you want to buy it as a code or card from a trustworthy retailer, generally; there are scams aplenty in these waters), which can generally be used to buy the premium battle pass. In most cases battle passes expire with each in-game &#8220;season&#8221; — so if they&#8217;ve already got that season&#8217;s pass, they can save it for the next one or just use the currency on in-game skins or something else they&#8217;ve been eyeing.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Varies</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA&#8217;s auditing body, the Office of Audits, has produced a report detailing the agency&#8217;s commitment to replacing the International Space Station (ISS) with one or more commercial space stations once the orbiting lab is retired. Despite still being scheduled for 2024, all indications are that the ISS&#8217;s operational life will be extended to 2030, which is when the agency is assuming it&#8217;ll be able to hand off human occupation of an on-orbit science facility to a private company.</p>
<p>This audit basically details the current costs of maintenance and operation of the ISS, and also explains why it thinks that there will still be an essential need for a research facility that can provide a test bed for prolonged human exposure to space, as well as for development and demonstration of tech key to helping people explore deep space, including the establishment of a more permanent presence on the moon and exploration of Mars.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that NASA hopes to see a commercial station operation by 2028 in order to give a period of two years of overlap before the anticipated retirement and de-orbiting of the ISS. That timeline presents clear risks, however, in part because of &#8220;limited market demand, inadequate funding, unreliable costs estimates and still-evolving requirements.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241079" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The good news is that recently a lot of companies seem to be interested in pursuing the development of commercial orbital destinations. A partnership between Nanoracks, its parent company Voyager Space,and Lockheed Martin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nanoracks-lockheed-martin-and-voyager-space-plan-to-launch-crewed-commercial-space-station-by-2027/">aims to produce one by 2027</a>. Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/">hopes to launch</a> its Orbital Reef station with Sierra Space and Boeing by 2030 at the latest, while Axiom is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/the-googler-who-came-to-monetize-space/">progressing with its plan</a> to send up modules that will attach to the ISS before separating and self-orbiting as its own station by 2028.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, entrepreneurs, investors and married couple Dave and Brit Morin teamed up with James Higa, who was a senior director at Apple for nearly a dozen years, and Tonal co-founder Nate Bosshard, to create a new venture firm called <a href="https://offline.vc/">Offline Ventures</a> that, very notably, counts Apple as an anchor investor.</p>
<p>The idea, in part, is to use their collective interest in mental health and hardware to help inform Apple&#8217;s road map, though the team is looking at much, much more, and is even in the process of incubating some startups. We talked recently with the Morins &#8212; who each logged some time at Apple early in their careers &#8212; to find out more in a conversation that&#8217;s been excerpted below and edited lightly for length. (You can hear our longer conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/brit-dave-morins-new-venture-fund-plus-the-inside/id1498270180?i=1000542538394">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>TC: You just closed on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/16/dave-brit-morin-raise-100-million-offline-ventures/?sh=1e9ffc8e5f4a">$100 million</a> for your debut fund. Why start a new fund during the pandemic and why with the four of you?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BM: Dave had departed <a href="https://slow-prod.herokuapp.com/">Slow Ventures</a> and had been taking some time off after that, doing angel investments, but wanting to get back into the game, both as an entrepreneur and investor. I had been running Brit &amp; Co. for nearly a decade, and saw from all of my years in raising venture capital that only 2% of venture funding goes to women and felt like the best thing I could do to support my mission of helping women rise is to actually fund them.</p>
<p>James had been at Index Ventures after leaving Apple [after] almost 30 years of reporting to Steve Jobs and is a longtime friend of ours and also wanted to join in … [Nate] we&#8217;ve [also] known for over a decade and been in many different deals together, so we already had a bit of a track record. We had different networks, but we also liked a lot of the same things.</p>
<p><strong>There seems to be a big emphasis on mental health. Does that come from your own personal experience in founding companies?</strong></p>
<p>DM: Yes, but also, when I sold [the social network] Path in 2015, about six months later, Brit and I started a foundation called <a href="https://www.sunrise.bio/">Sunrise</a> that has a very simple mission, which is to find the cure for depression and all forms of mental health. So we&#8217;ve been funding the basic science of mental health for close to seven years and participated in some of the most foundational scientific studies of mental health and mental health treatments over that time period and we&#8217;ve become very passionate about both the science of it, but also the reduction of suffering &#8212; and I mean people all around us [but also] including founders … It became very hard to ignore this pandemic in Silicon Valley that is broadly ignored. It&#8217;s getting better, but it&#8217;s something we wanted to not just talk about but really drive into the core of what we&#8217;re doing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s most interesting to you on this front?</strong></p>
<p>DM: Telemedicine was already moving pretty quickly before the pandemic. I bet on a company in the last Slow Ventures fund called <a href="https://www.brightside.com/">Brightside</a>, which is a telemedicine company for depression. They&#8217;ve seen dramatic acceleration through the pandemic, for example. Here at Offline, we&#8217;ve also invested in a telemedicine company called <a href="https://www.donefirst.com/">Done</a> [and] they focus specifically on ADHD and also just improving the accessibility of ADHD medications because they&#8217;re extremely hard to manage. We&#8217;ve also focused on healthcare system level enablement … we focus on direct therapeutics.</p>
<p>The fourth category is what we think of as digital drugs, or digital therapeutics. Meditation apps the year before the pandemic were the largest category in the App Store, and we think that pretty much proves that just like after World War II, when we shifted from working with our bodies all the time [to exercising in] the gym, [we see this] epidemic of social media [that&#8217;s] generating uniquely bad mental health states being balanced by the meditation apps.</p>
<p>Today, those apps are largely a bunch of podcast audio files organized into an interface. But we think that within the next 10 years, you will see things that are much more akin to a remote control button that helps you shift your brain and body somatic state using digital technology, so we&#8217;re also focused on uncovering those kinds of use cases as well.</p>
<p><strong>Apple is one of your investors. Was that one of their motivations in investing, to integrate that mental care interface into their devices?</strong></p>
<p>DM: Absolutely. In fact, one of the projects that we worked on philanthropically before Apple became our partner was over at Sunrise, [where] we put together Apple and UCLA, [which has] the <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-launches-major-mental-health-study-to-discover-insights-about-depression">largest genetic study</a> of depression and mental health going on in the world that we know of. They&#8217;re doing a 10-year study of 100,000 people &#8212; 10,000 people per year &#8212; that&#8217;s looking at the genetics, as well as the behavioral characteristics [or participants], and trying to find an objective measure of mental health for the first time.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&#8217;t know this, but all mental health diagnoses are subjective. They&#8217;re a bunch of symptoms that psychiatrists and psychologists have agreed upon and then named, [but] they have no biological basis and no objective tests. Psychiatrists are the only doctors who can prescribe a medication with no diagnostic test to show whether it&#8217;s working or not. [So the] goal [of the UCLA study] is to look at genetics and then use digital technology as an overlay to try to understand, &#8220;OK, for this diagnosis that we call depression or bipolar or ADD, can we uncover areas in the genome for which we might be able to find matches.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time before we put Apple together with UCLA, they were just working with the engineering department to create a wristband that would look at galvanic skin response. But Apple is now the technology partner for that study, similar to what was going on with <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/appleheartstudy.html">Stanford and the heart</a> and Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Can we expect the Apple Watch to be asking us whether we&#8217;re depressed in the near future? And what privacy questions does that raise if a company like Apple is monitoring the mental health of people who are using its devices?</strong></p>
<p>DM: No, you wouldn&#8217;t expect that to happen anytime soon. The study is 100% opt-in and it is just for the people who are part of the study. And really, they&#8217;re looking at whether it&#8217;s possible to use data and sensors as a component of finding mental health diagnoses.There are many studies outside of UCLA that have shown that just through very simple signals that aren&#8217;t even that complex, you actually can find mood and behavioral data that help people [receive] intervention faster … If you could just help people find the right resource 50% faster than [is possible] today, you might save millions of lives, so that&#8217;s the way to think about it. One of the nice things about how Apple thinks about the world is that your data is your data. If they do this in any way, I think we expect that privacy will always be respected.</p>
<p><strong>Is Apple the biggest investor in the fund, and also, is it uncommon for Apple to be an LP in a venture fund? I&#8217;ve long wondered whether we&#8217;d ever see an Apple Ventures or other answer to GV or CapitalG over at Alphabet.</strong></p>
<p>DM: No, it&#8217;s not common. They have invested in a few funds, including [those of] SoftBank and TPG [as well as] several BIPOC venture funds and with Howard University to establish some fun, related things related to their endowment. But this is unique in terms of relationship. I think it comes from just decades of relationships and trust and being able to speak the language and work with them in a way that they can trust.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Personal health is also an area of interest. Are you interested in more connected fitness-type bets because of Nate Bosshard?</strong></p>
<p>BM: Actually, part of the interesting aspect of Offline is that 80% of the fund is for investing and writing those early-stage checks, and 20% is for incubating and building out new ideas. The four of us are all entrepreneurs and investors and so one of our first incubation projects is called <a href="https://www.ancientritual.com/">Ancient Ritual</a> [and] the best way to describe it is a multisensory connected sauna. Nate is the one who has incubated this project, but there are now whole teams on it and we have more information to come on that and we hope to do more of these types of things. We definitely aren&#8217;t afraid of connected hardware. We invested in a company called <a href="https://arcboats.com/">Arc</a> that&#8217;s doing electric boats; we&#8217;ve looked at a variety of other connected fitness devices and certainly because of the success of Tonal are big believers. But we also know how hard hardware can be and how important it is to have the right teams, the right prototypes [and] the right funding mechanisms in place from the very beginning.</p>

<p><strong>You&#8217;ve already made a big bet on Clubhouse, even spinning out an SPV for your LPs to get a bigger bite of the company. I don&#8217;t follow Clubhouse so closely, but obviously, it seems like it&#8217;s lost some momentum. Do you think it can recapture the time and attention of users? Dave, you were at Facebook. You started a social network previously. You know more than most how these things can play out.</strong></p>
<p>DM: My short answer is yes. Almost every time we&#8217;ve invested in the company, people were asking that question. And then two months later, things grew even more … The way we look at Clubhouse is that it&#8217;s the next one in the line of many new sensory experiences for social networking. We think they&#8217;ve pioneered audio-based social networking … we also like to think of teams like musicians, and they&#8217;ve got a great band over there … One of the most difficult things about social networking right now is how much division and disagreement and misunderstanding there is, and that largely comes from the fact that we all use text and misinterpret tone way too much. So we also think [Clubhouse has] a worthy moral mission to some extent, as well.</p>
<p><strong>TC: To Brit&#8217;s point about incubating companies, given your expertise in social networking, I&#8217;m curious if we&#8217;d see Offline create something of its own in this area.</strong></p>
<p>DM: Absolutely. We think that web3 is an opportunity to create a better internet where the incentives of both the users and the platform or the network are more aligned with the incentives with the creators … not just from a business model perspective, but from a governance perspective,</p>
<p><strong>TC: It seems like everything in web3 involves asking users to pay for things, though, whereas these closed systems provide their services for &#8220;free&#8221; in exchange for users&#8217; time and data. I do wonder if web3 will be relegated to a concentrated base of users who don&#8217;t mind supporting these projects [or are willing to speculate on them]. I think most people are both victims of inertia and also want things for free, even if it means sacrificing their privacy.  </strong></p>
<p>DM:  I think of it very similar to when you&#8217;re standing in the airport and there are two sides of the magazine rock; there are magazines that are free and ones you can pay for.  There has always been a difference in quality and a difference in community on both sides, and there are people who like one, and others who like the other and &#8212; no value judgment either way &#8212; we&#8217;ve largely lived with the free side of the magazine rack on the internet for the last 20 years … [But] 10 years from now, it&#8217;s likely that every piece of clothing, every ticket you buy to anything, will just be an NFT. You may not even realize that&#8217;s what the actual technology is [but] this is where the internet&#8217;s going.</p>
<p>The skepticism that you&#8217;re pointing out is very real. And the cost of playing in the Etherium ecosystem right now is extraordinary. It&#8217;s far too high and absolutely prohibitive for the mainstream. [But] there are other new blockchain technologies like Solana that are extraordinarily fast and efficient and really cheap and if you look at any NFT project leaderboards, there are more and more Solana projects rising.</p>
<p>BM: A lot of my personal mission is to see gender equality [through greater] participation in new, multitrillion-dollar internet ecosystems. Four years ago, I actually hosted a cryptocurrency conference for women and more than 20,000 women showed up live and virtually. I think bitcoin was like $5,000 or $6,000 at the time, and only 4% of the cryptocurrency holders were women. Fast-forward to today. It&#8217;s more like 20% are are female, but that&#8217;s still such a disparity, and there&#8217;s so much value being created.</p>
<p>To your point, there&#8217;s such a lack of education, therefore there&#8217;s also a lack of interesting access. [Yet by] getting first-look opportunities, you hear about things going on first, you get to participate in them when the floor price is lower, and the financial upside [is greater], so stay tuned for more from us on that front. I&#8217;m particularly excited about a project I&#8217;m incubating that I hope will help provide more women with education, access and financial upside in this new world.</p>

		Asa Forsell is a senior product manager for automotive at <a href="https://www.qt.io/company">The Qt Company</a>. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Matt Murphy, the CEO of U.S. chipmaker Marvell Technology, predicted in October that the semiconductor shortage will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/03/semiconductor-chip-shortage-could-extend-through-2022-marvell-ceo.html">extend into 2022 and beyond</a>. The shortage is already having a huge impact across the world, with German carmaker Opel announcing the pause of some of its operations <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/10/06/german-carmaker-opel-puts-brakes-on-production-amid-microchip-shortage">until the start of next year</a>.</p>
<p>And this is far from an isolated incident &#8212; the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders recently revealed that the number of new cars registered in the U.K. in September was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/05/uk-car-sales-electric-vehicles-petrol-crisis-chip-shortage">the lowest since 1998</a>. Across the world, automotive manufacturers are struggling with the semiconductor shortage, unable to build and sell enough cars to meet demand.</p>
<p>The impact, however, is even broader. Having seen a surge in demand through the pandemic, consumer electronics are also starting to be affected by the semiconductor shortage, with research suggesting that smartphone production will be <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/chip-shortage-apple-samsung-ps5-b1931862.html">hit harder than initially predicted</a>. Microsoft’s executive vice president of gaming, Phil Spencer, predicted that both Xbox and PlayStation game consoles will continue to be in short supply into next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240344" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is further demonstrated in <a href="https://www.qt.io/forrester-smarter-product-development-study">research we at The Qt Company recently undertook with Forrester,</a> which looked at the challenges facing the global manufacturing industry. A startling 80% of organizations we spoke to are currently struggling to produce digital products and services, and 62% attributed this to delays in semiconductor provision.</p>
<h2>No quick fix</h2>
<p>Through 2020, demand for digital products and services grew at an unprecedented rate, and this demand has not yet wavered. The research, which we undertook in the first half of 2021, further revealed that 82% of organizations stated that they need to quickly introduce new smart or connected products and services in order to maintain or grow their market position. For nearly eight out of 10 organizations (79%), this means focusing their attention on accelerating their software R&amp;D lifecycle.</p>
<p>As speed remains paramount for businesses, delays in semiconductor provision and software development cycles are causing significant issues. For many, these delays are lasting for several months. And let’s not forget that sitting firmly alongside the challenges in firmware is the ever-present specter of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-31/employers-bow-down-to-tech-workers-in-hottest-job-market">developer skills shortage</a>.</p>
<p>While there is no quick fix to talent and semiconductor shortages, there are changes businesses can make that can have an immediate and beneficial impact. And at the heart are the designers and developers who create and deliver the products and services that rely on semiconductors and embedded devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Challenging the development process</h2>
<p>Businesses must look at their ways of working in order to make fast and effective improvements now to avoid falling into a crisis. When looking at the product life cycle, most businesses have a very siloed approach to design and development, not only in terms of the way the teams interact — or, in most cases, don’t — from the outset of a project but also when considering the software and tools they use.</p>
<p>This leads directly to one of the core challenges in fast, efficient mobile app development — overly complex developer/design feedback loops. There is often a disconnect between developers who are tasked with making digital products and the designers who are more concerned about things like user experience and user interface.</p>
<p>The two operate in distinct silos when they should be working in tandem. Enabling collaboration between developers and designers is critical to expediting this process and making up some of the lost ground caused by the chip shortage.</p>
<h2>Unifying processes</h2>
<p>Unifying development and design tools and practices can turn design iterations from interruptions into contributions to the development process and break the cycle of painstaking feedback loops, helping brands bring products to market much faster.</p>
<p>Unifying design and development as “DevDes” &#8212; in the same way we think about software development with DevOps &#8212; means silos are broken down, workloads are lightened and delivery is simplified.</p>
<p>Cross-platform frameworks and tools are vital to blunt the effects of these market challenges, and digital product decision-makers will need to remain flexible and use what can be sourced whenever it can be sourced. For example, investing in flexible software tools and platforms that support a wide variety of silicon can reduce the impact of supply chain shortages.</p>
<p>But that isn’t the only benefit. Looking beyond the semiconductor shortage, product teams are often tasked with quickly developing and deploying products that can be used across multiple devices but still provide the end user with a seamless, native experience. Once again, taking out silos and embracing a DevDes approach with cross-platform frameworks can expedite the process while allowing the team to work in their native environments.</p>
<h2>Future-proof processes</h2>
<p>While we are all glad to be moving out of the eye of the pandemic and focusing on a more sustainable future, the lessons we have learned over these past 20 months cannot and should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>While we are unlikely to see such a sudden surge in demand for devices as we have, we are likely to see peaks again. And the expectations from consumers and businesses alike for faster delivery of better quality products — and a seamless experience over an increasing number of devices — is certainly a trend that will continue.</p>
<p>Developer burnout has been talked about widely, and the pressure to deliver more and faster without offering the necessary support is not sustainable. As we continue to train more developers to meet the skills shortage, enabling them to work in a truly integrated way with other parts of the product teams will be critical.</p>
<p>The semiconductor shortage is going to cause disruption for some time yet to come, so it is up to businesses to look now at the steps they can make in their existing processes, which will not only help them navigate this challenging time but set them up as future-proof. And that starts with the people and processes at the heart of the development lifecycle.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launched in 2003, LinkedIn quickly became the first global professional social media network by offering an easy way to make and track professional connections. At roughly the same time, Y Combinator (YC) and other accelerators emerged as a largely analog means for entrepreneurs willing to commit three months of time and ~6% of their company to receive <em>en masse</em> training and connections to mentors, peers and funders.</p>
<p>While both LinkedIn and Y Combinator are still going strong, a new crop of companies are looking to fill the gap between these two approaches via structured online experiences that provide a combination of training and connections to help people achieve their professional goals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The ease with which like-minded professionals can receive training, coaching and participate in communities, largely thanks to improving and scalable digital offers, is a key part of the unbundling we are seeing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The emergence of these companies is part of a broader trend of the democratization of professional development, sparked in part by increasing awareness and recognition of the mismatch between what traditional education is delivering to young people and what’s demanded by employers. Indeed, the <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/the-skills-gap-an-economic-burden-for-the-eu/">OECD estimated</a> in 2019 that at least 80 million workers in Europe are mismatched in terms of their qualifications and what’s demanded in the workforce across a wide range of industries.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s positive, then, that the unbundling process is improving access to high-quality professional education and development. Lower prices, shorter courses and content more closely tied to professions all make it easier for people to retrain and upskill where necessary.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when the only way to get a fantastic business education, for example, is via a $50,000-$250,000 MBA, and where the only route to highly skilled professions is via a $20,000-$300,000 university course. Similarly, within this increasingly democratized system, access to coaching and mentoring at the individual and group levels is improving.</p>
<p>New approaches range from companies like <a href="https://www.thepowermba.com/uk/">The PowerMBA</a>, which offers an MBA alternative for $800-$1,000, to <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/">On Deck</a>, which offers professional development courses and communities for about $3,000, and <a href="https://joindorm.com/">Dorm</a>, which sells mentorship support and networks to entrepreneurs for $150 per month.</p>
<p>What do these approaches have in common? They are typically digital, not accredited by traditional academic institutions, and are shorter, condensed, focused and tightly linked to careers and outcomes compared with traditional education courses. Many providers communicate and market themselves on the &#8220;exclusivity&#8221; and focus of their communities. Further, there will typically be some content associated with the courses — the amount will largely depend on the purposes of the course and offer (i.e., content is shared, but not the central offers of most accelerators, incubators and mentoring providers).</p>
<p>The main avenues of differentiation for this new wave of companies are price (depending on the amount of personalization available and the pricing model), duration (short, intensive, bootcamp-style or an annual recurring subscription), method of delivery (asynchronous and on-demand or synchronous and live), content focus (content-driven or focused on relationships and mentorship), degree of accreditation (degree of formality around certification and accreditation), and, of course, whether providers focus on specific roles or broad topics. It’s important to point out that most of these avenues are spectra along which providers can place themselves.</p>
<p>With this in mind, <a href="https://www.brighteyevc.com/">Brighteye Ventures</a> created <a href="https://www.brighteyevc.com/post/professional-development-and-entrepreneurship-education-insights-and-a-market-map">a market map of the range of organizations</a> supporting individuals to further their professional learning, with a particular focus on business and entrepreneurship education. It doesn’t aim to be exhaustive but rather highlights the broad range of groups operating in the space. We have, for indicative purposes, included total funding (including IPO) for the companies in each of the categories where suitable and available (via PitchBook).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adam Selipsky gave his first AWS re:Invent keynote this morning since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/">taking over as CEO from Andy Jassy</a> earlier this year. He had big shoes to fill, but it&#8217;s not as though Selipsky was a complete stranger to the AWS team. In fact, he had been at the division since its earliest days, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">helping Jassy to build</a> it into a substantial business, before leaving in 2016 to become CEO at Tableau.</p>
<p>He began the day with a history lesson, and he didn&#8217;t need to count on others to feed the background to him, given he had been there when they opened their doors in Seattle all those years ago, a pig-in-a-poke of an idea to sell web services.</p>
<p>As Selipsky told it when he presented the cloud infrastructure concept to early potential customers, they didn&#8217;t quite get it. &#8220;What does this have to do with selling books?&#8221; he was continually asked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241034" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While he didn&#8217;t share the answer he gave, I would speculate that it had nothing to with it, and it had everything to do with it. Years ago, at a presentation with Amazon CTO Werner Vogels, he talked about similar conversations. As he said at the time, Amazon was never about selling anything. It was about building a web business at scale.</p>
<p>If you look at the top three cloud infrastructure vendors today &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google &#8212; they are all really good at building businesses at scale, and running data centers is a big part of that. Looking back it seems almost logical that a bookseller came up with the idea of selling infrastructure services, but it certainly didn&#8217;t at the time.</p>
<p>In 2005 nobody really knew what the cloud was, or if they did, it wasn&#8217;t a concept that was widely understood. I remember the first time I heard the term in the 2008 timeframe at a Web 2.0 conference in Boston. There, representatives from Amazon, Google and Salesforce gave a talk on what the cloud was and why it mattered.</p>
<p>I remember IT people lining up at the microphones for questions and comments and being openly hostile to the concept. They weren&#8217;t sharing their company data with a bookseller that was for sure &#8212; until they did.</p>
<p>Even Selipsky himself didn&#8217;t completely get it when he came on board. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tx3oHzKarY">he told Bloomberg&#8217;s Emily Chang</a> in an interview recently, &#8220;So the call I got went something like, &#8216;We have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people.&#8217; And it sounded intriguing, but I confess I didn&#8217;t fully understand what that was all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Andy Jassy described the genesis of the idea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">in a 2016 TechCrunch article</a>, it came about during an executive offsite brainstorming session in 2003:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the team worked, Jassy recalled, they realized they had also become quite good at running infrastructure services like compute, storage and database (due to those previously articulated internal requirements). What’s more, they had become highly skilled at running reliable, scalable, cost-effective data centers out of need. As a low-margin business like Amazon, they had to be as lean and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>It was at that point, without even fully articulating it, that they started to formulate the idea of what AWS could be, and they began to wonder if they had an additional business providing infrastructure services to developers.</p></blockquote>
<p>And eventually, they did what they described to Selipsky when they recruited him in 2005. They turned guts of the bookselling website inside out and sold them back to customers. It didn&#8217;t have much to do with selling books, yet it had everything to do with it &#8212; and that idea today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">is a $60 billion business</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand shuttle and software company Via has raised another $130 million, capital that has pushed its valuation to about $3.3 billion as demand from cities to update its legacy transit systems rises.</p>
<p>The round was led by Janus Henderson with participation from funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, ION Crossover Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and existing investor Exor. To date, the company has raised $800 million.</p>
<p>Via, which today employs about 950 people, has two sides to its business. The company operates consumer-facing shuttles in Washington, D.C. and New York. Its underlying software platform, which it sells to cities, transportation authorities, school districts and universities to deploy their own shuttles, is not only the core of its business; it has become the primary driver of growth.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240798" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Daniel Ramot previously told TechCrunch that there was was little interest from cities in the software-as-a-service platform when the company first launched in 2012. Via landed its first city partnership with Austin in late 2017, after providing the platform to the transit authority for free. It was enough to allow Via to develop case studies and convince other cities to buy into the service. In 2019, the partnerships side of the business &#8220;took off,&#8221; Ramot said in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/on-demand-shuttle-startup-via-hits-2-25-billion-valuation-on-latest-funding-round-led-by-exor/">interview last year</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the software side — branded internally as TransitTech — has eclipsed its consumer-facing operations. Via said TransitTech revenue more than doubled year on year to exceed an annual run rate of $100 million. The software platform is used by more than 500 partners, including Los Angeles Metro. Jersey City and Miami in the United States as well as Arriva Bus UK, a Deutsche Bahn company that uses it for a first and last-mile service connecting commuters to a high-speed train station in Kent, U.K.</p>
<p>Via doesn&#8217;t provide specifics on what it plans to use the funds for. The company has made two acquisitions in the past t18 months, including Fleetonomy in 2020.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Via used <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">$100 million in cash and equity</a> to acquire Remix, a startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design. Remix became a subsidiary of Via, an arrangement that will let the startup maintain its independent brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition has already produced one product that combines Remix&#8217;s collaborative mapping and transit-planning tools with Via&#8217;s on-demand transit data. Earlier this month, Via launched a software tool to help cities understand and plan how on-demand rides and fixed route transit like buses, can work in tangent.</p>
