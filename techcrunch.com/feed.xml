										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration is outlining new plans to combat domestic terrorism in light of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and social media companies have their own part to play.</p>
<p>The White House released a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf">national strategy on countering domestic terrorism</a> Tuesday. The plan acknowledges the key role that online platforms play in bringing violent ideas into the mainstream, going as far as calling social media sites the &#8220;front lines&#8221; of the war on domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The widespread availability of domestic terrorist recruitment material online is a national security threat whose front lines are overwhelmingly private–sector online platforms, and we are committed to informing more effectively the escalating efforts by those platforms to secure those front lines,&#8221; the White House plan states.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Biden administration committed to more information sharing with the tech sector to fight the tide of online extremism, part of a push to intervene well before extremists can organize violence. According to a fact sheet on the new domestic terror plan, the U.S. government will prioritize &#8220;increased information sharing with the technology sector,&#8221; specifically online platforms where extremism is incubated and organized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuing to enhance the domestic terrorism–related information offered to the private sector, especially the technology sector, will facilitate more robust efforts outside the government to counter terrorists’ abuse of Internet–based communications platforms to recruit others to engage in violence,&#8221; the White House plan states.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eeDxlInxsz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/capitol-attack-social-media-inauguration-day/">Threat of inauguration violence casts a long shadow over social media</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Threat of inauguration violence casts a long shadow over social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/capitol-attack-social-media-inauguration-day/embed/#?secret=eeDxlInxsz" data-secret="eeDxlInxsz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/politics/white-house-strategy-domestic-terrorism/index.html">remarks</a> timed with the release of the domestic terror strategy, Attorney General Merrick Garland asserted that coordinating with the tech sector is &#8220;particularly important&#8221; for interrupting extremists who organize and recruit on online platforms and emphasized plans to share enhanced information on potential domestic terror threats.</p>
<p>In spite of the new initiatives, the Biden administration admits that that domestic terrorism recruitment material will inevitably remain available online, particularly on platforms that don&#8217;t prioritize its removal — like most social media platforms, prior to January 2021 — and on end-to-end encrypted apps, many of which saw an influx of users when social media companies cracked down on extremism in the U.S. earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dealing with the supply is therefore necessary but not sufficient: we must address the demand too,&#8221; the White House plan states. &#8220;Today’s digital age requires an American population that can utilize essential aspects of Internet–based communications platforms while avoiding vulnerability to domestic terrorist recruitment and other harmful content.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Biden administration will also address vulnerability to online extremism through digital literacy programs, including &#8220;educational materials&#8221; and &#8220;skills–enhancing online games&#8221; designed to inoculate Americans against domestic extremism recruitment efforts, and presumably disinformation and misinformation more broadly.</p>
<p>The plan stops short of naming domestic terror elements like QAnon and the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement specifically, though it acknowledges the range of ways domestic terror can manifest, from small informal groups to organized militias.</p>
<p>A report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in March <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2194-unclassified-summary-of-assessment-on-domestic-violent-extremism">observed</a> the elevated threat to the U.S. that domestic terrorism poses in 2021, noting that domestic extremists leverage mainstream social media sites to recruit new members, organize in-person events and share materials that can lead to violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How big is the market in India for a neobank aimed at teenagers? Scores of high-profile investors are backing a startup to find out.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://fampay.in">FamPay</a> said on Wednesday it has raised $38 million in its Series A round led by Elevation Capital. General Catalyst, Rocketship VC, Greenoaks Capital and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital and Venture Highway also participated in the new round, which brings FamPay&#8217;s to-date raise to $42.7 million.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> early this month that FamPay was in talks with Elevation Capital to raise a new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/_SambhavJain_">Sambhav Jain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamkushtaneja">Kush Taneja</a> (pictured above) &#8212; both of whom graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2019 &#8212; FamPay enables teenagers to make online and offline payments.</p>
<p>The thesis behind the startup, said Jain in an interview with TechCrunch, is to provide financial literacy to teenagers, who additionally have limited options to open a bank account in India at a young age. Through gamification, the startup said it’s making lessons about money fun for youngsters.</p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., where it’s common for teenagers to get jobs at restaurants and other places and understand how to handle money at a young age, a similar tradition doesn’t exist in India.</p>
<p>After gathering the consent from parents, FamPay provides teenagers with an app to make online purchases, as well as plastic cards &#8212; the only numberless card of its kind in the country &#8212; for offline transactions. Parents credit money to their children’s FamPay accounts and get to keep track of high-ticket spendings.</p>
<p>In other markets, including the U.S., a number of startups including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/">Till Financial</a> are chasing to serve the teenagers, but in India, there currently is no startup looking to solve the financial access problem for teenagers, said Mridul Arora, a partner at Elevation Capital, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It could prove to be a good issue to solve &#8212; India has the largest adolescent population in the world.</p>
<p>“If you’re able to serve them at a young age, over a course of time, you stand to become their go-to product for a lot of things,” Arora said. “FamPay is serving a population that is very attractive and at the same time underserved.”</p>
<p>The current offerings of FamPay are just the beginning, said Jain. Eventually the startup wishes to provide a range of services and serve as a neobank for youngsters to retain them with the platform forever, he said, though he didn’t wish to share currently what those services might be.</p>

<p>Teens represent the “most tech-savvy generation, as they haven’t seen a world without the internet,” he said. “They adapt to technology faster than any other target audience and their first exposure with the internet comes from the likes of Instagram and Netflix. This leads to higher expectations from the products that they prefer to use. We are unique in approaching banking from a whole new lens with our recipe of community and gamification to match the Gen Z vibe.”</p>
<p>“I don’t look at FamPay just as a payments service. If the team is able to execute this, FamPay can become a very powerful gateway product to teenagers in India and their financial life. It can become a neobank, and it also has the opportunity to do something around social, community and commerce,” said Arora.</p>
<p>During their college life, Jain and Taneja collaborated and built an app and worked at a number of startups, including social network ShareChat, logistics firm Rivigo and video streaming service Hotstar. Jain said their work with startups in the early days paved the idea to explore a future in this ecosystem.</p>
<p>Prior to arriving at FamPay, Jain said the duo had thought about several more ideas for a startup. The early days of FamPay were uniquely challenging to the founders, who had to convince their parents about their decision to do a startup rather than joining firms or startups as had most of their peers from college. Until being selected by Y Combinator, Jain said he didn’t even fully understand a cap table and dilutions.</p>
<p>He credited entrepreneurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11">Kunal Shah</a> (founder of CRED) and <a href="https://twitter.com/amrishrau">Amrish Rau</a> (CEO of Pine Labs) for being generous with their time and guidance. They also wrote some of the earliest checks to the startup.</p>
<p>The startup, which has amassed over 2 million registered users, plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its user base and product offerings, and hire engineers. It is also looking for people to join its leadership team, said Jain.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“If you’re not going to an Ivy League, which is most of the world, you need better support than just going to a website.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.applyboard.com/">ApplyBoard</a>, a startup that helps international students find opportunities to study abroad, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210615005210/en/ApplyBoard-Announces-C375M-Investment-Round-with-a-Valuation-of-C4B-to-Meet-Expanding-International-Student-Demand">announced</a> today that it has nearly doubled its valuation in a little over a year. The Ontario-based company is now worth around $3.2 billion after raising a $300 million Series D round led by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.</p>
<p>ApplyBoard makes money from revenue-sharing agreements with colleges and universities. If a student attends a college after using their services, ApplyBoard receives a cut of the tuition. Meanwhile, the service, which helps students search and apply to schools, is free to use.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbasiri?originalSubdomain=ca">Martin Basiri </a>did not share specifics on revenue, but he confirmed that his company is growing its sales at a 400% year-over-year rate in 2021. For context, sales in 2019 hit $300 million, meaning that ApplyBoard is making at least $1.2 billion in sales this year.</p>
<p>These figures violate the prevailing edtech narrative from last year: <em>Higher ed is dead! Students don’t want to attend college anymore. Bring back the gap year, but make it permanent! </em></p>
<p>Instead, this company is proving that the university tech stack is more lucrative than many assumed, especially if you look beyond content offerings and into back-end marketing support.</p>
<p>My take: Startups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;Students want a seamless and pain-free application process&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>ApplyBoard’s recent fundraising efforts shed a light on its strategy to become, effectively, a tech-savvy guidance counselor for the approximately 200,000 students that it has served to date.</p>
<p>The company raised a $55 million extension round in September to bring on a partner, Education Testing Services (ETS) Strategy Capital, the venture arm of the world’s largest nonprofit education testing and assessment organization. ETS helps administer the TOEFL English-language proficiency test and the GRE graduate admissions test.</p>
<p>The synergies there led ApplyBoard to launch ApplyProof, a service that helps admissions and immigrant officers verify documents that international students need to apply to colleges around the world. Today’s financing event similarly brings in a strategic investor, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.</p>
<p>“The demand remains high post-pandemic and we continue to see a strong, pent-up demand from students wishing to study abroad,” Basiri said. “Students want a seamless and pain-free application process and be able to have all the information they need to make an informed decision.”</p>

<h2>How to identify unicorn founders when they’re still early-stage</h2>
<p>What are investors looking for?</p>
<p>Founders often tie themselves in knots as they try to project qualities they hope investors are seeking. In reality, few entrepreneurs have the acting skills required to convince someone that they&#8217;re patient, dedicated or hard working.</p>
<p>Johan Brenner, general partner at Creandum, was an early backer of Klarna, Spotify and several other European startups. Over the last two decades, he&#8217;s identified five key traits shared by people who create billion-dollar companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;A true unicorn founder doesn’t need to have all of those capabilities on day one,&#8221; says Brenner, &#8220;but they should already be thinking big while executing small and demonstrating that they understand how to scale a company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scale co-founder and CEO Alex Wang joined us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> this week to discuss his company&#8217;s role in the autonomous driving industry and how it&#8217;s changed in the five years since its founding. Scale helps large and small AV players establish reliable &#8220;ground truth&#8221; through data annotation and management, and along the way, the standards for what that means have shifted as the industry matures.</p>
<h2>Good data is the &#8220;good bones&#8221; of autonomous driving systems</h2>
<p>Even if two algorithms in autonomous driving might be created more or less equal, their real-world performance could vary dramatically based on what they&#8217;re consuming in terms of input data. That&#8217;s where Scale&#8217;s value prop to the industry starts, and Wang explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think about a traditional software system, the thing that will separate a good software system from a bad software system is the code, the quality of the code. For an AI system, which all of these self-driving vehicles or autonomous vehicles are, it&#8217;s the data that really separates an amazing algorithm from a bad algorithm. And so one thing we saw was that being one of the stewards and shepherds of high-quality data was going to be incredibly important for the industry, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s played out. We work with many of the great companies in the space, from Aurora to Nuro to Toyota to General Motors, and our work with all of them is ensuring that they have really a solid data foundation, so they can build the rest of their stacks on top of it. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 06:24)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Location-based services may have had their day as a salient category for hot apps or innovative tech leveraging the arrival of smartphones, but that&#8217;s largely because they are now part of the unspoken fabric of how we interact with digital services every day: we rely on location specific information when we are on search engines, when we are using maps, or weather apps, or taking and posting photos and more.</p>
<p>Still, there remain a lot of gaps in how location information links up with accurate information, and so today a company that&#8217;s made it its business to address that is announcing some funding as it scales up its service.</p>
<p><a href="https://uberall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uberall</a>, which works with retailers and other brick-and-mortar operators to help them update and provide more accurate information about themselves across the plethora of apps and other services that consumers use to discover them, is announcing $115 million in funding. Alongside that, the Berlin startup is making an acquisition: it&#8217;s buying <a href="https://momentfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MomentFeed</a>, a location marketing company based out of Los Angeles, CA, to continue scaling its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by London-based investor Bregal Milestone, with Level Equity, United Internet and Uberall management also participating. From what we understand from sources, the funding values Uberall at around $500 million, and the deal for MomentFeed was made for between $50 million and $60 million.</p>
<p>The business combination is building way more scale into the platform: Uberall said that together they will manage the online presence for 1.35 million business locations, making the company the biggest in the field, with customers including the gas station operator BP, KFC, clothes and food chain Marks and Spencer, McDonald&#8217;s and Pizza Hut.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Florian Hübner, the CEO and co-founder of Uberall, noted in an interview that the companies have <a href="https://uberall.com/en-us/products/uberall-vs-momentfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite a lot of overlap</a>, and in fact prior to the deal being made the companies worked together closely in the U.S. market, but all the same, MomentFeed has built some specific technology that will enrich the wider platform, such as a particularly strong tool for measuring sentiment analysis.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Managing the online presence&#8221; is not a company&#8217;s website, nor is it its apps, but may nevertheless be its most common digital touchpoints when it comes to actually engaging with consumers online. It includes how those companies appear on local listings services like Yelp or TripAdvisor, or mapping apps like Google&#8217;s &#8212; which provide not just listings information like addresses and opening hours but also customer reviews &#8212; or social apps or location-based advertising. Altogether, when you are considering a company with multiple locations and the multiple touchpoints a consumer might use, it ends up being a complicated mess of places that need to be managed and kept up to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the catalyst for this huge ecosystem where we enable the brands to use everything that the other tech platforms are offering in the best possible way,&#8221; Hübner told me. The tech platforms, meanwhile, are willing to work with middle-ware companies like Uberall to make the information on their services more accurate and complete by connecting with businesses when they have not manage to do so directly on their own. (And if you&#8217;ve ever been caught out by the wrong opening times on a Google Maps entry, or any other entry or piece of information elsewhere, you know this is an issue.)</p>
<p>And of course expecting any company with potentially hundreds of locations to provide the right details without a tool is also a non-starter. &#8220;Casually updating 100,000 profiles is super hard,&#8221; Hübner said.</p>
<p>It also provides services to update information about vaccine and Covid-19 testing clinics, as well as other essential services that also have to contend with the same variations in location, opening hours and customer feedback as any other business on a site like Google Maps.</p>
<p>Altogether, Uberall has built out a platform that essentially connects up all of those end points, so that an Uberall customer can use a dashboard to provide updates that populate automatically everywhere, and also to read and respond to reviews.</p>
<p>Conversely, Uberall also can look out for instances where a company is being unofficially represented, or mis-represented and locks those down. Alongside those, it has built a location-based marketing service that also serves ads for its customers. It is somewhat akin to social media management tools, which let you manage social media accounts and social media marketing campaigns, except that it&#8217;s covering a much more fragmented and disparate set of places where a company might appear online.</p>
<p>The bigger picture here is that just as location-based marketing is a fragmented business, so is the business of providing services to manage it. This move reduces down that field a little more and improves the efficiency of scaling such services.</p>
<p>“As we saw the market trending towards consolidation, we considered several potential companies to merge with. Uberall was by far our most preferred,” said MomentFeed CEO Nick Hedges in a statement. “This combination makes enormous strategic sense for our customers, who represent the who’s-who of leading U.S. omni channel brands. It helps accelerate our already rapid pace of innovation, giving customers an even greater edge in the hyper-competitive world of ’Near Me’ Marketing.” After the deal closes, Hedges will become Uberall&#8217;s chief strategy officer and EVP for North America.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with the Uberall team for this next phase of growth. Our strategic investment will significantly accelerate Uberall’s ambition to become the leading ‘Near Me’ Customer Experience platform worldwide. Uberall’s differentiated full-suite solution is unsurpassed by competition in terms of integration and functionality, providing customers with a real edge to reach, interact with, and convert online customers. We look forward to supporting Florian, Nick and their talented team to deliver on their exciting innovation and expansion roadmap.” said Cyrus Shey, managing partner of Bregal Milestone, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What, exactly, are investors looking for?</p>
<p>Early-stage founders, usually first-timers, often tie themselves in knots as they try to project the qualities they hope investors are seeking. In reality, few entrepreneurs have the acting skills required to convince someone that they&#8217;re patient, dedicated or hard-working.</p>
<p>Johan Brenner, general partner at Creandum, was an early backer of Klarna, Spotify and several other European startups. Over the last two decades, he&#8217;s identified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/how-to-identify-unicorn-founders-when-theyre-still-early-stage/">five key traits shared by people who create billion-dollar companies</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;A true unicorn founder doesn’t need to have all of those capabilities on Day One,&#8221; says Brenner, &#8220;but they should already be thinking big while executing small and demonstrating that they understand how to scale a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawing from observations gleaned from working with founders like Spotify&#8217;s Daniel Ek, Sebastian Siemiatkowski from Klarna, and iZettle&#8217;s Jacob de Geer and Magnus Nilsson, Brenner explains where &#8220;VC FOMO&#8221; comes from and how it drives dealmaking.</p>

<p>Founded in 2013 and based in São Paulo, Brazil, Nubank serves more than 34 million customers, making it Latin America&#8217;s largest neobank.</p>
<p>Reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcemccarthy">Marcella McCarthy</a> spoke to CEO David Velez to learn about his efforts to connect with consumers and overcome entrenched opposition from established players who were friendly with regulators.</p>
<p>In the first of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">a series of stories for Nubank&#8217;s EC-1</a>, she interviewed Velez about his early fundraising efforts. For a balanced perspective, she also spoke to early Nubank investors at Sequoia and Kaszek Ventures, Latin America&#8217;s largest venture fund, to find out why they funded the startup while it was still pre-product.</p>
<p>“There are people you come across in life that within the first hour of meeting with them, you know you want to work with them,” said Doug Leone, a global managing partner at Sequoia who&#8217;d recruited Velez after he graduated from grad school at Stanford.</p>
<p>Marcella also interviewed members of Nubank&#8217;s founding team to better understand why they decided to take a chance on a startup that faced such long odds of success.</p>
<p>“I left banking to make a fifth of my salary, and back then, about $5,000 in equity,” said Vitor Olivier, Nubank&#8217;s VP of operations and platforms.</p>
<p>“Financially, it didn’t really make sense, so I really had to believe that it was really going to work, and that it would be big.”</p>

<p>In his last dispatch before a week&#8217;s vacation, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> waded through the numbers in Didi&#8217;s SEC filing. The big takeaways?</p>
<p>&#8220;While Didi managed an impressive GTV recovery in China, its aggregate numbers are flatter, and recent quarterly trends are not incredibly attractive,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>However, &#8220;Didi is not as unprofitable as we might have anticipated. That’s a nice surprise. But the company’s regular business has never made money, and it’s losing more lately than historically, which is also pretty rough.&#8221;</p>

<p>They also talked about overseas expansion — a common trajectory for China’s top autonomous vehicle startups — and shed light on the challenges and opportunities for foreign AV companies eyeing the massive Chinese market.</p>

<p>&#8220;As in any disruptive industry, the forecast may be cloudier than the rosy picture painted by passionate founders and investors,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/breadfrom">Aria Alamalhodaei</a> writes. &#8220;A quick peek at comments and posts on LinkedIn reveals squabbles among industry insiders and analysts about when this emerging technology will truly take off and which companies will come out ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while some electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) companies have no revenue yet to speak of — and may not for the foreseeable future — valuations are skyrocketing.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a few changes to short-term strategy — and a longer-term plan that takes into account the fact that people are awakening to the value of their online data — advertisers can form a new type of relationship with consumers,&#8221; Permission.io CTO Hunter Jensen writes in a guest column. &#8220;It can be built upon trust and open exchange of value.&#8221;</p>
<p>If offered the right incentives, Jensen predicts, &#8220;consumers will happily consent to data collection because advertisers will be offering them something they value in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Raquel Urtasun, the former chief scientist at Uber ATG, is the founder and CEO of Waabi, an autonomous vehicle startup that came out of stealth mode last week. The Toronto-based company, which will focus on trucking, raised an impressive $83.5 million in a Series A round led by Khosla Ventures.</p>
<p>Urtasun joined Mobility 2021 to talk about her new venture, the challenges facing the self-driving vehicle industry and how her approach to AI can be used to advance the commercialization of AVs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pony.ai, the robotaxi startup that operates in China and the United States, has started testing driverless vehicles on public roads in California ahead of plans to launch a commercial service there in 2022.</p>
<p>The company said the driverless vehicle testing, which means the autonomous vehicles operate without human safety drivers behind the wheel, is happening daily on public roads in Fremont and Milpitas, California. Pony.ai is also testing its driverless vehicles in Guangzhou, China.</p>
<p>Pony.ai said it also plans to resume a rideshare service to the public in Irvine this summer using AVs with a human safety driver. Its goal is to roll out the fully driverless service to the public in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Going completely driverless is key to achieving full autonomy and an indispensable catalyst to realizing our ambitious vision,&#8221; said James Peng, CEO and co-founder of Pony.ai.</p>
<p>Pony.ai still has some regulatory hurdles to clear before it can operate commercially. Autonomous vehicle companies that want to charge the public for driverless rides need both the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission to issue deployment permits. In early June, Cruise became the first company to receive a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">driverless autonomous service permit</a> from the California PUC that allows it to test transporting passengers. The final step with the DMV, which only Nuro has achieved, is a deployment permit.</p>
<p>Pony&#8217;s driverless testing milestone in California comes a month after the state issued the company a permit to test a fleet of six driverless vehicles in a geographic area that spans about 39 square miles. While dozens of companies &#8212; <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/">55 in all</a> &#8212; have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it is less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Pony was the eighth company to be issued a driverless testing permit in the state, a list that includes Chinese companies AutoX, Baidu and WeRide as well as U.S. businesses Cruise, Nuro, Waymo and Zoox. Only Nuro has been granted a so-called deployment permit, which allows it to operate commercially.</p>
<p>Pony.ai, which was founded in 2016 by former Baidu developers Peng and Lou Tiancheng, has been allowed to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2017.  The driverless permit issued in May by the California DMV expanded upon Pony&#8217;s existing activity in the state.</p>
<p>Pony has tested ridesharing in Fremont and Irvine, California. In 2019, a fleet of electric, autonomous Hyundai Kona crossovers equipped with a self-driving system from Pony.ai and Via&#8217;s ride-hailing platform began shuttling customers on public roads. The robotaxi service, called BotRide, wasn&#8217;t a driverless service, as there was a human safety driver behind the wheel at all times. The BotRide pilot concluded in January 2020.</p>
<p>The company then started operating a public robotaxi service called PonyPilot in the Irvine area. Pony shifted that robotaxi service from shuttling people to packages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pony.ai also partnered with e-commerce platform Yamibuy to provide autonomous last-mile delivery service to customers in Irvine. The delivery service was launched to provide additional capacity to address the surge of online orders triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pony.ai said at the time.</p>
<p>As the pandemic eases and California returns to normal operations, Pony is preparing to launch a commercial robotaxi service. It has already amassed a number of partners and more than $1 billion in funding, including $400 million from Toyota, to help it achieve that goal. Last November, the company said its valuation had reached $5.3 billion following a fresh injection of $267 million in funding. Pony has several partnerships or collaborations with automakers and suppliers, including Bosch, Hyundai and Toyota.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health startup Ksana Health has received $2 million in seed funding led by re:Mind Capital, the mental health VC arm of Christian Angermayer and Apeiron Investment Group. It’s a move informed by two trends: passive data collection, and a burgeoning mental health crisis in teens and young adults. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ksana Health is an Oregon-based company founded two years ago by University of Oregon Professor </span><a href="https://psychology.uoregon.edu/profile/nallen3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas Allen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a clinical psychologist and director of the Center for Digital Mental Health. Ksana&#8217;s platforms focus on collecting data related to mental health, and transfer that data from user to healthcare practitioners through an app. It&#8217;s, in essence, a mobile therapy app with a highly detailed dashboard of patient information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has twelve employees, and other investors in the round include WPSS Investments, Panoramic Ventures, the Telosity Fund, Palo Santo Venture Fund, and Able Partners. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Ksana Health has one live product called the ‘Effortless Assessment Research System’ (EARS) which is designed for institutions conducting clinical research. Participants in clinical trials can download an app and opt-in to sharing data including movement, location (via GPS), keystrokes and patterns in written language content with the trial’s investigators (no specific messages are shared). The app’s connection also goes two ways: trial administrators can send out things like surveys to keep in touch with participants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EARS product, says Allen, has already generated about $900,000 in revenue based on usage in clinical trials, but this most recent round of funding is geared towards another product called Vira, aimed at consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vira will also passively collect data like exercise (via an accelerometer), screen time, keystrokes or location-based data via a smartphone or smart device. Screenshots from Vira&#8217;s dashboard also include sleep data, though that&#8217;s not specifically listed as a recorded variable on the <a href="https://ksanahealth.com/vira">company&#8217;s website at the moment</a>. Instead of funneling that data to a clinical trial, the data will be accessible to a patient’s therapist. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dZj5msJwFb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/what-happens-to-edtech-when-kids-go-back-to-school/">What happens to edtech when kids go back to school?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What happens to edtech when kids go back to school?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/what-happens-to-edtech-when-kids-go-back-to-school/embed/#?secret=dZj5msJwFb" data-secret="dZj5msJwFb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user would give a therapist a personalized code which allows them to access data collected on their phone. Then, a therapist might discuss those habits, and program behavioral nudges to pop up on a phone during the day, reminding the user to exercise, or wind down before bed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically what this system does is it allows some of the data that&#8217;s been collected by the way people use their cell phones in a day to day fashion [to be turned] into indicators of important health behaviors that we know are relevant to mental health – so things like sleep, physical activity, geographic mobility, mood, cognition, social connection,” Allen says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vira is a major force of forward momentum for Ksana Health. The company was also selected as part of the insurance company Anthem Inc.’s, </span><a href="https://www.thinkanthem.com/uncategorized/anthems-digital-incubator-supports-entrepreneurs-growth-through-collaboration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Incubator program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That inclusion allows Vira to be trialled within Beacon Health Options, a behavioral health company with 37 million members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vira has yet to launch, but the key audience, says Allen, is people 13 to 30 years old. Rates of mental health issues within this group have increased even before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/abn-abn0000410.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abnormal Psychology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the rate of young adults (18 to 25) reporting signs of major depression jumped 63 percent (from 7.7 to 13.1 percent) between 2009 and 2017. Meanwhile, there was no significant increase in the percentage of older adults experiencing mental distress or depression in that study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer Vira seems to offer is extremely detailed data on well-being that will be funneled to a therapist. Data collection in the mental health space isn’t unheard of – Some AI-based mental health chatbots do indeed analyze user conversations, but those conversations happen within the confines of an app. Vira, conversely, is capable of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">collecting data on a variety of variables that are passively trackable by a phone, and have some bearing on mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critically, there are no clinical trials of Vira itself right now, but the concept of the app is based on research that verifies each one of its’ individual parts. For instance, there is evidence that </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/11203"><span style="font-weight: 400;">la</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nguage used on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can predict mood disorders, and that lack of sleep (or in some cases, excessive sleep) is linked to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005791617300629?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety and depression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some sense, Ksana Health is somewhat reminiscent of a cadre of software betting that improving mental health is partially a factor of increased vigilance of digital life, particularly among teens. A.I-based software like GoGuardian for instance, have been used in school to record students keystrokes or search histories, in an attempt to head off student suicides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoGuardian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/student-suicides-nevada-coronavirus.html">was used</a> in Clark County district in Nevada, the fifth largest school district in the country, and flagged 3,100 potential signs of self-harm between June and October 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/risks-and-rewards-of-digital-therapeutics-in-treating-mental-disorders/</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like GoGuardian, Ksana Health is also catalogs digital activity as an indicator of mental health (note the inclusion of key strokes and language patterns, not just health variables like exercise), but Ksana Health’s focus also appears to be less on flagging harmful behavior automatically, and more about providing an extremely detailed data dashboard to a human therapist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus initially is to keep, for want of a better term, a human in the loop,” says Allen. Ksana Health also isn’t AI- based, so it may be harder to scale, but Allen sees this as a benefit, not a liability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re focused on embedding this within practitioners,” he says. “There&#8217;s obvious appeal to the scale of a fully automated solution, you know you can scale it up very quickly. But I think the problems with safety are very significant in those systems.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comprehensive array of data, but particularly the language component, says Jan Hardorp, a founding partner at re:Mind Capital, is one aspect that attracted the firm to Ksana Health. Hardorp will also have a seat on Ksana Health’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that language is very strong and variable, and then combined with other sensors, is a very good technological basis in order to assess and predict mental mental state and depression,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move fits within re:Mind’s somewhat unconventional approaches to mental health: Angermayer held a 22 percent stake in Compass Pathways, a company pursuing psychedelics as a fast-acting treatment for depression. That stake was worth about </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/a-bet-on-magic-mushrooms-made-one-investor-316-million-richer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$316 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the company’s September 2020 IPO. Angermayer’s other public investments span from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/billionaire-took-psychedelics-got-bitcoin-and-is-now-into-spacs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies to cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardorp says that overall, re:Mind’s activities are focused on one third novel treatments (like psychedelics), one third brain computer interfaces, and one third into technology. Ksana Health fits squarely in that third category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen says the company is already planning clinical trials of the Vira program in addition to the pilot program with Beacon Health. But Hardorp notes that so far, the lack of clinical trials on Vira itself hasn’t given him pause. He takes the strength of the EARS platform as a signal that Ksana Health’s platform is viable in the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re quite confident that it’s really the same technology. The Vira product, if you want, is really a new front-end to existing technology and algorithms,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, the Vira platform isn’t commercially available, but Allen is anticipating a launch in the first quarter of 2022. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV sales are driving demand for services and startups that fulfill the new needs of drivers, charging station operators and others. Evette Ellis and Ben Schippers took to the main stage at TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 to share how their companies capitalize off the new opportunities presented by the electric transportation revolution.</p>
<p>Ellis is the co-founder and chief workforce officer of ChargerHelp, an on-demand EV charging station repair company. She spoke about how the company approaches hiring and training, why it engages with workforce development centers, and how training in cohorts makes economic sense. Farther down, we&#8217;ll hear from Schippers, the founder of TezLab.</p>
<h2>Why the company works with workforce development centers</h2>
<p>Workforce development is a government-run and -funded system to connect job seekers with employers, training and career development. There are thousands of job centers across the country, coordinated by the U.S. Department of Labor, that serve millions of Americans. Evette described why she and co-founder Kameale Terry wanted to engage with workforce development from the beginning.</p>

<blockquote><p>We really, really wanted to pioneer this idea that you can work with a workforce development center, who our federal government pays lots of money to train and do all the things that you need to get a great talent source, to create that pipeline, to use those pipelines for industries outside of construction or entry-level medical, but also for tech. Tech is the biggest industry in our country and it&#8217;s really running the show right now. We wanted to make sure that underrepresented communities didn’t get left out of this shift that is clearly happening. <strong>(Timestamp: 13:54)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscribers of MTN, the largest telecom provider in Nigeria, may soon face service disruption in the West African nation, according to a notice seen by some journalists and outlets. </span></p>
<p>A rise in insecurity challenges in Nigeria is likely to disrupt MTN&#8217;s service, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/mtn-nigeria-comm-security/update-1-mtn-warns-of-service-disruption-in-nigeria-due-to-rising-insecurity-idUSL2N2NX0XR">Reuters</a> and others said, citing an alert from customer service reps. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout this year, Nigerians have had to battle kidnappings, clashes between farmers and herders, mass abductions of students and armed robberies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we must inform you that with the rising insecurity in different parts of Nigeria, service delivery to your organization may </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the coming days. This means that in some cases, our technical support team may not be able to get to your site and achieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turnaround time in fault management as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as possible,” MTN <a href="https://twitter.com/MuvunyiF/status/1404781767802998787">reportedly</a> said in the message. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MTN didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When MTN Nigeria published its financial report for Q1 2021, it showed strong growth as data revenue grew by 43% year-on-year to N106 billion ($257 million), contributing to 28% of its total revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data revenue growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was propelled by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 21% year-on-year jump in active data subscribers to 32.5 million and a 27% year-on-year increase in smartphone penetration to 36.3 million. These numbers reflect MTN&#8217;s dominance in Nigeria. Per data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecom operator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is responsible for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 43% of Nigeria&#8217;s internet subscribers and 38% of the country&#8217;s mobile subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most network providers in the country, MTN&#8217;s services have been a tale of two experiences: good and subpar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nigerians who spoke with TechCrunch have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the latter these past few weeks following the government&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">decision to ban Twitter</a> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fears of internet restriction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports from <a href="https://punchng.com/telecoms-services-face-disruption-as-workers-threaten-strike/">local media</a> seem to corroborate Reuters, albeit for a different reason: a union&#8217;s nationwide strike against all network providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union PTECSSAN (Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria), which comprises senior telecommunications staff in the country, announced that it would be embarking on a three-day industrial strike starting Wednesday to protest the &#8220;arbitrary sack of workers and casualisation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PTECSSAN accused telecommunications companies in Nigeria for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. First, breaching freedom of association and right of workers to organise; victimisation of union members; and poor and discriminatory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remuneration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also claimed that telecom operators abused expatriate quotas, practiced intimidation, and have harassed and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">verbally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assaulted employees, among other anti-labour practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several MTN customer care agents TechCrunch reached out to were either unaware or refuted the aforementioned message. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have such network glitches,&#8221; one said. &#8220;Kindly be aware that we don&#8217;t have any information on any service disruption in the coming days. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have any information about that, we&#8217;ll let our customers know via messages as soon as possible,&#8221; another agent responded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As an early-stage VC, you spend time with hundreds of fantastic startups, trying to identify potential winners by thinking about market size, business model and competition. Nevertheless, deep down you know that in the long run, it all comes down to the team and the founder(s).</p>
<p>When we look at the most successful companies in our portfolio, their amazing performance is in large part thanks to the founders. However, even after 20 years in the industry, I have to admit that analyzing the team is still the most challenging part of the job. How do you evaluate a young first-time entrepreneur of an early-stage company with little traction?</p>

	</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.creandum.com/">Creandum</a>, in the past 18 years, we have been fortunate to work with some of Europe’s most successful startup founders such as Daniel Ek from Spotify, Sebastian Siemiatkowski from Klarna, Johannes Schildt from Kry, Jacob de Geer and Magnus Nilsson from iZettle, Emil Eifrem from Neo4J, Christian Hecker from Trade Republic and many more.</p>
<p>After a while, we realized that these incredible entrepreneurs all share some fundamental characteristics. They all have lots of energy, work hard, show patience, perseverance and resilience. But on top of that, all these unicorn founders share five key traits that, as an investor, you should look for when you back them at an early stage.</p>
<h2>They know what they don’t know</h2>
<p>Many people expect a typical startup founder to be very confident and have a strong sales mentality. While they should definitely live up to those expectations, the best founders are also humble and well aware of their weaknesses and limitations as well as the potential challenges for their startup.</p>
<p>They keep wanting to learn, improve and grow the business beyond what average people have the energy and drive to manage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">announced</a> a slew of new audio products, including its Clubhouse clone, called Live Audio Rooms, which will be available across both Facebook and Messenger. Since May, Facebook has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/facebook-begins-testing-clubhouse-rival-expanding-audio-suite">publicly testing</a> the audio rooms feature in Taiwan with public figures, but today the company hosted its first public test of Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. The event itself was hosted by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who chatted with fellow execs and creators.</p>
<p>Joining Zuckerberg were Facebook VP and Head of Facebook Reality Labs Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Head of Facebook App Fidji Simo and three Facebook Gaming creators, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=stonemountain64">StoneMountain64</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueenEliminator">QueenEliminator</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=thefiercediva">TheFierceDivaQueen</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166464" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166464" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2166464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fb-audio-room.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166464" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The creators used their time in the Audio Room to talk more about their gaming journeys on Facebook, what kind of games they were streaming and other gaming-related matters. Zuckerberg also briefly teased new gaming features, including a new type of post, coming soon, called &#8220;Looking for Players.&#8221; This post type will help creators find others in the community to play games with while they&#8217;re streaming.</p>
<p>In addition, badges that are earned from livestreams will now carry over to fan groups, Zuckerberg said, adding that it was a highly requested feature by creators and fans alike.</p>
<p>Fan groups will also now become available to all partnered creators on Facebook Gaming, starting today, and will roll out to others in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166463" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166463" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2166463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9730.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>The experience of using the Live Audio Room is very much like what you&#8217;d expect on another platform, like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces. The event&#8217;s hosts appear in rounded profile icons at the top of the screen, while the listeners appear in the bottom half of the screen, as smaller icons. In between is a section that includes people followed by the speakers.</p>
<p>The active speaker is indicated with a glowing ring in shades of Facebook blue, purple and pink. If verified, a blue check appears next to their name.</p>

<p>Listeners can &#8220;Like&#8221; or otherwise react to the content as it streams live using the &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen. And they can choose to share the Audio Room either in a Facebook post, in a Group, with a friend directly or through other apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166468" style="width: 654px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166468" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166468 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?w=644" alt="" width="644" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png 1269w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=768,811 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=644,680 644w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9732.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166468" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>A toggle switch under the room&#8217;s three-dot &#8220;more&#8221; menu lets you turn on or off auto-generated captions, for accessibility. From here, you can also report users or any issues or bugs you encountered.</p>
<p>The Live Audio Room today did not offer any option for raising your hand or joining the speakers on stage &#8212; it was more of a &#8220;few-to-many&#8221; broadcast experience.</p>
<p>Before today, TechCrunch received a couple of tips from users who reported seeing the Audio Rooms option appear for them in the Facebook app. However, the company told us it had only tested Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. with employees.</p>
<p>During the test period, Live Audio Rooms are only available on iOS and Android, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also used today&#8217;s event to talk more broadly about Facebook&#8217;s plans for the creator economy going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a good vision for the future is one where a lot more people get to do creative work and work that they enjoy, and fewer people have to do work that they just find a chore. And, in order to do that, a lot of what we need to do is basically build out a bunch of these different monetization tools,&#8221; explained Zuckerberg. &#8220;Not all creators are going to have the same business model. So having the ability to basically use a lot of different tools like Fiji [Simo] was talking about &#8212; for some people it might be, Stars or ad revenue share or subscriptions or selling things or different kinds of things like that &#8212; that will be important and part of making this all add up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted also that the tools Facebook is building go beyond gaming, saying that Facebook intends to support journalists, writers and others &#8212; likely a reference to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22518571/facebook-substack-bulletin-newsletter-launch">upcoming Substack clone, Bulletin</a>, expected to launch later this month.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg additionally spoke about how the company won&#8217;t immediately take a cut of the revenue generated from creators&#8217; content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having this period where we&#8217;re not taking a cut and more people can get into these kinds of roles, I think is going to be a good thing to do &#8212; especially given how hard hit a lot of parts of the economy have been with COVID and the pandemic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More realistically, of course, Facebook&#8217;s decision to not take an immediate cut of some creator revenue is a decision it&#8217;s making in order to help attract more creators to its service, in the face of so much competition across the industry.</p>
<p>Clubhouse, for example, is currently wooing creators with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">a payments feature,</a> where creators keep 100% of their revenue. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">it&#8217;s funding some creators&#8217; shows</a>. Twitter, meanwhile, is tying its audio product Spaces to its broader set of creator tools, which now include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">newsletters</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">tips</a> and, soon, a subscription platform dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follow</a>.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t say during today&#8217;s event when Live Audio Rooms would be available to the public, but said the experience would roll out to &#8220;a lot more people soon.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sunlight is a great source of energy, but it rarely gets hot enough to fry an egg, let alone melt steel. Heliogen aims to change that with its high-tech concentrated solar technique, and has raised more than a hundred million dollars to test its 1,000-degree solar furnace at a few participating mines and refineries.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heliogens-new-technology-could-unlock-renewable-energy-for-industrial-manufacturing/">We covered Heliogen when it made its debut in 2019</a>, and the details in that article still get at the core of the company&#8217;s tech. Computer vision techniques are used to carefully control a large set of mirrors, which reflect and concentrate the sun&#8217;s light to the extent that it can reach in excess of 1,000 degrees Celsius, almost twice what previous solar concentrators could do. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a death ray,&#8221; founder Bill Gross explained then.</p>
<p>That lets the system replace fossil fuels and other legacy systems in many applications where such temperatures are required, for example mining and smelting operations. By using a Heliogen concentrator, they could run on sunlight during much of the day and only rely on other sources at night, potentially halving their fuel expenditure and consequently both saving money and stepping toward a greener future.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Heliogen&#8217;s new tech could unlock renewable energy for industrial manufacturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heliogens-new-technology-could-unlock-renewable-energy-for-industrial-manufacturing/embed/#?secret=HpjkO7g7V3" data-secret="HpjkO7g7V3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both goals hint at why utilities and a major mining and steel-making company are now investors. Heliogen raised a $25 million A-2, led by Prime Movers Lab, but soon also pulled together a much larger &#8220;bridge extension round&#8221; in their terminology of $83 million that brought in the miner ArcelorMittal, Edison International, Ocgrow Ventures, A.T. Gekko and more.</p>
<p>The money will be used both to continue development of the &#8220;Sunlight Refinery,&#8221; as Heliogen calls it, and deploy some actual on-site installations that would work in real production workflows at scale. &#8220;We are constantly making design and cost improvements to increase efficiency and decrease costs,&#8221; a representative of the company told me.</p>
<p>One of those pilot sites will be in Boron, California, where Rio Tinto operates a borates mine and will include Heliogen&#8217;s tech as part of its usual on-site processes, according to an MOU signed in March. Another MOU with ArcelorMittal will &#8220;evaluate the potential of Heliogen&#8217;s products in several of ArcelorMittal&#8217;s steel plants.&#8221; Facilities are planned in the U.S., MENA and Asia Pacific areas.</p>
<p>Beyond mining and smelting, the technique could be used to generate hydrogen in a zero-carbon way. That would be a big step toward building a working hydrogen infrastructure for next-generation fuel supply, since current methods make it difficult to do without relying on fossil fuels in the first place. And no doubt there are other industrial processes that could benefit from a free and zero-carbon source of high heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re being granted the resources to do more projects that address the most carbon-intensive human activities and work toward our goals of lowering the price and emissions of energy for everyone on the planet,&#8221; Gross said in a release announcing the round(s). &#8220;We thank all of our investors for enabling us to pursue our mission and offer the world technology that will allow it to achieve a post-carbon economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Senate confirmed Big Tech critic and prominent antitrust scholar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/lina-khans-timely-tech-skepticism-makes-for-a-refreshingly-friendly-ftc-confirmation-hearing/">Lina Khan as FTC Commissioner Tuesday</a>, signaling a new era of scrutiny for the tech industry. Khan was confirmed in a 69-28 vote, with Republicans joining Democrats in a rare show of bipartisan support for Khan&#8217;s ideas on reining in tech&#8217;s most powerful companies.</p>
<p>An associate law professor at Columbia, Khan&#8217;s star rose with the <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">publication of a landmark paper</a> examining how the government&#8217;s outdated ways of identifying monopolies have failed to keep up with modern business realities, particularly in tech. In Khan&#8217;s view, that regulatory failure has allowed the biggest tech companies to consolidate unprecedented wealth and power, in turn making it even more difficult to regulate them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m so grateful to the Senate for my confirmation. Congress created the FTC to safeguard fair competition and protect consumers, workers, and honest businesses from unfair &amp; deceptive practices. I look forward to upholding this mission with vigor and serving the American public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1404841168182169602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>President Biden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/lina-khan-biden-ftc-antitrust/">nominated Khan back in March</a>, sending an early message that Biden would not extend the warm relationship Big Tech companies enjoyed with the White House under former President Obama.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s confirmation is a sign that the agency will be prioritizing tech antitrust concerns, a priority that will run parallel to Congressional efforts to bolster the FTC&#8217;s enforcement powers. The FTC famously imposed a $5 billion fine on Facebook for privacy violations in 2019, but the record-setting fine was only a glancing blow for a company already worth more than $500 billion.</p>
<p>Last week, Congress revealed a long-anticipated package of bipartisan bills that, if passed, would overhaul tech&#8217;s biggest businesses and redraw the industry&#8217;s rules for years to come.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">previous bill proposed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar</a> would set aside a pool of money that the FTC could use to create a new division for market and merger research, one step toward modernizing antitrust enforcement to keep up with relentless growth from tech&#8217;s most powerful giants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of 200 startup founders, investors, associations and government members are backing a manifesto and a set of recommendations in order to create the next wave of tech giants in Europe. Today, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting an event in Paris with some of the members of this group called <a href="https://scaleupeurope.tech">Scale-Up Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Companies, investors and associations that signed the manifesto include Alan, Axel Springer, Bpifrance, Darktrace, Deutsche Startups, Doctolib, Eurazeo, Flixbus, France Digitale, Glovo, La French Tech, N26, OVHcloud, Shift Technology, Stripe, UiPath and Wise.</p>
<p>“To achieve all that, I&#8217;ll follow your ambition — 10 technology companies that are worth €100 billion or more by 2030,” Macron said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s an ambitious goal — that’s why Scale-Up Europe has laid out a roadmap and is issuing a <a href="https://sifted.eu/intelligence/reports/scale-up-europe">report</a>. While it is backed by both private actors and public institutions, it could be considered as a sort of lobbying effort for the European Commission and European governments.</p>
<p>There are a handful of key topics in those recommendations. And it starts with funding. In particular, the group thinks Europe is still lagging behind when it comes to late-stage investments. The biggest VC funds aren’t as big as the biggest VC funds in the U.S. or in China.</p>
<p>The French government has been working on a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">foster</a> late-stage funds and investments in public tech companies in France. “On funding, we’ve seen the success of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Tibi initiative</a> at the French level. We think we should follow that model at the European level,” a source close to Macron told me.</p>
<p>It means that Europe should consider using public funding as a multiplier effect for VC funds. The <a href="https://www.eif.org">European Investment Fund</a> is already pouring a lot of money in VC funds. But Scale-Up Europe recommends associating private funds of funds, sharing risk and pooling public investment banks for increased collaboration.</p>

<p>The second topic is foreign talent. Some countries already have a tech worker visa. The group thinks it should be standardized across the European Union with some level of portability for social rights.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, an open letter called <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en">&#8220;Not Optional&#8221;</a> also highlighted some discrepancies with stock option schemes. Today’s report states once again that some governments should adopt more favorable rules with stock options.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PJOxDe40uY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/30-european-startup-ceos-call-for-better-stock-option-policies/">30 European startup CEOs call for better stock option policies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;30 European startup CEOs call for better stock option policies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/30-european-startup-ceos-call-for-better-stock-option-policies/embed/#?secret=PJOxDe40uY" data-secret="PJOxDe40uY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third topic revolves around deep tech startups. According to the report, Europe isn’t doing enough to foster more deep tech startups and investors. Recommendations include standardizing patent transfer frameworks. Those schemes are important if you want to turn a research project into a company. It also says that the European Innovation Council could also take on a larger role in defining a deep tech roadmap.</p>
<p>Scale-Up Europe then highlights some recommendations to improve relationships between big corporations and startups. These are mostly tax breaks, R&amp;D tax benefits and other fiscal incentives. (I’m personally not convinced there will be more European tech giants if we incentivize acquisitions with tax breaks.)</p>
<p>Finally, the group of investors, founders and government members behind Scale-Up Europe think there should be a European tech mission that works a bit like <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com">La French Tech</a> in France. This tech mission could clear regulatory hurdles, promote startups and more.</p>
<p>Overall, those recommendations are mostly focused on making it easier to create — and grow — a startup in Europe. Investors as well as startup employees who hold stock options will be quite pleased to see that it’ll be easier to make money quickly. It’ll be interesting to see whether the European Commission reuses some of these recommendations.</p>
<p>To be fair, those are actionable recommendations. And yet, building a tech giant is a complicated task. Tech giants tend to control a large chunk of their tech stack, including in areas such as cloud hosting, payments, analytics, advertising and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Many European startups are currently built on APIs, frameworks and platforms that are built in the U.S. or in China. Scale-Up Europe misses the point on this front. Scaling European startups isn’t a gold rush. It’s a long process that requires continuous investments that start from the bottom of the tech stack and moves upward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nintendo defied expectations today with an E3-timed Direct showing off not the hoped-for new Switch hardware but a dozen or so new games — as well as a general release window for the much-anticipated next Zelda game. And to celebrate the original&#8217;s 35th anniversary, it will sell a new Game &amp; Watch featuring the first three games in the series.</p>
<p>Among other things, Nintendo showed off remasters or remakes of titles from the &#8220;Monkey Ball,&#8221; &#8220;Mario Party,&#8221; &#8220;Advance Wars, &#8220;Wario Ware&#8221; and other series, and announced new entries in the &#8220;Mario + Rabbids&#8221; and &#8220;Shin Megami Tensei&#8221; worlds. Other newly announced or teased games will be making it to Switch as well, like the new &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising was the inclusion of a new side-scrolling Metroid game, the first in nearly 20 years — and in fact, it has been in and out of development for half that time. &#8220;Metroid Dread,&#8221; the fifth in the mainline series that began on the NES, will release October 8, and we&#8217;ll see if Nintendo has managed to keep pace in a genre it pioneered but others have refined.</p>

<p>Everyone was hoping for Zelda news, however, and Nintendo&#8230; only slightly disappointed us. As the announcers noted, it&#8217;s the 35th anniversary of the NES original, and the perfect time to announce something truly special, but they have &#8220;no campaigns or other Nintendo Switch games planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, they offered an admittedly tempting Game &amp; Watch in the style of the one we saw released last year for the Mario series. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/nintendos-mario-game-watch-is-a-choice-gaming-stocking-stuffer-of-2020/">I had lots of good things to say about that device</a>, and the new one will no doubt be just as fun. The ability to pause the game and pick it up later (but not rewind or save states) should make for a fun, authentic playthrough of the first three games in the Zelda series: &#8220;The Legend of Zelda&#8221; and &#8220;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&#8221; for NES, and &#8220;Link&#8217;s Awakening&#8221; for Game Boy (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/">recently remade</a>).</p>

<p>The last item on the list was a new look at the follow-up to Breath of the Wild, which years after its debut still shines as one of the, if not the, best game on the Switch. Its sequel has a lot to live up to!</p>
<p>While the first trailer was all cinematic, this one showed gameplay and the overworld, including a new level of verticality that brings flying fortresses and castles in the air into play. It certainly looks impressive, but one wonders how much further the company can push its Switch hardware. After all, &#8220;Breath of the Wild&#8221; pushed the system to its limits at its debut, and even then it was not as powerful as its rivals from Microsoft and Sony — both now replaced by a new generation.</p>
<p>One hopes that Nintendo is simply being weird and has a trick up its sleeve, as it has many times before. The Switch was announced out of nowhere, and previous hardware updates have also dropped with little or no warning and seemingly arbitrary timing. What&#8217;s expected is an updated Switch that&#8217;s physically the same dimensions but considerably updated inside and using a larger, better display. Perfect backwards compatibility, like with the 3DS series of handhelds, also seems only logical. But Nintendo has always done its own thing and its fans wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Android shared information today about six features that will roll out this summer. Some of these are just quality of life upgrades, like starring text messages to easily find them later, or getting contextual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">Emoji Kitchen</a> suggestions depending on what you&#8217;re typing. But other aspects of this update emphasize security, safety and accessibility.</p>
<p>Last summer, Google added a feature on Android that basically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/google-is-turning-android-phones-into-seismometers/">uses your phone as a seismometer</a> to create &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest earthquake detection network.&#8221; The system is free, and since testing in California, it&#8217;s also launched in New Zealand and Greece. Now, Google will introduce this feature in Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The company says that they&#8217;ll continue expanding the feature this year, prioritizing countries with the highest earthquake risk.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166404" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166404" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166404 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.-Earthquake-Alerts.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google is also expanding on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/google-assistant-can-now-control-android-apps/">another feature released last year</a>, which made Google Assistant compatible with Android apps. In the initial update, apps were supported like Spotify, Snapchat, Twitter, Walmart, Discord, Etsy, MyFitnessPal, Mint, Nike Adapt, Nike Run Club, eBay, Kroger, Postmates and Wayfair. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_OAyYiya40&amp;">Today&#8217;s update</a> mentioned apps like eBay, Yahoo! Finance, Strava and Capital One. These features are comparable to Apple&#8217;s support of Siri with iOS apps, which includes the ability to open apps, perform tasks and record a custom command.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166408" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166408" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166408 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.-Voice-Access-Gaze-Detection.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, Google is ramping up its gaze detection feature, which is now in beta. Gaze detection allows people to ask Voice Access to only respond when they&#8217;re looking at their screen, allowing people to naturally move between talking with friends and using their phone. Now, Voice Access will also have enhanced password input &#8212; when it detects a password field, it will allow you to input letters, numbers and symbols by saying &#8220;capital P&#8221; or &#8220;dollar sign,&#8221; for example, making it easier for users to more quickly enter this sensitive information. In October, Google Assistant became available on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/google-assistant-comes-to-gaze-powered-accessible-devices/">gaze-powered accessible devices</a>, and in the same month, Google researchers debuted a demo that made it so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/google-research-lets-sign-language-switch-active-speaker-in-video-calls/">people using sign language could be identified</a> as the &#8220;active speaker&#8221; in video calls. Apple doesn&#8217;t have a comparable gaze detection feature yet that&#8217;s widely available, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/apple-acquires-smi-eye-tracking-company/">they acquired SensoMotoric Instruments</a> (SMI), an eye-tracking firm, in 2017. So, hopefully similar accessibility features will be in the works at Apple, especially as Google continues to build out theirs.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Android update also lets Android Auto users customize more of their experience. Now, you can set your launcher screen from your phone, set dark mode manually and more easily browse content on media apps with an A-Z scroll bar and &#8220;back to top&#8221; button. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Messages will now be compatible on the launch screen &#8212; proceed with caution and don&#8217;t drive distracted &#8212; and EV charging, parking, and navigation apps will now be available for use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Refraction AI calls itself the Goldilocks of robotic delivery. The Ann Arbor-based company, which recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/last-mile-delivery-robotics-company-refraction-ai-raises-4-2m/">$4.2 million seed round</a> and expanded operations to Austin, was founded by two University of Michigan professors who think delivery via full-size autonomous vehicles (AV) is not nearly as close as many promise and sidewalk delivery comes with too many hassles and not enough payoff. Their &#8220;just right&#8221; solution? Find a middle path, or rather, a bike path.</p>
<p>The company’s REV-1 robot, which co-founder and CTO Matthew Johnson-Roberson debuted on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/demo-with-matthew-johnson-roberson-refraction-ai/">TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage</a> in 2019, was built on a foundation of a bicycle. At about 4 feet tall and 32 inches wide, the three-wheeled vehicle can travel at up to 15 miles per hour, which means it can stop quickly to avoid obstacles while still being faster than a human.</p>
<p>The intermediate speed also means that the REV-1 doesn’t need to see as far ahead as a full-size AV, which allows it to function well on radars, sensors and cameras instead of requiring expensive lidar, according to the company.</p>
<p>Johnson-Roberson has spent nearly 20 years in academic robotics. Universities are home to many of the advances in field robotics, but the average person doesn&#8217;t see many such applications everyday when they look out their window. This desire to make something that is useful to the general public has been a huge motivator for the academic-turned-founder.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: You unveiled Refraction AI on the TechCrunch stage two years ago. How has it evolved since?</b></p>
<p><b>Matthew Johnson-Roberson: </b>It&#8217;s been a really exciting ride. At that time, we had one vehicle — the one that we rolled out on stage — and now we have 25 vehicles in Ann Arbor and Austin, which we just announced. So things have changed quite a bit in the intervening years. We had already predicted a lot of changes around food delivery, specifically, and lots of those were accelerated by the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/elisity">Elisity</a>, a self-styled innovator that provides behavior-based enterprise cybersecurity, has raised $26 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Two Bear Capital and AllegisCyber Capital, the latter of which has invested in a number of cybersecurity startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cybersecurity-startup-panaseer-raises-26-5m-series-b-led-allegiscyber-capital/">Panaseer</a>, with previous seed investor Atlantic Bridge also participating.</p>
<p>Elisity, which is led by industry veterans from Cisco, Qualys and Viptela, says the funding will help it meet growing enterprise demand for its cloud-delivered Cognitive Trust platform, which it claims is the only platform intelligent enough to understand how assets and people connect beyond corporate perimeters.</p>
<p>The platform looks to help organizations transition from legacy access approaches to zero trust, a security model based on maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone — even employees — by default, across their entire digital footprint. This enables organizations to adopt a &#8220;work-from-anywhere&#8221; model, according to the company, which notes that most companies today continue to rely on security and policies based on physical location or low-level networking constructs, such as VLAN, IP and MAC addresses, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vpn/">VPNs</a>.</p>
<p>Cognitive Trust, the company claims, can analyze the unique identity and context of people, apps and devices, including Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT), wherever they’re working. The company says through its AI-driven behavioral intelligence, the platform can also continuously assess risk and instantly optimize access, connectivity and protection policies.</p>

<p>&#8220;CISOs are facing ever-increasing attack surfaces caused by the shift to remote work, reliance on cloud-based services (and often multi-cloud) and the convergence of IT/OT networks,&#8221; said Mike Goguen, founder and managing partner at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/two-bear-capital">Two Bear Capital</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;Elisity addresses all of these problems by not only enacting a zero trust model, but by doing so at the edge and within the behavioral context of each interaction. We are excited to partner with the CEO, James Winebrenner, and his team as they expand the reach of their revolutionary approach to enterprise security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Elisity — whose competitors include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/vectra-ai-picks-up-130m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-network-approach-to-threat-detection-and-response/">Vectra AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lastline/">Lastline</a> —<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>closed a $7.5 million seed round in August that same year, led by Atlantic Bridge. With its seed round, Elisity began scaling its engineering, sales and marketing teams to ramp up ahead of the platform’s launch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s looking to scale in order to meet growing enterprise demand, which comes as many organizations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">move to a hybrid working model</a> and seek the tools to help them secure distributed workforces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;When the security perimeter is no longer the network, we see an incredible opportunity to evolve the way enterprises connect and protect their people and their assets, moving away from strict network constructs to identity and context as the basis for secure access,&#8221; said Winebrenner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;With Elisity, customers can dispense with the complexity, cost and protracted timeline enterprises usually encounter. We can onboard a new customer in as little as 45 minutes, rather than months or years, moving them to an identity-based access policy, and expanding to their cloud and on-prem[ise] footprints over time without having to rip and replace existing identity providers and network infrastructure investments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We do this without making tradeoffs between productivity for employees and the network security posture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elisity, which is based in California, currently employs around 30 staff. However, <a href="https://www.elisity.com/company?#TeamLeadSection">it currently has no women in its leadership team</a>, nor on its board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
