					<description><![CDATA[The former Lucid Motors will expand its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet and aims to ultimately produce 400,000 vehicles a year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group (formerly Lucid Motors) will be expanding its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet, CEO Pete Rawlinson said Monday just hours after the company officially went public with a $4.5 billion injection of capital.</p>
<p>The company also said it has 11,000 paid reservations for its flagship luxury electric sedan, the Lucid Air.</p>
<p>Part of the expansion will be used to accommodate the manufacturing of Project Gravity, the mysterious title given to the automaker’s forthcoming luxury electric SUV, a Lucid spokesman told TechCrunch. Not much is known about Gravity at this point, other than that it’s scheduled to be available from 2023 and that it will use the same battery platform as the Air. Patent drawings submitted to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, first noticed by a member of the <a href="https://www.lucid-forum.com/threads/lucid-gravity-suv-patent-images-reveal-production-design.142/">Lucid Forum</a>, reveal little more than the renderings on Lucid’s website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also planning on bringing more of the component production in-house, including major pieces such as the body panel stampings, the spokesman added. These parts were being handled by an external supplier.</p>
<p>The Casa Grande City Council approved the plans to expand the nearly 1 million-square-foot space in March. The first phase of the factory, which cost around $700 million to construct, went up in a record 12 months after breaking ground. Lucid has said that it wants to expand production capacity from around 30,000 vehicles per year to up to 400,000.</p>
<p>Lucid has had a long, sometimes tenuous road to the public market. The company first set its sights on bringing an electric sedan to production as early as 2018, but it quickly hit funding challenges that pushed this timeline further and further back. Lucid received major funding in 2018 with a $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which continued to be its largest shareholder throughout Lucid&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/"> merger</a> with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.</p>
<p>That merger hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">a bit of a hiccup</a> last week when the company failed to garner a sufficient number of votes on a key proposal &#8212; likely due to the rise of retail traders and malfunctioning spam filters, executives said in an investor call.</p>
<p>Lucid, which will now operate under the name Lucid Group, is listed under the ticker symbol LCID.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five weeks after Lordstown Motors issued a warning that it might not have enough funds to bring its electric pickup truck to market, a hedge fund managed by investment firm Yorkville Advisors has agreed to buy $400 million worth of shares over a three-year period, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021009220/ride-20210723x8k.htm">regulatory filing posted</a> Monday.</p>
<p>The tumult within Lordstown Motors, which has resulted in the resignation of its CEO and CTO, has put the company at risk of failing. This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle. If approved by shareholders, hedge fund YA II PN will be able to purchase 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares.</p>
<p>The capital provides a lifeline to Lordstown, which has struggled in recent months. The hedge fund, which is able to buy the shares at $7.48 a share, could also benefit financially if the stock price rises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of former CEO Steve Burns&#8217; other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors.</p>
<p>The Ohio automaker was founded in 2019, and within a year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">reached a deal to merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion. The company had planned to begin production of its Endurance pickup truck starting in the second half of 2021 at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Those plans faltered and a series of missteps and allegations of fraud compounded the company&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had taken a short position on Lordstown Motors. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company that has &#8220;no revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hindenburg disputed that the company booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller said that &#8220;extensive research reveals that the company&#8217;s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p>Lordstown execs dug themselves into a deeper hole by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/">attempting to calm investors</a> a day after its CEO and CTO resigned with statements that they had binding orders from customers that would fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/"> company retracted those statements</a> within days.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice and the SEC are separately<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/"> investigating the company</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge in Washington DC has ordered a man accused of participating in the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6 to unlock his laptop &#8220;with his face,&#8221; after prosecutors argued that the laptop likely contains video footage that would incriminate him in the attempted insurrection.</p>
<p>Guy Reffitt was arrested in late January, three weeks after he participated in the riot, and has been in jail since. He has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including bringing a firearm to the Capitol grounds and a charge of obstructing justice. His Windows laptop was one of several devices seized by the FBI, which investigators said was protected with a password, but that it could also be unlocked using Reffitt&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said forensic evidence suggested that the laptop contained gigabytes of footage from Reffitt&#8217;s helmet-worn camera that he allegedly used to record some of the riot, and asked the court if it could compel Reffitt to sit in front of the computer to unlock it.</p>
<p>Reffitt&#8217;s lawyer told the court that his client could &#8220;not remember&#8221; the password, but the court sided with the government and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21016668-us-vs-reffitt">granted the motion to compel</a> his biometrics. Reffitt&#8217;s lawyer told CNN, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/politics/capitol-rioter-unlock-laptop/index.html">first reported the court order</a>, that the laptop is now unlocked.</p>
<p>The government took advantage of a loophole in the Fifth Amendment, a constitutional right that grants anyone in the U.S. the right to remain silent, which includes the right to not turn over information that could implicate themselves in a crime, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/court-police-suspects-passwords/">such as a password</a>. But some courts have ruled that those protections don&#8217;t extend to a person&#8217;s physical attributes that can be used in place of a password, such as a face scan or fingerprint.</p>
<p>In Reffitt&#8217;s indictment, the FBI said as such, arguing that compelling Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it &#8220;would not run afoul of the defendant&#8217;s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courts across the U.S. are still divided on the reading of the Fifth Amendment and whether or not it applies to the compelled use of a person&#8217;s biometrics. The U.S. Supreme Court isn&#8217;t likely to address the issue any time soon, rejecting two petitions in as many years to rule on the matter, leaving it largely up to the states to decide.</p>

As part of the latest neurological <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/investigational-magnetic-device-shrinks-glioblastoma-in-first-in-world-human-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">breakthrough</a>, researchers used a helmet that generates a magnetic field to shrink a deadly tumor by a third. The 53-year-old patient who underwent the treatment ultimately passed away due to an unrelated injury. But, an autopsy of his brain showed that the procedure had removed 31 percent of the tumor mass in a short time. The test marked the first noninvasive therapy for a deadly form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma.</p>
<p>The helmet features three rotating magnets connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery. As part of the therapy, the patient wore the device for five weeks at a clinic and then at home with the help of his wife. The resulting magnetic field therapy created by the helmet was administered for two hours initially and then ramped up to a maximum of six hours per day. During the period, the patient&#8217;s tumor mass and volume shrunk by nearly a third, with shrinkage appearing to correlate with the treatment dose.</p>
<p>The inventors of the device — which received FDA approval for compassionate use treatment — claim it could one day help treat brain cancer without radiation or chemotherapy. “Our results&#8230;open a new world of non-invasive and nontoxic therapy&#8230;with many exciting possibilities for the future,” said David S. Baskin, corresponding author and director of the Kenneth R. Peak Center for Brain and Pituitary Tumor Treatment in the Department of Neurosurgery at Houston Methodist Neurological Institute. Details of the procedure have been published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.708017/full?utm_source=F-NTF&amp;utm_medium=EMLX&amp;utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Frontiers in Oncology</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Things in China seem to be changing for the worse, in terms of both future access to foreign capital for Chinese companies and doing business in the country overall.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">spent a little time</a> on Friday ruminating on the impact of then-rumored regulation in China targeting its edtech sector. News that the Chinese government intended to crack down further on the education technology market hit shares of public, China-based edtech companies. It was a mess.</p>
<p>Then over the weekend, the rumors became reality, and the impact is still being felt today in the global markets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more. China is also bringing new regulatory pressure on food-delivery companies and Tencent Music. More precisely, we&#8217;ve seen successive market-dynamic-changing moves from the Chinese government in the last few days, coming as 2021 had already proved to be a turbulent environment for China-based technology companies.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Today we have to do a little bit of work to understand precisely what is going on with the various regulatory changes. Why? Because the Chinese venture capital market is a <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/q2-2021-chinese-inbound-investment-announced-ma-transactions-and-equity-investments/">key player in the global venture scene</a>. And Chinese startups have gone public on both Chinese, Hong Kong and U.S. exchanges; there&#8217;s a lot of capital tied up in companies impacted today &#8212; and possibly tomorrow.</p>
<p>For startups, the regulatory changes aren&#8217;t a death blow; indeed, many Chinese tech startups won&#8217;t be affected by what we&#8217;ve seen thus far. And upstart tech companies in sectors less likely to be targeted by central authorities may become more attractive to investors than they were before the regulatory onslaught kicked off. But on the whole, it feels like the risk profile of doing business in China has risen. That could curb the pace at which capital is invested, cut valuations and lower interest in the Chinese startup market from private-market investors able to invest globally.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>The edtech clampdown did not start last week. China&#8217;s edtech sector started to rack up penalties and fines in June, which led to what <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2021/06/chinas-next-big-regulatory-clampdown-edtech/">the Asia Times called</a> &#8220;warning bells&#8221; in the sector. From there, things went from penalties to punishing regulatory changes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The round comes about a year after Solarisbank's last round of $67.5 million, but as a sign of the times, what is perhaps more notable is that its valuation has nearly quintupled since then.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; the process by which some of the more complicated, but also commoditized, aspects of financial services are built and wrapped in an API for anyone else to implement in their own products for end users &#8212; has become a huge cornerstone of how fintech is built today. Now, one of the earlier and bigger movers in the space is announcing a major round of growth funding to build out its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solarisbank</a>, a Berlin startup that provides a range of financial services by way of some 180 APIs that others use to build end-user-facing products (including basic banking and card services, lending, payments, and know-your-customer services) has raised €190 million ($224 million) in a Series D that values the company at €1.4 billion ($1.65 billion) and announced the acquisition of one of its competitors in the space, <a href="https://www.contis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contis</a>.</p>
<p>Decisive Capital Management, a Swiss firm that has also backed insurtech startup Wefox, led the round, with Pathway Capital Management, CNP (Groupe Frère) and Ilavska Vuillermoz Capital also participating, in addition to and previous backers Yabeo Capital, BBVA, Vulcan Capital and HV Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round comes about a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/banking-platform-solarisbank-raises-67-5-million-at-360-million-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of $67.5 million</a>, but as a sign of the times, what is perhaps more notable is that the company&#8217;s valuation has nearly quintupled since then (it was $360 million in June 2020).</p>
<p>This latest round is going to be used for expansion. CEO Roland Folz said in an interview that the Contis acquisition &#8212; which underscores a wider consolidation trend in fintech &#8212; will help it better cover all of Europe and start to make its first early moves into Asia. There are no plans right now to add the U.S. to that list, he said.</p>
<p>He added that the combined entity will be making revenues in the &#8220;triple-digit euros&#8221; &#8212; that is, hundreds of millions; it posted net revenues of €35 million in 2020 &#8212; and will be in a position to go public next year, if it chooses to.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&#8217;s hoping to double down on the huge shift we&#8217;re seeing in the world of financial services, where consumers and businesses are opting for newer and more modern banking experiences as they migrate away from slower, less flexible and sometimes more expensive incumbents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe is an ideal space for us to work in,&#8221; said Folz. &#8220;We believe that in Europe there are roughly 800 million bank accounts and some 400 million of those will change &#8216;ownership,&#8217; where traditional banks will be swapped out with non-traditional banks. &#8230; If we look at the five- to 10-year perspective, we want to make sure a significant proportion of those accounts will be on our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>SolarisBank counts Trade Republic, American Express, BP, Samsung and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/vivid-is-a-new-challenger-bank-built-on-top-of-solarisbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivid</a> among its customers, powering basic banking, know-your-customer checks, lending, digital wallet and other services related to finance for companies that can, in turn, focus their energies on building more user-friendly customer experiences or other services altogether. It&#8217;s been growing at a rate of 40%-60% annually, Folz added, and it has some 50 &#8220;partners&#8221; (as it calls its customers) in all, covering some 2 million customer accounts.</p>
<p>Contis, meanwhile, is a substantial business in its own right, with some 200 customers covering more than 2 million users and €9.9 billion in transactions annually.</p>
<p>Solarisbank was founded five years ago out of the Berlin-based startup incubator and investor <a href="https://finleap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finleap</a>, with Ramin Niroumand, a founder of finleap, essentially the &#8220;founder&#8221; of Solarisbank, too. (Currently and more formally, he is also chairman of its advisory board.)</p>
<p>Embedded finance is all the rage at the moment, and a number of startups today are providing fintech-as-a-service or banking-as-a-service tools to third parties. Other notable names in the same segment of the market include Railsbank, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/railsbank-raises-70m-to-build-out-its-fintech-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced funding</a> earlier this month;  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapyd</a>, which raised a big round at a $2.5 billion valuation earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unit</a>, another banking-as-a-service startup picking up funding and growing; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/fintechos-nabs-61-5m-for-a-low-code-approach-to-modernizing-legacy-banking-and-insurance-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, which really does what its name says (and is also currently raising money); and the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, which ironically is targeting incumbents.</p>
<p>Solarisbank believes its particular approach to this gap in the market gives it more flexibility and mileage: Unlike its rivals, the bulked-up Solarisbank will have banking licenses for Europe and e-money licenses in Lithuania and the U.K., with its tech stack living on AWS, giving it an opportunity to build more services, scale and keep better margins in the process &#8212; a critical detail in what is essentially an economy of scale play.</p>
<p>It also believes that its diverse customer base &#8212; covering not just obvious fintech companies like neobanks, but a variety of others, like Samsung, that are building financial services (in its case, a digital wallet) &#8212; gives it more staying power to cater to whatever segment of that base is growing most at any given time. As Niroumand points out, around 70% of its revenues come from some 30% of its customers. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a diverse clientele we are serving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is currently active in Germany, France, Italy and Spain but says it can cover the whole European Economic Area with passporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the combined entity, we are looking at numbers that no one else is even close to remotely,&#8221; added Folz.</p>
<p>The market opportunity, combined with Solarisbank&#8217;s approach and its current customer base, is what attracted investors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are experiencing a paradigm shift in banking, where customers expect financial services to adapt to their specific needs,” Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, a partner at Decisive Capital Management, said in a statement. “Technology is the key to enable this transformation and Solarisbank’s powerful banking-as-a-service platform positions it perfectly for this new banking era. We are both inspired by the team and thrilled to work together on its mission.”</p>

<p>Do you live in a city with shared e-scooters and e-bikes that you never really ride even though you think it&#8217;s a cool concept? Maybe you think paying $10 to go three miles is ridiculous, or you don&#8217;t want to touch the sticky handlebars that someone may have previously coughed on. You&#8217;ve considered buying your own, but it ain&#8217;t cheap and you&#8217;re not ready for that kind of commitment &#8230; But wait! From the depths of this stream of consciousness a new business model emerges: micromobility subscriptions.</p>
<p>The premise is that customers pay a somewhat affordable fee for a monthly rental of a higher quality e-scooter or e-bike. It&#8217;s delivered to their door and assembled for them. If it breaks down, someone will ship them a new one. And customers can cancel anytime. It&#8217;s truly made for the 21st century city dweller, adding nicely to their collection of meal kit, vitamins, video streaming, music streaming, book reading, meditation app, digital trainer and outfit subscriptions.</p>
<p>Enough about the customer. Investors and companies are seeing the value in either building a business around the micromobility subscriptions model or adding it as another line to an existing business. They say it&#8217;s easy to scale, provides a good return on investment and costs less per mile to operate. And for those who actually care about sustainability, it allows the operator to control the vehicle&#8217;s end of life in a way that sales don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m harping on about this model is because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/why-startups-and-investors-are-turning-to-micromobility-subscriptions/">I wrote about it for ExtraCrunch</a> this week. It&#8217;s behind a paywall, but here are some highlights from the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shawn Carolan, managing director at Menlo Ventures, which invested in e-scooter subscription/sales company Unagi, is bullish on the micromobility subscription model. He says most people would rather pay a low monthly fee rather than a higher upfront fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best customers are repeat customers, commuters or local neighborhood trips,&#8221; Carolan said. &#8220;Repeatedly paying per ride is both expensive and cognitively taxing. People want low friction in transportation. Getting from here to there shouldn&#8217;t require a lot of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures bet that customers would also take better care of high-quality scooter they get to &#8220;own&#8221; for a time, which translates to a longer lifetime for hardware &#8212; something the dockless shared model consistently struggles with. Having an additional route to micromobility will broaden the market, positioning it as a SaaS business, which achieves a higher multiple.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for the subscription model? Startups looking to go this route need to work on providing the best possible service in order to retain customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The job to be done is reliability,&#8221; Oliver Bruce, angel investor and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast with Horace Dediu, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Maintenance and repairs is still a nascent sector, but for people who want to have a reliable option for travel and don&#8217;t know or care about how to maintain their brakes or gears, it&#8217;s a really good option. Proper servicing will open up micromobility to a far wider group, especially when paired to safe infrastructure and favorable transport policies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Ireland gets on the e-scooter bandwagon</b></h3>
<p>In other news, this week <strong>Ireland</strong> launched its first e-scooter trial across five campuses of Dublin City University. Berlin-based <strong>Tier</strong> will work with Irish and DCU-based<strong> Luna</strong> to equi</p>
<p>p e-scooters with computer vision tech that will be able to detect pavement lines and pedestrians. This is similar to what <strong>Drover</strong> is doing with <strong>Spin</strong>, which has just launched its visually updated scooters in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics and Smart DCU, a district of Smart Dublin, will also collaborate on the pilot research. E-scooters are still illegal to ride on Irish roads, but there is <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/e-scooter-laws-ireland-what-20671464">proposed legislation</a> in the works to change that.</p>
<h3>Superpedestrian&#8217;s scooters are not backing vision</h3>
<p>E-scooter company <strong>Superpedestrian</strong> acquired <strong>Navmatic</strong>, a startup that helps micromobility operators locate vehicles and correct their movements in real time. With access to Navmatic&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">super fusion tech</a>, Superpedestrian has created an advanced safety system called Pedestrian Defense that can detect unsafe riding behaviors and stop them in real time.</p>
<p>Navmatic&#8217;s technology basically allows the scooter to detect the rider&#8217;s micro-movements and through those plus other data picked up from sensors can determine things like if the scooter is going down the wrong way on a one way street or riding on the pavement.</p>
<h3>Bike stuff</h3>
<p>The Rad Power RadRover 6 Plus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">launched this week</a>, the latest model of the company&#8217;s flagship bike.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the e-bike for people who come to the world of biking from a car-centric background somewhat reluctantly, but get hooked to the smooth, sturdy ride, user-friendly design and really affordable price. This totally rad bike is only $1,999, and it&#8217;s built to last.</p>
<p>I talked to the bike manufacturer&#8217;s chief product officer, Redwood Stephens, and he explained how Rad Power&#8217;s business model is all about reducing friction for the customer, from the way you order your vehicle to the packaging it arrives in to the big obvious ON button. And this method appears to be going quite well for the company. In February it raised $150 million in funding, probably the most any e-bike company in America has ever raised.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> scored another $2.5 billion in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/rivian-raises-another-2-5b-pushing-its-ev-war-chest-up-to-10-5b/">private funding round of returning investors</a>. The round was led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in the round, according to Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised an eye-popping $10.5 billion to date. The company didn&#8217;t share a post-money valuation, but earlier this year when it had announced a $2.65 billion raise TechCrunch learned that its  valuation was $27.6 billion.</p>
<p>As the money comes in, the pressure is increasing for the company to deliver its consumer and commercial products. Rivian recently delayed deliveries of its R1T truck and R1S SUV from this summer to September due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips. The company also confirmed it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">open a second U.S. factory</a>.</p>
<p>My other &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; involves a deal that almost wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m speaking of <strong>Lucid Motors of</strong> course, which had to extend the deadline to approve its merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. (They were able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">approve the merger on Friday</a>).</p>
<p>The hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger &#8212; proposal two, which would revise the company&#8217;s charter so that Lucid could receive key financing. That proposal requires a higher number of votes than the others &#8212; and it must be approved for the merger to take place &#8212; so a lack of votes ended up halting the entire process. The lack of shareholders was blamed on retail investors&#8217; unfamiliarity with the SPAC process and, unbelievably, spam filters gone awry.</p>
<p>The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ChargePoint</strong> acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">European charging software company <strong>has·to·be</strong></a> for €250 million ($295 million) in cash and stock, the electric vehicle charging network&#8217;s first acquisition since it became a publicly traded company. Through the deal, ChargePoint gains more than just 125 employees and the company&#8217;s operating software, which manages more than 40,000 networked ports in Europe. The acquisition will give ChargePoint a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America, as well as VW Group as a strategic partner.</p>
<p><strong>Magna International</strong>, the Canadian auto parts maker, is going to <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/magna-international-buy-veoneer-38b?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FEuropeNews+%28Automotive+News+Europe+News+Feed%29">acquire its rival Veoneer</a>, which had spun off from safety equipment supplier Autoliv in 2018, for about $3.8 billion in cash, Automotive News reported. (This  also qualifies for my &#8220;deal of the week.&#8221;) The acquisition is going to give Magna a major boost, particularly in the area of driver assistance technologies business.</p>
<p>Magna will buy out Veoneer&#8217;s outstanding shares for $31.25 each, and the acquisition represents an enterprise value of $3.3 billion including debt, the companies said in a joint statement. Magna also said it will capture about $100 million in annual cost savings by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, a universal rewards platform and app that allows anyone with a smartphone to earn miles for all of their travel, raised $12.5 million in Series A funding round led by Scrum Ventures, with participation from TransLink Capital and Japan Airlines (JAL Innovation Fund), TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance (MS&amp;AD), Synapse Partners and several other prominent individual investors. The raise brings Miles&#8217; total funding to $20 million, with other notable investors including JetBlue Technology Ventures, Liil Ventures, Porsche Ventures, Panasonic, SAIC, Sony Innovation Fund, Urban Us (VC), and Gabe Klein (Co-founder CityFi).</p>
<p><strong>Rodo</strong>, an e-commerce startup focused on buying and selling vehicles, raised $18 million in a Series B financing round led by Holman Enterprises and Evolution VC Partners. The round also included existing investor IAC along with Kevin Hart&#8217;s HartBeat Ventures as well as auto industry veterans RML Automotive vice chairman Mack McLarty, McLarty Diversified Holdings Chairman and CEO Franklin McLarty and Ken Schnitzer, the former chairman of Park Place Automotive Group. Rodo, which has raised a total of $45 million to date, plans to use the funds to scale its dealership network nationwide and invest in marketing and customer acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Sonatus</strong>, the California-grown automotive software company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/auto-software-company-sonatus-raises-35-million-from-hyundai-motor-group-saic-capital/"> raised $35 million in a Series A round</a> that attracted high-profile technology and automotive industry companies including Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s Kia Corporation, SAIC Capital and LG Electronics. Silicon Valley VC Translink Capital led the round, with other investors including Marvell Technology, UMC Capital and Wanxiang Group Company.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">secure nickel</a> from the commodity production giant BHP. The companies didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of mineral that will be supplied, just that it will come from BHP&#8217;s Nickel West division mines in Western Australia. The two companies also agreed to work together to increase battery supply chain sustainability and to identify ways to decrease carbon emissions from their respective operations using energy storage paired with renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>Uber Freight</strong>, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, acquired TransPlace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">for $2.25 billion</a> from private equity group TPG Capital. It&#8217;s one of those upstream meets downstream type of deals. The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p>
<p>This deal marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an Adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner!</p>
<p>EV rebates and tax credits are a well-known incentive mechanism to encourage Americans to make the switch to electric, but people looking for micromobility incentives have historically been out of luck. A new bill introduced in the Senate is looking to change that. The <strong>Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act</strong> would give consumers a refundable 30% tax credit on the purchase of an electric bicycle, up to $1,500.</p>
<p>Qualifying bikes must be under $8,000 dollars and reach a max speed of no more than 28 miles per hour. So that means a huge swath of the market would be eligible for the credit. A <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1019/text?r=1&amp;s=1">sister bill</a> was introduced to the House earlier this year. If it passes in both parts of Congress, it would then head to President Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/blogs/the-scenic-route/an-inside-look-at-the-ebike-act">interesting interview</a> with <strong>Rep. Earl Blumenauer</strong>, one of the legislators who introduced the bill in the House. (Just a note, it was conducted by The Scenic Route, a vertical of e-bike seller <strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>.) The Congressman talks about how e-bike incentives could fit into the larger goals of the massive infrastructure bill currently being mulled by lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking to the Secretary of Transportation yesterday about the opportunities we have with this big infrastructure package and this is one of those elements that ties in with what we&#8217;re doing with the tax system,&#8221; Blumenauer said. &#8220;It reduces traffic congestion, there&#8217;s less pollution to contend with, and it eases the problem of parking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in Austin, where the hills have dissuaded me from cycling around &#8212; yet, the majority of my car trips are less than four miles. I&#8217;ve often thought that an electric bike would be a good way to use my car less. I&#8217;m sure many other Americans feel similarly.</p>

<p>As per ushe, there is a lot to get to this week. When will the news cycle slow down?</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> and its backer and customer Ford had the big AV story of the week. The two companies announced plans to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles</a> on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. I get deep into the details in the story, but the tl;dr includes Lyft taking a 2.5% stake in Argo, which now has a valuation of $12.4 billion.</p>
<p>The first Ford self-driving vehicles, which are equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, will become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year. Austin will follow next year, with the remaining U.S. cities being added to the Lyft app in 2023 and beyond. Argo currently tests in Detroit, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Jody Kelman, who heads up Lyft&#8217;s Autonomous, the company&#8217;s self-driving deployment business unit, answers the why we should care question: &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest deployment certainly that we&#8217;re doing and that I think anyone else is doing. One thousand cars across six markets is a big leap forward in terms of scaled commercialization.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mobileye</strong> expanded its autonomous vehicle testing program <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/">to New York City</a> as part of its strategy to develop and deploy the technology. If you&#8217;re not watching Mobileye, you should be — even those who don&#8217;t agree with the company&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>New York City joins a number of other cities, including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo, where Mobileye has either launched testing or plans to this year. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> is expanding into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/waymo-to-open-offices-in-pittsburgh-an-av-tech-hub/">AV hub Pittsburgh</a>. The company will start by hiring around a dozen engineers, a source familiar with the move told TechCrunch, and they&#8217;ll co-locate in Google&#8217;s existing offices in the Bakery Square district. As of Thursday, only around three open positions for the Pittsburgh area were listed on Waymo&#8217;s website, but the company will be adding more roles soon.</p>
<p>Notably, some of the new team will come from Pittsburgh-based RobotWits, a tech startup focused on autonomous vehicle decision-making. Waymo acquired RobotWits&#8217; IP rights and some members of its engineering and technical team as well as the company&#8217;s founder and CEO Maxim Likhachev are joining Waymo.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, the commercial electric vehicle company, has been chosen to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">build electric buses</a> for the City of Anaheim, California. The Federal Transportation Administration awarded Anaheim a $2 million grant in 2019. The city&#8217;s transportation network announced the plan to partner with Arrival to achieve its goal of running California&#8217;s first all-electric bus fleet by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Battery joint ventures</strong> have become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">hot must-have deal</a> for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years. TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan digs into what is driving this trend and provides a roundup of the latest deals.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> said it will add a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/gm-confirms-a-third-electric-pickup-truck-is-in-development/">full-size electric pickup truck</a> to its GMC lineup, the latest in a string of EV product announcements by the automaker in the past year as it pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. GM didn&#8217;t provide much more, but we can expect it to follow the GMC Hummer EV pickup that is coming  late this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla CEO Elon Musk</strong> said the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/elon-musk-tesla-to-open-up-global-charging-network-to-other-evs-later-this-year/">will allow other electric vehicles</a> to access its global network of chargers later this year. Musk has been chattering about this idea for years now; what made me take it a skosh more seriously is that he attached a timeline to this. My prediction is that Tesla owners will push back.</p>
<p>Speaking of Musk, the technoking said the automaker will &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-most-likely-accept-bitcoin-again-when-it-becomes-more-eco-friendly/">most likely&#8217; resume accepting bitcoin</a> as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables. He made the comments at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation. You might recall that Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that the company purchased a historic $1.5 billion in bitcoin &#8212; before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> laid out a €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">an electric-only automaker</a> by the end of the decade. To be clear, Mercedes did give itself some wiggle room in that ambitious goal, noting that it will be &#8220;ready to go all electric by the end of the decade, where markets allow.&#8221; This could mean that some combustion engine Mercedes, which are already equipped with 48-volt mild hybrid systems, will be produced and sold beyond the decade.</p>
<p>This target is driving Mercedes to become more vertically integrated, secure its supply chain and retraining its workforce. For instance, the automaker noted that it has <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">acquired U.K.-based electric motor company YASA, and has determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</span></p>
<h2>In-car tech and ADAS</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is rolling out three major upgrades including automatic lanes changes and towing support to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">hands-free driver assistance system</a> Super Cruise and making it available in six vehicles, including the 2022 all-new GMC Hummer EV pickup truck.</p>
<p>Speaking of Super Cruise, GM isn&#8217;t OK with <strong>Ford</strong> naming its own ADAS BlueCruise. GM and its self-driving vehicle subsidiary Cruise, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/564670-gm-files-trademark-lawsuit-against-ford">filed a lawsuit against Ford</a> claiming that the BlueCruise name is too similar to its Super Cruise trademark and Cruise&#8217;s trademark, The Hill reported.</p>
<h2>Ride-hailing, car-sharing and other stuff</h2>
<p><strong>Getaround</strong> was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/peer-to-peer-car-rental-startup-getaround-fined-nearly-1m-by-dcs-attorney-general/">fined nearly $1 million</a> by the Washington, D.C. Office of the attorney general for operating without a license and other violations, part of a settlement of what the peer-to-peer car rental startup calls &#8220;politically motivated allegations.&#8221;</p>
<h2>People makin&#8217; moves</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> has hired Yanbing Li as its new senior VP of engineering, according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6820569879918325760/">posting on LinkedIn</a>. Yanbing comes from Google, where she lead the enterprise services platform organization in Google Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> announced its board of directors and it contains some high-profile transportation folks, including Zoox CEO Aicha Evans, Dr. James Kuffner, CEO of Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings,·Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn Co-Founder and Co-Lead Director of Reinvent Technology Partners, Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado and Dipender Saluja the managing director of Capricorn Investment Group.</p>
<p>Of course, the board also includes Joby founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt, Founder and executive chairman Paul Sciarra.</p>
<p><strong>Velodyne Lidar</strong> lost its CEO, the latest in a series of issues and internal drama that have cropped up since the sensor company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp. CEO Anand Gopalan, who was previously CTO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">announced he is leaving</a> the lidar company at the end of July.</p>
<p>A team of top executives that includes COO Jim Barnhart, CFO Drew Hamer, Chief People Officer Kathy McBeath and Chief Commercial Officer Sinclair Vass will run the company as a search for a new chief executive is conducted. The company didn&#8217;t disclose why Gopalan was leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Xos</strong>, the electric truck company that is set to go public via SPAC merger later this summer, announced nominees for the board that will represent the combined company. Beyond Xos co-founders Dakota Semler and Giordano Sordoni, the list includes: Burt Jordan, the former VP of global purchasing operation and supply chain sustainability at Ford, S. Sara Mathew, the former chair and CEO at Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation, George Mattson, who co-dounded NextGen Acquisition Corporation, and Ed Rapp, the former group president for resource industries and former CFO at Caterpillar Inc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tick tock, early-stage startup fans: If you plan to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ebsavingsendthisweek&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ebsavingsendthisweekpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23), time is running out to score a pass to the world’s leading conference dedicated to tech startups — for less than $100. The early bird sale ends this week, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ebsavingsendthisweek&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ebsavingsendthisweekpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass here</a> before the deal expires on <strong>July 30 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>And if you’re part of the tech startup ecosystem — or aspire to be — why the heck wouldn’t you dive headlong into three days dedicated to the art and science required to build and scale successful startups? Just listen to what three past attendees said about their Disrupt experience.</p>
<p>Disrupt is a great sweet spot, and highly valuable, for anyone in the idea stage all the way through to having raised some angel money. Soak up the pitch deck teardowns and the VC presentations. They’re telling you what they&#8217;re looking for, what motivates them, what pushes them to contact you for a meeting. And that’s exactly what every startup raising capital needs to know. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“TechCrunch has created a great venue that brings together all the different people within the startup ecosystem. It’s a place where new startups can present, attendees can learn from top industry experts and who knows? One day they might be the person speaking on the Disrupt stage. It&#8217;s a great event overall.” — JC Bodson, founder and CEO of Arbitrage Technologies</p>
<p>“The connections I made at Disrupt offer long-term benefits. Investors willing to put forth capital, engineers offering tech expertise and manufacturers to help me streamline. Fostering these relationships will help me grow my company and my bottom line.” — Felicia Jackson, inventor and founder of CPRWrap.</p>
<p>Disrupt is the place to be to learn, connect, collaborate and keep tabs on rapidly changing trends. Here’s just one example of the timely topics and world-class experts we have on tap. Don’t forget to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">check out the agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Saving the World:</strong> COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and wellbeing, but it also shook industries and economies across the globe. The same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech Cofounder and CEO, Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world’s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://queenly.com/">Queenly</a>, a resale marketplace for formalwear, announced on Friday that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">grown its seed round</a> to $6.3 million in a financing round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Connie Chan. The financing event brings Queenly’s total venture raised to date at $7.1 million.</p>
<p>Queenly sees itself as a “StockX” for formalwear, but has its own hold on the resale market for luxury goods. The startup gets consumers to list their used dresses &#8211; whether it be from weddings, proms, or pageants &#8211; on the platform to sell at a discounted price to others. Sellers then make about 80% of the listed price when a dress is sold, while buyers get a unique dress that wouldn&#8217;t have been worn gain anyways.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JIsZsZIGRs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">The StockX EC-1</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The StockX EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/embed/#?secret=JIsZsZIGRs" data-secret="JIsZsZIGRs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement, A16z’s Chan said that she experienced “firsthand how unique but underserved the formalwear market is by technology.” The investor noted how fit is less important because people often rely on alterations, but uniqueness matters. She also credited the experience that the Queenly co-founders Trisha Bantigue and Kathy Zhou both have at pageants, which has made its way into the end-product.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the co-founders have put much of their energy into an algorithm designed to help buyers find the best dress for them, with search capabilities that are meant to be more inclusive of size and skin color than competitors like retail stores and Poshmark.</p>
<p>“These are just some things that we know because we’re women, and we know how to build this product for women,” Zhou said in a previous interview. “As opposed to if this was a male founder, they would not know that that would even be something that women would search for.”</p>
<p>The resale marketplace comes with its own challenges, the biggest of which can often be quality assurance. For dresses priced at $300 or less, Queenly gets proof photos of condition and then allows sellers ship directly to buyers. Dresses above $300 are routed through the company’s own operation, where a qualiy assurance team more closely checks for the condition of the dress.</p>
<p>Queenly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">graduated from Y Combinator in Winter 2021</a>, in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the lack of in-person events, the co-founders said that they had half a million in sales, thanks to Zoom weddings, Twitch pageants and socially-distant graduations. Queenly also got small fancy dress businesses, looking for a digital solution to get ubuyers, to list their inventory on the site.</p>
<p>The growth helped the startup raise while still in the accelerator, landing $800,000 from investors including Mike Smith, former COO of Stitch Fix, Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber, and Kelly Thompson, former COO of Samsclub.com and Walmart.com. The company then closed the first bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">its seed round at $2.3 million, </a>bringing on Dragon Capital along with other investors.</p>
<p>Now, three months later, Queenly has extended that seed round by a few million. The company declined to disclose its new valuation or sales volume, but did say that number of dresses on Queenly’s platform have grown from 50,000 in February to 60,000 now, in July. Queenly also landed a partnership, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/07/23/queenly-tackles-a-formalwear-industry-ripe-for-disruption/?sh=371688be3c5d">per Forbes,</a> with the Miss USA organization, which will help grow its footprint through contestants uploading their dresses to the platform. Of course, dresses aren&#8217;t synonymous with sales &#8211; but with millions more, the startup could be equipped to turn that reach into real dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Blue Origin, is offering to knock up to $2 billion off the cost of developing a lunar lander and to self-fund a pathfinder mission in exchange for a NASA contract.</p>
<p>The specific contract in question relates to developing a lunar lander for the Human Landing System program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo days. NASA announced in April 2020 that Blue Origin, SpaceX and Dynetics were chosen for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">the initial phase of the contract</a>, and it was thought that the competition would likely be whittled down to two final companies to build lunar landers. As TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">Darrell Etherington notes</a>, it’s not uncommon for NASA to select two vendors, as it did when it awarded both Boeing and SpaceX contracts under its Commercial Crew program.</p>
<p>But a year later, in a move that veered from historical practice, NASA announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">it had selected just one company</a> for the contract: SpaceX. That company, headed by Elon Musk, proposed a $2.89 billion plan for its lander – around half of Blue Origin’s $5.99 billion proposal. Bezos is now offering to cut that price tag by $2 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a document obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/">The Washington Post</a> explaining the rationale behind selecting a sole vendor for the HLS contract, NASA admits that it’s “current fiscal year budget did not support even a single [contract] award.” In response, SpaceX updated its payment schedule so it would fit “within NASA’s current budget.” That the agency has severe budgetary constraints is no secret: Congress approved just $850 million for the HLS program in fiscal year 2021, far short of the $3.4 billion NASA requested.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PDTOoJsNGS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">SpaceX wins NASA contract to develop human landing system for returning to the moon</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX wins NASA contract to develop human landing system for returning to the moon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/embed/#?secret=PDTOoJsNGS" data-secret="PDTOoJsNGS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Enter <a href="https://blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson">Bezos’ open letter</a> to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, which addresses the budget issue directly. He writes that the proposed incentives would remedy “perceived near-term budgetary issues” with the Human Landing System Program, which caused NASA to select a single company instead of two.</p>
<p>“Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the Agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX,” Bezos says in the letter. “That decision broke the mold of NASA’s successful commercial space programs by putting an end to meaningful competition for years to come.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Blue Origin has publicly questioned NASA’s decision to go with just one vendor. The company, along with Dynetics, filed protests with the Government Accountability Office just one week after the award was announced. Blue Origin argued that the contract requirements did not give companies an ability to “meaningfully compete.” GAO must rule on the protest by August 4.</p>
<p>Blue Origin and Dynetics are not the only entities to support two contract awards. The Senate recently passed a bill that would, among other things, require NASA to select two companies for the HLS lander – and the extra funds to do so, <a href="https://spacenews.com/senate-passes-nasa-authorization-act-2/">SpaceNews reported</a>. Not every lawmaker was happy about the inclusion of the extra funding, however: Senator Bernie Sanders called it a &#8220;Bezos bailout,&#8221; but was ultimately unsuccessful in getting the extra funding stripped from the bill.</p>
<p>“We stand ready to help NASA moderate its technical risks and solve its budgetary constraints and put the Artemis Program back on a more competitive, credible, and sustainable path,” Bezos said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com/">Box</a> released its new native e-signature product Box Sign on Monday, providing e-signature capability and unlimited signatures as part of Box’s business and enterprise plans at no additional cost.</p>
<p>The launch comes five months after the Redwood City, California-based company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">agreed to acquire</a> e-signature startup <a href="http://signrequest.com/">SignRequest</a> for $55 million.</p>
<p>Box CEO Aaron Levie told TechCrunch the company is already securing content management for 100,000 businesses, and Box Sign represents “a breakthrough product for the company” — a new category in which Box can help customers with business processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are building out a content cloud that powers the lifecycle of content so customers can retain and manage it,” Levie said. “Everyday, there are more transactions around onboarding a customer, closing a deal or an audit, but these are still done manually. We are moving that to digital and enabling the request of signatures around the content.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Users can send documents for e-signature directly from Box to anyone, even those without a Box account. Places for signature requests and approvals can be created anywhere on the document. All of this integrates across popular apps like Salesforce and includes email reminders and deadline notifications. As with Box’s offerings, the signatures are also secure and compliant.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/digital-signature-market?utm_source=PRN&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=PRN_PAID">global e-signature software market</a> was estimated to be around $1.8 billion in 2020, according to Prescient &amp; Strategic Intelligence, while <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US46257920">IDC expects it to grow to $3.8 billion</a> by 2023.</p>
<p>Levie considers the market still early as less than one-third of organizations use e-signature due to legacy tool limitations and cost barriers, revealing massive future opportunities. However, that may be changing: Box worked with banks during the pandemic that were still relying on mailing, scanning and faxing documents to help them adapt to digital processes. It also surveyed its customers last year around product capabilities, and the No. 1 “ask” was e-signature, he said.</p>
<p>He mentioned major players DocuSign and Adobe Sign — two products it will continue to integrate with — among the array of technology within the space. He said that Box is not trying to compete with any player, but saw a need from customers and wanted to proceed with an option for them.</p>
<p>The e-signature offering also follows the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005237/en/Box-Announces-Appointment-of-Diego-Dugatkin-as-Chief-Product-Officer">hiring of Diego Dugatkin</a> in June as Box’s new chief product officer. Prior to joining, Dugatkin was vice president of product management for Adobe Document Cloud and led strategy and execution for Adobe’s suite of products, including Adobe Sign.</p>
<p>“Our strategy has been for many years to expand our portfolio and power more advanced use cases, as well as a vision to have one platform to manage everything,” Levie said. “Diego has two decades of tremendous domain experience, and he will make a massive dent in powering this for us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the e-signature product, Box also introduced its Enterprise Plus plan that includes all of the company’s major add-ons, as well as advanced e-signature capabilities that will be available later this summer, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aditi Shekar&#8217;s path to entrepreneurship was a very intentional one, and while it wasn&#8217;t quite a childhood dream, it was the real-world version of the goals she did have as a kid. Fast forward to today, and Aditi&#8217;s company Zeta is on a rocket ship ride in fintech, having recently jumped from being a money management and virtual adviser app for couples, to an actual financial solutions provider built from the ground up with shared financial management in mind.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of Found, TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook and I sit down with Aditi to talk about where she gets her endless drive and determination, to why she loves financial management (I&#8217;m trying to get her zeal to wear off on me, tbh). We also get into why Zeta makes so much sense in the context of a field of legacy financial solutions that generally don&#8217;t acknowledge that the way we manage and think about money, especially as it relates to the dynamics between multiple people, has changed significantly over the course of the past several decades.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kut4flfo6R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">What should banking look like for modern couples?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Aditi definitely isn&#8217;t afraid to get real about what&#8217;s required to be an entrepreneur and dedicate yourself to a vision you really believe in. And as usual, Jordan and I end up feeling deeply inadequate and ashamed about our life choices — but in a fun way.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and me <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ever wake up to just a massive wall of news? That was us this morning, so we had to pick and choose. But since this show is about getting you caught up, we decided to focus on the largest, broadest new information that we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian stocks were down, European shares are lower and U.S. equities are set to open underwater. Bitcoin had a great weekend, however.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s edtech crackdown <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiger-temasek-investors-scarred-china-210000015.html">continued over the weekend</a>, with the country&#8217;s ruling party setting new rules for online tutoring companies; they can no longer go public and will be forced to become nonprofit entities. Chinese edtech stocks around the world fell.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s larger tech crackdown continued, with new moves against the present-day business models of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meituan-dives-14-china-tech-100133466.html">both food delivery companies</a> <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/tencent-shares-slide-after-beijing-music-crackdown/ar-AAMyzfJ">and Tencent Music</a>. The former must ensure minimum incomes, while the latter must give up exclusive rights deals. Shares fell.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/jam-city-ends-spac-deal-that-would-have-made-1-2-billion-firm-1.1632468">Jam City SPAC is kaput</a>. It will not be the last similar deal to fall apart.</li>
<li>And we chatted about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/rivian-raises-another-2-5b-pushing-its-ev-war-chest-up-to-10-5b/">this bit of Rivian news</a> because it stood out to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that, and we had a good time! Hugs and love from the Equity crew &#8212; chat Wednesday!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spotify, with the launch of a more attention-grabbing notifications feature, wants to increase user engagement, even if it sacrifices some sense of user comfort and enjoyment in the process.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is taking a cue from social networks like Facebook, which deliver a constant stream of notifications under a &#8220;bell&#8221; icon in the mobile app to keep users engaged with the latest content. This morning, Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-26/spotifys-whats-new-feed-means-youll-never-miss-the-latest-releases-from-the-shows-and-artists-you-follow/">introduced</a> what it&#8217;s calling the &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; feed, which will deliver an ongoing series of updates to mobile app users focused on new releases.</p>
<p>According to the company, the What&#8217;s New feed will serve as another way for Spotify users to keep up with all the new music and podcasts that are released from the shows and artists that they follow on the service. In other words, it&#8217;s a personalized feed based on what you listen to, not a universal feed or one you more explicitly customize by making specific selections.</p>
<p>The feed will be under the new &#8220;bell&#8221; icon at the top of the home tab alongside the recently played and settings icons on the top right.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2181846" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181846" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181846" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/What_s-New-GIF-2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181846" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The feed will be also updated in real-time, Spotify says, and will display a blue dot when there are new songs and episodes that arrived since you last opened the app. Before, you could find information about new releases in various places in the app, including your home tab and in hubs on the app&#8217;s search page.</p>
<p>While the feature may be useful because it gives you a single place to look in the Spotify app for everything that&#8217;s new, the use of a &#8220;notifications&#8221; feature that leverages dots is also a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html">psychological trick</a> that can make apps more addictive. Dots express a sense of urgency &#8212; making you feel as if you need to click to see what&#8217;s new or even just clear the dot. In fact, there was such a backlash against the overabundance of these dots inside social apps that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/facebook-may-finally-let-you-turn-off-those-annoying-notification-dots/">even Facebook a couple of years ago</a> rolled out tools that let you turn its annoying red notification dots off. (To be fair, Facebook hasn&#8217;t fully embraced red dot removal &#8212; the default is still set to &#8220;on&#8221; and there are plenty of notification dots all over its website today).</p>
<p>This seemingly minor addition to the Spotify app is actually a quite calculated one &#8212; and one that steps back from the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">humane technology movement</a> that emerged in recent years as a way to counter the overuse of growth hacks and other tricks to make apps more addictive.</p>
<p>Now, many companies are moving away from addictive features. Apple, for example, has added consumer-facing tools that put users back in control of when apps can notify them, including with the upcoming iOS 15 release, which lets you bundle notifications into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/">daily summaries</a> for less important apps or switch into &#8220;focus&#8221; modes for when you need fewer distractions. TikTok, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/tiktoks-new-screen-time-prompts-remind-users-to-take-a-breather-21816527">inserts videos</a> that remind you when you&#8217;ve been watching for too long. Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">added</a> a message at the end of your feed to let you know when you were &#8220;all caught up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify, with the launch of a more attention-grabbing notifications feature, is doing the opposite &#8212; it wants to increase user engagement, even if it understands that it may be sacrificing some sense of user comfort and enjoyment in the process.</p>
<p>What’s New is rolling out to all users globally on iOS and Android over the next few weeks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now that you have that COVID dog, Embark Veterinary wants to help him or her be in your life for a long time by offering DNA testing with the goal of increasing their lifespan.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that you have that COVID dog, <a href="https://embarkvet.com/">Embark Veterinary</a> wants to help him or her be in your life for a long time by offering DNA testing with the goal of curbing preventable diseases and increasing the lifespan of dogs by three years within the next decade.</p>
<p>The Boston-based dog genetics company raised $75 million in Series B funding in what the company is calling “the biggest Series B for a pet startup to date.” SoftBank Vision Fund 2 was the lead investor and was joined by existing investors F-Prime Capital, SV Angel, Slow Ventures, Freestyle Capital and Third Kind Venture Capital.</p>
<p>The new round boosts Embark’s total funding to $94.3 million since the company was founded in 2015, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/embark-veterinary/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>. It also gives it a post-money valuation of $700 million, Embark founder and CEO Ryan Boyko told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boyko has been a dog lover all his life, and also interested in biology and evolution. Dogs, in particular, are fascinating to him because of their variety: they can be bred to be two pounds or 200 pounds, and come in all shapes and sizes. His interest led him to study dogs in order to understand their evolution.</p>
<p>“I began to think about health problems, and honestly, dogs are a better system for using genetics to better their health than humans,” Boyko said. “You can breed them, so genetics has as much power to cause health problems as it can improve quality and life.”</p>
<p>Embark’s dog DNA test retails for $199 and enables dog owners, breeders and veterinarians to personalize care plans based on a dog’s unique genetic profile. It can test for over 350 breeds and 200 genetic health risks, as well as physical traits. Similar to a 23andMe test, test users can learn characteristics about breed, health and ancestry.</p>
<p>For example, the test could show that a healthy dog may have a gene that predisposes them to slipped discs. If the dog has that, then weight management would be an important factor in their care regime, as would not allowing them to jump off the couch. Another common genetic risk is HUU, or Hyperuricosuria, which is elevated levels of uric acid in urine that could lead to bladder stones due to the way dogs process minerals. By changing the dog’s diet, it could reduce the risk for developing the stones, which are painful and expensive to treat, Boyko said.</p>
<p>The test’s technology revolves around proprietary genotyping technology that analyzes more than 200,000 genetic markers, currently two times more information than any other dog DNA test on the market, Boyko said. This gives Embark the world’s largest database of canine health and biological information, enabling the company to provide insights into certain conditions and make new discoveries about health risks, traits and breeds.</p>

<p>Embark aims to become the standard of care for dog owners and vets. It grew 235% between 2019 and 2020 and saw five times the sales over the past two years. To support that growth, the company intends to use the new funding to bring on key hires and expand its database. Boyko anticipates adding more than 100 employees between 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>Boyko said the opportunity in the pet startup space is huge. Indeed, U.S. spending on pets reached nearly <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-04-15/annual-spending-pets-nearing-100b">$100 billion</a> in 2020, up from $95.7 billion in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-pet-products-association">American Pet Products Association</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, venture capital interest in U.S. pet-focused companies, from nutrition to travel to healthcare, grew 29.5% from 2019 and 2020, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/pets-became-purrfect-pals-during-pandemic-while-startup-funding-didnt-lay-down/">according to Crunchbase data</a>. In addition to Embark’s funding, 2021 was good to other pet startups as well, including pet insurance company Wagmo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/wagmo-raises-12-5-million-to-offer-pet-insurance-and-a-lot-more/">raising $12.5 million</a>, connected pet collar company Fi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/newly-launched-pet-health-startup-gallant-wants-you-to-bank-your-dogs-stem-cells-for-990/">received $30 million</a> and Rover, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/inside-rover-and-moneylions-spac-led-public-debuts/">announced plans to go public</a> via SPAC.</p>
<p>Lydia Jett, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, told TechCrunch that this was her first pet-based investment, and what Embark is doing brings advances to a category right now where people care about their pets enough that they want to do something that will expand their value of life.</p>
<p>Jett said the management team being dedicated to DNA-based analytics is the future, and Embark is starting this big curve when it comes to pets and the convergence of real emotional ties to pets and the ability to improve their lives.</p>
<p>“This company is a driver of change to happen,” she added. “We are the largest consumer investor in the world, and Embark is very much aligned with what we are seeing across our portfolio that consumers are revisiting priorities and choices. That is a major trend, but still early in the cycle of personalization for their pets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss of a loved one is perhaps one of the most traumatic things a person can experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to memorializing someone after their death, most people think of planning funerals and/or picking out caskets or tombstones. And those things are typically done with the help of a funeral home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Austin-based <a href="https://eterneva.com/">Eterneva</a>, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is building a rare direct to consumer brand in the end-of life-space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The four-year-old startup creates diamonds from the cremated ashes or hair of people and pets. It’s a highly unusual business but one that seems to be resonating with people seeking a way to keep a piece of their loved ones close to them after their death.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Eterneva has seen triple-digit growth in sales &#8212; including in 2020, when it more than doubled its revenue, according to CEO and co-founder Adelle Archer. And today, the company is announcing an “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oversubscribed” $10M Series A led funding round led by Tiger Management with participation from Goodwater Capital, Capstar Ventures, NextCoast Ventures and Dallas billionaire Mark Cuban. (For the unacquainted, Tiger Management is the hedge fund and family office of Julian Robertson from which Tiger Global Management descended.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was an extremely competitive round,” Archer told TechCrunch. “We received three term sheets and were able to put together an all-star investment group.” That investment group included Capstar Managing DIrector </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cavanaughk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathryn Cavanaugh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who also joined Eterneva’s board; Lydia Jett – one of the </span><a href="https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/celebritytalentbios/Lydia+Jett/423243"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top female partners at Softbank overseeing their $100B Vision Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Kara Nortman, managing partner at Upfront Capital, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/now-a-co-managing-partner-upfronts-kara-nortman-is-one-of-the-first-women-promoted-to-a-leadership-role-in-vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the first women to make managing partner at a VC fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and co-founder of Angel City with actress Natalie Portman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archer and co-founder Garrett Ozar launched Eterneva in the first quarter of 2017 after working together at BigCommerce. The company’s origin story is a very personal one for Archer. Her close friend and business mentor, Tracey Kaufman, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and ended up passing away at the age of 47. With no next of kin, Kaufman left her cremated ashes to her aunt, best friend and Archer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started looking into different options but all the websites we landed on were so lackluster, somber and overwhelming,” Archer recalls. “Tracey was the most amazing person, and I felt like when you lose remarkable people, you needed better options to honor and memorialize them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Archer was working on a lab-grown diamond startup. Over dinner with a diamond scientist during which she was discussing her mentor&#8217;s death, the scientist said, &#8220;Well, you know Adele, there is carbon in ashes, so we could get the carbon out of Tracey&#8217;s ashes and make a diamond.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The thought blew Archer’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew that I had to do that, 100%. Tracy was such a vibrant person, it suited her so perfectly,” she said. “And I’d have a part of her with me all the time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first diamond ever created by Eterneva, and it gave Archer a chance to be a customer of her own product, which she believes has helped in building an experience for her other customers. Soon, she became “fully focused” on the idea, which she viewed as a way to give grieving people “brightness and healing and a beautiful way to honor their loved ones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since inception, Eterneva has created nearly 1,500 diamonds for over 1,000 customers. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can do colorless or nearly any color including black, yellow, blue, orange and green. The entry price for an Eterneva diamond is $2,999 and that goes up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on the size and color. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets make up about 40% of Eterneva’s business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We view ourselves as the complete opposite tone of everything else in this space,” Archer said. “A lot of people are trying to solve planning and logistics around the end of life. We’re about helping people move forward, and building a platform for the celebration of life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to create the diamond is intricate, according to Archer, taking 7 to 9 months. The intent is to bring the customer along the journey by sharing the process with them at each stage through videos and pictures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do it in parallel with their processing grief, which is super isolating,” Archer said. “They are usually in a different place with their grief than when they first started.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the plans with the new capital is to enable more people to participate in person with the process such as, starting the machine work, or telling the jeweler stories about their loved one and coming up with a custom design that might have little details that represent aspects of their loved one’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to use the money to scale their funeral home channel program nationwide via Enterprise partnerships and scaling its operations and capacity in Austin so it can keep up with demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eterneva is banking on the fact that more and more “people don’t want traditional funerals anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want personalization and meaning,” said Archer. “We plan to evolve the platform with different products and services down the road.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also wants to continue to build awareness around its brand. Recently, it’s seen more than</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eterneva/video/6911861936330214662?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6891455354422593029"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a dozen videos on TikTok about its diamonds go viral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Archer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the Series A, Eterneva has raised a total of $6.7 million from angels and institutions. Its seed round was a $3 million financing led by Austin-based Springdale Ventures in 2020. Mark Cuban first became an investor in the company when Archer and Ozar appeared on Shark Tank. Cuban took a 9% stake in the company in exchange for a $600,000 investment. Despite claims that the company was a scam, Cuban has </span><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2019/12/30/mark-cuban-says-cremation-diamond-company-he-backed-isnt-a-scam-despite-expert-claims/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stood by the science behind it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and put money in the latest round as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email, he told TechCrunch he views an Eterneva diamond as “a unique, socially responsible way to stay connected to loved ones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There is still so much upside and growth in their future,” Cuban wrote. “So I doubled down.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe the creation of diamond from the hair or ashes of a loved one as “such an intense personal commitment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eternava takes a very emotional and difficult and helps people walk through their journey in a trusted way that I don’t think anyone else can come close to,” Cuban added.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sila's banking and payment platform gives software teams tools to build the next generation of financial products and services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://silamoney.com">Sila</a> announced Monday it raised $13 million in Series A funding for its banking and payment platform that gives software teams tools to build the next generation of financial products and services.</p>
<p>Revolution Ventures led the round and was joined by existing investors Madrona Venture Group, Oregon Venture Fund and Mucker Capital, as well as Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus. The funding brings the total investment to date for Portland, Oregon-based Sila to $20 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by Shamir Karkal, Angela Angelovska, Isaac Hines and Alex Lipton to simplify digital payments and storage in a regulatory compliant way and build on blockchain technology. CEO Karkal has a long history in the fintech space, co-founding Simple, an app unifying various accounts into one accessible bank card, in 2009. It was acquired by BBVA in 2014 for $117 million and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/simple-bank-closing-what-means-for-money-2021-1">shuttered earlier this year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Karkal told TechCrunch that the idea for Sila was born out of frustration while starting another bank. He saw a need for financial application development, but was hindered by a banking system “still stuck in the 20th century.” He thought consumers expected a different level of service, which is why many flock to fintechs.</p>
<p>However, whenever a business tried to connect existing banking systems, fintechs and cryptocurrency innovators, as it built and scale, would always run into technology and compliance issues, Karkal said.</p>
<p>“The problem with working with banks, is that you have to figure out how to integrate with their mainframe,” he added. “In the process, you end up having to also be compliance experts just to be able to do it.”</p>
<p>Whereas it took Karkal three years to get bank processes set up for other companies, it took Sila 18 months. Its banking APIs enable developers to create their own digital wallets, replacing the need to integrate with legacy financial institutions. Sila also has partnerships with fintech platforms, including Plaid, Alloy, Lithic and Arcus to move money, and is backed by Evolve Bank and Trust.</p>
<p>Sila can now get customers up-and-running in six to eight weeks. And unlike competitors that focus almost exclusively on e-commerce, most of Sila’s customers are doing regulated payments within the fintech, insurtech, commercial real estate and cryptocurrency spaces that tend to be more complex from a compliance basis, Karkal said.</p>
<p>Since the company launched its platform, business was building steadily, and took off in the second half of 2020. The company raised a $7.7 million seed round earlier in the year. In the last 12 months, Sila grew its revenue 10 times and customers’ end users grew over 500% in the last seven months.</p>
<p>Sila will use the new funding to increase headcount, target additional partners and expand product features, including its Ethereum MainNet stablecoin issuance and interoperability between FedWire and the Nacha Automated Clearing House network.</p>
<p>“There is a massive wave of fintechs emerging in the U.S., and we have barely scratched the surface,” Karkal said. “Places like India, Africa and Latin America could accelerate at the same time because they are mainly starting from zero. We are here to ‘arm the rebels’ and help those innovators build applications to give all end users a much better financial experience.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Clara Sieg, partner at Revolution Ventures, is joining the company’s board. She told TechCrunch she met the company’s co-founders through the Portland ecosystem.</p>
<p>Revolution tends to look at fintech startups from a consumer angle. Recognizing that the problem with building infrastructure meant dealing with banks, the firm set out how to find a company building the pipes to solve it, she said.</p>
<p>In the landscape of fintech, she considers Dwolla to be a competitor to Sila. Last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/dwolla-raises-21m-to-bring-more-customizable-payment-and-money-transfer-options-to-fintechs-and-brands/">raised $21 million</a> to continue developing its API that allows companies to build and facilitate fast payments, specifically with a focus on ACH. However, it comes down to actually signing up customers, and that competitive landscape is pretty thin, Sieg added.</p>
<p>“Sila is building an easy way for people to program money and taking a regulatory eye to things,” Sieg said. “When Shamir was building Simple, he could see how challenging it was for incumbents to provide the tools developers need to embed financial services, and this is why we have confidence in his ability to win.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Foodtech company NotCo, making plant-based milk and meat replacements, wrapped up another funding round this year, a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://notco.com/">NotCo</a>, a food technology company making plant-based milk and meat replacements, wrapped up another funding round this year, a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the round and was joined by new investors, including DFJ Growth Fund, the social impact foundation, ZOMA Lab; athletes Lewis Hamilton and Roger Federer; and musician and DJ Questlove. Follow-on investors included Bezos Expeditions, Enlightened Hospitality Investments, Future Positive, L Catterton, Kaszek Ventures, SOSV and Endeavour Catalyst.</p>
<p>This funding round follows an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005370/en/">undisclosed investment</a> in June from Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer through his firm EHI. In total, NotCo, with roots in both Chile and New York, has raised more than $350 million, founder and CEO Matias Muchnick told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/notco/">company</a> has four product lines: NotMilk, NotBurger and NotMeat, NoticeCream and NotMayo, which are available in the five countries of the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.</p>
<p>The company is operating in the middle of a trend toward eating healthier food, as more consumers also question how their food is made, resulting in demand for alternative proteins. In fact, the <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2021/the-benefits-of-plant-based-meats">market for alternative meat, eggs, dairy and seafood products</a> is predicted to reach $290 billion by 2035, according to research by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boston-consulting-group">Boston Consulting Group</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blue-horizon-corporation">Blue Horizon Corp</a>.</p>
<p>NotCo’s proprietary artificial intelligence technology, Giuseppe, matches animal proteins to their ideal replacements among thousands of plant-based ingredients. It is working to crack the code in understanding the molecular components and food characteristics in the combination of two ingredients that could mimic milk, but in a more sustainable and resourceful way &#8212; and that also tastes good, which is the biggest barrier to adoption, Muchnick said.</p>
<p>“Our theory is that there is a crazy dynamic among people: 60% who are already eating plant-based are not happy with the taste, and 30% of those who drink cow’s milk are waiting to change if there is a similar taste,” he added. “Our technology is based in AI so that we can create a different food system, as well as products faster and better than others in the space. There are 300,000 plant species, and we still have no idea what 99% of them can do.”</p>
<p>In addition to a flow of investments this year, the company launched its NotMilk brand in the United States seven months ago and is on track to be in 8,000 locations across retailers like Whole Foods Market, Sprouts and Wegmans by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Muchnick plans to allocate some of the new funding to establish markets in Mexico and Canada and add market share in the U.S. and Chile. He expects to have 50% of its business coming from the U.S. over the next three years. He is also eyeing an expansion into Asia and Europe in the next year.</p>
<p>NotCo also intends to add more products, like chicken and other white meats and seafood, and to invest in technology and R&amp;D. He expects to do that by doubling the company’s current headcount of 100 in the next two years. Muchnick also wants to establish more patents in food science — the company already has five — and to explore a potential intelligence side of the business.</p>
<p>Though NotCo reached unicorn status, Muchnick said the real prize is the brand awareness and subsequent sales boost, as well as opening doors for quick-service restaurant deals. NotBurger went into Burger King restaurants in Chile 11 months ago, and now has 5% of the market there, he added.</p>
<p>Sales overall have grown three times annually over the past four years, something Muchnick said was attractive to Tiger Global. He is equally happy to work with Tiger, especially as the company prepares to go public in the next two or three years. He said Tiger’s expertise will get NotCo there in a more prepared manner.</p>
<p>“NotCo has created world class plant-based food products that are rapidly gaining market share,” said Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with Matias and his team. We expect continued product innovation and expansion into new geographies and food categories will fuel high and sustainable growth for years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If efforts<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/maines-facial-recognition-law-shows-bipartisan-support-for-protecting-privacy/"> by states</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/"> cities</a> to pass privacy regulations curbing the use of facial recognition are anything to go by, you might fear the worst for the companies building the technology. But a recent influx of investor cash suggests the facial recognition startup sector is thriving, not suffering.</p>
<p>Facial recognition is one of the most controversial and complex policy areas in play. The technology can be used to track where you go and what you do. It&#8217;s used by public authorities and in private businesses like stores. But facial recognition has been shown to be flawed and inaccurate, often <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/lawmakers-amazon-recognition-racially-biased-harm-free-expression/">misidentifies non-white faces</a>, and is disproportionately <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-has-always-troubled-people-of-color-everyone-should-listen/">affects communities of color</a>. Its flawed algorithms have already been used to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"> send innocent people to jail</a>, and privacy advocates have raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/amazon-facial-recognition-software-raises-privacy-concerns-with-the-aclu/"> countless concerns</a> about how this kind of biometric data is stored and used.</p>
<p>With the threat of federal legislation looming, some of the biggest facial recognition companies like Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">announced they would stop selling their facial recognition technology</a> to police departments to try to appease angry investors, customers, and even their own employees who<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/tech-workers-demonstrate-in-downtown-san-francisco-against-trumps-immigration-plans/"> protested the deployment</a> of such technologies by the U.S. government and immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The pushback against facial recognition didn&#8217;t stop there. Since the start of the year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/"> Maine</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/">Massachusetts</a>, and the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/"> city of Minneapolis</a> have all passed legislation curbing or banning the use of facial recognition in some form, following in the steps of many other cities and states before them and setting the stage for others, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/new-york-city-biometrics-law/"> New York</a>, which are eyeing legislation of their own.</p>
<p>In those same six or so months, investors have funneled hundreds of millions into several facial recognition startups. A breakdown of<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/breakdown-venture-capital-floods-into-facial-recognition/"> Crunchbase data by FindBiometrics</a> shows a sharp rise in venture funding in facial recognition companies at well over $500 million in 2021 so far, compared to $622 million for all of 2020.</p>
<p>About half of that $500 million comes from one startup alone. Israel-based startup AnyVision<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/"> raised $235 million at Series C</a> earlier this month from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 for its facial recognition technology that&#8217;s used<a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/07/06/this-manual-for-a-popular-facial-recognition-tool-shows-just-how-much-the-software-tracks-people"> in schools</a>, stadiums, casinos, and retail stores. Macy&#8217;s is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/exclusive-why-us-hospital-oil-company-turned-facial-recognition-2021-04-20/"> a known customer</a>, and uses the face-scanning technology to identify shoplifters. It&#8217;s a steep funding round compared to a year earlier when Microsoft publicly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/29/divesting-from-one-facial-recognition-startup-microsoft-ends-outside-investments-in-the-tech/"> pulled its investment</a> in AnyVision&#8217;s Series A<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/29/divesting-from-one-facial-recognition-startup-microsoft-ends-outside-investments-in-the-tech/"> following an investigation</a> by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder into reports that the startup&#8217;s technology was being used by the Israeli government to surveil residents in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Paravision, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/"> marred by controversy</a> after it was accused of using facial recognition on its users without informing them, raised $23 million in a funding round led by J2 Ventures.</p>
<p>And last week, Clearview AI, the controversial facial recognition startup that is the subject of several government investigations and multiple class-action suits for allegedly scraping<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/clearview-facial-recognition-private-companies/"> billions of profile photos</a> from social media sites, confirmed to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/clearview-ai-valuation.html"> The New York Times</a> it raised $30 million from investors who asked &#8220;not to be identified,&#8221; only that they are &#8220;institutional investors and private family offices.&#8221; That is to say, while investors are happy to see their money go towards building facial recognition systems, they too are all too aware of the risks and controversies associated with attaching their names to the technology.</p>
<p>Although the applications and customers of facial recognition wildly vary, there&#8217;s still a big market for the technology.</p>
<p>Many of the cities and towns with facial recognition bans also have carve outs that allow its use in some circumstances, or broad exemptions for private businesses that can freely buy and use the technology. The exclusion of many China-based facial recognition companies, like Hikvision and Dahua, which the government has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/united-states-towns-hikvision-dahua-surveillance/"> linked to human rights abuses</a> against the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, as well as dozens of other startups<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/trump-us-blacklist-megvii-sensetime-yitu-xinjiang"> blacklisted</a> by the U.S. government, has helped push out some of the greatest competition from the most lucrative U.S. markets, like government customers</p>
<p>But as facial recognition continues to draw scrutiny, investors are urging companies to do more to make sure their technologies are not being misused.</p>
<p>In June, a group of 50 investors with more than $4.5 trillion in assets called on dozens of facial recognition companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba and Huawei, to build their technologies ethically.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some instances, new technologies such as facial recognition technology may also undermine our fundamental rights. Yet this technology is being designed and used in a largely unconstrained way, presenting risks to basic human rights,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just ethics, but also a matter of trying to future-proof the industry from inevitable further political headwinds. In April, the European Union&#8217;s top data protection watchdog called for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">end to facial recognition</a> in public spaces across the bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;As mass surveillance expands, technological innovation is outpacing human rights protection. There are growing reports of bans, fines, and blacklistings of the use of facial recognition technology. There is a pressing need to consider these questions,&#8221; the statement added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you are a coffee lover, taste matters, and <a href="https://www.spinn.com/">Spinn</a> is brewing up some fresh funding in the way of a $20 million funding round, led by Spark Capital, to bring connected coffee to new customers through its hardware-enabled coffee marketplace.</p>
<p>Joining Spark in the round were Amazon’s Alexa Fund, Bar 9 Ventures and existing investors. It gives the Los Angeles-based company a total of $37 million in funding to date, CEO Roderick de Rode told TechCrunch. He isn’t defining this round, but said Spinn previously raised both Series A and B rounds.</p>
<p>“SPINN is doing for coffee what Dyson did for vacuums and what Nest did for homes, rethinking technology and connectivity for better results,” said Kevin Thau, general partner at Spark Capital, in a written statement. “Their approach, from machine design to roaster assortment, is elevating the entire industry and delivering what consumers seek today: delicious tasting coffee brewed to their personal preferences, with the smallest impact on the planet.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spinn debuted its centrifugal brewing method at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/spinns-unique-coffee-brewer-brings-third-wave-roasters-to-your-countertop/">TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2016</a>. The connected coffee maker uses centrifugal force to spin, instead of press, coffee grounds. De Rode says this results in a cup of coffee tasting how it was intended by the roaster. The machines can be controlled via voice command from Amazon’s Alexa or a single tap on the machine or from a mobile app.</p>
<p>A survey released in April by National Coffee Association USA found that the global pandemic was the driver for <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Newsroom/COVID-19-drives-record-at-home-coffee-drinking-on-the-go-ordering-2021-National-Coffee-Data-Trends-Report">85% of Americans drinking at least one cup of coffee at home</a>, up 8% from January 2020. Nearly 60% of Americans drink coffee every day, and one-quarter purchased a new home coffee machine over the past year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Osma&#8217;s high-tech instant cold brew could change summertime coffee forever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/osmas-high-tech-instant-cold-brew-could-change-summertime-coffee-forever/embed/#?secret=Nac1y8Cly2" data-secret="Nac1y8Cly2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to Spinn, other startups are coming out with machines aimed at making a better cup; for example, <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">Osma</a> is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/osmas-high-tech-instant-cold-brew-could-change-summertime-coffee-forever/">new coffee-making technique</a> to make a strong espresso-like drink at any temperature, including icy cold.</p>
<p>Spinn itself has three coffee makers to choose from that retail for $479 to $799, according to its website. The machines don’t require any filters or coffee pods and make a variety of styles, including espresso, Americano, drip and cold brew.</p>
<p>The marketplace offers over 1,500 different kinds of coffee from more than 500 artisan roasters around the world. Customers add their coffee choices to a playlist of sorts, which can be specifically curated to ship or scheduled randomly, de Rode said. Drinkers can leave reviews and get recommendations, as well as take a quiz to match with various coffees.</p>
<p>He plans to use the new funding to further grow and develop its patented brewing technologies, and complete delivery of outstanding pre-orders.</p>
<p>Though de Rode wouldn’t go into specifics about Spinn’s growth metrics, he said there has been triple-digit growth from home users. He aims to do for coffee what Vivino did with wine: provide educational content about the coffee options and the roasters themselves.</p>
<p>“The coffee industry is becoming a food thing just like wine,” de Rode said. “People want to understand the different kinds of beans to make more sophisticated choices. We try to bridge the gap between the coffee shop and home.”</p>
