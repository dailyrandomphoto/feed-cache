										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced today that it&#8217;s rolling out new shopping features: Shops in Groups, product recommendations and a test of Live Shopping for Creators.</p>
<p>Shops in Groups enables admins of Facebook groups to set up an online store on their associated Facebook Page. It&#8217;s up to the admins where this money goes &#8212; in the case of OctoNation, a page that tested the feature, the profits went to OctoNation&#8217;s non-profit that educates people about octopuses (octopi?). This could get hairy in groups that don&#8217;t have a clear philanthropic aim, but it&#8217;s not as though Facebook groups have never been sites for drama before. Still, Yulie Kwon Kim, Meta&#8217;s Vice President of Product Management, pointed out that many group admins are volunteers, and these shops could offer them a revenue stream for their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money goes to the group admin, and they can decide how they want to use it,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a great way for people to sustain and keep the group going.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233317" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/facebook-groups-to-gain-personalization-features-subgroups-chat-and-tools-for-making-money/">had previously announced its plans</a> for group monetization features &#8212; including shops, fundraisers, and subscriptions &#8212; at its Facebook Communities Summit hosted earlier this month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233367" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233367" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shops-in-Groups.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook also said that users often ask for product recommendations in groups &#8212; think about a skincare or makeup group &#8212; so now, if a user mentions a product that is listed in a Facebook shop, they can tag it and embed it into their comment. Top product recommendations from groups will appear within users&#8217; news feeds.</p>
<p>Facebook has had Live Shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/06/facebook-live-shopping/">for years</a>, but as partnerships between brands and creators become more common, the app has begun testing a feature that would make these collaborations appear more seamless. Now, instead of an influencer directing fans to another page to watch them sell a product or vice versa, creators and brands can cross-stream on both of their pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233364" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233364" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Top-product-mentions.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233364" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This year, Facebook &#8212; now under the company name Meta &#8212; has consistently worked on building out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">shopping tools</a> for businesses and creators. So it only makes sense that as the holiday season draws nearer, the company is launching more ways to spend money on the Facebook app. These features will be available starting today on the web and on the Facebook mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Right now, Meta&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/facebook-will-no-longer-allow-advertisers-to-target-political-beliefs-religion-sexual-orientation/">primary revenue stream</a> comes from advertising, but the company&#8217;s investment in shopping could offer another source of income. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371">announced</a> this summer that as Meta rolls out more creator and commerce tools, it&#8217;s committed to not taking a cut from the earnings of businesses and creators until 2023. He added that when the company does introduce a revenue share, it will be less than Apple&#8217;s 30% cut. But by building a robust infrastructure for e-commerce now, the company is positioning itself for future profit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Priti Choksi, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, has a portfolio that includes Bright, Lumosity, Citcon, UPSIDE Foods and Birdies. But before she ever entered the world of VC, she was an operator at companies like Facebook and Google. She managed business development teams and ran M&amp;A and has vast experience in the world of growing and scaling companies.</p>
<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>
<p>This episode of TechCrunch Live will also feature the TCL pitch-off, where founders in the audience can come on our virtual stage and pitch their products to our esteemed guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is accessible to anyone who is available on Wednesdays at noon PST/3 p.m. EST, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">full library of on-demand TechCrunch Live content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members. It&#8217;s but one of the many reasons to subscribe. If you haven&#8217;t yet, you can do that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Registration and episode info can be found below.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wellness startup <a href="https://bellabeat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellabeat</a>, which has primarily marketed its wearable health trackers to women, recently introduced <a href="https://bellabeat.com/ivy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivy</a>, a stylish, comfortable health tracker with a long-lasting battery life, poised as a prettier version of a Fitbit. But the accompanying subscription &#8220;Coach&#8221; software supporting the new bracelet feels like it&#8217;s still in beta, which is concerning for a product aiming to offer health guidance to real-world users.</p>
<p>Over the past eight years, Bellabeat has established a track record of releasing wearable devices that look attractive enough to wear as everyday jewelry, like its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/bellabeats-new-hybrid-smartwatch-tracks-your-stress-and-goes-with-your-outfit/">Time</a> smartwatch and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/bellabeat-leafs-new-wearable-and-app-help-women-tackle-stress/">Leaf</a> health tracker. Ivy, launched this September, aims to be its most comprehensive product yet &#8212; tracking sleep patterns, heart rate, menstrual cycles, steps, hydration, activity, mindfulness and more.</p>
<p>As a simple health tracker, the Ivy succeeds in what it sets out to do, by tracking your sleep, heart rate and steps. Based on your daily achievements, the app gives you a wellness score. While it encourages you to exercise, it also encourages you to set aside time for daily meditations and other fun activities, which can range from reading to playing sports to going shopping. You&#8217;re also presented with a readiness score, which is calculated based on ongoing analysis of your heart rate, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and cardiac coherence.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But at $250, the Ivy isn&#8217;t cheap &#8212; especially when most of us have a free pedometer built into our cell phones. Yet the device is in such high demand that current orders won&#8217;t ship until the end of November &#8212; the company sold more than 50,000 units in its eight-month preorder phase, and over 18,000 since launching in September. Across its various products, which sync with the Bellabeat app, the company has over 100,000 monthly active users. It&#8217;s clear that the Y Combinator alum is onto something with its premise: women are interested in health tech, but they don&#8217;t always want to wear a tracker that makes them feel like a cyborg.</p>
<p>When you onboard onto the Bellabeat app, you&#8217;re presented with three main goals to choose from: &#8220;weight loss,&#8221; &#8220;get fit&#8221; or &#8220;get healthy.&#8221; Then, you can select from supportive goals: &#8220;better sleep,&#8221; &#8220;healthy aging&#8221; and &#8220;better sex.&#8221; Bellabeat&#8217;s premium &#8220;Coach&#8221; service &#8212; which sells for $99 per year &#8212; offers daily meal plans and weekly shopping lists to help women eat a balanced diet.</p>
<p>When TechCrunch tested the service, we selected &#8220;get healthy&#8221; as our main goal and were presented with meal plans that regularly averaged about 1,500 calories per day. We changed our goal to &#8220;weight loss,&#8221; and found the daily meal plans remained about the same.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Bellabeat why its standard meal plans were just 1,500 calories. A representative for Bellabeat told us the meal plans were generated due to a bug in the app, and to check it again. Upon returning to the app, the recipes were filled with inconsistencies, however. In one recipe, hummus on toast amounted to a shockingly inflated 904 calories, while veggie moussaka appeared as 1,653 calories, equal to about three McDonald&#8217;s Big Macs. When TechCrunch followed up about this, the representative said that the company was still working out some kinks with the app. But the app was not presented to us as a beta &#8212; the product is already on the market, retailing for $250 with a $99 yearly subscription. Even users who aren&#8217;t subscribed to the Coach service can still see recommended meal plans and the calorie counts for those meals. But when you upgrade, you get full recipes, as well as many exercises and health videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, Bellabeat isn&#8217;t marketing itself as a calorie-counting app in the same way that apps like Noom or MyFitnessPal are &#8212; the latter apps are food diaries, asking users to input everything that they eat in a day. Research suggests that apps like MyFitnessPal are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5700836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely used</a> among people with eating disorders, as they can enable restrictive habits. Noom, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/noom-weight-loss-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims to be anti-diet</a>, but is said to offer <a href="https://christinejbyrne.com/eating-disorder-recovery-means-not-dieting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small daily calorie allowances</a> which can be connected to the onset of eating disorders, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/cnvwwf/signed_up_for_noom_and_immediately_regretted_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harmful</a> for people recovering from an eating disorder. Plus, since these apps can scan barcodes of packaged foods to determine exact calorie counts, some users report feeling encouraged to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-48842898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose processed foods</a> over homemade meals &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to know how many calories are in a frozen dinner than in one you make yourself.</p>
<p>However, even though Bellabeat doesn&#8217;t ask users to input everything they eat in a day, the not-so-subtle implication of its recommended meal plans is that you shouldn&#8217;t be eating more than 1,500 calories per day, which can be harmful. According to the United States Department of Agriculture&#8217;s <a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, women should eat between 1,600 and 2,400 calories per day. Exact daily intake recommendations vary depending on an individual&#8217;s lifestyle and various other health factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;What frustrates me the most about health trackers that recommend a low-calorie allowance is that they do not take into account important factors about the individual using the app. They spit out a general number, and in this case, the same number for both weight loss and weight maintenance, with limited science behind it,&#8221; said Gabi Kahn, MS, RD, who specializes in nutrition for mothers. &#8220;Apps like these that recommend a 1,500 calorie diet to every woman are promoting disordered eating. They lead to people obsessing over every calorie they consume, overthinking every food choice to the point of obsession and overanalyzing every bite of food they eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s wellness is a tricky industry and one undergoing more scrutiny in recent years about its messaging to women. The <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/03/weight-watchers-name-change-ww-dieting-culture.html#:~:text=The%20company%20rebranded%20as%20WW,the%20same%20unhealthy%20diet%20culture.&amp;text=In%202018%2C%20Weight%20Watchers%20changed,company%20was%20all%20about%E2%80%94dieting." target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebrand</a> of &#8220;Weight Watchers&#8221; to &#8220;WW&#8221; (with the tagline &#8220;wellness that works&#8221;) is indicative of a larger trend in marketing health products to women: instead of telling women to lose weight, these companies tell women to be healthier. This cause sounds noble enough, yet it perpetuates the false idea that weight is the only indicator of health, rather than just <a href="https://www.self.com/story/the-science-on-weight-and-health">one data point</a> amid many factors. And as the industry shifts away from weight loss and toward the more sanitized &#8220;wellness,&#8221; lawmakers are paying close attention to link between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/">social media apps and eating disorders</a>, and particularly their impact on the mental health of minors.</p>
<p>Bellabeat is targeting a similar market. The company said that most of its clients are between the ages of 25 to 55, with 66% falling between ages 28 and 44.</p>
<p>Though Bellabeat does work with a team of 14 medical professionals &#8212; including a nutritionist &#8212; that expertise is easily undermined by these technical difficulties. Since reporting the bug to Bellabeat, the number of calories in these daily meal plans has increased to a more reasonable value for weight maintenance. But at the time that TechCrunch tested the product and was served these low-calorie meal plans, Ivy had already been on the market for about two months and sold almost 70,000 units. Solving such massive bugs at that point is dangerous for a product that women are using to make decisions about their health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Husband-and-wife co-founders Daniel and Brenna Stitzel are developing a way for foodies to monetize their culinary creations and closed on a round of $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to officially launch <a href="https://joinfoody.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foody</a>.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Serena Ventures, with Goodwater Capital and a group of angel investors joining, including Patreon’s Jack Conte, former Postmates exec Vivek Patel, Greenoaks Capital&#8217;s Neil Mehta and KeepTruckin’s Shoaib Makani.</p>
<p>Most Americans — <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/insight/americans-cooking-habits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">98% of them — cook at home at least once a week</a>, but finding recipes means long internet searches and wading through food blog stories and ads to get to the recipe.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Foody enables users to buy recipes, or upload their own, and keep them in one ad-free place. It also is partnering with Michelin-star chefs, like Jeremiah Tower, and food bloggers to monetize their recipes and other content while building relationships with fans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233019" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233019" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233019" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png" alt="Foody" width="1024" height="749" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png 3424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=1536,1124 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=2048,1499 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foody-Product.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233019" class="wp-caption-text">Foody app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foody</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for the company came about when Brenna Stitzel decided to go to culinary school in 2020 after a career in banking. When the global pandemic shut down her school and available food items on store shelves dwindled, Stitzel began getting inquiries from friends about what they could make with the pantry staples on hand.</p>
<p>“People were looking for content, so I started putting out recipes, but I wasn’t satisfied with the tools available,” she added. “There was not one great software to help food creators of all kinds, from restaurants to authors, to monetize their content and get it out there, nor was there one central place for home chefs to save, share and store their recipes.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Stitzels then set out to build a tool for creators to publish and share recipes that they can push out to fans with QR codes and URLs. Foodies can sign up for free to use the site, and then be able to put together a collection of recipes for a small fee.</p>
<p>Foody is launching with over 30 creators, including a curated list of a dozen featured creators, including Tower, Brandon Jew (Mister Jiu&#8217;s), Evan and Sarah Rich (Rich Table), Harold Villarosa, Gaby Dalkin, Amanda Frederickson, Amanda Haas, Laura and Sayat Ozyilmaz, A16 Restaurant and Tu David Phu.</p>
<p>In Serena Ventures, the Stitzels said they found partners “who share our vision for building amazing software that empowers creators and improves the day to day lives of home cooks.”</p>
<p>“Food and cooking are such big parts of my life, both for my profession and with my family,” Serena Williams, founder and managing partner of Serena Ventures, said in a written statement. “I’m so excited to try new recipes on Foody, and I believe it’s time culinary creators from every culture and background have an opportunity to turn their creativity into income.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the new funding to grow its team of 10 in engineering and development to build out new products and features, Dan Stitzel said.</p>
<p>“We have a big vision for what amazing kitchen software could be that includes planning weekly meals and integrating with grocery delivery services,” he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Given that VCs are putting more money to work in Africa this year as the quarters tick along, it’s reasonable to anticipate that 2022 could bring even greater total venture investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global venture capital market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">is increasingly active</a>, but few locales are seeing the sort of investment acceleration that African startups are enjoying this year.</p>
<p>New data indicates that African startups have already outraised all known prior years, meaning 2021 is sure to be a record. But, more importantly, the pace at which African startups are raising money in 2021 is accelerating, with September data indicating that it was perhaps the best month ever.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Given that venture capitalists are putting more money to work in Africa this year as the quarters tick along, it’s reasonable to anticipate that 2022 could bring even greater total venture investment to the continent.</p>
<p>Investors told The Exchange that their investment pace is picking up tempo and prices are rising. But it’s not all good news on the African front. There may be a dearth of late-stage checks despite a surfeit of early-stage deals, and the African startup economy remains weighted toward a single country (Nigeria) and category (fintech).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Any heating market won’t warm evenly, and the African startup scene is no exception to the rule. Still, the type of funding that the continent’s startups may need is in rich global supply, so perhaps this is a supply-chain issue that can be resolved?</p>
<p>Read on for more data and notes from Novastar Ventures&#8217; West Africa director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/waswani">Brian Odhiambo</a> and Acuity Venture Partners managing partner <a href="https://twitter.com/anovitske">Lexi Novitske.</a></p>
<h2>Strong totals, promising early-stage</h2>
<p>While we don&#8217;t have full confirmation yet, we are pretty sure that Africa crossed the $3 billion milestone in VC funding this year so far.</p>
<p>African startup observer Maxime Bayen was first to <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBayen/status/1444951568214904836">point out that the milestone was impeding</a>: According to <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/q3-2021-2020">data from his Substack newsletter, The Big Deal</a>, the first three quarters already totaled more than $2.9 billion. His prediction? That, if things continue at this pace, startup funding in Africa for 2021 will <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBayen/status/1457664777673654276">amount to $4 billion</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’ve spent the last decade studying the questions that loom large in the current news cycle. What are the implications of social media for teen mental health? What are the benefits of growing up digital? What’s dispiriting or even toxic, and for whom?</p>
<p>We’ve talked about these issues with <em>a lot </em>of teens. Based on research with more than 3,600 teenagers, we wrote a book (out next year from the MIT Press) called “Behind Their Screens: What Teens Are Facing (And Adults Are Missing).” We’ve worked closely with youths and families in different contexts, from schools and community centers to summer camps and even hospitals. One crucial insight: We need to think about teens’ tech experiences with a much wider lens.</p>
<p>We must focus on creating the best HX<em> &#8212;</em> <em>human experience</em> &#8212; for teens. A focus on HX broadens our attention to talking about, engaging with and designing tech in ways that align with our needs as human beings. HX urges us to think beyond the pitfalls of specific social media apps and more holistically about their place in a teen’s life.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230577" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s tempting to put all the blame for teens’ struggles on social media. But teens need us to start by asking and really listening to their stresses, worries and joys. What are their current vulnerabilities and struggles? What are true sources of comfort, connection and happiness? And what particular tech experiences amplify or undercut well-being?</p>
<p>HX is about what people are seeing <em>and </em>how they make sense of it. For one teen, workout videos are motivating and support healthy habits. For another teen, these same videos reinforce a painful sense that they’re not fit enough, thin enough or “productive” enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, “fixing” algorithms and the content teens see is important but isn’t a panacea.</p>
<p>This past summer, we ran a series of co-design workshops with teens. Our aim was to reimagine how to think about and support digital well-being. One teen gave voice to a concept that resonated powerfully with others. She described challenges of contemporary teen experiences as “the grind” &#8212; “a culture of needing to be productive all the time … experiencing everyone sharing what they’re doing and feeling like you’re not doing enough.” Social media speeds up the gears of grinds that feel constant and never-ending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The grind, other teens told us, is the engine of “pressure to do the most and spread myself thin.” Really, it’s a series of pressures — a feeling that they need to do “the most” in many different domains, all at the same time.</p>
<p>There is a grind to “curate my own quirky yet mainstream social media and real-life persona,” and another to “look my best at all times.” Nearly everyone identified a social grind: feeling like they need to “always be socializing, and be posting about it so people know,” or “making sure that I&#8217;m posting with a variety of people to signal that I have a lot of friends” and even “prioritizing social life over everything including mental health.”</p>
<p>Yet alongside constant “fun,” teens simultaneously feel grinds linked to academic pressure (reinforced, they said, by people posting grades, test scores or class schedules filled with AP courses) and acute career pressure (amplified by a sense of “constantly needing to prove that I have an important plan for my life”). They described pressure to be fully informed about the news and civic issues, to be set in their interests and identities, to be funny and supportive as friends — and signal it all on social media.</p>
<p>Teens are not monolithic, and their grinds also vary based on their different identities and contexts. A teen who immigrated to the U.S. said “being an immigrant sort of forces a grind on me.” A queer teen talked about a grind related to “the &#8216;right&#8217; way to be gay &#8212; assumptions about the way I dress and present.”</p>
<p>Critically, the grind is about tech, but it’s not just about the tech. It’s a collision of pressures that are developmentally linked and powerfully magnified by browsing, scrolling and posting.</p>
<p>Using a wider HX lens prompts questions about how we can help teens recalibrate their relationships to technology. Adults are often mired in an us-versus-them battle with teens over screens. When we assume teens want to be on their phones around the clock, we see it as our job is to save them from themselves. But teens repeatedly tell us otherwise.</p>
<p>“People are always glued to their phones, but so am I and I hate that,” a 15-year-old said.</p>
<p>“My phone distracts me from my homework and from the life moments I am currently in,” a 17-year-old said. “I know it’s a problem so I am trying to limit how much time I spend on my phone since hours and hours can go by of talking to my friends or liking pictures on Instagram.”</p>
<p>A 16-year-old added: “TikTok runs my life.”</p>
<p>To hold our attention, today’s technologies are designed to tap our most basic <em>human </em>desires to keep us clicking, scrolling and wanting more. For teens, app features can play on developmental sensitivities. Design collides with needs for peer connection, vulnerabilities to social pressures and natural sensitivity to questions about who they are and who they want to be. We shouldn’t mistake tech dependence as a sign that teens don’t care about optimizing their HX.</p>
<p>Social media companies have an urgent responsibility to do more to protect teens’ experiences. But we don’t have to wait on tech companies to begin supporting HX now.</p>
<p>Savvy teens tell us how they’ve become curators of their on-screen experiences, unfollowing and muting accounts that intensify the grind feelings. They actively seek out content that makes them feel seen, inspired or that makes them laugh.</p>
<p>They’re also intentional about when and how they use tech: Some have pacts with friends about putting their phones on “do not disturb” during in-person time or deciding not to post pictures while together because monitoring feedback becomes too distracting. During the pandemic, studying together quietly over video chat was a way to feel less lonely and more connected.</p>
<p>We need to help <em>all</em> teens develop the inclinations to focus on HX and the skills to support it.</p>
<p>There are things we can do as individuals to improve our HX, but bigger questions loom: Can companies adjust their platforms to protect vulnerable teens &#8212; and will they? What kinds of oversight and regulation are needed? While we debate the best path forward, millions of teens continue to scroll on. Supporting their HX can’t wait.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is answering the question of how you fairly come up with a way to share the attention between big and small sellers]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s tough to be a seller when there are so many products out there on marketplaces just waiting to be discovered. <a href="http://promoted.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promoted.ai</a> is out to help people find you, securing $2 million in funding to continue developing its tool that matches buyers to sellers in marketplace search.</p>
<p>The company was started by two former Pinterest marketplace and ad designers, Andrew Yates and Dan Hill, who wanted to help buyers find what they want more easily, which leads to repeat purchases. And then they wanted sellers to see immediate feedback about how their products appear in a search and tools to improve sales.</p>
<p>“We are predicting for every item in search what someone will engage with and ultimately buy,” Yates told TechCrunch. “It’s the complete package. What we discovered from the industry and customers is that we need to have a data infrastructure so that you can have data in the right place at the right time.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He explained that Promoted’s technology is more than simply an item, but the optimization of the entire picture: how you fairly come up with a way to share the attention between big and small sellers, then taking into account if the user is satisfied with that search.</p>
<p>Yates and Hill, based in the Bay Area, launched Promoted in 2020 and were part of Y Combinator’s recent summer cohort. In addition to the accelerator, major investors in the capital infusion include Interlace Ventures and Rebel Fund.</p>
<p>Vincent Diallo, managing partner at Interlace, said he was attracted to the company largely due to the team, which he felt had “amazing experience in the space.”</p>
<p>Interlace primarily invests in commerce technology, and Diallo saw two trends that Promoted was addressing: The first was the movement of retailers to increase their range in e-commerce and delivery by opening a marketplace. The second was the increased number of verticalized marketplaces trying to capture a subset of the market through one kind of customer behavior and building a community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“A big part of Amazon’s performance is from the ad manager and ad revenue, so we were convinced there was an opportunity to build a tool like this,” Diallo added.</p>
<p>The company is targeting enterprise deals and plans to use the new funding on hiring. However, their funding round was a bit unusual.</p>
<p>Much of the team is made up of former Facebook, Pinterest and Google engineers, and with the competitive talent environment, rather than go the traditional seed funding route, the founders decided to receive equity for the founding engineering team and raise the remaining funds from individual angel investors putting in $50,000 or less.</p>
<p>“We had to turn away some fantastic funds to make this work, but in exchange, we have a great network of champions, experts and advocates,” Yates said. “We found it better to give equity directly to engineers to recruit top talent because equities are so hot and experienced machine learning and ads engineer cash salaries are so high. We will end up raising additional capital for scaling up the team.”</p>
<p>Though the company is still young, it is already working with marketplace apps like Hipcamp and Snackpass, and customers are seeing lifted conversion rates. For example, Promoted increased Hipcamp’s total booking rate by over 7%, Yates said.</p>
<p>Next up, the company will be focusing on the launch manager side of the product and building out a tool similar to an ads manager for listings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Steve Hill unveiled The Boring Company&#8217;s plan for a subterranean shuttle that would whisk visitors to different parts of the city&#8217;s vast Convention Center campus, he predicted it would take just under two minutes to travel between its farthest stations.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the system doesn&#8217;t work, we will get all of our money back,&#8221; Hill said, in June 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/official-tunnel-project-could-speed-up-las-vegas-strip-travel-1681216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>.</p>
<p>That two-minute promise was repeated to the media as recently as April, according to an email between a Boring Company (TBC) representative and the LVCVA. That email was part of a 5,051-page drop of documents <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/tags/elon-musk-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained by Plainsite</a> under public records legislation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So far, it seems the two-minute target is still out of reach.</p>
<p>Detailed trip reports from the same records request show that in its first six weeks of operation, the LVCC Loop&#8217;s Tesla taxis took an average of nearly four minutes to span the system.</p>
<p>The data, which cover over 30,000 free rides and 75,000 passengers, reveals that there was no day on which the trips took an average of less than three minutes, and one day they needed an average of five. (TechCrunch excluded days on which the system transported fewer than a thousand people in total.) Videos of rides taken during a large auto conference last week (which was too recent to be included in this batch of public documents) show similar trip times.</p>
<p>A few minutes&#8217; delay won&#8217;t make a big difference to the average convention attendee, of course, but could add up to big financial penalties if TBC misses ridership targets during giant shows like CES. The disparity also calls into question TBC&#8217;s promises for a much larger public Loop network in Las Vegas that recently got the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-loop-expand-strip/">go-ahead</a>. Ultimately, the LVCC Loop&#8217;s performance could signal whether Musk&#8217;s subterranean taxis can be a viable form of urban transportation, or more of a Tesla-boosting amusement ride.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The larger Vegas Loop system is planned to comprise 51 stations and around 29 miles of tunnels, linking many of the city&#8217;s tourist sites. On its project page for the Vegas Loop, TBC suggests a trip from the city&#8217;s NFL stadium to the Convention Center would also take four minutes, despite the distance being more than four times longer than the LVCC Loop today.</p>
<p>The real-world travel data also raises doubts as to whether the LVCC Loop as it stands can meet its capacity goal of transporting 4,400 conference attendees per hour.</p>
<p>TBC achieved that number during a demonstration event in May, by squeezing three riders (without luggage) into each of the 62 Tesla Model 3, X and Y vehicles in the system. In reality, however, an average of just two passengers rode in each Loop vehicle between its opening to conventioneers in early June and mid-July.</p>
<p>A contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour. A penalty that large could impact the viability of the Loop, which earned just $230,500 for transportation services during its first month of operation in June. (TBC also gets a monthly management fee of $167,000, regardless of how many cars it operates.)</p>
<p>The highest number of passengers per hour the LVCC had transported by mid July was 1,355. A big reason for this is that the LVCC does not generally have its largest conferences in the heat of a Nevada summer, and there were simply not that many passengers requiring transportation. During a beauty convention in June, for example, a Loop operations engineer wrote to the LVCVA: &#8220;I trimmed back the [number of] cars now because we are seeing a super low volume of passengers.&#8221; Some evenings, Loop management closed the system early after no passengers had entered the system for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Loop has three levels of service. Level 2, offering just five cars and no station attendants, is when there are no active conventions on the LVCC campus. Level 3, with 23 vehicles, can handle up to 20,000 visitors. Level 4, with from 30 to 62 Teslas, is for the largest events.</p>
<h2>The big tech test</h2>
<p>The acid test for the system will likely be the CES convention in January, which can attract 185,000 attendees. Last week, the Loop got permission to operate with 70 vehicles, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/elon-musks-loop-gets-autopilot-and-an-intruder/">TechCrunch predicted</a> in August. Even so, it will need to either cut trip times or persuade at least three passengers into each vehicle to avoid the capacity penalty. It will also have to cut down on &#8220;ghost cars&#8221; driving without passengers on board &#8212; which actually accounted for a majority of trips during the Loop&#8217;s opening event in early June.</p>
<p>The current tunnels seem unlikely to accommodate many more vehicles. During the 70-vehicle test last week, a city inspector noted: &#8220;There were some occasions where vehicles entered and exited the tunnels within stations within 1 to 2 seconds apart.&#8221; The Loop&#8217;s safety analysis is based on maintaining six seconds of headway between cars.</p>
<h2>Positive reviews</h2>
<p>The good news is that riders seem to like the Loop. &#8220;Customers really love the system and it is clearly their preferred method of travel around the campus. Wait times are manageable to about two minutes max during the largest of surges,&#8221; wrote Seth Hooper, director of Loop Operations, at the end of June. Multi-colored &#8220;rainbow road&#8221; tunnel lights that were originally turned on for just two minutes every quarter hour are now an almost permanent fixture, due to rider demand.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the system&#8217;s biggest problems continues to be unauthorized visitors. As well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/elon-musks-loop-gets-autopilot-and-an-intruder/">intruder vehicle</a> that TechCrunch revealed in October, the Loop has had multiple incursions by convention center employees apparently keen to have a peek. &#8220;The biggest culprits of unauthorized vehicles are LVCVA carts,&#8221; wrote Hooper.</p>
<p>Even animals got in on the action. In late July, two TBC employees tried to rescue a kitten that had fallen into a storm sewer near the system&#8217;s South station.</p>
<p>TBC and the LVCVA did not immediately respond to questions about the cat&#8217;s ultimate fate, nor to other detailed queries about the trip data. However, TBC is cataloguing the safety and security incidents that any transportation system faces. On at least three occasions, Loop drivers have struck fences or bollards when misjudging turns, causing minor damage. The only injury to a passenger (by the end of June) was a Loop passenger sustaining a small laceration and contusion to her finger when another passenger closed a vehicle door on her hand.</p>
<p>All of this data will be invaluable to TBC as it plans to scale up the technology to serve an entire city. It is not yet known whether the Vegas Loop, unlike the LVCC system, will accommodate children and pets, nor exactly how much tickets for the paid system will cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobility 54 Investment SAS, a corporate venture capital subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho Corporation and CFAO group, DOB Equity and InfraCo Africa have invested $3.4 million (€3 million) in electric motorcycle startup <a href="https://www.zem.bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zembo</a> to help it grow its business.</p>
<p>Zembo, a French startup with operations in Uganda, was founded in 2018 and sells electric motorcycles through a lease-to-own program. It also operates a network of solar charging and battery swapping stations in the East African country.</p>
<p>Mobility 54 said it will help the startup to scale its operations across Africa “by leveraging the group’s (Toyota’s) automotive footprint throughout the continent.” Additionally, Mobility 54 will work with Zembo to forge new partnerships, especially for its battery and solar panel businesses &#8212; an area in which the startup anticipates the greatest growth.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Mobility 54’s investment in Zembo envisions to accelerate the carbon neutrality in Africa by electrification of the mobility industry. Toyota Tsusho and CFAO group will contribute to deploy Zembo’s business in Africa by leveraging the group’s automotive footprints throughout the continent,” Mobility 54 said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward increasing the number of motorcycles, by about 2,000, and the installation of more than 60 charging and battery swapping stations across Uganda’s capital, Kampala. Its motorcycles cover 37 miles (60km) on a single charge.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with impact-focused institutions like InfraCo Africa, DOB Equity, and Mobility 54 to continue developing electric boda bodas (motorcycles) and charging stations for our customers,” said Zembo co-founder, Étienne Saint-Sernin.</p>
<p>“Zembo’s mission to improve incomes for Uganda’s boda boda riders while cutting air pollution is shared by our supporters and is a driving force for this partnership. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers and making sustainable mobility a reality in Uganda,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zembo assembles the electric motorcycles in Uganda and works with external financial institutions to sell them through rent-to-own plans. Its battery-as-a-service model allows riders to swap discharged batteries with fully charged ones at a fee.</p>
<p>InfraCo Africa’s CEO, Gilles Vaes, <a href="https://infracoafrica.com/infraco-africa-dob-equity-and-mobility-54-announce-investment-to-scale-zembos-vision-for-electric-mobility-in-uganda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> “… Zembo has a great track record of delivering electric two-wheeler vehicles to the market and our joint effort with DOB Equity and Mobility 54 to scale and develop the business will expand the company’s ability to cut urban air pollution, create jobs and promote economic development in Kampala. The project also aligns with global efforts to improve air quality and to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.”</p>
<p>InfraCo Africa, part of Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), which is funded by six governments and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), provides funding and expertise to infrastructure projects, while DOB Equity is a Dutch family-backed investor with an interest in East Africa.</p>
<p>Motorcycle taxis are popular across Africa, and are widely used in major cities like Kampala. However, they are regarded as a major source of noise and air pollution, problems that would be addressed by a transition to electric power.</p>
<p>Zembo Storm motorcycles is one of the many businesses that are rising in African markets to offer e-mobility solutions as cleaner travel options.</p>
<p>Other players include Kenya’s Opibus, which is set to start mass production of motorcycles next year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-conversion-startup-opibus-raises-7-5m-to-start-bus-and-motorcycle-mass-production/">Opibus told TechCrunch</a> in an earlier interview that the competitive advantage of electric transport includes declining operational costs of up to 60% lower than fossil fuel alternatives.</p>
<p>A switch to electric power also holds the promise of lowering carbon emissions, which contribute greatly to the climate change problems that the world is working to address.</p>
<p>Reports, however, show that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bolt-to-expand-ev-option-in-south-africa/">electric mobility in Africa</a> is nascent even as opportunities remain vast, especially if the infrastructure to support its adoption is built. To bridge the gap, companies like Zembo and Opibus are building their own infrastructure.</p>

As first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the company now offers a <a href="https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">rectangular option</a> (PDF) that&#8217;s smaller and lighter than its original circular one. Users have to install that antenna on their rooftop or anywhere high up with a clear view of the sky to be able to access its satellite internet.</p>
<p>The original version is a standard dish that&#8217;s 23-inch wide, but the rectangular version is only 12 inches wide and 19 inches long. It&#8217;s also only 9.2 pounds, which is almost half the weight of its circular counterpart. The new terminal&#8217;s smaller form factor could give users more options when it comes to potential locations where they can install it. In addition, the rectangular terminal comes with more accessory options, including a long pole users can simply stick in the ground so they no longer have to mount the antenna on their rooftop.</p>
<p>SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-service-99-a-month-045831110.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">launched</a> Starlink as a beta service in late 2020 and offered customers access to its satellite internet for $99 a month. Users would have to pay $499 on top of that for its hardware kit, though, which includes the antenna, its stand, power supply and a WiFi router. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/networking/45600/spacex-prepares-to-cut-starlink-dish-cost-by-half-later-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">said</a> in August that the original dish cost $3,000 to produce, and while the company was able to get that down to $1,300, it was still selling the kit at a loss.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shotwell also said at the time that the terminal it&#8217;s releasing this year &#8220;will cost roughly half&#8221; of what its current user terminals cost and that the company may be able to cut that in half again. <em>The Verge notes</em>, however, that the hardware kit is still being sold for $499 even with the rectangular antenna, and SpaceX has yet to reveal whether it will be sold at a lower price in the future. Potential new customers who don&#8217;t mind paying the same price for it can get the rectangular terminal when they order a kit, so long as they&#8217;re in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salesforce users tend to have a similar complaint in the amount of time it takes to update records, but <a href="https://www.getweflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weflow</a> aims to conquer this form of “Salesforce fatigue.”</p>
<p>The Berlin-based company is developing a tool — still in private beta — that makes it faster to update Salesforce and reduces much of the busy work that takes up salespeople’s time.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2018/03/13/salesforce-essentials-is-here-now-millions-of-small-businesses-can-grow-and-innovate-faster-on-the-worlds-1-crm-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83% of Fortune 500 companies use the platform</a> to improve sales productivity, many sales professionals <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend the bulk of their time on tasks other than selling</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serial entrepreneurs Henrik Basten and Janis Zech worked together at Fyber and experienced this firsthand while running revenue teams. They started Weflow in late 2020 to be a revenue workspace built on top of Saleforce’s database to help salespeople add information inside Salesforce records quickly and manage their pipeline.</p>
<p>“People want to create a solution that is more like Asana for pipeline management,” CEO Zech told TechCrunch. “However, what is helpful is that Salesforce is an open ecosystem that you can build on top of. We observed people go into their pipeline and have 30 tabs open with notes scattered about. We were thinking that if salespeople don’t enjoy using it, we would create a more modern experience that was easier to update.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233125" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png" alt="Weflow" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png 2340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233125" class="wp-caption-text">Weflow pipeline table. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weflow</p></div></p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Users can sign up with their Salesforce account, access their pipeline and update deals, tasks, notes and activities with a few clicks. All of the data stays in Salesforce. Salespeople typically perform this task once a week and schedule two or three hours for it, but Zech estimates that Weflow can reduce that down to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In addition, the company created a modern notepad, built for Salesforce, for users to build templates so that salespeople are asking the same questions and writing in the same fields. There is also a task manager.</p>
<p>Now today, the company announced $2.7 million in pre-seed funding, led by Cherry Ventures, to get its tool to public launch. Cherry was joined by a group of angel investors, including Christian Reber, Sascha Konietzke, Chris Schagen, Alexander Ljung, Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss and Andreas Bodczek.</p>
<p>Filip Dames, partner at Cherry Ventures, said he and the founders had known each other from Fyber, and when they came to him with Weflow, Dames was “happy to be a support on this journey.”</p>

<p>When Dames looked across this firm’s portfolio, he noted that most startups began with sales, a process that is hard to ramp up, especially when sales tools are “expensive and clunky.”</p>
<p>“With the ability to build something on top of Salesforce, there is a wide canvas in which direction the company can go,” he added. “Janis and Henrik are on a mission in a space that is large enough to create venture returns. Salesforce brings in $20 billion in revenue, and that enables a lot of new businesses to be created. By making the interface more fun to use, you can spend more time with the customer.”</p>
<p>In the last couple of months, Basten and Zech have built up a team of 10, and there are 15 co-development partners piloting the product currently, with a handful being added each week. Zech says the product will launch early next year.</p>
<p>They will be using the new funding to invest in marketing and product development. Weflow is product-led and will eventually have a free version, Zech added.</p>
<p>“We want to help everyone because the problem is very well understood by whoever you talk to about Salesforce, so we have an interest in solving this and have a good starting point,” he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With World Mental Health Day just behind us, I thought about how the tech industry can be a difficult place to stay mentally well. Working remotely, especially under unprecedented circumstances, can make a difficult situation worse. I have worked remotely in technology for over a decade, and I’ll share my tips for how fast-paced technical startups can take good care of their software development talent.</p>
<p>Software development at its best is a creative endeavor. Developers need a certain level of comfort to be able to produce quality work. Boring tasks, noisy offices and too many meetings can impact productivity even in the best of times.</p>
<p>However, health is something more fundamental, almost on the lowest level of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">hierarchy of needs</a>, which includes mental health. Software developers need their brains in good shape to do the work that they do, and sometimes when things aren’t going well, we can see it in our colleague’s code before the real problem is even communicated.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226207" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The distributed nature of remote startup teams makes this more difficult. When you work remotely, the features of the office that can help you to support your team’s well-being are missing. Not only the free fruit and coffee or the bean bags; it can also be harder to notice when a colleague is having a hard time. When we aren’t in the same place, it’s harder to spot who is coming in late, leaving early or just seems a bit … flat.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>It’s also harder to check if someone is doing all right when there is no watercooler conversation. However, if you are unsure about someone and wondering if you should check in with them, my advice is always to reach out. As remote teams, we need to communicate more, and when it comes to mental health, it’s better to say something and find out someone is fine and that you were worried about nothing, rather than have them reach a breaking point alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Give the gift of autonomy</h2>
<p>I’ve worked remotely &#8212; by choice, for a selection of employers both large and small, as well as my own freelance consultancy &#8212; for more than a decade. What I value most about working from home is the flexibility, especially when my work is more on the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">maker’s schedule</a> as a software developer.</p>
<p>I discovered a series of life hacks that helped me to do more of my best work, such as a gym workout at 11 a.m. after an early start in the office, or putting dinner in the oven before the last meeting of the day. This ability to have a bit more “life” alongside the work has been beneficial for my own well-being, especially at times when I have been struggling.</p>
<p>In Daniel Pink’s book “Drive,” he covers how autonomy, mastery and purpose are the main drivers of motivation. Motivation, recognition and confidence are key to successful software development work. Being empowered to contribute toward a wider goal using your skills is very rewarding, and for startups where there is usually more freedom in choosing and prioritizing work, this can be very satisfying for developers.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/blog/83-of-developers-suffer-from-burnout-haystack-analytics-study-finds">83% of developers report burnout</a>, according to research from Haystack, so be careful to set realistic expectations for your software developers. It’s harder to send them home at a reasonable time when there is no physical office, so those expectations need to be carefully laid out, especially when there are flexible working hours and it’s easy to let big projects take over.</p>
<h2>Education says you care</h2>
<p>Developers are lifelong learners; they have to be because the industry changes so quickly. They are constantly investing in themselves, their knowledge and their skills.</p>
<p>As an employer, you can invest in them as individuals as well. Some companies offer generous training budgets or time off. I once worked for a small software company that didn’t provide a budget for study, but you could book one day a month to just learn something, and either help yourself to the shelf of textbooks or ask for a one-hour tutorial from someone else to get you started on a new topic. It didn’t cost the company much at all, but I felt like they wanted me to succeed.</p>
<h2>Freedom to work</h2>
<p>Rewarding developers with money <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/55603/1/505087677.pdf">doesn’t work as a motivator</a>, but giving them time and trusting them to use it for something other than direct product engineering work can have a big impact.</p>
<p>Google famously uses an approach of giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project">20% of a worker’s time</a> to be used for anything they found interesting. It even produced some useful products, but the main point is that developers felt involved and trusted at work. Atlassian is also famous for doing something similar, with all employees working for 24 hours on projects of their choice, producing surprising innovations and improvements that might never have shipped otherwise.</p>
<p>Many developers give much of their time to open source projects. I’ve had a few attempts at explaining this to people from other professions, and it turns out <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/">hacker culture is baffling</a>.</p>
<p>Developers, however, strongly identify with this world, and <a href="https://aiven.io/press/research-the-future-is-open-source-over-90-of-developers-believe-that-open">91% of developers say open source is in their future</a>. Giving developers permission to contribute to open source can make them feel more valued. Those open source communities can be an important part of a developer’s social and support networks, as well as their identity, which is critical for their wider well-being.</p>
<h2>Lessons from open source</h2>
<p>Our modern workplace has a lot to learn from open source in the way that we enable others to participate alongside us in projects. Open source projects serve as a reasonable model for how a truly remote workflow can function.</p>
<p>Some of the foundational building blocks of our software world were built by people who knew one another only by mailing list or IRC channel. Software was built, but, perhaps even more importantly, strong connections were made.</p>
<p>Remote software teams today, whether remote by choice or circumstance, have much more impressive tools available. Source control and collaboration tools are more than a mailing list now, and we can all be constantly in contact by text chat, audio or video call. We can even pair programs remotely using screen sharing or tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share">VSCode Live Share</a>.</p>
<p>However, all this connectivity can lead to added stress and notification fatigue. Remember that software developers are all different; one person’s working style won’t be exactly like another’s. Open source projects work in a way that is respectful of everyone’s time and without much expectation that any one person will be around at any specific time — rather, within an expected time window.</p>
<p>For remote teams doing advanced technological work, scheduling as few meetings as possible that leave long stretches of thinking time &#8212; and setting expectations about how quickly anyone is expected to respond to Slack messages &#8212; can really help to provide a calm working environment.</p>
<h2>Work-life balance</h2>
<p>When the pandemic stopped us from our daily commute, many were left with less than ideal work setups. Parked on the sofa or at the kitchen table, and possibly with other family members nearby, was unsurprisingly difficult for many of us, with <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252507495/Team-leaders-urged-to-address-developer-mental-health">increased levels of burnout</a> widely reported.</p>
<p>Even if your developers have been working from home for some time, it’s never a bad idea to check in whether they need a monitor upgrade, a spare power supply or even a new keyboard. Many employers now offer work-from-home budgets, but a little goes a long way when it comes to making sure your developers have the tools that they need.</p>
<p>Take the time to socialize together at work. Cringeworthy corporate team building is hopefully a thing of the past, but some simple online games can lighten the mood. If your company offers an EAP (employee assistance program), make sure that all of your employees know about it and how to access it. It doesn’t hurt to remind managers that the programs are there for them, too, not just the people on their teams.</p>
<p>When it comes to mental health, a startup can be a difficult place to be. They’re fast-paced, with frequent changes and many plates to keep spinning. My best advice is to look out for one another &#8212; and that’s not just managers looking out for the staff that report to them. All of us can do our bit by looking out for others and by taking care of ourselves.</p>
<p>When we burn out, there are warning signs before it happens. We need to find ways to make our work sustainable for the long term and to be something we do alongside our healthy lives. It’s easier said than done, but busy startups must take the time to remind their employees that they matter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 11, 2021. Below we have the first news item I have seen in which a company <em>not</em> diving into crypto was met by cheers, so read on for some narrative violations. In TechCrunch news, Rocket Lab’s Peter Beck is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/rocket-labs-peter-beck-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">coming to TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, which has me hype! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/">Discord backtracks on crypto push:</a> </strong>After tweeting out a screenshot of NFTs inside of Discord, the social chat company said that it has “no current plans to ship this internal concept.” Given that every brand with a pulse is trying to smear crypto magic all over itself, the Discord community backlash to crypto integration feels notable.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/as-valuations-soar-and-ipos-accelerate-the-public-is-taking-on-more-startup-risk/"><strong>The public is now at risk:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s tech boom is different from the dot-com era’s own period of outlandish exuberance. But after a long run of rich valuations and revenue-light companies being mostly constrained to the private market, we’re seeing more risk spill into the pockets of the investing public. It’s something to worry about.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/indonesian-goto-group-raises-over-1-3b-in-its-first-close-of-pre-ipo/">GoTo raises $1.3 billion in pre-IPO deal:</a></strong> The hybrid of Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce player Tokopedia is not shy about adding funds to its accounts ahead of its public debut. And it could be worth around $30 billion after this latest infusion of cash. When GoTo does in fact go to the public markets, its IPO will make waves around the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a whole mess of startup news, let’s talk about SoftBank. After its first Vision Fund wound down — though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/how-chinas-regulatory-crackdown-whomped-vision-fund-1s-returns/">results are still trickling in</a> from that particular capital vehicle — it seemed that Tiger and other groups took SoftBank’s leading-investor mantle. But the Japanese telco and investing powerhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">has put $3 billion into India this year alone</a> and could do more next year. That says quite a lot about Indian startups and about SoftBank itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233008" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/sivo-debt-as-a-service/"><strong>Stripe for debt:</strong></a> That’s what Sivo is building it appears, by offering access to debt via an API. Stripe, of course, has generated oceans of revenue by offering payments as a service via an API along with a growing stable of fintech products. In essence, Sivo should be able to help startups offer debt products without having to use their own balance sheet as their funding source.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/collectible-card-trading-platform-alt-raises-75m-as-it-eyes-other-asset-categories-and-preps-its-mobile-launch/"><strong>Why is everyone obsessed with collectibles?</strong></a> I don’t know, but alternative asset investing is still putting up impressive growth. We can tell that thanks to Alt raising a $75 million round today. It’s currently a platform for buying and selling rare sports cards, or what you might prefer to refer to as IRL NFTs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/"><strong>Instacart wants to bring you groceries tomorrow:</strong></a> Grocery delivery unicorn Instacart is rolling out lower-fee, next-day delivery and partnering with dollar stores for more goods. DoorDash, another delivery company, is also expanding its product remit. Uber Eats as well. It appears that every delivery company wants to deliver pretty much everything, in time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/ro-is-in-talks-to-acquire-at-home-sperm-storage-startup-dadi/"><strong>Ro wants to freeze your swimmers:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">Troubled health unicorn Ro</a> — parent company of well-known ED pill slinger Roman – is in talks to buy sperm storage company Dadi, TechCrunch reports. The expansion into sperm management makes sense given that the company has already done the work to ensure that folks are able to produce said material.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/chilean-proptech-startup-houm-raises-35m-series-a-to-expand-across-latam/"><strong>More money to help folks buy, sell houses more quickly:</strong></a> It seems that every market will have a few startups that want to make the process of buying and selling homes easier. Because it’s an awful experience everywhere, I suppose. Today’s example is Chilean proptech startup Houm, which has just raised a $35 million Series A.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/nigerias-helium-health-acquires-uaes-meddy-in-rare-africa-gcc-deal/"><strong>Helium Health buys Meddy:</strong></a> In a notable bit of M&amp;A, Nigeria-based Helium Health is buying UAE-based doctor-booking platform Meddy. Terms were not disclosed, but the transaction underscores how quickly the African and Middle Eastern startup markets are maturing.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/e-commerce-logistics-startup-hive-buzzes-following-34m-investment/"><strong>Today’s Tiger deal is Hive:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Berlin-based Hive provides software to help DTC brands manage fulfillment. The company just raised a $34 million round, which might sound small but the company had raised $10 million prior to the new investment.</li>
<li>And in case you forgot about SPACs, smart building tech concern Brivo <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/brivo-to-go-public-via-spac-at-808m-valuation/">intends to ride one to the public markets</a></strong>, giving itself an $800 million valuation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advent of new privacy regulations in Europe, California and other regions has forced online marketers to rethink their basic practices.</p>
<p>Instead of surreptitiously skimming intelligence via cookies and invisible pixels, what if marketers just asked consumers for relevant details that would personalize their shopping experience?</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the kind of things you’d tell a store associate helping you find the right gifts to purchase for your family,&#8221; says Ben Parr, president and co-founder of Octane AI. &#8220;That’s zero-party data.&#8221;</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/"><strong>Like YouTube, Instagram would really like you to use its TikTok clone:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch has notes today on Instagram’s bonus program that the social network has in place to drive more usage of its Reels product.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram added <a href="https://www.instagram.com/creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two features</a> to Reels yesterday: text-to-speech and voice effects. These features are popular already on TikTok, but now, creators can use them on Instagram too. This marks yet another effort from Instagram to keep up with TikTok when it comes to short-form video, as Instagram offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">big reels bonuses</a> to incentivize creators,</p>
<p>Text-to-speech is a necessary accessibility feature that helps blind and low-vision people understand written text. But videos with these robotic voices became so <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/meme-insider/how-tiktoks-new-text-to-speech-feature-became-a-meme-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inexplicably popular</a> on TikTok that the voice actor behind the feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701167/bev-standing-tiktok-lawsuit-settles-text-to-speech-voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the company</a> since she hadn&#8217;t given it permission to use her recordings. After she filed her lawsuit, TikTok changed the voice behind the feature.</p>

<p>Creators often use text-to-speech voiceovers not so much for their accessibility benefits, but because it can be kind of funny to have a monotone, computerized voice narrating their content. The text-to-speech tool can be found within the text tool in the Reels camera. Once you record or upload a video, navigate to preview to add text. Once you add the text, a text bubble will appear at the bottom of the screen, which lets users time when they want that bit of text to appear. But now, you can tap a three-dot icon to open a menu for each text bubble, which will give you the option to add a text to speech voiceover. There are two voice options to choose from.</p>
<p>But voice effects let you get even more creative with your reels. These features let you modify the audio or the voiceover in your post. To see these effects, tap the music note once you&#8217;ve recorded your reel to open the audio mixer. Then, you&#8217;ll see an effects menu that lets you modify the audio in your reel or voiceover.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new features are rolling out now to Instagram mobile users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-unveils-interactive-clip-sharing-feature">rolling out</a> a new Prime Video feature that lets users share video clips from TV shows and movies on the platform. The clips can be shared on social media or via direct message. The feature is currently only available on iOS and for users in the U.S. For the initial rollout, users <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">can</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">only share clips from a limited number of shows, including season one of “The Boys,” “The Wilds,” “Invincible” and “Fairfax.”</span></p>
<p>When you’re watching one of these four titles, you can click on the new &#8220;Share a clip&#8221; button to create a 30-second clip. Once you click the button, the streaming service will pause the show to open up a screen where you can clip and edit the video. The app will then create a clip of what you just watched, allowing you to move the clip forward or backward to exactly where you want it. You’ll also be able to preview the clip before sharing it with others. When you’re ready to share the clip, you can select the &#8220;Share&#8221; icon and either upload it or share it via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, iMessage, Messenger and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Amazon says it plans to let users share clips from more of its original movies and series in the future. The company’s decision to allow users to share its content marks a change from other streaming services, which currently don’t offer ways to share video clips from their shows and movies. Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu all go as far as preventing users from capturing screenshots of content on their services and instead black out images when users try to do so.</p>
<p>Amazon’s latest feature for Prime Video indicates that it’s thinking differently about its content being shared and viewed on other platforms. It’s worth noting that Amazon may also be hoping to attract more users to Prime Video by encouraging its users to share clips of its original content with their friends and followers and hopefully get them interested enough to check it out themselves.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Your startup’s homepage should accomplish two things well: (1) <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Clearly explain exactly what you offer and (2) </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Convert visitors into active prospects.</span></p>
<p>If visitors leave confused or your website isn&#8217;t able to convert, allocate the resources to fix it before worrying about marketing.</p>
<p>When building your startup&#8217;s website, start by getting inspiration from the websites of established companies in your industry. Why? Because larger companies will have the resources to test and optimize their website to convert, saving you the need to do figure it all out yourself.</p>
<p>This post is going to tear down the homepage of Zapier, a SaaS platform that now has millions of customers and integrates with over 3,000 apps.</p>
<p>This teardown covers all the key sections of Zapier&#8217;s homepage so that you can apply the conversion tactics and copywriting strategies to your startup&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<h2>Grab attention early with these three tactics</h2>
<p>The above-the-fold (ATF) section of a homepage is the first section users see before they begin to scroll. It&#8217;s important that you nail this section, because if it&#8217;s not compelling, the rest of your landing page won&#8217;t be read.</p>
<p>Zapier&#8217;s ATF section has three pieces that we&#8217;ll dive into individually: header, subheader and a call to action.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232783" style="width: 1765px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232783" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232783 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png" alt="Zapier's above the fold section" width="1755" height="729" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png 1755w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=768,319 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=680,282 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=1536,638 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1755px) 100vw, 1755px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232783" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>A descriptive header with no jargon</h3>
<p>The purpose of the header is to explain what your startup does and why it matters. It needs to be easy to understand at a glance. One of the biggest mistakes we see startups make is trying to make their header clever. Opt for clarity, not cleverness if you care about getting customers. The best headers can accomplish this in about 10 simple words.</p>
<p>Zapier explains what their product does in three words: &#8220;Connect your apps.&#8221; Then, they explain why it matters in two words: &#8220;Automate workflows.&#8221; The implication is that you&#8217;ll save a lot of time if you use Zapier.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When crafting your header, start by writing at least 10 variations and share them with friends and colleagues who don&#8217;t work in your industry. Your header should be simple enough that anyone can understand what you sell. Avoid industry jargon unless it&#8217;s a primary competitive advantage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232784" style="width: 1153px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232784" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232784 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png" alt="It's imperative to use a descriptive header with no jargon" width="1143" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1143px) 100vw, 1143px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232784" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>A subheader that describes the transformation your customers go through</h3>
<p>The header and subheader should complement each other. The header explains what you do, while the subheader explains how you do it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The less information you ask your visitor to provide, the higher the conversion rate will be.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The subheader should add credibility to the claim made in the header by explaining <em>how</em> your company will accomplish the promise of the header. Explaining how it works is critical for conversion so that visitors know you have a real solution to their problems that has been thought through.</p>
<p>Again, avoid technical jargon in the subheader. You&#8217;re trying to pique your reader&#8217;s interest, not pitch to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an effort to expand beyond music, Spotify has been investing hundreds of millions to build out its podcasts business. Now the company has set its sights on another form of audio, with today&#8217;s acquisition of digital audiobook distributor <a href="https://findaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Findaway</a>.</p>
<p>Spotify declined to share the financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory review and approval.</p>
<p>Founded in 2004, Findaway&#8217;s core focus has been on bringing more audiobooks to listeners worldwide.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It today operates a collection of brands and products led by its <a href="https://findaway.com/publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large audiobook distribution business</a> that connects content creators with reseller partners like Apple, Google, Scribd, Audible, Nook, Rakuten Kobo, Chirp, Storytel (a Spotify partner), Overdrive, Audiobooks.com and dozens of other global brands.</p>
<p>Other brands under the Findaway umbrella include <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://findaway.com/authors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Findaway Voices</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17157640/smashwords-findaway-voices-ebook-audiobook-production-partnership-audible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connects</a> authors with professional narrators; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://findawayaudioworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audioworks</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which sees the company producing audio for top publishers; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://findaway.com/institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playaway</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which brings preloaded audiobook products to libraries and schools; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://orangeskyaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orange Sky Audio</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which works to bring a more diversified audio catalog to listeners; and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://audioengine.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AudioEngine</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which offers tools and technology that allow developers to integrate a broad catalog of audiobooks into their own platforms. </span></p>
<p>Spotify is bringing in Findaway&#8217;s full team of around 150, it says, and then plans to build on Findaway&#8217;s existing investments in the audio industry. It also plans to bring expanded access to audiobooks to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Shareholder-Letter-Q3-2021_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">381 million</a> monthly active users.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this acquisition, the plan is to accelerate into the audiobooks space by expanding our platform,&#8221; said Nir Zicherman, Spotify&#8217;s head of Audiobooks. He explained that today, Spotify users tend to go to other platforms to access audiobooks, and it wants to enable that consumption to take place with Spotify&#8217;s app itself. Initially, that may see Spotify users leveraging the company&#8217;s new <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Access Platform technology</a> (OAP) to authenticate with existing credentials to access audiobooks from Findaway and other audiobook partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spotify-expands-into-the-audiobooks-market-by-partnering-with-storytel/">like Storytel</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, however, OAP offers the flexibility for publishers to determine how their content is sold that works with their own business models, meaning they may introduce a variety of new ways consumers could unlock and listen to audiobook content on Spotify going forward.</p>
<p>The first integrations of OAP are expected to arrive early next year, said Spotify.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we think there&#8217;s massive potential and growth ahead for audiobooks,&#8221; Zicherman noted. &#8220;Combining Spotify and Findaway and their amazing team and their amazing tech, the idea is to realize that future faster than we ever could as separate companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/audiobooks-market#:~:text=The%20global%20audiobooks%20market%20is,USD%2014.99%20billion%20by%202027.&amp;text=Some%20key%20players%20operating%20in,Apple%20Inc.%2C%20and%20Storytel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> research estimates,</a> the audiobook industry is expected to grow from $3.3 billion as of 2020 to $15 billion by 2027, which is why Spotify believes Findaway is worth the investment. The company also noted that it sees the Findaway deal as the beginning of its ambitions in the audiobooks space, so it may choose to expand the team further in the future.</p>
<p>Spotify plans to have Findaway continue to run its various brands and services much as it does today, with the same staff and partners, operating from its Cleveland-area headquarters. This approach is similar to how Spotify handled its acquisition of podcast creation platform Anchor, which continued to offer distribution to other platforms &#8212; including Spotify&#8217;s competition.</p>
<p>The company has signaled its interest in audiobooks ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. In January, it <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-tests-audiobooks-with-frankenstein-jane-eyre-and-other-literary-classics-exclusive-4121062/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began testing the format</a> with a handful of classics, like “Frankenstein,” “Jane Eyre,” “Persuasion” and others, narrated by celebs. It had also previously offered the first “Harry Potter” book with chapters narrated by stars like Daniel Radcliffe, David Beckham and Dakota Fanning.</p>
<p>And in May, it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spotify-expands-into-the-audiobooks-market-by-partnering-with-storytel/"> announced a partnership</a> with audiobooks platform <a href="https://www.storytel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storytel</a> to allow Spotify users to access their audiobooks through Spotify&#8217;s app, also powered by OAP. (The company wouldn&#8217;t say if the deal with Findaway grew out of similar partnership discussions, but that seems a likely possibility.)</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s acquisition doesn&#8217;t signal a shift away from Spotify&#8217;s commitment to podcasts in order to chase a new area of audio investment, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Podcasts will remain a critical part of our focus as a business,&#8221; said Zicherman. &#8220;This is an expansion into a new content type that we know our consumers want, and, in many cases, are already listening to. We want to bring that on platform so they can enjoy it on Spotify, as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ro.co/">Ro</a>, a direct-to-consumer health company valued by its investors at $5 billion, is nearing a deal to acquire at-home sperm storage upstart Dadi, per multiple sources familiar with the unicorn’s business. The deal would be Ro’s fourth acquisition in the past 12 months, along with Workpath, Kit and Modern Fertility.</p>
<p>The deal is near close but could still fall through. It’s unclear how large the deal is, but one source estimated that the transaction will close at $100 million. Ro and Dadi did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dadikit.com/">Dadi</a> launched in 2019 with a temperature-controlled at-home fertility test and sperm collection kit, with a mission to remind men that “infertility isn’t a women’s issue, it’s both a men’s and women’s issue,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/dadi-brings-in-2m/">according to co-founder and CEO Tom Smith. </a>The startup has since raised $10 million in known venture capital, per Crunchbase, from investors such as firstminute Capital, Third Kind Venture Capital and The Chernin Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233009" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dadi’s closest competitor is Legacy, which has similarly raised venture capital for a sperm-testing and freezing service. Legacy won TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition at Disrupt Berlin 2018 and has raised over $20 million to date from investors like FirstMark, Y Combinator and Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes amid rising tensions at Ro, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">current and former employees say that the healthcare company has struggled</a> to keep up with the demands of new growth-stage goals. Many employees, some of whom have since left the company, said the tipping point for them was when Ro pursued rapid acquisitions for growth, instead of fixing culture and operations for longtime teams within the company.</p>
<p>“Each acquisition felt like it came out of nowhere,” a recently resigned employee interviewed by TechCrunch said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">about the cadence of deals.</a> “We’ve never really integrated with any of our companies that we’ve acquired; so what are we doing this for? The focus [of the company] would shift a lot because of these acquisitions, and, leaders would say ‘this is a growth company, that’s what happens.’”</p>
<p>That said, two of Ro’s latest acquisitions seem to mesh well with Dadi when it comes to strategy. Kit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ro-buys-kit-a-17-month-old-startup-that-offers-at-home-health-testing/">which Ro acquired in June,</a> is an at-home diagnostics company with an array of customizable products, from finger prick blood tests to weight measurement tools. The startup, similar to Dadi, wants to make it easier for consumers to be proactive about their health within the comfort of their own homes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s a fragmentation of care, fragmentation of data and providers aren’t kept in the loop,” Zachariah Reitano, co-founder and CEO of Ro, said about the Kit acquisition. “And we have so much work to do, but Kit is such an important and essential piece in that infrastructure to again bring more and more of a patient’s care under the same roof.”</p>
<p>Dadi will also bolster Ro’s apparent efforts to move into the fertility space, underscored by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">$225 million buy of Modern Fertility.</a> Led by Carly Leahy and Afton Vechery, Modern Fertility offers an at-home fertility test for women as well as a slew of personalized support for reproductive health issues.</p>
<p>And of course, Ro started out as a business in the men&#8217;s health space by focusing on erectile dysfunction. Its ED line continues to account for half of the health tech unicorn&#8217;s revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is on the verge of entering a new era in its historic journey as a provider of private rocket launch services: The company&#8217;s next flight includes its first attempt to recover one of its boosters for re-use, using a helicopter to snatch it out of the air as it floats back to Earth slowed by a parachute.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one reason why we&#8217;re so excited to have Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021 this year, which is happening December 14 and 15</a>. Beck, who founded the company 15 years ago in Auckland, has had a whirlwind year, taking Rocket Lab public via a SPAC merger in March, and unveiling plans to develop Neutron, a new medium-lift launch vehicle that will boost its capabilities alongside its existing Electron rocket.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is also expanding its own identity as a space company, venturing further into satellite development and providing a range of services that essentially make it a one-stop shop for would-be spacefaring businesses and customers who want to stick to what they do best and leave getting to and operating in space to the professionals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232292" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15.
