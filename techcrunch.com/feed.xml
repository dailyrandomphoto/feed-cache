<p tabindex="1" role="textbox" aria-label="Message Body" aria-multiline="true">Global investment firm KKR has plans to acquire a New Zealand bus and coach company with an 86-year heritage, Ritchies Transport. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the circumstances say the deal values Ritchies at over $347 million ($500 million NZD).</p>
<p tabindex="1" role="textbox" aria-label="Message Body" aria-multiline="true">On Thursday, the two companies signed the definitive agreements under which KKR will acquire Ritchies, marking KKR&#8217;s first infrastructure investment in New Zealand. KKR said acquiring the bus company, which currently has a fleet of more than 1,600 vehicles and 42 depots that operate across the country, will help it advance its mission &#8220;to better connect local communities, support the country&#8217;s expanding public transport network and promote greener transportation solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p tabindex="1" role="textbox" aria-label="Message Body" aria-multiline="true">New Zealand is still largely an ICE-fueled nation, but the country has plans to electrify. The government now requires all of its agencies and ministries to electrify fleets within the next five years, and aims to <a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/christchurch-and-auckland-prepare-to-roll-out-electric-bus-fleets--5614">decarbonize public transport,</a> which mainly relies on buses, entirely by 2035. Kiwi Bus Builders, a New Zealand manufacturer, recently assembled a range of ADL electric buses which have made it to <a href="https://cbwmagazine.com/adl-delivers-first-extra-large-electric-bus-in-new-zealand/">Auckland&#8217;s city streets</a>.</p>
<p tabindex="1" role="textbox" aria-label="Message Body" aria-multiline="true">Director on KKR&#8217;s infrastructure team Andrew Jennings said in a statement that Ritchies buses will represent &#8220;a highly visible opportunity to encourage the adoption of zero-emissions technology&#8221; as New Zealand continues to see &#8220;demand for high quality, greener public transport solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p tabindex="1" role="textbox" aria-label="Message Body" aria-multiline="true">KKR told TechCrunch that it does have a plan to help Ritchies electrify its fleet, and that the firm has made advancements globally across areas related to sustainable transportation, and it will be leveraging those experiences to advance the country as it moves towards zero emissions.</p>
<p tabindex="1" role="textbox" aria-label="Message Body" aria-multiline="true">The investment comes from KKR&#8217;s Asia Pacific Infrastructure Fund. The transaction is still conditional on OIO approval, which KKR says is expected within four to five months. Once the deal is completed, the Ritchie family will continue to hold a stake in the company, and Andrew Ritchie, current director of operations, will be appointed as CEO of the company as Glenn Ritchie, the current CEO, retires.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has a unique fascination for gold. The households in the South Asian market are estimated to have a stash of over 25,000 tons of the precious metal whose value today is about half of the country’s nominal GDP. But much of this gold has been sitting idly in lockers in big metal wardrobes for generations.</p>
<p>For generations, Indians across the socio-economic spectrum have preferred to stash their savings — or at least a part of it — in the form of gold. In fact, such is the demand for gold in India — Indians stockpile more gold than citizens in any other country — that the South Asian nation is also one of the world’s largest importers of this precious metal.</p>
<p>Indians use this gold not only as a savings instrument, which protects them from the ups-and-downs of the financial market, but also as an asset against which they could get credit. However, selling off your gold in the form of jewelry or otherwise has a stigma attached to it — &#8220;one is so broke that they had to pawn off their last asset of financial security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other challenge with keeping gold in the house is that it’s not safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://indiagold.co">Indiagold</a>, a young startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/former-paytm-execs-team-up-indiagold/">attempting to help people put this gold to use</a>, said on Friday it has raised $12 million in its Series A funding. The new financing round was led by Prosus’ PayU &#8212; which typically only backs later stage deals &#8212; and Falcon’s Alpha Wave Incubation (AWI) fund. Better Tomorrow Ventures, 3one4 Capital, Rainmatter Capital and existing investor Leo Capital also participated in the round, which brings the startup&#8217;s all-time raise to $14 million.</p>
<p>Indiagold &#8212; founded by Nitin Misra and Deepak Abbot, two former executives of Paytm &#8212; is building a gold-focused digital alternative credit platform in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. The startup is using gold to determine the credit worthiness of its customers and providing APIs to banks and other lenders that want to reach this untapped market.</p>
<p>The startup today has two major offerings: It has made it very easy and affordable for people to keep their gold in safe lockers, and it’s enabled them the option to take a loan against their gold reserves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once an individual has signed up on Indiagold, the startup’s agents come to their house, inspect and weigh the gold and put it in a RFID sticker-attached tamper-proof bag. Then they put this bag in a steel box and get the customer to lock it with their fingerprint. As the agents leave the premises, Indiagold app provides a livefeed of their journey to the designated vault location.</p>
<p>The idea is to make it very simple for customers to put their gold in a locker. Traditionally, because of the emotional stigma attached to the yellow metal, most people have hesitated to do anything with the gold jewelry they own. Indiagold has devised a procedure that helps them gain trust of their customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This whole business is built around trust,&#8221; said Misra in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;Unlike a norm in some circles of the startup ecosystem where you are expected to break things and move fast, in our business we have to spend time with customers to build that trust,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Indiagold also offers their lockers at a much affordable price &#8212; just a few dollars a year, as opposed to hundreds taken by banks. And unlike banks, Indiagold protects the customers’ gold with insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Customers have access to Indiagold app where they can see realtime value of the gold items they have put in the locker. This is when the startup’s second offering kicks in, should customers need it. In the event these customers need to take a loan, the startup facilitates a line of credit to them within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Tapping on gold as a loan collateral is a very large market in India &#8212; and also one that remains largely unscratched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the large gold reserves held by Indian household, the gold loan market has barely scratched the surface. The gold collateral (166 tons) held by Muthoot Finance is less than 1% of the estimated gold reserves in Indian households (~25k tons). This is because gold is seen as a family heirloom and passed along generations,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients earlier this year.</p>
<p>Customers have the freedom to take loan against only parts of their gold reserve they have stored in the locker. And because they know that their gold items are tied to their biometric, they are confident that nobody is breaking into the locker and melting their jewelries.</p>
<p>If changing consumer behavior wasn&#8217;t a big enough task already, Indiagold this year has grappled with several other challenges. The devastating second wave of the coronavirus wiped 70% of its business within days, said Misra and Abbot. &#8220;We have gone through a lot in this short journey,&#8221; Misra recalled.</p>
<p>But by first half of this month, business had climbed to an all-time peak, he said.</p>
<p>“Indiagold’s unique doorstep gold loan and gold locker products not only offer unparalleled customer experience but also enable it to offer credit at more affordable rates. The traction Indiagold has seen in a short time is a testament to its superior product capabilities and the deep experience of its pedigreed founders. We believe the gold loan market is ripe for disruption and are thrilled to back Indiagold’s founders,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, co-founder of Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup, which is currently operational in the National Capital Region and Indore, plans to expand to 10 cities by the end of the financial year. The duo said they are also working to broaden their product offerings. PayU said in a statement that it will explore ways to collaborate with Indiagold on some product offerings.</p>
<p>A handful of startups are beginning to explore the gold opportunities in India. Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.myjar.app">Jar</a>, founded this year, is helping young users start their journey of savings by investing in digital gold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/">announced</a> today it has reached a proposed settlement (embedded below) in a lawsuit filed against it by developers in the United States. The agreement, which is still pending court approval, includes a few changes, the biggest one being that developers will be able to share information on how to pay for purchases outside of their iOS app or the App Store—which means they can tell customers about payment options that aren’t subject to Apple commissions. The settlement also includes more pricing tiers and a new transparency report about the app review process.</p>
<p>The class-action lawsuit was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-apple-antitrust-idCAKCN1T5249-OCABS">filed against Apple in 2019</a> by app developers Donald Cameron and Illinois Pure Sweat Basketball, who said the company engaged in anticompetitive practices by only allowing the downloading of iPhone apps through its App Store.</p>
<p>In today’s announcement, Apple said it is “clarifying that developers can use communications, such as emails, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app. As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Stores.”</p>
<p>This would allow developers to communicate with customers by email and “other communication services,” which was difficult to do under the App Store’s rules, which forbid developers from using contact information obtained within an app to contact users outside of the app. The settlement would lift this rule for all app categories, enabling developers to tell consenting users about payment methods that avoid Apple’s commissions.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing tiers, Apple said it will expand the number of price points available to developers from fewer than 100 to more than 500. It also agreed to publish a new annual transparency report that will share information about the app review process, including how many apps are rejected, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, “objective data regarding search queries and results,” and the number of apps removed from the App Store.</p>
<p>The company also said it will create a new fund for qualifying developers in America who earned $1 million or less through the U.S. App Store, which includes 99% of developers in America. Hagens Berman, one of the law firms representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/apple-ios-app-developers">said the fund will be $100 million</a>, with payments ranging from $250 to $30,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the self-driving car company under General Motors, has launched a new initiative called <a href="https://www.getcruise.com/news/farm-to-fleet-how-cruise-powers-its-self-driving-cars-with-clean-energy">Farm to Fleet</a> that will allow the company to source solar power from farms in California&#8217;s Central Valley. The <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/Cruise-looks-to-Central-Valley-solar-panels-to-16409623.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a> was the first to report the news that Cruise is directly purchasing renewable energy credits from Sundale Vineyards and Moonlight Companies to help power its fleet of all-electric autonomous vehicles in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Cruise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">recently secured a permit</a> to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles in San Francisco without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The company is also ramping up its march to commercialization with a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion line of credit</a> from GM Financial to pay for hundreds of electric and autonomous Origin vehicles. While this partnership with California farmers is undoubtedly a boon to the state&#8217;s work in progressing renewable energies while also providing jobs and financial opportunities to local businesses, Cruise isn&#8217;t running a charity here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/california-scrambles-to-find-electricity-this-summer-as-blackout-risks-grow-11625666400">The California Independent System Operator has been soliciting power producers</a> across the western United States to sell more megawatts to the state this summer in anticipation of heat waves that will boost electricity demand and potentially cause blackouts. Power supplies are lower than expected already due to droughts, outages and delays in bringing new energy generation sources to the grid, causing reduced hydroelectric generation. To ensure California&#8217;s grid can handle the massive increase in fleet size Cruise is planning, it seems that the company has no choice but to find creative ways to bolster the grid. Cruise, however, is holding firm that it&#8217;s got loftier goals than securing the energy from whatever sources are available.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is entirely about us doing the right thing for our cities and communities and fundamentally transforming transportation for the better,&#8221; Ray Wert, a Cruise spokesperson, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>With droughts continuing to plague California farmers, converting farmland to solar farms is a potential way to help the state meet its climate change targets, according to <a href="https://www.scienceforconservation.org/products/power-of-place">a report from environmental nonprofit Nature Conservancy</a>. Which is why Cruise saw the logic in approaching Central Valley farmers now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farm to Fleet is a vehicle to rapidly reduce urban transportation emissions while generating new revenue for California’s farmers leading in renewable energy,&#8221; said Rob Grant, Cruise’s vice president of social affairs and global impact, in a blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cruise is paying negotiated contract rates with the farms through its clean energy partner, BTR Energy. The company isn&#8217;t disclosing costs, but says it&#8217;s paying no more or less than what it would pay for using other forms of renewable energy credits (RECs). RECs are produced when a renewable energy source generates one megawatt-hour of electricity and passes it on to the grid. According to Cruise, Sundale has installed 2 megawatts of solar capacity to power their 200,000 square footage of cold storage, and Moonlight has installed a combined 3.9 MW of solar arrays and two-battery storage system for its sorting and storage facilities. So when Cruise buys credits from these farms, it&#8217;s able to say that a specific amount of its electricity use came from a renewable source. RECs are unique and tracked, so it&#8217;s clear where they came from, what kind of energy they used and where they went. Cruise did not share how many RECs it plans to purchase from the farms, but says it will be enough to power its San Francisco fleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the solar power still flows through the same grid, Cruise purchases and then ultimately &#8216;retires&#8217; the renewable energy credits generated by the solar panels at the farms,&#8221; said Wert. &#8220;Through data that we submit to the California Air Resources Board quarterly, we retire a number of RECs equivalent to the amount of electricity we used to charge our vehicles.&#8221;<span class="im"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Cruise is also working with BTR Energy to finalize a supply of RECs for its operations in Arizona, including its delivery pilot with Walmart.</p>
<p><span class="im">Wert says using fully renewable power is actually profitable for Cruise in California due to the <a href="https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/low-carbon-fuel-standard-credits-overview-lcfs/">Low Carbon Fuel Standard</a>, which is designed to decrease the carbon intensity of transportation fuels in the state and provide more low-carbon alternatives. Cruise owns and operates all of its own EV charging ports, so it&#8217;s able to generate credits based on the carbon intensity score of the electricity and amount of energy delivered. Cruise can then sell its credits to other companies seeking to reduce their footprints and comply with regulations. </span></p>
<p><span class="im">Aside from practicalities, Cruise is aiming to set a standard for the industry and create demand for renewable energy, thus incentivizing more people and businesses to create it. </span><b></b></p>
<p>Aram Shumavon, CEO of grid analytics startup Kevala, says Cruise should be applauded for this partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Cruise seems to be trying to acknowledge is that there is carbon intensity associated with the electricity that they&#8217;re consuming, and they&#8217;re offsetting that in some way,&#8221; Shumavon told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a whole category of carbon accounting, that&#8217;s referred to as Scope 3, which is trying to understand how much carbon the supply chain that you use to provide your service actually involves, and Cruise is probably, as a very deliberate decision, getting out in front of their Scope 3 requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shumavon said that by quantifying the total carbon intensity of commercial activity, companies become more accountable to it and can then drive change by asking providers for their supply to source from renewables. For example, an automaker might ask their aluminum provider to source only from an area with hydroelectric power instead of coal power, which would ultimately bring the automaker&#8217;s carbon intensity down.</p>
<p><span class="im">&#8220;Transportation is responsible for over 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is why we announced our Clean Mile Challenge in February, where we challenged the rest of the AV industry to report how many miles they’re driving on renewable energy every year,&#8221; said Wert. &#8220;We’re hoping that others follow our lead.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>‘Ello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 26, 2021. Or as someone called it recently, Friday Jr. We have lots and lots of news today, with a slight bias toward big items from Big Tech companies. But first, do note that we’re going to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/were-focusing-on-fintech-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">spend a lot of time talking fintech at Disrupt this year</a>, and TechCrunch just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/techstars-saba-karim-is-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">announced that Techstars’ Saba Karim is coming</a>. It’s going to be great! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FT0Ufv3fSj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/techstars-saba-karim-is-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">Techstars&#8217; Saba Karim is coming to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Techstars&#8217; Saba Karim is coming to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/techstars-saba-karim-is-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/embed/#?secret=FT0Ufv3fSj" data-secret="FT0Ufv3fSj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/airbnb-to-allow-anyone-not-only-current-hosts-to-sign-up-to-house-afghan-refugees/"><strong>Airbnb expands who can help host Afghan refugees:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Want to help with Airbnb’s push to house refugees fleeing Afghanistan? The company announced today that it will allow anyone to help, not merely existing hosts. Hopefully this expands the pool of housing stock available and gets more folks housed. We’re all human, so let’s help one another.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/"><strong>Apple’s commission rigidity fades further:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Apple’s hard-line 30% commission is softening yet again, with the company planning to offer lower take rates for news purchases, at least for publishers who take part in the Apple News app. So it’s good news, with a strong arm-twist to go along with it. Why is Apple fighting so hard to continue rent-seeking in the mobile economy? Because it’s lucrative as heck, that’s why.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/big-tech-pledges-billions-to-bolster-u-s-cybersecurity-defenses/">Major tech companies pledge huge dollars for cybersecurity:</a> </strong>U.S. tech giants Apple, Google and Microsoft are pledging to work on cybersecurity with extra fervor, they said in a White House meeting. Microsoft is pledging to spend $20 billion on the effort, and Google $10 billion. Apple has promised to “establish a new program to drive continuous security improvements throughout the technology supply chain,” TechCrunch writes. All this is good news, but we do wonder how much of the pledged spending was already penciled into future budgets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The other day we noted that our own Brian Heater was launching a newsletter. He still is, and one of its pre-launch entries today sports a headline that I cannot improve upon: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/actuator-2/">I don’t know what to do with those tossed salads and robot legs</a>.” Heater gets 100 points for getting that past the editors. You can sign up for the robot newsletter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters/">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/otter-ai-expands-automatic-transcription-assistant-to-microsoft-teams-google-meet-and-cisco-webex/"><strong>Otter.ai expands transcription capabilities:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you need to record a conversation and transcribe it, Otter is a great tool to use. I know that because I’m an Otter customer &#8212; with my own money &#8212; and depend on it heavily. Its news today is that the service is rolling out its “Otter Assistant feature for Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and Cisco Webex,” after previously launching support for Zoom.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/job-offer-management-platform-compa-emerges-from-stealth-with-3-9m/"><strong>Compa raises $3.9M to build better job offer software:</strong></a> Hiring is a pain in the backside, and in today’s superheated talent market for a number of startup-friendly gigs, it’s even more irksome. To combat those facts, Compa has built software to support recruiters in their work by helping them “manage their compensation strategies to create and communicate offers that are easy to understand and are unbiased.” The startup just came out of stealth.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/playbook-which-aims-to-be-the-dropbox-for-designers-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-founders-fund/"><strong>Playbook wants to build the Dropbox for designers:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yes, in years past Dropbox was the Dropbox for designers, but today it&#8217;s an enterprise storage and productivity tool. So now there’s Playbook, which wants to assume Dropbox’s old mantle. And it just raised $4 million in a round led by Founders Fund.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/picsart-raises-130m-from-softbank-becomes-unicorn-on-the-back-of-its-visual-creator-tools/"><strong>Picsart raises $130M:</strong></a> Today’s SoftBank and/or Tiger round is Picsart, for whom the Vision Fund 2 just led a $130 million transaction. Details were light, but the company is now a unicorn that crested the $100 million revenue mark. So if you were curious if mobile-first creator tools could scale, well, they can.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/atheneum-150-million/">Atheneum raises $150M for its research and survey product:</a></strong> When I first saw this news I was very excited. Because I live near a private library called the Athenæum. However, this is not that, and so my local temple to books did not just raise $150 million. A startup with the name did, however, and the customer base for its research and survey service is already 500 big companies deep.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/no-code-process-automation-platform-leapwork-fires-up-with-62m-series-b/"><b>Leapwork proves that no-code is still hot by raising $62M Series B:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based in Denmark, and raising that country’s largest-ever Series B, Leapwork is making waves with its no-code tool that helps with process automation. I suppose at the union of two hot trends it is not a surprise that the company is doing well &#8212; process automation is booming, and everyone is short on developers.</span></li>
<li>Finally, recent TechCrunch hire Kate Park is out today with a piece digging into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/ai-voice-synthetic-speech-company-lovo-gets-4-5m-pre-series-a-funding/"><strong>AI voice and synthetic speech startup LOVO</strong></a>, which just put together a $4.5 million round. Perhaps it can fill in for TechCrunchers on our podcasts when we have colds.</li>

<h2>You can’t hack your YC application, but here’s what to avoid</h2>
<p>Forget what you&#8217;ve heard: There are many shortcuts to success.</p>
<p>Tapping into someone else&#8217;s experience is a tried-and-true method, which is why two-time Y Combinator participant Chris Morton wrote a guest post for Extra Crunch with advice for founders hoping to be accepted by the famed accelerator.</p>
<p>Morton, who has also reviewed thousands of YC applications, shares his thoughts on when to submit an application, what to do if you miss the deadline and whether you&#8217;ll need to relocate if accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that your application should be good enough to get an interview, not win a prize,&#8221; says Morton. &#8220;Go back to work instead of spending more time perfecting an application.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>To close out our news roundup today, a wall of Big Tech news for your diversion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/"><strong>Google kills Streams, its clinician support app:</strong></a> Google is very good at making things and even better at killing them. If Google was a novelist, it would self-kill so many darlings that it would only produce novellas. Regardless, that Streams is dead is not a huge surprise, but for some likely a real bummer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">Want some Netflix games? Move to Poland:</a></strong> Netflix is getting into games, which is not a huge surprise given that games are a bigger business than movies, to pick an example. But not everyone is going to get their hands on its mobile titles at once. Poland is up first. That’s not shocking as far as market selection goes, given the popularity of video games in Europe and the reasonable size of the Polish market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/facebook-elections-oversight-board/"><strong>Facebook considers launching an election policy decision board group oversight Entmoot coven thing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In more evidence that Facebook may be slightly too large a company to fit into the modern world as a single entity, and that maybe single-human, complete shareholder control should go the way of monarchy, the social giant is “looking to create a standalone advisory committee for election-related policy decisions.” Does that inspire confidence? You tell me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/lordstown-motors-taps-former-icahn-exec-as-ceo-to-put-its-ev-truck-ambitions-back-on-track/"><strong>Lordstown gets new CEO:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This is a hard, high-profile gig, so it must have been something of an adventure to fill. Still, troubled public EV company Lordstown has secured new leadership that TechCrunch reports is “Daniel A. Ninivaggi, a longtime automotive executive and former head of Carl C. Icahn’s holding company.” Let’s see if he can turn the company around.</li>
<li>Wrapping up, if you are a paid YouTube subscriber, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/youtube-to-roll-out-picture-in-picture-viewing-for-all-u-s-ios-users-starting-with-premium-subscribers/">here’s some good news</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/7675bbee-9ef6-463d-bc17-5008709a1f69?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The Equity crew felt that there was enough media news out recently that we simply had no choice but to fire up a Twitter Space and have a chat. The above episode is a discussion of a few things, in a <em>loose and relaxed manner</em>, so don&#8217;t take any of the Verizon jokes too seriously, Verizon, as we still work for you. For a few more days.</p>
<p>Regardless, here&#8217;s what <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1430870604178202624">Politico sells for $1 billion</a>: </strong>Its new parent company Axel Springer is also buying the rest of Politico Europe and all of Protocol at the same time. This deal exploded everyone&#8217;s Twitter feed due to its scale, and the fact that it was one heck of an exit for a media company. One billion dollars? For media? In this economy? Yes!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/08/26/forbes-to-become-public-company-through-business-combination-with-special-purpose-acquisition-company-magnum-opus/"><strong>Forbes is going public via a SPAC</strong></a>: Yep, the venerable Forbes magazing and its enormous digital arm are taking the blank-check route to the public markets, which means that we got its numbers and time to stroll through them. Our take is that Forbes has done massive work to take its IRL brand and extend it into the digital world. The company has big plans to boot, and will be worth more than $800 million when it combines.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/vice-media-round-layoffs-1235049824/">Layoffs hit Vice</a>:</strong> As Vice turns its focus to video content — you&#8217;ve heard this story before — it is shedding some of its editorial staff. The layoffs were a stinkbomb on Media Twitter after the other news of the week, but were sadly not a huge surprise. The company&#8217;s union decried them as something of a yearly recurrence. Not good, not good at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there&#8217;s more media news to come. Our parent company Verizon Media is expected to close its sale to Apollo on September 1 or sometime soon after, which means we will either be hosting Equity regularly as always, or we&#8217;ll be hosting the RUDE (Recently Unemployed Due to (Private) Equity) podcast.</p>

Applications for Ticketed Spaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">first opened in June</a> for users who are over 18, hosted three Spaces in the last 30 days and have at least 1,000 followers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to work closely with people who are already hosting Spaces for Ticketed Spaces,&#8221; a Twitter representative told TechCrunch. Twitter declined to say how many people it&#8217;s rolled out this capability to so far, or when users can expect a more universal rollout. For now, anyone on iOS can buy tickets to Spaces hosted by people who have access to the feature.</p>

<p>Twitter <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed-faq">previously stated</a> that it will take a 3% cut of creators&#8217; earnings from Ticketed Spaces. But since the feature is only currently available on iOS, that means that Twitter will be subject to Apple&#8217;s 30% in-app purchase fee, so a creator will only see 67% of each ticket sale. If a creator&#8217;s total lifetime earnings on Twitter &#8212; including Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows &#8212; exceed $50,000, then Twitter will raise its 3% commission to 20%.</p>
<p>Ticketed Spaces would differentiate Twitter aside from its live audio competitors. Clubhouse and Instagram let listeners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">tip speakers</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">award badges</a> in a live audio space, but the apps haven&#8217;t enabled advance ticket sales.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zendesk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is looking to grow its customer service capabilities, and today it announced the acquisition of early-stage artificial intelligence startup Cleverly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed at this time and Cleverly has not been entirely public about the size of its funding.</span><a href="https://www.cleverly.ai/contact-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Founded in 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleverly</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is based in Lisbon, Portugal and, according to its site, has received funding from the European Union’s </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horizon 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research and innovation programme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was also listed by TechCrunch in an article earlier this year looking at the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lisbons-startup-scene-rises-as-portugal-gears-up-to-be-a-european-tech-tiger/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">startup scene in Lisbon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as being one of the most exciting deep tech companies in the region, according to Stephan Morais, partner at Indico Capital Partners.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleverly&#8217;s product platform provides a series of artificial intelligence-powered capabilities, including a triage function to automatically tag incoming service requests to help categorize workflow. The startup also has what it refers to as AI-powered human augmentation with its</span><a href="https://www.cleverly.ai/product/agent-assist"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">agent assist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capability that aims to help customer service agents provide the right answers to inquiries. The company&#8217;s technology already integrates with Zendesk, as well as with Salesforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to why Zendesk is acquiring Cleverly, Shawna Wolverton, EVP of product at Zendesk, noted in an email to TechCrunch that the two companies have a similar vision for the future of customer service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cleverly and Zendesk want to democratize AI, so companies can create practical applications that make it possible for businesses to get started with AI right out of the box — without a team of data scientists required,&#8221; she said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolverton added that AI has the ability to help customer experience teams deliver great customer service. She expects that the next generation of great customer experiences will be created by intelligent software, enabling humans and AI working closely together to deliver this at scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolverton noted that her company will be welcoming all of Cleverly’s team to Zendesk beginning August 30, including founders Christina Fonseca as VP of Product and Pedro Coelho as principal engineering lead, Machine Learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zendesk already has a series of AI-enabled capabilities that can help organizations automate customer conversations, boost agent productivity and increase operational efficiency, including the Answer Bot, which is a chatbot for customer interactions providing answers pulled from Zendesk&#8217;s knowledge base. Zendesk&#8217;s Content Cues AI-powered feature in turn helps to automatically review support tickets and also can identify areas where content in a company&#8217;s help center can be updated to be more useful to users.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With Cleverly, we will deliver a range of capabilities that automate key insights, further reduce manual tasks and improve workflows, and overall lead to happier, more productive support teams,&#8221; Wolverton said. &#8220;We will have more news to share on that front once the team is up and running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zendesk&#8217;s business has been growing in 2021 overall,</span><a href="https://investor.zendesk.com/ir-home/financial-reports/financial-releases/financial-releases-details/2021/Zendesk-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">second-quarter fiscal 2021 revenue of $318.2 million for a 29% year-over-year gain.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to e-paper devices, the Kindle is of course the first brand people think of, though I&#8217;ve done my best to spread the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/kobos-forma-e-reader-takes-on-kindle-oasis-with-an-asymmetric-design-and-premium-price/">Kobo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/the-remarkable-2-improves-on-the-original-in-every-way-but-remains-firmly-in-its-niche/">reMarkable</a> gospel as well. Chinese e-reader maker Boox is a relatively new entrant to the space, and its devices are experimental but useful options in the niche market of monochrome tablets. In fact, they make my new favorite small device.</p>
<p>A brand from parent company Onyx, Boox has a wide array of devices, some might say too wide, ranging from pocketable to medium-sized e-readers to A4-sized tablets. Its branding is not particularly memorable and slightly updated versions come out quite regularly — one device I hoped to test was actually being replaced by the time I got around to writing this article.</p>
<p>The unifying aspect is the OS, a modified version of Android 10 with a few special-made apps for reading and productivity. Made with Chinese consumers in mind, the services probably aren&#8217;t ones you will have heard of.</p>
<p>I tested several devices from Boox, the simplest being the Poke 3 e-reader, then the larger and more complex Note2, followed by the svelte Note Air and enormous Max Lumi. Most recently I have been looking at the Nova3 Color, which uses E Ink&#8217;s latest Kaleido Plus color screen.</p>
<p>The truth is if you didn&#8217;t turn them on you probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell that these devices were all from the same company. They have quite different hardware styles, though of course there&#8217;s only so much room for expression in a black tablet with a screen in shades of grey.</p>
<h3>Little and big</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin with the simplest and most familiar format, the 6-inch e-reader. In this category we have the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Clara HD. The former is probably the best one Amazon makes, but I prefer the latter, even though its build quality is, frankly, poor.</p>
<p>Boox in this space has (among others) the Poke 3, not exactly the catchiest name, but it makes up for that with its form factor: pretty much the platonic ideal for a small reader like this. I liked it so much I broke it out into a separate review, but here are the basics.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J2Dbe1j9WF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/">The Boox Poke 3 is my new favorite e-reader</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Boox Poke 3 is my new favorite e-reader&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/embed/#?secret=J2Dbe1j9WF" data-secret="J2Dbe1j9WF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The 6-inch, 300-PPI screen is of equal quality to the Kindle and Kobo, and like the Clara HD has a temperature-adjustable frontlight. The front of the device is completely flush, just the way I like it, and has just enough bezel to grip without it becoming too much or too little. The seamless design makes it pocketable and resistant to crumbs and spills (though it makes no water resistance claims). There&#8217;s a power button up top (thank you) and a single USB-C port at the bottom.</p>
<p>Regarding the hardware, I find it difficult to come up with any criticism at all. It could, I suppose, be lighter, but its dimensions could not be smaller than they are without adversely affecting the ergonomics; a millimeter could conceivably be shaved off the thickness but it would be barely noticeable.</p>
<p>The OS is a highly customized version of Android, with all the pros and cons that comes with. I have always enjoyed the simplicity of Kobo&#8217;s interface, though they seem bent on complicating it. Boox&#8217;s OS is powerful but busy, uneasy in its decisions of what options to make available and prominent to the user.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2072183" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2072183" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2072183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg" alt="Screen of a Boox Poke 3 e-reader" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/boox-poke3-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2072183" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The reader app, NeoReader, supports tons of file formats and has a huge set of controls for changing your view, highlighting and notating books and PDFs, and so on. This is more for the larger devices than the small ones, which really only need font adjustment and other basic stuff.</p>
<p>If all you want to do is read e-books you already have sitting on your computer, it&#8217;s as easy as dragging them into the &#8220;Books&#8221; folder on the device&#8217;s storage. That tab is what you&#8217;ll see when you turn on the device, and it&#8217;s always easy to get to. There&#8217;s a built-in store that takes up a whole tab, though it isn&#8217;t available in the U.S. — then a file manager tab for rooting around in directories — and a tab each for your apps and settings.</p>
<p>The apps are another custom situation: This being a Chinese device, it comes without the usual Google-authenticated App Store, whatever it&#8217;s called these days. Instead, it has its own store with dozens of the most-used reading apps, from Pocket and GoodReader to the Kobo and Kindle apps. But these are essentially side-loaded: for instance, the Kindle app is a few months old. That&#8217;s far from a disaster, but you do need to commit to a certain amount of trust in Boox and its proxy app store in order to use the device as-is.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also enable Google Play services in the settings, which adds the official store into the mix. But for most people this is already far too much work. We are both spoiled and deprived in our e-reader selection in that they are generally simple and extremely straightforward to use. Someone who is not familiar with Android, using this device and a Kobo or Kindle, would probably opt for one of the latter.</p>
<p>Yet the possibilities are many for those who wish to take the plunge. For my part, I like the form factor of the Poke 3 so well that I will brave any OS to use it. Besides, you spend 99% of your time on these things in a book, so as long as that part works, the rest is just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>At the 6-inch scale, this all seems like way too much. But on Boox&#8217;s larger devices, the flexibility starts to make more sense. The idea with the Note 2 (now 3), Note Air and Max Lumi is to provide almost all the capabilities of an Android tablet, but with the benefits of an e-paper screen. Admittedly that makes playing racing games something of a non-starter, but it could be very attractive to the types of people for whom their reMarkable is used more than their iPad.</p>
<p>If you read a lot of documents, doing so on a bright tablet screen — or a dim one, for that matter — sucks. An e-paper screen is better for the task, but the best device for that, the reMarkable, is also very deliberately limited in what it can accomplish, since the whole philosophy of the company revolves around <em>focus</em>. So there are definitely people who want the capabilities of an Android device with the readability of an e-paper one. Or at any rate Boox thinks so.</p>
<p>The Note 2 and Max Lumi seem related: They&#8217;re unremarkable black tablets of impressive dimensions and, in my limited explorations of their hardware, what seemed to me excellent build quality. The Note Air, it must be said, is the opposite of unremarkable — in fact, when I saw it, I thought it was a clone of the reMarkable 2!</p>

<p>This first impression turned out to be less than generous on my part, as while the two share some significant design elements, they are in fact quite different and Boox&#8217;s facility in creating other devices has led me to give them the benefit of the doubt here. The blue and orange motif isn&#8217;t the greatest, but it does help set it apart, and all the devices (especially the Air) are thin and well designed.</p>
<p>All the tablets feature frontlights, and I&#8217;m happy to say that my skepticism that it could be done with such big screens was needless. It works well and like the Poke 3 the light is adjustable in both brightness and temperature (though it&#8217;s a bit fiddly).</p>
<h3>Color e-paper still isn&#8217;t quite there</h3>

<p>The Nova3 Color has a 7.8-inch screen with the latest color e-paper tech from E Ink. I&#8217;ve always been excited for the possibilities of this side of the technology, but color e-paper screens have always suffered from poor contrast, low refresh speeds, ghosting and other shortcomings. While this latest iteration does go some way toward amending those (and a software update helped further), it is still unfortunately too much of a compromise.</p>
<p>The hardware is similar to the other Boox devices, solid and unassuming. The difference is all in the screen, which shows in color even when the device is off. Color e-paper works by combining the microscopic black and white beads that form images with a layer of color filters that can be changed. This one, like the others, has a frontlight and it helps a lot with making those colors pop, since without it they&#8217;re all rather muted.</p>
<p>There is still the issue of ghosting, though if you&#8217;re reading, say, a comic, you can easily set it to refresh every page (it takes only a fraction of a second) and the problem is gone. It&#8217;s less easy to do this with more dynamic content like a webpage, though of course navigating the web on an e-reader is already something of a novelty.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194717" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194717" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2194717" class="wp-caption-text">The color e-paper display still lacks saturation, if not contrast. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey</p></div></p>
<p>More troubling to me is the decrease in contrast and effective decrease in resolution that the color layer brings. When color content is shown, there&#8217;s a distinct screen door effect to it, not quite like ordinary LCD aliasing but still visible. And when you have greyscale content you sometimes see moire and other interference patterns in mid-tones.</p>
<p>Books look all right but not nearly as clear as an ordinary monochrome E Ink display; the screen door effect is always present and reduces contrast. It&#8217;s still very readable, but when cheaper devices do the job better, it&#8217;s hard to justify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194715" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194715" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194715 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/boox-nova3-color-type.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2194715" class="wp-caption-text">Text is less clear and high contrast on the color screen than on the monochrome one. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey</p></div></p>
<p>I appreciate Boox making the latest screen from E Ink available, and it may be useful to some who want a little more tablet DNA in their e-reader (at this point the two categories are not very distinct). But for most people the color does not add enough, and subtracts too much.</p>
<h3>Does it all, or stretched too thin?</h3>
<p>The OS is the same on all of these as far as I can tell, but on the these devices the focus shifts to interactivity rather than simply reading. Boox makes a Wacom-like pen that can be used to write on the surface of these larger tablets, and it serves its purpose fine, though with nowhere near the responsiveness or accuracy of reMarkable&#8217;s.</p>
<p>That said, the final result when sketching or writing was a pleasing one, though the OS takes a moment to catch up and anti-alias the marks. I thought the brush in particular had nice gradations.</p>
<p>One thing the Boox tablets have on others like them (that is to say, the reMarkable, the defunct Sony Digital Paper Tablet and a handful of other niche devices) is in the PDF handling. The Boox devices let you navigate and mark up PDFs with ease, and the original files are simply saved over with your doodles and notes added. Though marking up a document is easy on the reMarkable, its slightly clumsy app makes sharing and sorting them a bit of a chore. I prefer the simple approach: modify the original file (there&#8217;s always a copy somewhere) and email it directly from the device. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>
<p>Besides the reader and notebook, there are a handful of included apps that any tablet user might find useful. There&#8217;s a browser that&#8217;s about as functional as you&#8217;d expect — it&#8217;s Chromium-based and renders well but ghosts terribly; a voice recorder, a music player, a calendar&#8230; and of course you could download plenty more from the built-in or Google app stores. If you wanted to, you could make these quite well-rounded devices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure just how large the market is for this kind of e-paper tablet. But I feel these devices offer something interesting and unique, even if they&#8217;re also&#8230; well, it&#8217;s hard to get around the fact that you can get an iPad for half the price of the larger Boox tablets, and then do most of the same stuff and more.</p>
<p>These e-paper devices have a certain draw, though, and if you plan to read and mark up long documents, it&#8217;s way better to do so on one of these than on an iPad, for a number of reasons. With Boox&#8217;s lineup in the mix there are more options than ever, and that&#8217;s definitely a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pokémon GO announced yesterday that it will permanently keep an in-game feature that made the game easier to play while social distancing. Introduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the feature doubled the interaction radius around key augmented reality landmarks that are essential to gameplay. Though Niantic &#8212; parent company to Pokémon GO &#8212; removed the feature earlier this month, it chose to <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1430644448929718274">permanently reinstate</a> it after weeks of community- and creator-led backlash.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trainers &#8211; we’re looking forward to sharing our plans as a result of the task force on September 1, but one thing does not have to wait! From now on, 80 meters will be the base interaction radius for PokéStops and Gyms globally. (1/2)</p>
<p>&mdash; Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1430644448929718274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Pre-pandemic, Pokémon GO players needed to be within 40 meters of a PokéStop or Gym to interact with it, but with the now-permanent change, the radius is expanded to 80 meters. Incidentally, players with disabilities found that this feature made the game more accessible to people with limited mobility. As one of the first mainstream AR mobile games, Pokémon GO is virtually unplayable if you&#8217;re unable to travel to real-world landmarks like PokéStops and Gyms &#8212; so allowing users to interact with these landmarks from farther away (for example, if a wheelchair-user can&#8217;t journey off of a paved sidewalk) opened the game up to new players.</p>
<p>Because Pokémon GO has long positioned itself as a game that encourages real-world exploration, worldwide lockdowns posed a unique challenge for Niantic. But by making some <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/stay-safe/">small changes</a> &#8212; like expanding the interaction radius by just 40 meters, increasing Pokémon spawns and making it easier to obtain more PokéBalls &#8212; the game became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/">easier to play from home</a>.</p>
<p>These changes didn&#8217;t break the game or contradict its adventurous spirit, which made the rollback of a well-loved upgrade confusing for players, especially in light of the spreading Delta variant. From a financial standpoint, the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/">thrived during the pandemic</a>. In 2020, Pokémon GO had its best-earning year since its launch in 2016, earning <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020">over $1 billion</a>. According to app analytics firm Sensor Tower, this upward trend continued for Pokémon GO in the first half of 2021, with $642 million. This marked a 34% increase in consumer spending compared to the first half of 2020, when it made $479 million.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/pokemon-go-influencers-threaten-a-boycott-after-niantic-removes-covid-safety-measures/">Niantic reduced the interaction radius</a>, Pokémon GO content creators and community members worked together to write an open letter to Niantic, which caused the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HearUsNiantic">#HearUsNiantic</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/FvDgphKkWiA?t=68">trend on Twitter</a>. The letter expressed that the increased radius made the game safer, more accessible and less intrusive.</p>
<p>Some players organized a boycott of the game on August 5th, which was referred to as &#8220;<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/pok-mon-tries-enticing-players-160000316.html">Pokémon No Day</a>.&#8221; That same day, Niantic issued <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/pgo-exploration-bonus-response/?hl=en">a response letter </a>addressed to the Pokémon GO community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Encouraging people to explore, exercise and safely play together in person remains Niantic’s mission. The health and wellbeing of players is our top priority,&#8221; Niantic&#8217;s statement read. The company formed an &#8220;inter cross-functional team&#8221; to address these concerns and invited prominent Pokémon GO content creators to share community feedback. While expanding the interaction radius is the first result of the task force, Pokémon GO <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1430644448929718274">tweeted</a> that it will share more findings on September 1.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Niantic why it initially chose to rebuke these gameplay updates despite positive community feedback, increased revenue and an ongoing pandemic, but Niantic declined to comment.</p>
<p>Despite players&#8217; visible negative response on social media, Sensor Tower told TechCrunch that it didn&#8217;t see any change in consumer spending or active users for Pokémon GO around the time of the in-game strike. However, there was a <a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/niantic-inc/app/pokemon-go/1094591345/overview">significant uptick</a> in negative App Store reviews.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Though the wider interaction radius is now reinstated, some players remain frustrated, since community leaders had previously provided this feedback </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/hello-world-pokemon-go">in June</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> after Niantic announced its plans to roll back these changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Why did it have to take this giant community movement for any of our feedback to be heard?&#8221; said creator ZoëTwoDots in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6eBNFpRc8U&amp;">a YouTube video</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://onpopcorn.com/">Popcorn</a> wants to make work communication more fun and personal by offering a way for users to record short video messages, or &#8220;pops,&#8221; that can be used for any number of purposes in place of longer emails, texts, Slack messages or Zoom calls. While there are plenty of other places to record short-form video these days, most of these exist in the social media space, which isn&#8217;t appropriate for a work environment. Nor does it make sense to send a video you&#8217;ve recorded on your phone as an email attachment, when you really just want to check in with a colleague or say hello.</p>
<p>Popcorn, on the other hand, lets you create the short video and then send a URL to that video anywhere you would want to add a personal touch to your message.</p>
<p>For example, you could use Popcorn in a business networking scenario, where you&#8217;re trying to connect with someone in your industry for the first time &#8212; aka &#8220;cold outreach.&#8221; Instead of just blasting them a message on LinkedIn, you could also paste in the Popcorn URL to introduce yourself in a more natural, friendly fashion. You also could use Popcorn with your team at work for things like daily check-ins, sharing progress on an ongoing project or to greet new hires, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194586" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194586" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2194586 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png 390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popcorn</p></div></p>
<p>Videos themselves can be up to 60 seconds in length &#8212; a time limit designed to keep Popcorn users from rambling. Users also can opt to record audio only if they don&#8217;t want to appear on video. And you can increase the playback speed if you&#8217;re in a hurry. Users who want to receive &#8220;pops&#8221; could also advertise their &#8220;popcode&#8221; (e.g. try mine at U8696).</p>
<p>The idea to bring short-form video to the workplace comes from Popcorn co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinspraggins/">Justin Spraggins</a>, whose background is in building consumer apps. One of his first apps to gain traction back in 2014 was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/18/looksee-debuts-a-tinder-meets-instagram-for-connecting-around-shared-photos/">Tinder-meets-Instagram experience called Looksee</a> that allowed users to connect around shared photos. A couple years later, he co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/unmute-reinvents-the-phone-hotline-with-an-social-calling-app/">a social calling app called Unmute,</a> a Clubhouse precursor of sorts. He then went on to co-found <a href="https://www.9count.co/">9 Count</a>, a consumer app development shop which launched more social apps like BFF (previously Wink) and Juju.</p>
<p>9 Count&#8217;s lead engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hochberg-44858351/">Ben Hochberg</a>, is now also a co-founder on Popcorn (or rather, Snack Break, Inc. as the legal entity is called). They began their work on Popcorn in 2020, just after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the rapid shift to remote work in the days that followed could now help Popcorn gain traction among distributed teams. Today&#8217;s remote workers may never again return to in-person meetings at the office, but they&#8217;re also growing tired of long days stuck in Zoom meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Popcorn, the goal is to make work communication fun, personal and bite-sized, Spraggins says. &#8220;[We want to] bring all the stuff we&#8217;re really passionate about in consumer social into work, which I think is really important for us now,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;You work with these people, but how do you &#8212; without scheduling a Zoom &#8212; how do you bring the &#8216;human&#8217; to it?,&#8221; Spraggins says. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about making work products feel more social, more like Snapchat than utility tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a lot Popcorn would still need to figure out to truly make a business-oriented social app work, including adding enhanced security, limiting spam, offering some sort of reporting flow for bad actors, and more. It will also eventually need to land on a successful revenue model.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbyECYAbh_Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, Popcorn is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1539175761#?platform=iphone">free download</a> on iPhone, iPad and Mac, and offers a Slack integration so you can send video messages to co-workers directly in the communication software you already use to catch up and stay in touch. The app today is fairly simple, but the company plans to enhance its short videos over time using AR frames that let users showcase their personalities.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $400,000 pre-seed round from General Catalyst (<a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/niko-bonatsos/">Niko Bonatsos)</a> and <a href="https://www.dreammachine.vc/">Dream Machine</a> (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexia-tsotsis">Alexia Bonatsos</a>, previously editor-in-chief at TechCrunch.) Spraggins says the company will be looking to raise a seed round in the fall to help with hires, including in the AR space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix today <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587">announced</a> it will begin testing mobile games inside its Android app for its members in Poland. At launch, paying subscribers will be able to try out two games, &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3&#8221; &#8212; titles that have been <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things:_The_Game">previously</a> available on the Apple App Store, Google Play and, in the case of the newer release, on other <a href="https://bonusxp.com/#games">platforms</a>, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/stranger-things-3-the-game/9pmddq228fqd?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">desktop</a> and <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things_3:_The_Game">consoles</a>. While the games are offered to subscribers from within the Netflix mobile app&#8217;s center tab, users will still be directed to the Google Play Store to install the game on their devices.</p>
<p>To then play, members will need to confirm their Netflix credentials.</p>
<p>Members can later return to the game at any time by clicking &#8220;Play&#8221; on the game&#8217;s page from inside the Netflix app or by launching it directly from their mobile device.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s still very, very early days and we will be working hard to deliver the best possible experience in the months ahead with our no ads, no in-app purchases approach to gaming,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said about the launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let’s talk Netflix and gaming. </p>
<p>Today members in Poland can try Netflix mobile gaming on Android with two games, Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3. It’s very, very early days and we’ve got a lot of work to do in the months ahead, but this is the first step. <a href="https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r">https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company has been expanding its investment in gaming for years, seeing the potential for a broader entertainment universe that ties in to its most popular shows. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">the E3 gaming conference back in 2019</a>, Netflix detailed a series of gaming integrations across popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite and its plans to bring new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games to the market.</p>
<p>On mobile, Netflix has been working with the Allen, Texas-based game studio <a href="https://bonusxp.com/">BonusXP</a>, whose first game for Netflix, &#8220;<a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things:_The_Game">Stranger Things: The Game</a>,&#8221; has now been renamed &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; to better differentiate it from others. While that game takes place after season 1 and before season 2, in the &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; timeline, the follow-up title, &#8220;Stranger Things 3,&#8221; is a playable version of the third season of the Netflix series. (So watch out for spoilers!)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 investors on 2021&#8217;s mobile gaming trends and opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/6-investors-on-2021s-mobile-gaming-trends-and-opportunities/embed/#?secret=4KmF5HCkTs" data-secret="4KmF5HCkTs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Netflix declined to share how popular the games had been in terms of users or installs, while they were publicly available on the app stores.</p>
<p>With the launch of the test in Poland, Netflix says users will need to have a membership to download the titles as they&#8217;re now exclusively available to subscribers. However, existing users who already downloaded the game from Google Play in the past will not be impacted. They will be able to play the game as usual or even re-download it from their account library if they used to have it installed. But new players will only be able to get the game from the Netflix app.</p>
<p>The test aims to better understand how mobile gaming will resonate with Netflix members and determine what other improvements Netflix may need to make to the overall functionality, the company said. It chose Poland as the initial test market because it has an active mobile gaming audience, which made it seem like a good fit for this early feedback.</p>
<p>Netflix couldn&#8217;t say when it would broaden this test to other countries, beyond &#8220;the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The streamer recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">announced</a> during its second-quarter earnings that it would add mobile games to its offerings, noting that it views gaming as &#8220;another new content category&#8221; for its business, similar to its &#8220;expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news followed what had been<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-current-quarter-forecast-misses-estimates-shares-fall-2021-07-20/"> a sharp slowdown in new customers</a> after the pandemic-fueled boost to streaming. In North America, Netflix in Q2 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/netflix-bleeds-subscribers-in-us-and-canada-with-no-sign-of-recovery/">lost a sizable 430,000 subscribers</a> &#8212; its third-ever quarterly decline in a decade. It also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/netflix-bleeds-subscribers-in-us-and-canada-with-no-sign-of-recovery/">issued weaker guidance</a> for the upcoming quarter, forecasting the addition of 3.5 million subscribers when analysts had been looking for 5.9 million. But Netflix downplayed the threat of competition on its slowing growth, instead blaming a lighter content slate, in part due to COVID-related production delays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Curio Wellness <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/curio-wellness-launches-30m-fund-to-help-women-and-minorities-own-a-cannabis-dispensary/">announced its innovative franchise program in 2020</a>, and today it’s bringing the program across the United States. The company is now accepting franchise applications in 10 states, including Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan and Illinois.</p>
<p>The program is designed to lower barriers to opening a dispensary. Anyone can apply to secure a franchise license, and diverse founders can seek capital through the Curio Wellness Fund. Curio Wellness expects to be able to sponsor 40 to 50 retail stores. The company is also rebranding its retail operations to Far &amp; Dotter.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Jerel Registre, managing director at Curio WMBE Fund, who says the fund raised $20 million to date and expects to close the fundraising on October 31. He’s proud of the fund’s investor base, pointing to the diverse investor base representing 40% of the fund.</p>
<p>“My focus on the fund is driving diverse entrepreneurship,” Registre said. “The reason cannabis is such a great industry to do that in is that it’s a growing opportunity. It’s just a great ocean to put the boat on in terms of increasing diversity among entrepreneurs. It’s an area of the economy, and it’s a hot industry where there’s an understanding of the need for diversity.”</p>
<p>Registre points out that while the cannabis industry’s customer and employee base are often diverse, there’s often a lack of diversity in the executive and business ownership group. That’s what Curio Wellness is trying to address.</p>
<p>The fund provides selected franchisees with up to 93% of the capital needed to open a location. But it’s more than capital. It’s clear while speaking to Registre that his team is dedicated to formulating a proven strategy for their franchises. He points to Chick-fil-Aa as an example, saying, while he doesn’t like the company’s relationship with its franchisees, it provides a market-leading cohesive brand statement. Through Curio&#8217;s program, franchisees are provided with two phases of support. The first provides capital to franchisees to open their Curio Wellness Center and assist them in obtaining licenses, selecting a location and hiring and training employees. Once the location is operational, the fund intends to provide ongoing support around managing, sales and marketing, store operations, and ensuring employees stay updated on product information.</p>
<p>“After more than two years of effort to design an effective method of providing capital to diverse entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry, it is a personal honor to officially begin the application process and to truly expand diversity and enable economic empowerment in the industry,” said Registre. “The Fund is a true testament to Curio’s goal to address systemic barriers and create generational wealth among aspiring women, BIPOC, and disabled veteran entrepreneurs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This program is spinning up at the right time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/2020-was-a-defining-year-for-cannabis-what-comes-next/">Cannabis was one of the winners of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, resulting in record sales and consumer acceptance. As a result, the time is right for dispensary ownership to better reflect their local neighborhoods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is looking to create a standalone advisory committee for election-related policy decisions, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/technology/facebook-election-commission.html">The New York Times</a>. The company has reportedly approached a number of policy experts and academics it is interested in recruiting for the group, which could give the company cover for some of its most consequential choices.</p>
<p>The group, which the Times characterizes as a commission, would potentially be empowered to weigh in on issues like election misinformation and political advertising — two of Facebook&#8217;s biggest policy headaches. Facebook reportedly plans for the commission to be in place for the 2022 U.S. midterm elections and could announce its formation as soon as this fall.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s election commission could be modeled after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">Oversight Board</a>, the company&#8217;s first experiment in quasi-independent external decision making. The Oversight Board began<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/"> reviewing cases in October of last year</a>, but didn&#8217;t gear up in time to impact the flood of election misinformation that swept the platform during the U.S. presidential election. Initially, the board could only make policy rulings based on material that was already removed from Facebook.</p>
<p>The company touts the independence of the Oversight Board, and while it does operate independently, Facebook created the group and appointed its four original co-chairs. The Oversight Board is able to set policy precedents and make binding per-case moderation rulings, but ultimately its authority comes from Facebook itself, which at any point could decide to ignore the board&#8217;s decisions.</p>

<p>A similar external policy-setting body focused on elections would be<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/"> very politically useful</a> for Facebook. The company is a frequent target for both Republicans and Democrats, with the former claiming Facebook censors conservatives disproportionately and the latter calling attention to Facebook&#8217;s long history of incubating conspiracies and political misinformation.</p>
<p>Neither side was happy when Facebook decided to suspend political advertising after the election — a gesture that failed to address the exponential spread of organic misinformation. Facebook asked the Oversight Board to review its decision to suspend former President Trump, though the board ultimately kicked its most controversial case <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board/">back to the company itself</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Y Combinator application season is upon us. I have been through YC a couple of times and have reviewed thousands of applications as a volunteer in later years.</p>
<p>Typically, you hear advice focused on ways to improve your YC application so it gets accepted. Here are some tips on what not to do and why so many YC applications get rejected. I&#8217;ve also put down some advice about what else to anticipate and take into consideration as you navigate the application process.</p>
<p>In short, don’t overthink your application, and keep it simple and straightforward.</p>
<h2>When should I submit my YC application?</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When in doubt, read YC’s instructions and answer the question literally. Avoid verbose marketing lingo and keep answers short and concise.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The best applications are often those made at the last minute, because applicants do not overthink their responses and toil over details they think need to be shoved into a question. While I do not recommend submitting applications at the deadline because the system has had issues receiving submissions, you can capture the essence of last-minute submissions by being clear and concise.</p>
<p>Remember that your application should be good enough to get an interview, not win a prize. Go back to work instead of spending more time perfecting an application.</p>
<p>YC experiments frequently. For this batch and the last, there was an early deadline that would give accepted teams access to YC before the batch officially began. Applying early gives you an opportunity to land an interview in the early round and to update your application to be considered in the standard round.</p>
<h2>Is it OK to submit my YC application late?</h2>

					<description><![CDATA[There's a lot of advice out there on how to grab people's attention, but there's one aspect of marketing that Robert Katai thinks isn't talked about as often: maintaining their attention.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a lot of advice out there on how to grab people&#8217;s attention, but there&#8217;s one aspect of marketing that <a href="https://robertkatai.com/">Robert Katai</a> thinks isn&#8217;t talked about as often: maintaining their attention. The solution, he says, is a combination of content strategy and positioning.</p>
<p>Based in Romania, Katai is known for his podcasts and speeches covering the gamut of content marketing. A product manager at online graphic design platform <a href="https://www.creatopy.com/">Creatopy</a>, he also works with clients as a freelance content strategist, and it is in this capacity that he was recommended to TechCrunch via our growth marketer survey. (If you have growth marketers to recommend, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out the survey</a>!)</p>
<p>Katai was recommended by multiple Romanian clients and contacts who vouched for his content strategy prowess, so we were curious to know more. Who is he? And is his advice applicable beyond borders?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes. In a freewheeling interview, Katai spoke about how content marketing should integrate with users&#8217; daily lives, and how content can be repurposed across multiple formats. He also shared some insights on the booming Romanian startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you help your clients as a freelancer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Katai: </strong>One of the two things I&#8217;m doing is that I&#8217;m helping clients with creating their content strategy based on their objective. You can get web traffic, but you can also create a message and build the brand. You don&#8217;t have to start at the beginning; You can rebuild the brand later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, I&#8217;m working with a Romanian outsourcing company that pioneered this industry in our city of Cluj-Napoca. But lately, they started to realize that they should be more attractive from a sales as well as from an employee perspective. So I worked with them to perform an internal audit to see why employees love the company, why they leave, why they stay and what they want from the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192106" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192106" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?w=300" alt="Robert Katai" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robert Katai.</p></div></p>
<p>From there, I got to the idea that they needed to reshape their brand to not just have people notice them but to also maintain their attention. And here comes the content: I started an ambassador program, because there are people outside of the company who love it.</p>
<p>I also recommended they create an internal print magazine. It&#8217;s a very well-designed magazine that their 200 to 300 employees can take home and read. It&#8217;s not just about the job; it&#8217;s also about their hobbies, things to do in the city and some thought leadership articles that can inspire them to have a better life.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the second way you are helping clients?</strong></p>
<p>Apart from content strategy, I&#8217;m working with clients on their positioning for their audience, community and market, but also sometimes in terms of employer branding. Content can be a bridge between the two ways I am helping clients, because I&#8217;m using a lot of content marketing here and not focusing only on performance or growth marketing hacks. I&#8217;m helping them understand that if they want to establish a memorable, long-lasting brand in the market, they have to make content marketing part of their life.</p>
<p>If they want to reposition themselves in the industry, they need to say: Okay, these are the kinds of content we have to create for our goals; who will amplify the content, who will connect with us, and who will consume the content. Today, content creation is free — everybody can do it. The hard part is how you distribute and amplify that. And here&#8217;s how I can help the startups: Make a big piece of content and repurpose it in several small pieces; get it in front of people so that the brand is on their minds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How can brands achieve that top-of-mind status?</strong></p>
<p>We all know that there are four kinds of content: Text, video, pictures and audio. These four formats never die. The platform can change, but the format will stay the same. A video can be an Instagram Reel, a documentary or something else, but it&#8217;s a video. The same goes for a photo. So the content strategy I&#8217;m working with is how brands can use that content ecosystem.</p>
<p>When I work with my clients — and also with Creatopy where I&#8217;m a product marketer — I recommend them to use content to build their brand and be visible to their users every day in their feeds. Every morning, when their customers are waking up and checking their phones, they don&#8217;t open a newspaper. They will open Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, and maybe then when they get out of the bathroom and make coffee, they will open YouTube and connect with Alexa.</p>
<p>I really believe that brands should create content that can just be in the mind of the user. Snackable content, Reels, TikTok … It doesn&#8217;t matter what we call it.</p>
<p><strong>You also talked about repurposing content. Can you explain that?</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the interview you&#8217;ve done with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/to-stay-ahead-of-your-competitors-start-building-your-narrative-on-day-one/">Peep Laja</a>. You could have recorded it as a video. And he covered several topics, so you could have several short videos — 30 seconds, three minutes, whatever. You can publish them daily on your site or social media channels with a comment that says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the link to the full article.&#8221; But remember that on LinkedIn, that link will need to go into the comments section, not the post itself.</p>
<p>You can also have a longer video that you can publish on social media or on Wistia, asking people to give their email — so now you also have subscribers.</p>
<p>Then the second type of content you can create is audio. You already have it from the recording. You don&#8217;t have to publish the full 45-minute conversation, but you can have a five-minute audio clip, and again link to the articles.</p>
<p>Now we have video and audio, but what if you also designed quotes with his headshot and messaging? If it&#8217;s part of a series, you should also give it a name.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just motivational; it&#8217;s educational, too, so you should take these quotes and create carousels for Instagram and LinkedIn. The first slide should grab attention — it can be a question. The second slide can be a link to the interview so that even if people don&#8217;t click it, it will be on their minds. Then you can have slides with insights.</p>
<p>The last slide will always be a call to action: Asking people to share, comment or save it for later — it&#8217;s the new currency on Instagram! And once you have your Instagram carousel, you create a PDF and publish it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>So now you have five formats of content from one piece of content.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, how much do we owe you?! Just kidding, we actually do some of that for the Equity podcast, for instance. Now, what other advice do you have for startups?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big advocate of documenting the process. Just imagine if Mark Zuckerberg had done that and you could read how he launched Facebook and so on. Noah Kagan is doing that right now. I think startup founders should do it, not just from the PR and marketing perspective, but for their audience. Even if your audience is not paying for your product right now, they are staying with you and giving your brand an essence in the industry.</p>
<p>Just think about what Salesforce is doing right now: They <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/there-could-be-more-to-the-salesforce-video-streaming-service-than-meets-the-eye/">launched Salesforce+</a>, which is like Netflix for B2B. It&#8217;s to get the attention of professionals and also maintain it, and I believe this is the currency of the big companies today: People&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p><b>Do you work with any startups in Romania? And do you have any impressions to share on the </b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/8-investors-tell-us-the-story-behind-the-romanian-startup-boom/"><b>Romanian startup ecosystem</b></a><b>?</b></p>
<p>Yes, I help a few Romanian startups with their content marketing and positioning. Sometimes other startups email me with questions, so I help them, too, but I don&#8217;t charge for email advice. I work with the ones that are looking for a long-term or project-based collaboration.</p>
<p>Startup founders here in Romania are curious, and very courageous to experiment even if it won&#8217;t necessarily work. And Romanian startups are very smart. For instance, <a href="https://planable.io/">Planable</a> is doing a great job with content, social media and positioning. We also have social media analytics company <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/">Socialinsider</a>, which this year launched virtual events, and <a href="https://www.typingdna.com/">TypingDNA</a>, which wants to get rid of needing to log in with passwords and was founded by a former colleague.</p>
<p>I also found that the founders here work harder than their teams and don&#8217;t just leave others do the work — at least the ones I have met. We have several startup events in Romania: <a href="https://www.howtoweb.co/">How to Web</a>, and <a href="https://techsylvania.com/">Techsylvania</a> here in Transylvania.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like this name, but people say that Cluj-Napoca is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/06/the-silicon-valley-of-transylvania/">&#8220;Silicon Valley of Romania.&#8221;</a> Lots of startups have been launched here, but the city that is getting more and more traction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradea">Oradea</a>, where the bet on education is paying off.</p>
<p><em>(If you are a tech startup founder or investor in Cluj or Oradea, fill in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/we-want-your-city-in-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">TechCrunch&#8217;s European Cities Survey 2021</a>.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Though YouTube has supported picture-in-picture viewing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/youtubes-picture-in-picture-mode-is-live-for-all-u-s-android-users/">on Android devices</a> since 2018, YouTube told TechCrunch today that it plans to launch the feature to all iOS users in the U.S. on both iPhone and iPad. For now, YouTube is inviting Premium subscribers to test this feature, which lets users watch picture-in-picture videos in a mini player while browsing other apps. The testing period for Premium users ends on October 31, but YouTube does not have a timeline to share for when all U.S. iOS users will gain access to the feature.</p>
<p>Though this is a mobile feature, Premium subscribers must enable the ability to test it <a href="http://youtube.com/new">via the YouTube experiments website</a> on the desktop. Last year, YouTube made opting into experiments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">a Premium perk</a>.</p>
<p>If you scroll down on the experiments website, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Picture-in picture on iOS&#8221; with the option to try it. Then, if you watch a video on the YouTube app, you should see a picture-in-picture display of the video when you navigate out of the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194578" style="width: 681px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194578" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194578 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?w=671" alt="" width="671" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=296,300 296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=768,778 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=671,680 671w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=1517,1536 1517w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=2022,2048 2022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubepip.png?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshots obtained by TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Once viewing a video via picture-in-picture, you can adjust where the video appears on your screen and how big it is. When you tap on the video, you&#8217;ll return to the YouTube app. If you lock your phone, the video will pause.</p>

<p>Some users have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/">reported</a> that you might need to delete and reinstall the YouTube app to get it to work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This feature is different from existing picture-in-picture functionality on the YouTube iOS app because it allows you to continue watching a video even while navigating elsewhere on your phone. Similar features already exist on streaming apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/netflix-finally-gets-picture-in-picture-support-on-ipad/">Netflix</a>.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The May 2021 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> from the White House on improving U.S. cybersecurity includes a provision for a software bill of materials (SBOM), a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building a software product.</p>
<p>An SBOM is the full list of every item that’s needed to build an application. It enumerates all parts, including open-source software (OSS) dependencies (direct), transitive OSS dependencies (indirect), open-source packages, vendor agents, vendor application programming interfaces (APIs) and vendor software development kits.</p>
<p>Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open-source and commercial software components, the executive order notes. It’s useful to those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software and those who operate the software.</p>
<p>As the executive order describes, an SBOM enables software developers to make sure open-source and third-party components are up to date. Buyers can use an SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk in a product. And those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability.</p>
<p>“A widely used, machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool integration,” the executive order says. “The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other applications and systems. Understanding the supply chain of software, obtaining an SBOM and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in managing risk.”</p>
<p>An SBOM is intrinsically hierarchical. The finished product sits at the top, and the hierarchy includes all of its dependencies providing a foundation for its functionality. Any one of these parts can be exploited in this hierarchical structure, leading to a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, given the potential impact, there has been a lot of talk about the proposed SBOM provision since the executive order was announced. This is certainly true within the cybersecurity community. Anytime there are attacks such as the ones against Equifax or Solarwinds that involve software vulnerabilities being exploited, there is renewed interest in this type of concept.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearly, the intention of an SBOM is good. If software vendors are not upgrading dependencies to eliminate security vulnerabilities, the thinking is we need to be able to ask the vendors to share their lists of dependencies. That way, the fear of customer or public ridicule might encourage the software producers to do a better job of upgrading dependencies.</p>
<p>However, this is an old and outmoded way of thinking. Modern applications and microservices use many dependencies. It’s not uncommon for a small application to use tens of dependencies, which in turn might use other dependencies. Soon the list of dependencies used by a single application can run into the hundreds. And if a modern application consists of a few hundred microservices, which is not uncommon, the list of dependencies can run into the thousands.</p>
<p>If a software vendor were to publish such an extensive list, how will the end users of that software really benefit? Yes, we can also ask the software vendor to publish which of the dependencies is vulnerable, and let’s say that list runs into the hundreds. Now what?</p>
<p>Clearly, having to upgrade hundreds of vulnerable dependencies is not a trivial task. A software vendor would be constantly deciding between adding new functionality that generates revenue and allows the company to stay ahead of its competitors versus upgrading dependencies that don’t do either.</p>
<p>If the government formalizes an SBOM mandate and starts to financially penalize vendors that have vulnerable dependencies, it is clear that given the complexity associated with upgrading dependencies the software vendors might choose to pay fines rather than risk losing revenue or competitive advantage in the market.</p>
<p>Revenue drives market capitalization, which in turn drives executive and employee compensation. Fines, as small as they are, have negligible impact on the bottom line. In a purely economic sense, the choice is fairly obvious.</p>
<p>In addition, software vendors typically do not want to publish lists of all their dependencies because that provides a lot of information to hackers and other bad actors as well as to competitors. It’s bad enough that cybercriminals are able to find vulnerabilities on their own. Providing lists of dependencies gives them even more possible resources to discover weaknesses.</p>
<p>Customers and users of the software, for their part, don’t want to know all the dependencies. What would they gain from studying a list of hundreds of dependencies? Rather, software vendors and their customers want to know which dependencies, if any, make the application vulnerable. That really is the key question.</p>
<p>Prioritizing software composition analysis (SCA) ensures that when dependencies are analyzed in the context of an application, the dependencies that make an application vulnerable can be dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>Instead of publishing a list of 1,000 dependencies, or 100 that are vulnerable, organizations can publish a far more manageable list in the single digits. That is a problem that organizations can much more easily deal with. Sometimes a software vendor can fix an issue without having to upgrade the dependency. For example, it can make changes in the code, which is not always possible if we are merely looking for the list of vulnerable dependencies.</p>
<p>There is no reason to disdain the concept of SBOM outright. By all means, let’s make the software vendors responsible for being transparent about what goes into their software products. Plenty of organizations have paid a steep price because of software vulnerabilities that could have been prevented in the form of data breaches and other cybersecurity attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s heartening to see the federal government take cybersecurity so seriously and propose ways to enhance the protection of applications and data.</p>
<p>However, let’s make SBOM specific to the list of dependencies that actually make the application vulnerable. This serves both the vendor and its customers by cutting directly to the sources of vulnerabilities that can do damage. That way, we can address the issues at hand without creating unnecessary burdens.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is rolling out a major update for its iOS smartphone app with new controls, improved management and cool visuals. Version 4.0 also gives you the choice between two different sized widgets for your iPhone home screen. As detailed by <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/558/tesla-releases-new-iphone-tesla-app-android-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Tesla Software Updates</em></a>, both feature the same information: the name of the car, battery percentage, location (or charging info), unlock status, an image of the vehicle and the time the information was last updated. Tesla previously had a &#8220;Today&#8221; extension for iOS that was nowhere near as comprehensive as the new widgets.</p>
<p>In terms of controls, you can send commands to your car immediately upon opening the app, instead of waiting for the vehicle to wake up. There&#8217;s also enhanced phone key support that essentially lets you unlock multiple Teslas.</p>
<p>An updated visual that should be immediately noticeable is the new 3D vehicle render. There are also new animations when you charge your car and in the climate and controls sections. Design-wise, Tesla has ditched the charging section and now displays that info when your car is plugged in. You can also view Supercharging history from within the app. While the speed limit, valet mode and sentry mode settings have been moved to a new category titled Security, which includes tips on how to use the Bluetooth, phone key and location services.</p>
<p>To sum up, this is the biggest update to the EV maker&#8217;s iOS app in a while. Recently, Tesla has mainly focused on providing bug fixes and improvements, outside of the introduction of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-powerwall-owners-can-now-help-balance-the-grid-in-california-052917432.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Virtual Power Plant</a> enrolment in July.</p>
