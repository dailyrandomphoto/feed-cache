										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It sounds like a plan concocted by a supervillain, if that villain&#8217;s dastardly end was to provide cheap, clean power all over the world: launch a set of three-kilometer-wide solar arrays that beam the sun&#8217;s energy to the surface. Even the price tag seems gleaned from pop fiction: one hundred million dollars. But this is a real project at Caltech, funded for a nearly a decade largely by a single donor.</p>
<p>The Space-based Solar Power Project has been underway since at least 2013, when the first donation from Donald and Brigitte Bren came through. Donald Bren is the chairman of Irvine Company and on the Caltech board of trustees, and after hearing about the idea of space-based solar in Popular Science, he proposed to fund a research project at the university — and since then has given over $100M for the purpose. The source of the funds has been kept anonymous until this week, <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-announces-breakthrough-100-million-gift-to-fund-space-based-solar-power-project">when Caltech made it public</a>.</p>
<p>The idea emerges naturally from the current limitations of renewable energy. Solar power is ubiquitous on the surface, but of course highly dependent on the weather, season, and time of day. No solar panel, even in ideal circumstances, can work at full capacity all the time, and so the problem becomes one of transferring and storing energy in a smart grid. No solar panel <em>on Earth</em>, that is.</p>
<p>A solar panel in orbit, however, may be exposed to the full light of the sun nearly all the time, and with none of the reduction in its power that comes from that light passing through the planet&#8217;s protective atmosphere and magnetosphere.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186965" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186965" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186965" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="727" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg?resize=768,545 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg?resize=1536,1091 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-tile.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186965" class="wp-caption-text">The latest prototype created by the SSPP, which collects sunlight and transmits it over microwave frequency.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This ambitious project is a transformative approach to large-scale solar energy harvesting for the Earth that overcomes this intermittency and the need for energy storage,&#8221; said SSPP researcher Harry Atwater in the Caltech release.</p>
<p>Of course, you would need to collect enough energy that it&#8217;s worth doing in the first place, and you need a way to beam that energy down to the surface in a way that doesn&#8217;t lose most of it to the aforementioned protective layers but also doesn&#8217;t fry anything passing through its path.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These fundamental questions have been looked at systematically for the last decade, and the team is clear that without Bren&#8217;s support, this project wouldn&#8217;t have been possible. Attempting to do the work while scrounging for grants and rotating through grad students might have prevented its being done at all, but the steady funding meant they could hire long-term researchers and overcome early obstacles that might have stymied them otherwise.</p>
<p>The group has produced dozens of published studies and prototypes (which you can peruse <a href="https://www.spacesolar.caltech.edu/publications">here</a>), including the lightest solar collector-transmitter made by an order of magnitude, and is now on the verge of launching its first space-based test satellite.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Launch] is currently expected to be Q1 2023,&#8221; co-director of the project Ali Hajimiri told TechCrunch. &#8220;It involves several demonstrators for space verification of key technologies involved in the effort, namely, wireless power transfer at distance, lightweight flexible photovoltaics, and flexible deployable space structures.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186966" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186966" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png" alt="" width="1024" height="729" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png 1110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=768,547 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186966" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram showing how tiles like the one above could be joined together to form strips, then spacecraft, then arrays of spacecraft.</p></div></p>
<p>These will be small-scale tests (about 6 feet across), but the vision is for something rather larger. Bigger than anything currently in space, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;The final system is envisioned to consist of multiple deployable modules in close formation flight and operating in synchronization with one another,&#8221; Hajimiri said. &#8220;Each module is several tens of meters on the side and the system can be build up by adding more modules over time.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186967" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186967" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186967" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png" alt="Image of how the final space solar installation could look, a kilometers-wide set of cells in orbit." width="637" height="491" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186967" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>Eventually the concept calls for a structure perhaps as large as 5-6 kilometers across. Don&#8217;t worry — it would be far enough out from Earth that you wouldn&#8217;t see a giant hexagon blocking out the stars. Power would be sent to receivers on the surface using directed, steerable microwave transmission. A few of these in orbit could beam power to any location on the planet full time.</p>
<p>Of course that is the vision, which is many, many years out if it is to take place at all. But don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking of this as having that single ambitious, one might even say grandiose goal. The pursuit of this idea has produced advances in<a href="https://daedalus.caltech.edu/"> solar cells</a>, flexible space-based structures, and <a href="https://chic.caltech.edu/publication/">wireless power transfer</a>, each of which can be applied in other areas. The vision may be the stuff of science fiction, but the science is progressing in a very grounded way.</p>
<p>For his part, Bren seems to be happy just to advance the ball on what he considers an important task that might not otherwise have been attempted at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a student researching the possible applications of space-based solar energy for many years,&#8221; he told Caltech. &#8220;My interest in supporting the world-class scientists at Caltech is driven by my belief in harnessing the natural power of the sun for the benefit of everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back with the SSPP ahead of launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With most popular online video games, there&#8217;s a <em>huge</em> gap between being a good player and a great one. A casual player might be able to hold their own against other casual players, only for a random pro to wander by and chew through everyone like they&#8217;re somehow playing with a different set of rules.</p>
<p>Could an AI-driven voice in your ear help close that gap, if only a bit? <a href="https://senpai.gg">SenpAI.GG</a>, a company out of Y Combinator&#8217;s latest batch, thinks so.</p>
<p>Much of that aforementioned gap boils down to practice, muscle memory and — let&#8217;s face it — natural ability. But as a game gets older/bigger/more complex, the best players tend to have a wealth of one resource that&#8217;s oh-so-crucial, if not oh-so-fun to gather: information.</p>
<p>Which guns do the most damage at this range? Which character is best suited to counter that character on this map? Hell, what changed in that &#8220;minor update&#8221; that flashed across your screen as you were booting up the game? Wait, why is my favorite weapon suddenly so much harder to control?</p>
<p>Staying on top of all this information as players discover new tactics and updates shift the &#8220;meta&#8221; is a challenge in its own right. It usually involves lots of Twitch streams, lots of digging around Reddit threads and lots of poring over patch notes.</p>
<p>SenpAI.GG is looking to surface more of that information automatically and help new players get good, faster. Their desktop client presents you with information it thinks can help, post-game analysis on your strategies, plus in-game audio cues for the things you might not be great at tracking yet.</p>
<p>It currently supports a handful of games — League of Legends, Valorant and Teamfight Tactics — with the info it provides varying from game to game. In LoL, for example, it&#8217;ll look at both teams&#8217; selected champions and try to recommend the one you could pick to help most; in Valorant, meanwhile, it can give you an audio heads-up that one of your teammates is running low on health (<em>before</em> said teammate starts yelling at you to heal them), when you&#8217;ve forgotten to reload or how long you&#8217;ve got before the Spike (read: game-ending bomb) explodes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2186932" style="width: 1842px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186932" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2186932 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg" alt="" width="1832" height="1009" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg 1832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=1536,846 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1832px) 100vw, 1832px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186932" class="wp-caption-text">SenpAI.GG&#8217;s in-game overlay providing League of Legends insights. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SenpAI.GG</p></div></p>
<p>Just as important as the information it provides is the information it <em>won&#8217;t</em> provide. In my chat with him, SenpAI.GG founder Olcay Yilmazcoban seemed very aware that there&#8217;s a hard-to-define line here where &#8220;assistant&#8221; blurs into &#8220;cheating tool&#8221; — but the company follows certain rules to stay on the right side of things and prevent their players from getting banned.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t, for example, ever take action on a player&#8217;s behalf — they might fire an audio cue to say &#8220;hey, you should heal that teammate,&#8221; but they won&#8217;t press the button for you. They&#8217;ll only generate their real-time insights from what&#8217;s on <em>your</em> screen — not anything hidden within the running process. They also won&#8217;t do things like reveal an enemy&#8217;s location just because your teammate is also running the app and can see them. Think &#8220;good player standing over your shoulder,&#8221; not &#8220;wall hack.&#8221; The company says that they&#8217;re always within each game developer&#8217;s competitive fairness guidelines, and only work with approved/provided APIs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea because it&#8217;s one that, arguably, never gets old. With each new game they support, they&#8217;ve got a new potential audience to serve. Meanwhile, it&#8217;s not as if the old games/insights will expire — a game&#8217;s big ol&#8217; book-of-stuff-you-need-to-know tends to only get bigger and more complex as a game ages and the patches pile up. There are games I&#8217;ve been playing for <em>years</em> where I&#8217;d still love a voice assistant that says &#8220;Oh hey, the recoil on the gun you just picked up has gotten way more intense since the last time you played.&#8221; SenpAI.GG isn&#8217;t there yet, but there&#8217;s a ton of natural room for growth.</p>
<p>Yilmazcoban tells me that they currently have over 400,000 active users, with a team of 11 people working on it. The base app is free, with plans to offer advanced features for a couple bucks a month.</p>

Turns out when everyone owns something, no one does. As a result, growth teams can cause an enormous amount of friction in an organization when introduced.</p>
<p>Growth teams are twice as likely to appear among businesses growing their ARR by 100% or more annually. What&#8217;s more, they also seem to be more common after product-market fit has been achieved — usually after a company has reached about $5 million to $10 million in revenue.</p>

<h2>How do you hire an early growth leader?</h2>
<p>According to responses from <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/">product benchmarks surveys</a>, growth teams have transitioned dramatically from reporting to marketing and sales to reporting directly to the CEO.</p>
<p>Some of the early writing on growth teams says that they can be structured individually as their own standalone team or as a SWAT model, where experts from various other departments in the organization converge on a regular cadence to solve for growth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186835" style="width: 987px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186835" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2186835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png" alt="Graph showing more growth teams now report to CEOs than marketing, sales or product" width="977" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png 977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenView Partners</p></div></p>
<p>My experience, and the <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/">data I’ve collected</a> from business-user focused software companies, has led me to the conclusion that growth teams in business software should not be structured as “SWAT” teams, with cross-functional leadership coming together to think critically about growth problems facing the business. I find that if problems don’t have a real owner, they’re not going to get solved. Growth issues are no different and are often deprioritized unless it’s someone’s job to think about them.</p>

<p>I put early growth hires into a few simple buckets. You’ve got:</p>
<p><strong>Product-minded growth experts:</strong> These folks are all about optimizing the user experience, reducing friction and expanding usage. They’re usually pretty analytical and might have product, data or MarketingOps backgrounds.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Brick-and-mortar stores forced to close due to pandemic lockdowns had to quickly pivot to an online-only model. Understandably, newcomers to the digital retail scene found themselves behind the curve in attracting online buyers, particularly in the face of popular established events like Amazon Prime Day. This year’s Prime Day, held June 21-22, was reportedly the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amazon-says-prime-day-delivered-two-biggest-days-ever-for-small-medium-sized-businesses-1030547652?op=1">biggest ever on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Online retailers that have opted to forge their own path to generate sales often wonder how they can compete with Amazon.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Amazon’s true unique selling proposition is its distribution network. Online retailers will not be able to compete on this point. Instead, it’s important to focus on areas where they can excel.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The reality is that Amazon’s true unique selling proposition is its distribution network. Online retailers will not be able to compete on this point because Amazon’s distribution network is so fast. Instead, it’s important to focus on areas where they can excel &#8212; without having to become a third-party seller on Amazon’s platform.</p>
<p>The following are seven key tips that are relevant for online retailers that want to attract and retain customers without having to partner with Amazon or to try to beat it at its own game.</p>
<h2>Gain a 360-degree view of the customer</h2>
<p>An online retailer needs to consider what kind of experience it wants to create; customers expect smooth processes on every step of their online shopping journey.</p>
<p>One idea is to implement a consumer data platform that will help the retailer gain the best insights into their customers: who they are and what they like, which websites they frequent and other relevant information. Retailers can use this data to then target customers with ads for products they’ll actually want to buy. Consumer data platforms can even help online retailers target consumers across platforms as well as in the store.</p>
<h2>Ensure smooth and glitch-free pre-sale transactions</h2>
<p>One of the biggest frustrations with online retailers is the performance of a website, from getting on the site through the closing of the sale. If something fails or glitches at any point in the process of searching for a product and paying for it, the customer will leave and not come back.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem involves a lot of testing of the user interface to ensure a good user experience. Tests should be done on all e-commerce segments on a site, including the basket and ad banners. By inserting tags along the customer journey, a retailer can track lost sales and see where problems happen on their website.</p>
<h2>Offer a broad variety of payment options</h2>
<p>As a payment option, PayPal recently experienced a record <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-posted-record-payment-volume-growth-q3-2020-2020-11?op=1">36% year-on-year growth in payment volume</a> between the third quarter of 2019 and Q3 2020. Despite PayPal’s popularity, Amazon does not accept it as a form of payment.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists are chatting this week about a recent piece from The Information titled “<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-end-of-venture-capital-as-we-know-it">The End of Venture Capital as We Know It</a>.” As with nearly everything you read, the article in question is a bit more nuanced than its headline. Its author, <a href="https://twitter.com/lessin">Sam Lessin</a>, makes some pretty good points. But I don’t fully agree with his conclusions, and want to talk about why.</p>
<p>This will be fun, and, because it’s Friday, both relaxed and cordial. (For fun, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIk2cw-VSOQ">long-ass podcast</a> I participated in with Lessin last year.)</p>
<h2>A capital explosion</h2>
<p>Lessin notes that venture capitalists once made risky wagers on companies that often withered away. Higher-than-average investment risk meant that returns from winning bets had to be very lucrative, or else the venture model would have failed.</p>
<p>Thus, venture capitalists sold their capital dearly to founders. The prices that venture capitalists have historically paid for startup equity in high-growth tech upstarts make IPO pops appear de minimis; it’s the VCs who make out like bandits when a tech company floats, not the bankers. The Wall Street crew just gets a final lap at the milk saucer.</p>
<p>Over time, however, things changed. Founders could lean on AWS instead of having to spend equity capital on server racks and colocation. The process of building software and taking it to market became better understood by more people.</p>
<p>Even more, recurring fees overtook the traditional method of selling software for a one-time price. This made the revenues of software companies less like those of video game companies, driven by episodic releases and dependent on the market’s reception of the next version of any particular product.</p>
<p>As SaaS took over, software revenues kept their lucrative gross margin profile but became both longer-lasting and more dependable. They got better. And easier to forecast to boot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, prices went up for software companies &#8212; public and private.</p>
<p>Another result of the revolution in both software construction and distribution &#8212; higher-level programming languages, smartphones, app stores, SaaS and, today, on-demand pricing coupled to API delivery &#8212; was that more money could pile into the companies busy writing code. Lower risk meant that other forms of capital found startup investing &#8212; super-late stage to begin with, but increasingly earlier in the startup lifecycle &#8212; not just possible, but rather attractive.</p>
<p>With more capital varieties taking interest in private tech companies thanks in part to reduced risk, pricing changed. Or, as Lessin puts it, thanks to better market ability to metricize startup opportunity and risk, “investors across the board [now] price [startups] more or less the same way.”</p>
<p>You can see where this is going: If that’s the case, then the model of selling expensive capital for huge upside becomes a bit soggy. If there is less risk, then venture capitalists can’t charge as much for their capital. Their return profile might change, with cheaper and more plentiful money chasing deals, leading to higher prices and lower returns.</p>
<p>The result of all of the above is Lessin’s lede: “All signs seem to indicate that by 2022, for the first time, nontraditional tech investors — including hedge funds, mutual funds and the like — will invest more in private tech companies than traditional Silicon Valley-style venture capitalists will.”</p>
<p>Capital crowding into the parts of finance once reserved for the high priests of venture means that the VCs of the world are finding themselves often fighting for deals with all sorts of new, and wealthier, players.</p>
<p>The result of this, per Lessin, is that venture “firms that grew up around software and internet investing and consider themselves venture capitalists&#8221; must &#8220;enter the bigger pond as a fairly small fish, or go find another small pond.”</p>
<h2>Yeah, but</h2>
<p>The obvious critique of Lessin’s argument is one that he makes himself, namely that what he is discussing is not as relevant to seed investing. As Lessin puts it, his argument’s impact on seed investing is “far less clear.”</p>
<p>Agreed. Sure, it&#8217;s the end of venture capital as we know it. But it&#8217;s not the end of venture capital, because if capitalism is going to continue, there&#8217;s always going to need to be risky-ass shit for VCs to bet on at the bottom.</p>
<p>The factors that made later-stage SaaS investing something that even idiots can make a few dollars doing become scarce the earlier one looks in the startup world. Investing in areas other than software compounds this effect; if you try to treat biotech startups as less risky than before simply because public clouds exist, you are going to fuck up.</p>
<p>So the Lessin argument matters less in seed-stage and earlier investing than it does in the later stages of startup backing, and doubly less when it comes to earlier investing in non-software companies.</p>
<p>While it’s a little-known fact, some venture capitalists still invest in startups that are not software-focused. Sure, nearly every startup involves code, but you can make a lot of money in a lot of ways by building startups, especially tech startups. The figuring-out of SaaS investing does not mean that investing in marketplaces, for example, has enjoyed a similar decline in risk.</p>
<p>So, the VCs-are-dead concept is less true for seed and non-software startups.</p>
<p>Is Lessin correct, then, that the game really has changed for middle- and late-stage software investing? Of course it has, but I think that he takes the concept of less risky, private-market software investing in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>First, even if private-market investing in software has a lower risk profile than before, it’s not zero. Many software startups will fail or stall out and sell for a modest sum at best. As many in today’s market as before? Probably not, but still some.</p>
<p>This means that the act of picking still matters; we can vamp as long as we’d like about how venture capitalists are going to have to pay more competitive prices for deals, but VCs could retain an edge in startup selection. This can limit downside, but may also do quite a lot more.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">Anshu Sharma</a> of <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/">Skyflow</a> &#8212; and formerly of Salesforce and Storm Ventures, where I first met him &#8212; made an argument about this particular point earlier this week with which I am sympathetic.</p>
<p>Sharma thinks, and I agree, that venture winners are getting bigger. Recall that a billion-dollar private company was once a rare thing. Now they are built daily. And the biggest software companies aren’t worth the few hundred billion dollars that Microsoft was largely valued at between 1998 and 2019. Today they are worth several trillion dollars.</p>
<p>More simply, a more attractive software market in terms of risk and value creation means that outliers are even more outlier-y than before. This means that venture capitalists that pick well, and, yes, go earlier than they once did, can still generate bonkers returns. Perhaps even more so than before.</p>
<p>This is what I am hearing about certain funds regarding their present-day performance. If Lessin’s point held up as strongly as he states it, I reckon that we’d see declining rates of return at top VCs. We’re not, at least based on what I am hearing. (Feel free to tell me if I am wrong.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XKJFMcqhly"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">The early-stage venture capital market is weird and chaotic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The early-stage venture capital market is weird and chaotic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/embed/#?secret=XKJFMcqhly" data-secret="XKJFMcqhly" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So yes, venture capital is changing, and the larger funds really are looking more and more like entirely different sorts of capital managers than the VCs of yore. Capitalism is happening to venture capital, changing it as the world of money itself evolves. Services were one way that VCs tried to differentiate from one another, and probably from non-venture capital sources, though that was discussed less when The Services Wars were taking off.</p>
<p>But even the rapid-fire Tiger can’t invest in every company, and not all its bets will pay out. You might decide that you’d be better off putting capital into a slightly smaller fund with a slightly more measured cadence of dealmaking, allowing selection at the hand of fund managers that you trust to allocate your funds among other pooled capital to bet for you. So that you might earn better-than-average returns.</p>
<p>You know, the venture model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">V2Food is one of many new contenders in the alternative protein space, founded in Australia but now setting its sights on Europe, Asia and beyond. It has a few key advantages over the competition, and with €45 million in new funding it may be finding its way to plates in the Eurozone soon.</p>
<p>The company has seen strong uptake in its home market, and the first goal is to be No. 1 in Australia, said CEO and founder Nick Hazell, formerly of MasterFoods and PepsiCo R&amp;D. But in the meantime they&#8217;ll be expanding their presence in Asia, where partner Burger King has launched a Whopper with their patty, and in Europe, where the product&#8217;s minimal suspicious elements come into play.</p>
<p>Currently v2Food makes plant-based ground beef and patties, sausages and a ready-made Bolognese sauce. Obviously they have strong competition in those categories, which are sort of the opening play of most alternative protein companies. But v2Food has a leg up on many of them in two ways.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186886" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186886" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg" alt="A package of v2Food's ground meat and someone cooking it in a kitchen." width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg 2072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=2048,1307 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> v2Food</p></div></p>
<p>First, v2Food products are made, or at least can be made, using &#8220;any standard meat production facility.&#8221; That&#8217;s a big plus for scaling and a minus for cost, since economies of scale are already in play. The processes for creating and mixing the plant-derived and other artificial substances that make up alternative proteins in general aren&#8217;t always amenable to existing infrastructure. This also opens the door to partnerships with existing meat companies that might have balked at having to switch processes. (Incidentally, Hazell noted that what they&#8217;re aiming for isn&#8217;t so much about replacing traditional meats so much as growing the market in a new direction, a philosophy those companies may appreciate.)</p>
<p>Second, as the press release announcing the fundraise puts it, &#8220;v2food products do not contain GMOs, preservatives, colors or flavorings. This makes it an ideal product for the European market, where the many large competitors have been unable to enter the market due to strict regulation.&#8221; It&#8217;s also a soft advantage for winning over in-store buyers vacillating between two plant-based options; who hasn&#8217;t on occasion ended up going for the one with fewer ingredients that proudly touts its lack of preservatives and such? The alt-protein buying demographic is likely especially sensitive to this consideration.</p>
<p>The €45 million round is a &#8220;B Plus,&#8221; led by European impact fund Astanor, with participation from Huaxing Growth Capitol Fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/">Main Sequence</a> and ABC World Asia. The money is going toward both R&amp;D and scaling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Founded by Australia&#8217;s national science agency, Main Sequence launches $250M AUD deep tech fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/embed/#?secret=1kfQqRZs0D" data-secret="1kfQqRZs0D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This funding is an important step towards v2food’s goal of transforming the way the world produces food,&#8221; said Hazell. &#8220;It’s imperative that we scale quickly because these global issues need immediate solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end a large portion will go toward simply creating enough product to meet demand. They&#8217;re also doubling R&amp;D spend to both accelerate new products and improve the existing ones. And rather than import the necessary ingredients to Australia, they&#8217;re exploring the possibility of building a local manufacturing facility there. With luck and a bit of plant-based elbow grease, the region could become a net exporter, propping up the local economy as well as building up v2Food&#8217;s resilience and cutting costs.</p>
<p>The Europe expansion is still a twinkle in the company&#8217;s (and Astanor&#8217;s) eye, for even with its simplicity and non-GMO origins, it&#8217;s not trivial to launch a new product in the European market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Michelle Davey&#8217;s pitch to Jordan Nof of Tusk Ventures about Wheel, a startup focused on providing a full suite of virtual care solutions to clinicians, was front-loaded with early metrics. It may not be standard practice to start with the numbers, especially early on, but she explained to us why she chose that strategy — and Nof told us why it worked.</p>
<p>Davey and Nof joined us on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live and went into detail on why Tusk was eager to finance Wheel, walking us through the startup&#8217;s Series A pitch deck and sharing which slides and bits clinched the deal.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a weekly virtual event series meant to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We sit down with investors and the founders they finance to hear what brought them together, what they saw in each other and how they work together moving forward. We also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where founders in the audience can pitch their startups to our outstanding speakers.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone live on Wednesdays at noon PDT, but the on-demand content is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. You can check out the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL library here</a>.</p>
<h2>When to lead with traction</h2>
<p>Davey emphasized the importance of not sticking to a rigid format for building a pitch deck. She said it&#8217;s important to instead focus on crafting your pitch around what makes you appealing and unique. That should be on the foreground and featured prominently.</p>
<p>For Wheel, that meant leading with traction, since the company had impressive uptake even early on. That remained true for their recent Series B raise, too.</p>

Just a few weeks ago, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velodyne Lidar, the sensor company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/">that went </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public a year ago when it merged with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">., reported its <a href="https://ir.velodynelidar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/velodyne-lidar-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results">second quarter earnings Thursday</a>, results that show a company spending more to find new customers for its products while grappling with an increasingly expensive internal drama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">Velodyne’s CEO Anand Gopalan resigned</a>, taking $8 million in equity compensation with him, according to the company&#8217;s second-quarter report. </span>At the time of Gopalan’s resignation, the company restated its business outlook for 2021 revenue, noting that its guidance of between $77 million and $94 million remained unchanged.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Earlier in the year, founder David Hall was removed as chairman of the board and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, lost her role of chief marketing officer following an investigation by the board into the couple for “inappropriate behavior.” The legal fees involved in this debacle set the company back $1.4 million this quarter, and $3.7 million for the first half of 2021, according to Velodyne CFO Drew Hamer.</span></p>
<p>The board&#8217;s fight with the Halls has escalated. In a May letter, David Hall blamed the SPAC, specifically the SPAC-appointed members of the combined company’s board, for its poor financial performance, and called for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal">resignation of Gopalan and two board members</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a call with investors Thursday, Hamer also said general and administrative expenses are expected to increase by about 35% in 2021 due to increased public company and legal expenses, meaning the struggle is not over. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first quarter to the second, there was already a 21% increase, from $17 million to $20.6 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;general and administrative expenses&#8221; category falls under the company’s broader operating expenses, which were $84.8 million this quarter, about double last quarter’s spend. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rising legal costs at the company are only part of its accelerating cost profile. The company is also investing heavily in growth, namely in sales and marketing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large majority of operating expenses were spent on sales and marketing. Velodyne spent $47.2 million in the second quarter, which is up massively from $7.1 million in the first quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, companies spend about 11.3% of their total revenue on marketing budgets, </span><a href="https://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/how-much-budget-for-online-marketing-in-2014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a 2020 CMO survey</span></a>, though that is a broad metric.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s important to note that the full impact of sales and marketing spend is never fully realized in the quarter in which that capital is put to work. In other words, we don&#8217;t know if Velodyne&#8217;s expanded Q2 sales and marketing spend has brought in more business.</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue eased between the first and second quarters, falling from $17.7 million to $13.6 million. For a company investing so heavily in sales to see revenue decline is not encouraging, even if the bulk of results stemming from Q2 spend may not show up until the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings report.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Velodyne is betting that its efforts will lead to accelerating sales in coming quarters. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it expects to make an additional $46 to $62 million revenue in the second half of the year due to an increase in demand for lidar products. While Q2’s total revenue was actually less than Q1’s, the company&#8217;s product-based revenue rose around 30%, which Hamer attributed to “renewed demand for lidar sensors from customers with delayed purchases due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our pipeline continues to grow,” said Hamer. “We had 213 projects on August 1, up from 198 projects at May 1&#8230;Included in the signed and awarded pipeline are new ADAS multiyear agreements, which we expect will begin to ramp starting in 2026.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamer estimated that through 2025, Velodyne has the opportunity for more than $1 billion in revenue from signed and awarded projects, plus a pipeline of projects that are not yet signed and awarded that could bring the company to $4.5 billion in potential revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of April,</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/faraday-future-signs-velodyne-exclusive-lidar-supplier-luxury-ev-2021-04-29/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Velodyne was selected by EV company Faraday Future</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an exclusive lidar supplier for its flagship luxury electric car FF 91, which is due to be launched next year. Faraday’s cars would use the Velarray H800 lidar sensors to power their autonomous driving system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velodyne has some other existing partnerships, but it faces steep competition in the automotive space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminar, for example, has deals with major OEMs like Volvo and Toyota, and it </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/luminar-buys-one-its-chip-suppliers-bolster-self-driving-car-sensor-2021-07-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently bought one of its chip suppliers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that it wouldn’t have to be held up like everyone else in the industry, including Velodyne, by the semiconductor shortage. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/china-lidar-hesai-300-million-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hesai is also seeing some traction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with customers like Lyft, Nuro, Bosch, Navya and Chinese robotaxi operators Baidu, WeRide and AutoX. </span></p>

<p>For instance, Ford, which had originally backed Velodyne, divested its stake in the company and placed its bets on Argo AI, which is supplying the automaker with its the autonomous vehicle technology. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/">Argo had upped its game by drastically improving its in-house lidar sensor</a>, meaning it would no longer need to rely on Velodyne. That had a ripple effect and impacted Veoneer, which had partnered with Velodyne to produce the lidar for Ford.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">High-quality UX for websites and apps is no longer a nice-to-have, it’s a must-have if a company is to succeed. But scaling the impact of UX teams is not simple, and in recent years teams have turned to what’s know as DesignOps platforms to help them.</p>
<p>Now, a new startup hopes to become a key DesignOps platform for UX teams, and has raised money to help it, in turn, scale-up.</p>
<p><a href="http://zeroheight.com">Zeroheight</a> has now raised a $10 million Series A funding round led by Tribe Capital, with participation from Adobe, Y Combinator, FundersClub and Expa, as well as angel investors including Tom Preston-Werner (co-founder of GitHub), Bradley Horowitz (VP Product at Google), Irene Au (built and ran UX design for Google) and Nick Caldwell (VP Engineering at Twitter).</p>
<p>London-based zeroheight will now expand to the San Francisco/Bay Area, and grow the team across the board. Its focus so far has been on UX documentation, but it will now also explore other areas such as closing the gap between design and development.</p>
<p>Co-founder Jerome de Lafargue said: “zeroheight does for UX what DevOps platforms like GitHub do for building and shipping code, providing a central place to document and manage UX components, coupled with design APIs that allow teams to skip the design hand-off stage entirely and speed up the UX delivery process.”</p>
<p>He said the company addresses the scaling problem for UX teams: “Problems have emerged because UX teams have grown dramatically in the past few years, because UX is now so important for most companies to just compete. And so because of this you now need centralization, you need components that are reusable so that teams can be efficient and not lose quality as it keeps shipping.”</p>
<p>Zeroheight counts several Fortune 500 companies like Adobe and United Airlines as customers among its 1,300+ customer base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The players in the space that we can name and track are generally cash-rich and market-sentiment poor.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hippo began to trade earlier this week after completing its SPAC combination. The home-focused U.S. neoinsurance provider initially stuck close to its $10 per-share pre-combination price before plummeting yesterday during regular trading.</p>
<p>But Hippo&#8217;s declines don&#8217;t appear to be of its own doing. Lemonade, another U.S. neoinsurance player — albeit one more focused on rental coverage — posted slightly <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3725469-lemonade-eps-in-line-beats-on-revenue">better-than-expected Q2 results</a> earlier in the week. After its report, Lemonade&#8217;s value dropped sharply, and it appears it dragged Hippo down with it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The trading volatility is interesting on its own, but what matters more is that the drop in the value of several neoinsurance companies is part of a larger trend. This week&#8217;s declines are not incredibly surprising — the market has negatively repriced tech-enabled insurance providers in recent quarters, which can be an uncomfortable situation for a category that previously basked in warm attention from public investors.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we&#8217;d typically riff on the new values of public neoinsurance companies and use that data to work our way into a guess concerning what the price declines might mean for related startups. Taking public-market data and using it to better understand private markets is pretty much the national pastime of this column.</p>
<p>Not today. Instead, we&#8217;re going to look into an interesting dynamic among neoinsurance companies that may matter a bit more for our comprehension of the private markets. Namely that the players in the space that we can name and track are generally cash-rich and market-sentiment poor.</p>
<p>Public markets are cutting the value of neoinsurance stocks, but the companies behind the valuation declines are rather wealthy. This makes their enterprise values smaller than you might guess from a quick glance at their market cap figures. But do Lemonade or Hippo really care if the stock market decides from one quarter to the next that their businesses are worth plus or minus 10%? Do they have enough cash to pursue their long-term visions, regardless?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack all the numbers, discuss an interview The Exchange held with Hippo CEO Assaf Wand earlier in the week and consider what Lemonade had to say during its earnings call.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As startups in Africa continue to grow and raise money at a ridiculous pace, so too will their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cap tables expand. Most African startups&#8217; bulk of VC money is from foreign investors, making it imperative for African startups to incorporate abroad, especially in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processes for incorporation are quite complicated, and even though most founders still get the hang of it, they risk the chance of messing up their cap tables. For instance, some Nigerian startups are guilty of issuing preferred shares in naira and then canceling to issue dollar-denominated SAFEs when they get incorporated in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raise, a startup building Africa&#8217;s Carta is tackling these challenges and has received backing from 500 Startups to scale its technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Marvin Coleby, Tina Nyamache and Eugene Mutai set out to create a blockchain solution that would make it easier for people to buy and sell shares in pre-IPO companies in Africa. After running several iterations, they found out that most companies still struggled with the concept of equity and liquidity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They spent money managing corporate structures for holding companies in Delaware, Canada, and Europe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintained paper-based subsidiaries across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Coleby, most of the equity across Africa is still stored, tracked and updated using paper certificates, manual processes and fragmented government databases. This raises transaction costs to manage subsidiaries and issue employee stock options. It also inflates costs to enter and exit positions in private and public companies.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186529" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186529" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2186529" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?w=680" alt="Raise" width="680" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9DAD789B-AE6F-4362-A23A-F5409C4E3435.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186529" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Raise</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they started Raise to help startups, investors, employees, and law firms manage deals, cap tables and corporate compliance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, Raise customers can also automate due diligence, set valuations, track employee stock vesting and make routine documentation for licenses and government documents in Nigeria and Kenya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Raise launched in 2019, it was in private beta and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was backed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Binance Labs, the sole investor in its pre-seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since proceeding to a public beta in 2020, Raise has onboarded customers like <a href="https://www.getraise.io/post/announcing-our-partnership-with-adili">Anjarwalla &amp; Khanna, Africa’s largest law firm</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; startups Bamboo, Workpay and Mono; and VC firms like Microtraction and Chrysalis Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the long-term problem Raise is trying to solve is liquidity, Coleby tells TechCrunch on a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything we do is to find a way to make it easier for founders, customers, employees, investors to get liquidity from investing in companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Companies are raising money, people are investing, and employees are getting stock options. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are only one or two exits now and then. That&#8217;s because we build with the Silicon Valley model where we have to grow, scale until we get some big exit. From our perspective, liquidity doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. It can be small little pieces of liquidity that employees and investors get over time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that measure, Africa’s capital markets for private and public companies are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">painfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illiquid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It takes several months or years to buy or sell equity, and, according to Raise, over $1 trillion of stock in Africa is &#8220;illiquid, paper-based and priced in inflationary currencies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian stock trading platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/nigerian-investment-platform-chaka-secures-1-5m-pre-seed-after-bagging-countrys-first-sec-license/">Chaka</a>, Bamboo and Trove help Nigerians create liquidity for assets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internationally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Raise aims to build the platform behind them to streamline more asset classes and investment opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that&#8217;s still in the works, Raise organizes ownership data for African companies and makes them accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a similar play to what Carta, a $3 billion company offering cap table software, does for U.S. companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, onboarding cap tables and equity data will also open up use cases for Carta to become a blockchain-based digital asset platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The plan is to become more like Africa’s Nasdaq for private companies as i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t hopes to sell indexes, ETFs, futures, and assets for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coleby says in that way, Raise will become an equity engine for processing Africa’s hundreds of billion dollars of trade and securities volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coleby says the number of companies going live is increasing 60% month-on-month. The platform manages about 200 cap tables with assets worth more than $400 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next phase of growth, according to Coleby, will be onboarding Series A and growth-stage companies onto the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is active in Nigeria and Kenya. Coleby says a seed round is in the works to continue growing deeper into those markets and experiment with funding and liquidity operations across the African VC space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Raise is building a marketplace that continues connecting and educating investors, employees, and founders in one platform with their law firms to use trusted and verified data to do deals and issue stock options to employees.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Foldables! Two, probably! Those are your headliners. Samsung tipped its hand with the event invite, which features a pair of geometrical objects that pretty clearly represent the new Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip.</p>
<p>The other headliner is what we won’t be seeing at the event (Deadliner? Endliner?). The company already confirmed via corporate blog that we won’t be seeing the next version of the Galaxy Note next week. That’s a big break from the device’s long-standing annual refresh cycle.</p>
<p>We still don’t know if this is the end-end of the line for the phablet. Samsung told TechCrunch, “We will not be launching new Galaxy Note devices in 2021. Instead, Samsung plans to continue to expand the Note experience and bring many of its popular productivity and creativity features, including the S Pen, across our Galaxy ecosystem. We will share more details on our future portfolio once we are ready to announce.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186428" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186428" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2186428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samsung-Unpacked-Invitation.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Rumors surfaced prior to this revelation that the company may have been forced to put the device on hold, as global supply chain issues continue to hamstring manufacturers. There’s also an argument to be made, however, that Samsung has gradually made the Note redundant over the past several Galaxy S updates.</p>
<p>It seems telling that the company referred to a forthcoming “flagship” in its official Unpacked copy. With the Note out of the picture and the Galaxy S about six months out from a refresh, this appears to refer to the Galaxy Fold gaining the (admittedly ceremonial) title. Whether that means two or three flagships in the company’s Armada remains to be seen.</p>
<p>What we do know, however, is that &#8212; like the Galaxy S before it &#8212; at least one of the forthcoming foldables will be blurring that Note line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I hope you’ll join us as we debut our next Galaxy Z family and share some foldable surprises — including the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones,” the company’s president and head of Mobile Communications Business, TM Roh wrote. The executive also promised “even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger material” on the new Galaxy Z Flip.</p>
<p>Previous &#8212; and subsequent &#8212; leaks have given us good looks at both the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3. Hell, it wouldn’t be a Samsung event if pretty much everything didn’t leak out prior to the event.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Evan (@evleaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1422375304543326211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A series of tweets from EVLeaks has given us nearly every angle of the upcoming foldable smartphones, along with (European) prices that put the Fold and Flip starting at €1,899 and €1,099, respectively. Both mark a sizable decrease from the previous generation. That’s nice &#8212; if not entirely surprising. Samsung’s plan all along has clearly been a prolonged drop in pricing as foldable technology scaled. We’re still a long ways away from cheap here, but perhaps nudging our way toward the realm of possibility for more users.</p>
<p>Other leaked details for the Fold/Flip include a 7.6/6.7-inch internal display, a Snapdragon 888 processor (both) and 12MP triple/dual cameras, respectively. Interestingly, water resistance is also reportedly on board here.</p>
<p>With a year of virtual events under its belt, the company seems to have a better idea of pacing. Samsung &#8212; along with many other companies in the space &#8212; took liberties when events went more from in-person to online, meting out announcements event by event. Thankfully, next week’s Unpacked is a much bigger, self-contained event.</p>
<p>The other expected highlights are both wearables. First is the long-awaited fruits of the partnership between Samsung and Google that was announced at I/O. We didn’t get a lot of info at the time, beyond the fact that it will potentially be a boon for users and developers, with the ability to jointly create apps for both the beleaguered Wear OS and Samsung’s custom brand of Tizen.</p>

<p>“Samsung and Google have a long history of collaboration, and whenever we’ve worked together, the experience for our consumers has been dramatically better for everyone,” Google SVP Sameer Samat said at a June follow-up to the I/O news. “That certainly holds true for this new, unified platform, which will be rolling out for the first time on Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch. In collaboration with Samsung, we’re thrilled to bring longer battery life, faster performance and a wide range of apps, including many from Google to a whole new wearable experience.”</p>
<p>The company held an (admittedly disappointing) event at MWC focused on the forthcoming watch. There was, however, one key thing missing: the watch. Based on pure speculation, I’d suggest that the wearable just didn’t come together on the timeline Samsung was expecting, but the company went ahead and did a virtual presser at the (mostly virtual) trade show.</p>
<p>The company did, however, announced One UI Watch &#8212; a wearable version of its streamlined OS interface. Samsung notes in a press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>One UI Watch together with the new unified platform will create an entirely new Galaxy Watch experience. As part of the new experience, once you install watch-compatible apps on your smartphone, they will be swiftly downloaded onto your smartwatch. If you’ve customized your clock app on your phone to show the time in different cities around the globe, this will be automatically reflected on your watch as well. And if you block calls and messages from your watch, they will now be blocked on your smartphone, too.</p></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Leaks have also revealed the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic models along with (again) European pricing. They’re reportedly set to start at €279 and €379, respectively, with each featuring multiple sizing options. That last bit was always a sticking point for me with Samsung watches, which have traditionally been fairly massive, knocking out a good number of potential buyers in the process.</p>
<p>The last big piece of the puzzle are the Galaxy Buds 2. The latest upgrade to the company’s entry-level buds are said to be gaining active noise canceling.</p>
<p>Will there be surprises once things kick off at <strong>7AM PT</strong>/<strong>10AM ET on August 11</strong>? Little, ones, probably. These leaks have a tendency to capture things in broad strokes but miss some of the key nuances in the process. And while the company is more than a little familiar with pre-show leaks, it’s still managed to surprise us in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4B2_dfvRZ4M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>SpaceX has achieved another major milestone in its Starship fully reusable launch system: It stacked the Starship spacecraft itself on top of a prototype of its Super Heavy booster, which itself is loaded up with a full complement of 29 Raptor rocket engines, and the Starship on top has six itself. The stacked spacecraft now represents the tallest assembled rocket ever developed in history.</p>
<p>This stacking, which happened at SpaceX&#8217;s development site in south Texas, is a significant development because it&#8217;s the first time the two elements of the full Starship system have been united as one. This is the configuration that will be used for launching the next Starship prototype on its test mission that will hopefully achieve orbit.</p>
<p>Taken together, the massive combined launch system reaches nearly 400 feet tall (around 390 feet, to be more precise), and combined with the orbital launch stand on which it rests, the whole thing is about 475 feet high, which is taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>
<p>The stacking itself is impressive, but don&#8217;t expect it to last: The likely next step is for the two halves of the launch system to be separated again, with both undergoing more work, analysis and testing ahead of a reassembly in preparation for the actual eventual orbital launch test.</p>
<p>As for when the orbital launch test will actually take place, it&#8217;s not currently clear. The disassembly, testing and reassembly will take some time, but the company is definitely still aiming to make that happen before end of year.</p>
<p><em>Stream above from <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com">NASASpaceflight.</a></em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Updated: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed more details about what&#8217;s next for the Starship system after the two halves are separated. In a tweet, he said that next up for the system will be adding the final heat shield tiles on the Starship spacecraft – a task that is around 98% complete, he added <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423674865626730500">in a tweet</a>. The other items on the to-do list are adding thermal protection to booster engines, ground propellant storage tanks, and a QD arm for the ship.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not all SpaceX needs to do to get Starship flight-ready: receiving a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. That can&#8217;t happen until the regulator has completed an environmental assessment, a process that could take months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Austin-based company’s technology creates an infrastructure for healthcare provider data management that puts providers at the center.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/austin-based-verifiable-raises-3-million-for-its-api-toolkit-to-verify-healthcare-credentials/">$3 million seed round</a>, <a href="https://verifiable.com/">Verifiable</a> snapped up another $17 million for its healthcare provider credentialing API toolkit.</p>
<p>The Austin-based company’s technology creates an infrastructure for healthcare provider data management that puts providers at the center. Verifiable founder Nick Macario told TechCrunch that data fuels critical operations across health systems and insurance carriers, like contracting, credentialing, enrollment, claims and directories. All of this is being done manually now, and often inaccurately, which is leading to billions of dollars of annual waste.</p>
<p>Verifiable’s infrastructure manages healthcare providers and automates the verification of provider data, enabling automation of business processes like credentialing, payer enrollment and network management for virtual healthcare platforms, health systems and insurance payers. It is able to reduce credentialing turnaround times by over 70%, Macario said.</p>
<p>Insurance payers is the newest part of the company’s expansion that includes verifying provider directories. For example, the information that pops up when someone performs an in-network search on their healthcare plan’s website to find a certain provider in their area.</p>

Tiger Global and existing investors also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Macario was also planning to raise another round of funding, but he said the combination of an inflection point with the product and Jack Altman’s continued investment interest made it a good time to start scaling the team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Altman said the general space of healthcare technology has potential. It is also a topic near to him &#8212; his wife is a nurse. He was speaking to her about what Verifiable was working on, and she told him that there are still teams of people doing this.</p>
<p>“So much data is flowing through, and because healthcare is such a massive part of the country’s GDP, there is so much potential that can be unlocked,” Altman added. “I love Verifiable’s positioning around the provider. They are the people between the healthcare system and the patient, so to have access to their data, patients can form a relationship with them, which is a powerful position.”</p>
<p>In addition to expanding into insurance payers, Macario intends to use the new funding to double his team of 26 employees by the end of the year. The company has openings for engineers, operations and go-to-market talent.</p>
<p>Verifiable works with companies like Lyra Health, Talkspace, Modern Health, Headway, Wheel, Quartet Health, Forward and provider networks to automate credentialing, compliance processes and provider operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verifiable&#8217;s infrastructure has verified hundreds of thousands of providers and we plan to continue to double down on providers, use cases and payers,&#8221; Macario said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston go-to-market venture capital firm <a href="http://www.stage2.capital">Stage 2 Capital</a> kicks off its second fund with plans to invest $80 million into B2B software companies.</p>
<p>The firm’s approach combines venture capital expertise with a diverse community of over 250 limited partners and go-to-market experts who work with portfolio companies to accelerate revenue growth.</p>
<p>Firm co-founders Jay Po, a former investor at Bessemer Venture Partners, and Mark Roberge, former chief revenue officer at HubSpot, started Stage 2 Capital in 2018.</p>
<p>While at Bessemer, Po told TechCrunch he met startup founders who were not sure how to scale revenue or build a sustainable sales machine. He saw how big the skills gap was in go-to-market (GtM), so on nights and weekends he took classes on sales development to better understand what was going on.</p>
<p>At the same time, Roberge was on faculty at Harvard Business School and was consulting startups. He, too, saw founders struggle to build out their GtM function, so much so that gathered a bunch of data points and put them all together in a book, “The Sales Acceleration Formula: Using Data, Technology and Inbound Selling to go from $0 to $100 million.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186484" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186484" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186484" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png 3284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=1536,871 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=2048,1161 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Team-Photo.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186484" class="wp-caption-text">Stage 2 Capital team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stage 2 Capital</p></div></p>
<p>Po said the firm “was virtual before it was cool,” which is how it has been able to invest in diverse geographies and set its own pace in terms of curating its network and making introductions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their goal is to educate startups on the right time to scale. While startups should be growing 100% or 200%, many startups scale prematurely because they see certain companies experience massive growth all at once and assume that is the way to do it, Roberge said.</p>
<p>“We find companies jump into that set of goals prematurely and are not ready for it,” he added. “We help them to understand when and how fast they can go. They are often looking at that prior success, but are not appreciating the context, like who the other company was selling to and the environment at that time.”</p>
<p>Po and Roberge launched their first fund in 2018, raising $15 million, and ended up making 11 investments in late-seed stage to Series A companies and amassed a network of 97 LPs from companies like Gong, Procore, Atlassian, Asana and Drift. The firm wants to assist companies in changing the world, but Roberge said that will take a while, and that peers were impressed with the early signals of the investment thesis.</p>
<p>Investments from the first fund include companies hailing from across the United States, including Sendoso, Ocrolus, Gosite and Reibus.</p>
<p>“Stage 2 Capital stands out from all other VCs because of the expertise and partnership Jay, Mark and the LPs bring,” said Kris Rudeegraap, founder and CEO of Sendoso, in a written statement. “They’ve exceeded expectations on delivering what they promised and we’ve increased our revenue almost 10 times in the short time since they invested.”</p>
<p>The firm’s second fund represents a five-time increase in investment capital, Po said. He expects to be able to invest in another 20 companies with an average check size of $2 to $3 million. The pair have already made seven investments so far, including DeepScribe, Arcade, QuotaPath and Sales Impact Academy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.K.-based open banking bulk payment startup <a href="http://usecomma.com">Comma</a> has raised £4.34 million ($6 million) in a seed round of funding led by Octopus Ventures and Connect Ventures. They were joined by investors Village Global, and the founders of Wagestream, Peter Briffett and Portman Wills.</p>
<p>The company says it enables small and micro businesses to bulk-pay bills, salaries and taxes using existing high street small business bank accounts, saving them a lot of time and money in administration. This is because BACS is difficult to obtain and costly, and virtual accounts require KYC to set up and add complexity to bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Comma says that during the pandemic there was a large increase in outsourced financial operations. The availability of open banking bulk payment APIs from several of the high street banks made the product possible, which led to the startup picking up a great deal more business.</p>
<p>The Comma app connects to accounting systems (Xero, QuickBooks, Sage) and allows a business or their accountant to enter and manage supplier bank details without needing bank access. They can pay between 15-50 payees at once and the system posts payments against bills back to the accounting system to mark what has been paid.</p>
<p>Founder Tom Beckenham said: “I worked as COO of a business that was billing across continents and paying hundreds of staff. It was a very manual process. It occurred to me that larger businesses had corporate banking and systems that managed payments. Small businesses did not and were largely ignored. I noticed that traditional methods of solving the problem for small businesses had high setup costs &#8212; eliminating most of the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he saw an opportunity to use new open banking technology to get to this long tail of businesses and solve payments holistically: &#8220;We have just got past the £1,000,000 in payments so far. We will get to £1 million per week by the end of the quarter.”</p>
<p>In the U.K. the startup competes to some extent with Credec, Telleroo and BACS bureaus such as ADP. Internationally, Melio in the U.S. is the closest comparison. Libeo in France is also offering something similar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past decade, Nigeria has seen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies cater to the development and growth of software engineers and tech talent in general. It&#8217;s a space many in the Nigerian ecosystem like to think is budding yet overcrowded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chikanwobi">Chika Nwobi</a> started <a href="https://decagonhq.com/internationalfellowship/">Decagon</a> in 2018, the perception was generally &#8220;here comes another tech talent accelerator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years on, the entrepreneur who is a household name has significantly scaled the company to new heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Decagon is announcing its $1.5 million seed round and a student loan financing facility of $25 million from Nigerian financial institution Sterling Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a serial founder, Nwobi ran a couple of tech businesses, most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile internet company MTech in the early 2000s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With Decagon, Nwobi is charting new territory in the fast-paced startup world after years of investing via his seed-stage firm called L5Lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nwobi says Decagon aims to address the underrepresentation of black people in tech globally, starting with Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West African country is the most populous on the continent and the most populous black nation globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dire need for tech talent in Nigeria has become more evident these days, where startups are raising venture capital at a ridiculous pace. Youth unemployment in the country is at a staggering 50%, and while tech has presented an avenue to create jobs, supply isn&#8217;t catching up with demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more worrisome is the fact that the country&#8217;s best talents are leaving in droves to foreign companies in the U.S, Canada, the U.K., and Germany</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the issue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is supply. If supply </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is fixed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, everyone is happy. That&#8217;s what Decagon hopes for by training and connecting engineers to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remotely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with both local and international companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Microsoft, Facebook and Google have all invested in building engineering offices in Nigeria, but most other companies can&#8217;t afford to do that, so we help them access top talent to work as remote engineers,” Nwobi said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decagon runs a six-month software engineering program and selects its candidates based on merit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a paid program, and the software engineers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pay about N2 million (~$4,000) tuition to get in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the company employs an income-sharing model when the engineers find work and start earning upon graduation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if the trainees can not afford the program in the first place? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student loan financing takes care of that, and students who take that option are expected to repay N3 million (~$6,000) in the space of three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be the first to create such merit-based loan financing for students in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing is in partnership with the financier Sterling Bank and Nigeria&#8217;s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It allows Decagon to offer a Pay-After-Learning plan that provides the trainees with laptops, accommodation, internet, meal allowance and a stipend. No upfront payment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decagon says while more than 80,000 people have applied to partake in its program, it has accepted only 440 candidates. That&#8217;s a 0.55% acceptance rate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nwobi discloses three figures to show the company is on the right track: the company has recorded a 100% placement rate for its trainees, a 100% loan repayment rate, and a 410% salary increment made by its software engineers after getting placement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global tech talent company Andela employed this model before pivoting, and while it didn&#8217;t work for them, it seems to be working for Decagon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason is likely because Andela used equity financing to carry out these operations, whereas Decagon uses debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obinna Ukachukwu, the divisional head of Sterling Bank, commenting on the student loan financing, said, “We got involved to support alternative education by providing loans for Nigerian students complemented with financial literacy training. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the excellent performance of the current portfolio, it made sense to scale our support to Decagon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its equity financing, Decagon raised money from Kepple Africa and Timon Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some angel investors like Paul Kokoricha, managing partner of the private equity business of ACA, and Tokyo-based UNITED Inc., also took part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nwobi says Decagon operates at the intersection of edtech, fintech and the future of work, and the funds will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its efforts on the three fronts. The company will also be looking to deepen gender inclusion by increasing female participation in its cohorts from 25% (its current stats) to 50% in the next three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO adds that the company which he refers to as a &#8220;tech talent catalyst&#8221; is profitable and growing at 500% per annum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We see this capital as fuel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our mission to transform exceptional people, often from under-represented backgrounds, into world-class engineers by connecting them with financing, in-demand skills and their dream jobs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re thrilled to work with Decagon to build up the top 0.5% of vetted engineering talent in Africa and help connect them to global tech opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The frequency of engineering leaders from US and European companies in our network ask about sourcing African and Nigerian technical talent has increased at a rapid clip, and we&#8217;re excited to lean into that and help Decagon on their mission,” partner at Timon Capital, Chris Muscarella, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decagon&#8217;s raise comes when there is general skepticism about the viability of tech talent accelerators on the continent despite their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Andela changed its model, it was a clear market leader with over $180 million in its arsenal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it’s pivot, funding has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stalled for most of these companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Decagon&#8217;s student loan financing method will be the new trendsetter in a space that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">desperately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs investment to solve Africa&#8217;s talent problem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian online learning platform Vedantu is not engaging to sell the firm to edtech giant Byju&#8217;s, a top executive said on Friday.</p>
<p>A report by Indian news outlet Entrackr <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/08/exclusive-byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-vedantu-for-800-mn/">said</a> early Friday that Byju&#8217;s had offered $700 million to $800 million to acquire Bangalore-based Vedantu, which counts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/indian-online-tutoring-platform-vedantu-raises-100-million/">Accel and GGV Capital among its investors</a>.</p>
<p>In a conversation with TechCrunch, Vedantu co-founder and chief executive Vamsi Krishna said any speculation around the firm engaging with Byju&#8217;s for an acquisition or merger is &#8220;absolutely 100% inaccurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s, which has acquired over half a dozen startups this year, declined to comment.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s most valuable startup, Byju&#8217;s, has held conversations with multiple education firms in recent quarters as the Bangalore-headquartered giant looks to expand its footprint and broaden its product offerings &#8212; by both organic and inorganic means.</p>
<p>The startup did reach out to both Unacademy and Vedantu last year and offered them both roughly $1 billion each, according to four people familiar with the matter. But Byju&#8217;s and Vedantu haven&#8217;t re-engaged this year, one of them said.</p>

<p>Vedantu is separately in advanced stages to close a new financing round that would value it at over $1 billion, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The round is expected to close within weeks, they said.</p>
<p>Scores of young startups have cropped up in recent years to tap the education market in India, where more than 200 million individuals go to schools. Vedantu, Unacademy and Byju&#8217;s lead the market, and younger firms including Teachmint and Classplus have reported accelerated growth in recent quarters as more students adopt online learning platforms in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s K-12 education market is expected to grow 2.5x and expand to $120 billion by 2025, analysts at Bernstein said in a report to clients last week. &#8220;Online K-12 education is expected to grow 7x by 2025, reach $5 billion market driven by the strong growth in user base, increase in online penetration and expanding product offerings,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
