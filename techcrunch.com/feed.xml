										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Neobrokers &#8212; startups that are disrupting the investment industry by providing a platform for a wider range of consumers to partake in the stock market by offering them more incremental investment options and modern and easy mobile-based interfaces to manage their money &#8212; continue to see a huge amount of interest, and today comes the latest development in that story.</p>
<p><a href="https://uk.scalable.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uk.scalable.capital/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623300713883000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2tHF2ywqHE2sm1ekwO3WNP8qNZQ">Scalable Capital</a>, a Munich/Berlin startup that provides tools to monitor and manage portfolios for those investing in shares, manage trades and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange traded funds</a> for a flat fee of €2.99 per month, has raised over $180 million (around €150 million) to expand its business. The company confirmed to us that the investment, a Series E being led by China&#8217;s Tencent, is being done at a $1.4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>This is a huge jump &#8212; a lot of scaling, as it were &#8212; for Scalable Capital. It was only in July 2020, less than a year ago, that the startup raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/scalable-capital-raises-58m-at-a-460m-valuation-for-its-robo-investment-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series D of $58 million</a> at a $460 million valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Previous investors, including BlackRock, HV Holtzbrinck Ventures and Tengelmann Ventures, also participated in this round. The company, founded in 2014 but commercially launched in 2016, has now raised more than $320 million in equity funding.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the rapid fundraising is to strike while the iron is hot, and to give the startup some more fuel to grow at a time when other neobrokers are also seeing a lot of activity.</p>
<p>Scalable Capital itself now has 250,000 customers across Austria, Germany and the UK, more than three times the 80,000 it had back in July. At the same time, assets under management have ballooned to $5 billion (versus $2 billion in that last round). In another interesting turn, Scalable is also building out a business as a neobroker partner to many established banks, too, with the list of high-street names including ING, the British Barclays Bank, Siemens Private Finance, the digital subsidiary of the Santander Group Openbank, Oskar GmbH, and Targobank.</p>
<p>But while Scalable will be using some of the funding to continue expanding on the continent, it also seems that its UK business is no longer accepting new customers, We are asking whether that is temporary and Brexit-related, or another reason and will update when we have an answer.</p>
<p>Altogether, Scalable said that some 1,500 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) available on the platform (these are the most popular vehicle: more than half of the assets on the platform invested in these). It also provides access to invest across some 4,000 different shares and 2,000 funds. All of these are set to grow, along with potentially launching new products, too.</p>
<p>“We see huge demand to invest money in the capital markets instead of leaving it in bank accounts. This comes against a backdrop of record-low interest rates, growing inflation and a widening pension gap”, says Florian Prucker, co-CEO and co-founder of Scalable Capital, in a statement. “Our clients can access fully managed globally diversified ETF portfolios and – in the same app – self directed trading in shares, ETFs, crypto currencies and funds. We also provide a market-leading offering of ETF, stocks and crypto monthly savings plans. We are planning to launch derivatives trading next. We will continue on our mission to make everyone an investor”.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company is also bulking up at a time when others in the same space are doubling down, too. Last month, Trade Republic &#8212; another neobroker from Germany &#8212; announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $900 million investment at a $5 billion valuation</a> led by Sequoia. Other big European players that have also recently raised big expansion rounds include Amsterdam&#8217;s Bux (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/bux-a-european-robinhood-raises-80m-to-expand-its-neo-broker-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million in April</a>) and Vienna-based Bitpanda (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/neobroker-bitpanda-raises-170m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-take-its-trading-platform-beyond-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$170 million in March</a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tencent also led that last round for Bux, a part of its bigger investment efforts both in fintech and in the region. Other big bets in Fintech have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/greeces-viva-wallet-raises-80m-for-its-neo-bank-targeting-small-business-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet in Greece</a>; Nubank in Brazil, which yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also announced a big round</a>; N26; and Futu, a Nasdaq-listed Chinese neo-broker. It also has built out an extensive gaming empire with a string of major acquisitions, including Supercell.</p>
<p>“Tencent complements our existing long-term partners who already represent an international investor base. Our recent funding is a major step forward on our way to becoming the leading retail investment platform in Europe. The strong acceleration of our growth further validates our mission to empower investors”, says Erik Podzuweit, co-CEO and co-founder of Scalable Capital, in a statement. “Anyone thinking of investing money should think of Scalable Capital. Whether you want to invest yourself via our broker or want our wealth management solutions to do it for you.”</p>
<p>The fintech interest is particularly notable also given that Tencent is also the parent of China&#8217;s messaging behemoth WeChat, which has also made huge inroads among consumers around a range of financial services.</p>
<p>“Demand for accessible solutions of personal investing is increasing in European markets, particularly among millennials. Scalable Capital excels in offering its customers a convenient and cost-efficient investing experience. We are delighted to be an investor and participate in Scalable Capital’s growth”, says Danying Ma, Managing Director of Tencent Investment, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every startup is trying to fix something but Terraformation is tackling the only problem that must matter to all of us: Climate change.</p>
<p>This is why it&#8217;s in such a big huge hurry. Its mission &#8212; as a &#8216;forest tech&#8217; startup &#8212; is to accelerate tree planting by applying a startup-y operational philosophy of scalability to the pressing task of rapidly, sustainably reforesting denuded landscapes &#8212; bringing back native trees species to revive former wastelands and shrinking our carbon emissions in the process.</p>
<p>Forests are natural carbon sinks. The problem is we just don&#8217;t have enough trees with roots in the ground to offset our emissions. So that at least means the mission is simple: Plant more trees, and plant more trees <em>fast</em>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terraformation&#8217;s goal is to restore three billion acres of global native forest ecosystems by scaling tree replanting projects in parallel, scaling the use of existing techniques, and working with all the partners it can. (For a little context, the U.S. contains some 2.27BN acres of total land area, per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands#:~:text=The%20federal%20government%20owns%20about,area%20of%202.27%20billion%20acres.">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>So far it says it&#8217;s planted &#8220;thousands&#8221; of trees &#8212; with live projects in North America, South America, Africa and Europe which it hopes will yield up to 20,000 replanted acres. It&#8217;s also in talks with partners about more projects that could clad hundreds of thousands of acres with carbon-consuming (and biodiversity-prompting) trees, if they come to full fruition.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still a long way off the 3BN-acre-wooded moonshot, of course. But Terraformation claims it&#8217;s been able to achieve a forestry restoration work-rate that&#8217;s 5x the average already. And that&#8217;s definitely the kind of &#8216;gas stepping&#8217; that climate change needs.</p>
<p>Its elevator pitch is also punchy: &#8220;Our mission is explicitly to solve climate change through mass reforestation,&#8221; says founder<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Yishan Wong &#8212; whose name may be familiar as the ex-Reddit CEO (and also a former early-stage engineer at PayPal/Facebook). </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span>So it&#8217;s getting trees in the ground and getting faster at getting trees in the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s not going it alone, either. It&#8217;s just announced a first closing of a $30 million Series A funding round, </span>led by Sam &amp; Max Altman at Apollo Projects, the brothers&#8217; &#8216;moonshot&#8217; fund; plus several high-profile institutional investors (whose names aren&#8217;t being disclosed); along with nearly 100 angel investors, including Sundeep Ahuja, Lachy Groom, Sahil Lavingia, Joe Lonsdale, Susan Wu, and OVN Cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [Series A] was a bit larger than we anticipated and the idea is to get us to the next stage of planting orders of magnitude more trees every year,&#8221; says<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Wong. &#8220;</span>So it&#8217;ll be used both for supporting forestry projects directly, as well as for the development and deployment of forestry acceleration products and technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very, very nice thing about mass reforestation or mass restoration as a solution to climate change is that it&#8217;s extremely parallelizable,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;You can plant any tree at the same time as your planting some other tree. This is the primary reason why this solution can potentially be implemented within the timetable that we have left. But in order to do so we have to start and drive an enormous, decentralized reforestation campaign across multiple continents and countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding follows a $5M seed last year, as the young startup worked to hone its approach.</p>
<p>Terraformation is targeting the main barriers to successful reforesting: Through early research and pilots it says it&#8217;s identified three key bottlenecks to large-scale forest restoration &#8212; namely, land availability, freshwater, and seed. It then seeks to address each of these pinch-points to viable reforesting &#8212; identifying and fashioning modular, sharable solutions (tools, techniques, training etc) that can help shave off friction and build leafy, branching success.</p>
<p>These products include a seed bank unit it&#8217;s devised, housed in a standard shipping container and kitted out with all the equipment (plus solar off-grip capability, if required) to take care of on-site storage for the thousands of native seeds each projects needs to replant a whole forest.</p>
<p>It also offers a nursery kit which also ships in a shipping container &#8212; a flat-packed greenhouse that it says a couple of people can put together, and where thousands of seedlings can then be tended and irrigated in pots until they&#8217;re ready to plant out.</p>
<p>A third support it offers to the replanting projects it wants to work with is expertise in building solar-powered desalination rigs so young trees can be supplied with adequate water to survive in locations where poor land management may have made conditions for growth difficult and harsh.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that planted trees which fail because of poor processes won&#8217;t help cut carbon emissions. Badly managed replanting is at best wasteful &#8212; and may be closer to cynical greenwashing in some cases. (Poor quality projects can be a known problem where claims of corporate carbon offsetting are being made, for example.)</p>
<p>Terraformation is thus zeroing in on repeatable ways to scale and accelerate the successful planting and nurturing of trees, from seed to sapling and beyond, to accelerate sustainable reforesting.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s the only kind of tree planting that will really count in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>Its first pilot restoration projects begun in Hawai&#8217;i in 2019 &#8212; where it&#8217;s been able to plant thousands of trees at a site called Pacific Flight, reviving a native tropical sandalwood forest that had been logged unsustainably. To enable the young trees to grow in land which had also become arid as a result of cattle grazing, the team built the world&#8217;s largest fully off-grid, solar-powered desalination system to supply sustainable freshwater to the baby forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The arid environment, high winds, and degraded soils meant that if a team could restore a forest there, they could do it anywhere,&#8221; is the pitch on <a href="https://www.terraformation.com/about">its website</a>.</p>
<p>The Series A will go toward spinning up lots more such native species forest restoration projects &#8212; working via partnerships, with organizations such as Environmental Defenders in Uganda, and other groups in Ecuador, Haiti and Tanzania &#8212; as well as on more R&amp;D (additional products are in the pipeline, we&#8217;re told); and on expanding headcount so its team has the legs to run faster.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for a startup with Silicon Valley engineering pedigree at its core, the team&#8217;s approach is<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> intentionally light on technology &#8212; leaning only on vital tech (like solar and desalination), rather than experimental bells and whistles (drones, robotics etc) to ensure the processes it&#8217;s packaging up for massive replanting parallelism remain as simple, accessible and reliable as possible. So they are able</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to scale all over the globe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s clear that sci-fi</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> robotic gadgetry isn&#8217;t the answer here. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It&#8217;s sweating toil plus tried and tested horticulture processes, done systematically and repeatedly, in mass parallelism all over the world that&#8217;s required, argues Wong, whose years in tech have given him a healthy scepticism on the issue of over-engineering. (</span>&#8220;The biggest lesson I learned was, you want to solve a big problem? You want to use as little technology as possible&#8230; Technology&#8217;s always breaking, it&#8217;s always got flaws. The biggest problem with technology is technology.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say that the key contribution that &#8216;tech&#8217; &#8212; if you think of a monolith or a culture or whatever &#8212; will make to climate change, is not in fact some new invention or some gadget or some sort of special magical technology&#8230; I think it really is the practice of scalability,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Which is an organizational end. A management way of thinking. Because that is actually something that has been carefully and painfully developed&#8230; over the past 20 years in Silicon Valley. How to take small working solutions, how to solve very big problems, how to scale them. And it isn&#8217;t a very glamorous thing &#8212; which is why I think it&#8217;s one of the more pure disciplines.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just has been less corrupt&#8230; Scalability is just people thinking hard and grinding it out to address really hard big problems. And I think that practice and all the little tips and rules that we have to doing that is the real contribution that tech is going to make &#8212; with one of those principles being use as little tech as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terraformation is building software tools too &#8212; such as a mobile app to help with cataloguing and monitoring seeds. But the really critical technologies involved, solar and desalination, are very much at the &#8216;tried and tested&#8217; end of the tech scale (&#8220;very, very reliable and refined&#8221;.).</p>
<p>Wong points out that a key development for solar and desalination is related to the unit economics &#8212; with falling costs allowing for scalability and thus speed.</p>
<p>Asked whether Terraformation is a business in the typical startup sense, Wong says it&#8217;s been set up in a familiar way &#8212; as a Delaware C Corp &#8212; but purely because he says that&#8217;s just the quickest way to be able to operate. Doing stuff as a non-profit would be way too slow, he says, describing it thusly as a &#8220;non non-profit&#8221; (rather than a business with a for-profit mission).</p>
<p>Aka: &#8220;It&#8217;s a corporate with investors but primarily the aim is to solve climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Startup investors are of course often betting their money on the chance of a quick and meaty return. But not here, confirms Wong. </span>&#8220;When we raised funding all of our investors invested primarily because they wanted to see climate change solved,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;To many of them this was the first time that a plausible, full-scale solution to solving climate change had been presented.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still very, very hard. It&#8217;s very, very large. It&#8217;s really daunting. But it&#8217;s the first time someone has mapped out a path that could actually get us there. And so all of our investors invested because they want to see that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how will a &#8216;non non-profit&#8217; startup (even with $30M just banked) get its hands on enough land to plant enough trees? A variety of ways, per Wong. (Perhaps even, in some instances, landowners could end up paying it to turn their dirt into beautiful woodland.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The short answer is anywhere we can!&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The solution is structured to give us maximum flexibility, given that we can use a large variety of land. We don&#8217;t want to count on any particular land owning entity &#8212; and I use that very broad term to mean like people, communities, governments, municipalities &#8212; we don&#8217;t want to rely on any one particular land-owning entity wanting to work with us or allowing us to reforest the land, because you can&#8217;t guarantee that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also notes that Terraformation&#8217;s plan to fix climate change is based on &#8220;worse case scenarios&#8221; &#8212; where &#8220;no one who owns any land that gets enough natural rainfall for forest restoration will allow it to reforest it&#8221;. &#8220;We use the least valuable land &#8212; basically desertified, degraded land,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Is there enough of that? And it turns out there is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though personal financial upside clearly isn&#8217;t front of mind for Terraformation&#8217;s investors, Wong still believes there&#8217;s plenty of &#8216;value&#8217; to be unlocked as a byproduct of spreading leafy-green goodness all over the planet vs funding more extractive exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out that solving climate change is actually a huge value creating act,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;My experience in Silicon Valley is if you have people who believe in you and believe in the thing that you&#8217;re creating is ultimately value-creating then it&#8217;s actually also wealth creating. If you do something that is fundamentally very, very valuable and you&#8217;re right next to it, you will be able to monetize it in some way. You will capture some of that value for your shareholders. So it&#8217;s a bet that if you really can solve climate change, that&#8217;s super valuable, both for the world and to the entity that&#8217;s [investing].&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course climate change is more than just a problem; it&#8217;s an existential threat to all life on Earth &#8212; one which affect humans and every other living creature and thing on the planet.</p>
<p>Given such terminal stakes, reversing climate change should be the highest global priority. Instead, humans have procrastinated &#8212; putting dealing with rises in atmospheric CO2 on the back-burner and worse (cutting down existing forests like the Amazon Rainforest, for one).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Set against that backdrop, Terraformation&#8217;s answer to humanity&#8217;s greatest crisis looks compellingly simple. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its bet is that climate change can be fixed by scaling the most proven technology possible (trees) to capture carbon emissions. Who can argue with that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it does also seem clear that reforesting will need to go hand in hand with a mainstreaming of conservation, as a prevailing societal attitude, if the mission is to be pulled off &#8212; otherwise all these beautiful baby trees could just meet the same sad fate as all the Earth&#8217;s already lost forests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Nonetheless, </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">c</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">onservation is something Wong&#8217;s team is deliberately not focusing on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not because they don&#8217;t care. Rather their hope is that by building the baby forests, the protective partners will come &#8212; to watch over and get value from the trees as they grow. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make it seem like we don&#8217;t care about [forestry conservation] but one of the things that I try to do is figure out where people are already doing work and things are already moving in the right direction &#8212; and then go work on the thing that other people are not working on,&#8221; he says when we ask about this. &#8220;When I talk to people in the forestry world many, many people are working on avoiding deforestation, helping solve the broader socioeconomic issues that result in deforestation. And so I feel like there is momentum moving in that direction &#8212; so we have to work on this other issue that other people aren&#8217;t working on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wong also argues that forests are naturally more valuable than the denuded waste/scrub ground they&#8217;re replanting &#8212; implying that pure economic interest should help these baby forests survive and thrive far into the future.</p>
<p>However the history of humanity shows that unequal wealth distribution can wreak all sorts of havoc on a resource-rich natural environment. And people who live in poverty may well be disproportionately more likely to like in a rural location, on or near land that Terraformation hopes to target for replanting. So if these forests can&#8217;t provide &#8212; in crude terms &#8212; &#8216;value&#8217; for their local communities the risk is the same cycle of short-term economic harm will rip all this hard work (and hope) out of the ground once again.</p>
<p>Wealth inequality lies at the core of much of humanity&#8217;s counterproductive destruction of the environment. So, seen from that angle, reforesting the planet may require just as much effort toward tackling &#8212; root and branch &#8212; the wider socioeconomic fault-lines of our world, as it will washing, sorting and storing seed, watering seedlings and nurturing and planting saplings.</p>
<p>And that further dials up an already massive climate challenge. But, again, Wong is quietly hopeful.</p>
<p>&#8220;People aren&#8217;t cutting down trees because they&#8217;re evil, they&#8217;re cutting down trees because they need to make a living. So we have to provide them with ways to make a living that is more valuable than cutting down the trees. I think that recognition is moving in the correct direction &#8212; so I&#8217;m hopeful there,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asked what keeps him up at night, he also has a straightforward answer to hand &#8212; one we&#8217;ve heard many times already from a new generation of climate campaigners, like Greta Thunberg, whose futures will be irrevocably stamped by the effects of climate change: Humanity simply isn&#8217;t moving fast enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to do this we have to make order of magnitude improvements in both speed and scale &#8212; which is technically a thing that we know how to do but is among the most daunting things that you ever try to undertake. So&#8230; are we moving fast enough? Are we doing enough? Because time is running out,&#8221; warns Wong.</p>
<p>&#8220;The timeframe that we have left is very small when compared to the planetary scale of the problem. And so I think the only way that we&#8217;re going to get there is with proven solutions, moving, growing at exponential speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am [hopeful],&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of humans working together. People can really do it. I&#8217;m very I guess what you&#8217;d call pro-human. We have a lot of flaws, we fight amongst ourselves a lot, but I really think that when people work together they can really do amazing, amazing things&#8230; Trees gave us life and so now it&#8217;s our time to repay that debt.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A young Indian startup that is betting that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/earned-wage-access/">earned wage access solutions</a> will take off in the South Asian nation said on Wednesday it has closed a new round from high-profile investors.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="http://refyne.co.in/">Refyne</a> said on Wednesday that it has raised $16 million in Series A from partners of DST Global and RTP Global. The one-year-old startup also disclosed that it raised a $4.1 million seed round in December from Jigsaw VC and QED Investors and XYZ Capital, all of whom also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> last month that Refyne was in talks with RTP Global to raise money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Refyne works with employers to let their workers access their earned salaries in real-time. An employee can check Refyne and see how much they have earned in a week and withdraw a fraction of it anytime they wish.</p>
<p>The idea, explained Refyne&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive Chitresh Sharma, is that many individuals in India run out of cash before their next payday and then some end up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/google-cracks-down-on-personal-loan-apps-in-india-following-abuse-and-outcry/">taking loans on not so favorable terms</a> to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;An employee should have the option to access their own earnings at any time,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;When faced with a mid-month liquidity crunch, the apparent options for employees to access quick cash include payday loans or micro-credit schemes. However, these instruments often carry predatory pricing, which further exacerbates employees’ debt obligations and mental wellness,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a concept that has taken off in several markets &#8212; with many major employers such as Uber and McDonald&#8217;s offering this flexibility to their workforce &#8212; but is yet to be tested in India, where on paper, earned wage access idea should work as a significant portion of the working force remains on a shaky financial footing. Earlier on Monday, Indonesian startup Wagely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/wagely-an-indonesian-earned-wage-access-and-financial-services-platform-raises-5-6m/">announced a $5.6 million fundraise</a> to test this idea in the Southeast Asian market.</p>
<p>Sharma, a third-time founder who returned to India to start Refyne, said the startup&#8217;s plug-and-play software is aimed at employers of all size, and the platform can prove beneficial to blue-collar as well as white-collar workers.</p>
<p>“The need for financial inclusion is more important today than ever before. As the first company in India to provide earned wage access, Refyne can revolutionise the way millions of workers manage their money. By providing a real, affordable alternative to payday loans, Refyne will not only improve a person’s financial health, but it will add control for the consumer and dramatically reduce the stress on those who worry about meeting their financial obligations,&#8221; said QED Investors Managing Partner and Co-Founder Nigel Morris in a statement. This is QED&#8217;s first investment in India.</p>
<p>Over 100 companies in India are already using Refyne&#8217;s platform, serving over 300,000 employees. Some of the clients include Rebel Foods, Cafe Coffee Day, Hira Group, and Chai Point.</p>
<p>Refyne plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its technology team and accelerate its growth. By the end of the current financial year, it aims to serve 1 million workers in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a nail polish company,&#8221; says Fenton Jagdeo of <a href="https://www.faculty.world/">Faculty</a>, the startup he cofounded in 2019 with Umar ElBably. Though their Toronto-based company currently sells just three shades of nail polish along with some nail stickers &#8212; that&#8217;s it &#8212;  the products are a wedge to something much larger, says Jagdeo.</p>
<p>There will be merchandise, according to the former business management consultant. There will be men&#8217;s foundation, and eye shadow, and very possibly hair dye, all of which is focused around a &#8220;new wave of masculinity,&#8221; Jagdeo explains.</p>
<div>These items aren&#8217;t likely to appear in the aisles of Sephora or CVS, suggests Jagdeo. Faculty is instead “going to be very selective about who we have conversations with. We’re imagining the the Essences of the world, the StockXs, the Kiths. That’s where our clientele is.”</div>
<p>More, he says that in the same way that the prominent culture publication Hypebeast created a &#8220;desire for new product and newness,&#8221; Faculty has &#8220;mastered the drop model,&#8221; meaning that Faculty has and will continue to advertise a limited supply of a product before invariably selling out of that item. (Those three nail polish shades and the sticker set? They&#8217;re long gone.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you find yourself wondering if Faculty aims to become a streetwear company or a cosmetics company, Jagdeo is succeeding in his mission. As he explains it, &#8220;essentially, our goal is to blur&#8221; that dividing line.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s utterly implausible and yet strangely alluring, which likely explains why the cosmetics giant Estee Lauder just led a $3 million seed round in the five-person outfit, joined by RareBreed Ventures, Maple VC, Debut Capital, Creative Connectors, AUFI, 10K Ventures, actress Maisie Williams and recording artist Iann Dior.</p>
<p>After all, there is little to separate one cosmetics brand from another, aside from storytelling and the ability to build up a loyal following. (See, for example, Glossier and its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/03/19/glossier-raises-100m-and-now-has-a-billion-dollar-valuation/?sh=af0fb9e720d8">mega-valuation</a>.)</p>
<p>Even Jagdeo readily admits that Faculty&#8217;s nail polish is &#8220;not, from a purely chemical perspective, different&#8221; from what&#8217;s widely available in the market already. Yet he sells the vision easily while insisting that ElBably, who attended the same <a href="https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/">business school</a> as Jagdeo, is the better storyteller of the two.</p>
<p>Certainly, their pitch &#8212; that men need more ways through unconventional men&#8217;s products to express themselves &#8212; is a smart one. Consider that the men&#8217;s personal care market alone is expected to balloon to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mens-personal-care-market-size-worth-75-8-billion-by-2027--cagr-6-0-grand-view-research-inc-301194818.html">$75 billion</a> over the next six years, according to Grand View Research, and there are few established grooming brands for millennials, even while <a href="https://hiconsumption.com/best-grooming-brands-for-men/">plenty of outfits</a> are trying. (SNL even came up with a skit recently about a new men&#8217;s cosmetics brand called &#8220;Man Stain,&#8221; which pokes fun at men who want to wear make-up but feel insecure about it.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, streetwear market is even bigger &#8212; it was in the range of <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/de/en/insights/2019/streetwear.html">$185 billion</a> in sales in 2019, according to PwC analysis &#8212; and new brands are breaking through all the time, including brands that, like Faculty, are the express opposite of hyper masculine.</p>
<p>Naturally, Estee Lauder&#8217;s imprimatur could make a difference here, too, particularly given that the cosmetics giant isn&#8217;t known to actively invest in startups or lead seed rounds. Indeed, while Jagdeo says the funding will help Faculty with its marketing, R&amp;D, and operational expenses, he notes the real advantage to working with Estee Lauder is the mentorship it can provide, as well as its ability to open doors for Faculty.</p>
<p>Says Jagdeo, &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot easier for us to say, &#8216;Hey, you know, we&#8217;re working with Estee Lauder and Estee Lauder is one of our investors,&#8217; versus, &#8216;We&#8217;re two guys with a dream.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Earned wage access (EWA) platforms that allow workers to withdraw their earnings on demand instead of waiting until payday are proliferating around the world. Today, Indonesian EWA startup <a href="https://www.wagely.app/">wagely</a> announced it has raised $5.6 million in strategic funding, led by Integra Partners (formerly known as Dymon Asia Ventures). Other investors included the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Ventures, PT Triputra Investindo Arya, Global Founders Capital, Trihill Capital, 1982 Ventures and Willy Swandi Dharma, former president director of insurance company PT Asuransi Adira Dinamika.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by alumni of two of Southeast Asia’s largest tech companies, wagely expects to reach more than 250,000 users this year. Chief executive officer Tobias Fischer was former regional lending program manager at Grab Financial Services Asia, while chief technology officer Sasanadi Rukua served as vice president of engineering at Tokopedia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fischer told TechCrunch that after working at financial services companies in Southeast Asia, he and Ruka saw that “managing cashflow is the most pressing everyday issue for lower- and middle-income Indonesians.”</p>
<p>While the pandemic exacerbated financial hardships, Fischer said more than 75% of Indonesians already struggled to cover unexpected expenses between paychecks. Many borrow from family or friends, but if that option is unavailable, they may turn to payday lenders who can charge more than 360% annualized percentage rates, or pay overdraft and late fees to their banks until their next paycheck.</p>
<p>“This is the start of a vicious and costly debt cycle that has a long-lasting negative impact on individual financial well-being, which in turn impacts businesses with higher turnover, lower productivity and more employee loans,” Fischer said.</p>

<p>On average, more than 50% of employees at wagely’s enterprise clients use it multiple times throughout the month to track their daily earnings and access their earned wages. The company’s ultimate goal is “to build a holistic financial wellness platform for lower- and middle-income workers” that includes other financial services, including savings, insurance and smart spending products, Fischer said.</p>
<p>More companies around the world are allowing workers to pick when they get paid. Some notable EWA platforms include Gusto Cashout; DailyPay, which <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/dailypay-raises-175-mln-d-round-and-its-now-a-unicorn-51621355832">recently hit unicorn status</a>; Wagestream; Minu and Even. In Indonesia, wagely’s competitors include GajiGesa and Gajiku.</p>
<p>Fischer said wagely “created the earned wage access category in Indonesia,” and is the market leader with more than 50 large companies, including state-owned enterprises and multi-national conglomerates. Its new funding will be used to increase wagely’s sales team in order to close more enterprise deals. Wagely’s current customers include PT Bentoel Internasional Investama Tbk (British American Tobacco); PT Supra Boga Lestari Tbk (Ranch Market); beauty and wellness company PT Mustika Ratu Tbk; and renewable energy group PT Kencana Energi Lestari Tbk.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Wilson Maknawi, president director at PT Kencana Energi Lestari TBK, said, “wagely offers our employees financial stability in times of uncertainty. It is incredibly important and a crucial step for the long-term resilience of our business. With no changes to our payroll process, wagely’s solution has proven to increase our business savings and helped our employees to avoid predatory loans while providing savings and budget tools that increase their financial literacy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, former President Donald Trump issued a statement supporting the Nigerian government&#8217;s decision to suspend Twitter activities in the West African country.</p>
<div class="ringCommonDetail ringBlockType-paragraph ">
<p>&#8220;Congratulations to the country of Nigeria, who just banned Twitter because they banned their President,&#8221; he said in the statement.</p>
<p>The ex-President also encouraged other countries to follow in Nigeria&#8217;s footsteps and ban Twitter and Facebook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;More COUNTRIES should ban Twitter and Facebook for not allowing free and open speech &#8212; all voices should be heard. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the meantime, competitors will emerge and take hold. Who are they to dictate good and evil if they themselves are evil? Perhaps I should have done it while I was President. But Zuckerberg kept calling me and coming to the White House for dinner telling me how great I was. 2024?&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s approval is coming days after Nigeria <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">suspended Twitter indefinitely</a> last Friday. The government made the judgment days after Twitter deleted Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari&#8217;s tweet for violating its abusive behaviour policy and several calls by Nigerians to take it down. His tweet threatened punishment on secessionists in the southeastern part of the country.</p>
<p>Although the Nigerian President, via his spokesperson, later declared that the state-wide ban on Twitter was only a temporary measure to curb misinformation and fake news, new directives suggest otherwise. The government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/nigeria-orders-broadcasting-media-to-disregard-twitter-as-news-source/">ordered broadcasting media</a> to delete their Twitter accounts and stop using the platform as a news source on Monday which further confirms a ploy to stifle free speech and enforce censorship.</p>
<p>“In compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in,” an excerpt of the statement read.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Trump has been on the receiving end of not one but two bans. In early January, he was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">permanently banned from Twitter</a> after instigating the violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol. Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528">cited concerns</a> over the “risk of further incitement of violence.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1JBIhGF1yU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">Why Twitter says it banned President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Twitter says it banned President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/embed/#?secret=1JBIhGF1yU" data-secret="1JBIhGF1yU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He was subsequently suspended indefinitely on Facebook. Last Friday, the social media juggernaut announced its decision to reconsider Trump&#8217;s suspension in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">two years</a> (which starts counting from January).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;At the end of this period, we will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded. We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest. If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded,&#8221; Vice‑President for Global Affairs and Communications at Facebook, Nick Clegg said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When the suspension is eventually lifted, there will be a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions that will be triggered if Mr Trump commits further violations in future, up to and including permanent removal of his pages and accounts.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News broke this morning that Bain Capital Private Equity and Crosspoint Capital Partners are purchasing Seattle-based network security startup ExtraHop.</p>
<p>Part of the Network Detection and Response (NDR) market, ExtraHop&#8217;s security solutions are for companies that manage assets in the cloud and on-site, &#8220;something that could be useful as more companies find themselves in that in-between state,&#8221; report Ron Miller and Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, ExtraHop was closing in on $100 million in ARR and was considering an IPO, so Ron and Alex spoke to ExtraHop CTO and co-founder Jesse Rothstein to learn more about how (and why) the deal came together.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Have a great week, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Xometry, a Maryland-based service that connects companies with manufacturers with excess production capacity around the world, filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week announcing its intent to become a public company.</p>
<p>As the global supply chain tightened during the pandemic in 2020, a company that helped find excess manufacturing capacity was likely in high demand.</p>
<p>But growth aside, it’s clear that Xometry is no modern software business, at least from a revenue-quality profile.</p>

<p>The average corporate security organization spends $18 million annually but is largely ineffective at preventing breaches, IP theft and data loss. Why?</p>
<p>The fragmented approach we’re currently using in the security operations center (SOC) does not work. It&#8217;s time to replace the security information and event management (SIEM) approach with security data lakes.</p>
<p>The reduced reliance on the SIEM is well underway, along with many other changes. The SIEM is not going away overnight, but its role is changing rapidly, and it has a new partner in the SOC — the security data lake.</p>

<p>There has been a wave of businesses over the past several years hoping to offer broadband internet delivered from thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), providing coverage of most of the earth’s surface.</p>
<p>In tandem with the accelerated deployment of SpaceX’s Starlink constellation in 2020, China has rapidly responded in terms of policy, financing and technology. While still in early development, a &#8220;Chinese answer to Starlink,&#8221; SatNet, and the associated GuoWang are likely to compete in certain markets with Starlink and others while also fulfilling a strategic purpose from a government perspective.</p>
<p>With considerable backing from very high-level actors, we are likely to see the rollout of a Red Star(link) over China (and the rest of the world) over the coming years.</p>

<p>While we wait for Robinhood&#8217;s IPO, The Exchange dove into its fundraising history, its product, its numbers and, bracing ourselves for impact, its projections.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom says your board should include a few CEOs who can offer informed advice from an entrepreneur&#8217;s perspective, but adding a technical leader to the mix creates real upside, according to Abby Kearns, chief technology officer at Puppet.</p>
<p>Beyond their engineering experience, CTOs can help founders set realistic timelines, help identify pain points and bring what Kearns calls &#8220;pragmatic empathy&#8221; to high-pressure situations.</p>
<p>They can also be an effective advocate for founder teams who need help explaining why a launch is delayed or new engineering hires are badly needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A CTO understands the nuts and bolts,&#8221; says Kearns.</p>

<p>As someone with “founder” on your resume, you face a greater challenge when trying to get a traditional salaried job.</p>
<p>You’ve already shown that you really want to lead a company, not just rise up the ladder, which means some employers are less likely to hire you.</p>
<p>So what should you do? Especially if your life partner and/or bank account are burnt out on the income volatility of startups?</p>
<p>Here are six options for ex-founders planning their next move.</p>

<p>In the fifth and final part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">Expensify&#8217;s EC-1</a>, Anna Heim explores how the company built its business, true to form, in an unexpected way.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;You&#8217;d expect an expense management company to have a large sales department and advertise through all kinds of channels to maximize customer acquisition, Anna writes. But &#8220;Expensify just doesn’t do what you think it should.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping in mind this company’s propensity to just stick to its guts, it’s not much of a surprise that it got to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue</a> and millions of users with a staff of 130, some contractors, and an almost non-existent sales team.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is that much growth possible without a sales team? Word of mouth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The corporate philanthropy organization <a href="https://pledge1percent.org/">Pledge 1%</a> has, since its launch in 2014, asked founders to donate 1% of their companies&#8217; equity, product or employees&#8217; time starting on their first day of business.</p>
<p>While the Bay Area-based outfit has found meaningful support from companies like DocuSign, Box, Twilio Okta and PagerDuty that pledged their resources ahead of becoming publicly traded companies, Pledge 1% is now sharpening its ask slightly, and asking a growing list of VCs to also help<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> unlock what it hopes will become billions of dollars in donations by nudging their companies to donate 1% of their outstanding equity ahead of a public offering. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a soft sell, as the organization&#8217;s CEO, Amy Lesnick, describes it. Her five-person team isn&#8217;t asking VCs to fork over any of their ownership in pre-IPO companies. Instead, Pledge 1% &#8212; originally co-founded by Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar, among others &#8212; has enlisted VCs who are also &#8220;allies&#8221; of the organization to talk more systematically with founders whose companies are poised to go public within 12 to 18 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to help persuade these founding teams to set up corporate-donor-advised funds so that when their companies&#8217; shares begin to trade, they already have a scheduled sale of those shares in place, or else plans to exercise (and donate) them after the company&#8217;s post-IPO lock-up period.</p>
<p>It is already happening somewhat organically, she adds. In the last year, Coinbase, UiPath and Unity worked with Pledge 1% to set aside equity worth $1 billion.</p>
<p>Much of what Pledge 1% aims to do is simply to institutionalize the process, explains Lesnick. In her view, more companies want to weave philanthropy into their corporate culture, but it&#8217;s oftentimes challenging for a fast-moving startup to know how best to do that. Meanwhile, because VCs sits on so many boards, around 50 of them have come together to help Pledge 1% create a living playbook for founders and a step-by-step guide for companies to formalize equity pledges &#8212; along with a companion guide for CFOs and in-house attorneys.</p>
<p>Indeed, while right now, participating VCs will focus on nudging their maturing portfolio companies into thinking more about gifting, Lesnick says Pledge 1%&#8217;s aspiration is that all venture-backed companies will eventually set aside some equity for social impact during during every round of capital that they raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully,&#8221; says Lesnick, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have a conversation in five years and have a good chuckle of how we even had to talk about [startups donating equity] because it will just be the norm.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you want to catch up on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/numerous-popular-websites-are-facing-an-outage/">why the internet broke today</a>, we have the story that you need. I suppose it’s nice to read that story without it being Amazon’s fault for once. Or Cloudflare. Now that we think about it, there are a lot of failure points for the internet. Today&#8217;s culprit, Fastly, went down, taking lots of the internet with it. But Fastly’s stock? <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/news/?guccounter=1">Up more than 9%</a> as I write to you. Figure that one out &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/expensify-ec1-business/"><strong>How bottom-up sales helped Expensify blaze the path for SaaS</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The final entry of TechCrunch’s deep dive into Expensify’s business ahead of its IPO is live today. <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> focused her final installment of the five-part series on how the well-known expense software company managed the growth that is helping take it public.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/u-s-pc-shipments-soar-73-in-the-first-quarter-as-apple-falls-from-top-spot/">Personal computers are not dead</a>:</strong> Remember when the iPad came out and PCs were supposedly kaput? Well, they are not dead yet, not by a long shot. In fact, here in the U.S., PC sales shot up 73% in the first quarter compared to Q1 2020 numbers. And Apple lost its top slot to HP, in America at least.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/as-monday-com-targets-6b-ipo-valuation-zoom-and-salesforce-commit-150m/">Investors still love software more than life</a>: </strong>The market for high-growth technology companies is super hot at the moment, recent evidence for which was provided by Monday.com’s IPO pricing and expected investments from both Zoom and Salesforce. The Israeli company should debut on the U.S. markets later this week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We have three main blocks of startup news this morning. The first deals with consumer social applications, a category that goes through booms and busts in investor interest. The second is fintech-focused. And the third is a mix of funding rounds large and small to keep you up to date on the latest.</p>
<p><strong>2 Turntables and a camera phone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/"><strong>Dispo’s camera app confirms its Series A round</strong></a><strong>: </strong>After a hyped launch and the fallout regarding a member of co-founder David Dobrik’s “Vlog Squad,” the social camera application confirmed what we had heard earlier this year: that it raised a $20 million round. It will be interesting to see when the company accesses the private markets again, if it is able to.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/turntable-fm-competitor-tt-fm-launches-beta-app-for-ios-and-android/"><strong>Turntable spins up beta apps for Android and iOS</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Turntable, similar to Turntable.fm but not the same application, is launching early-release applications for iOS and Android. Don’t forget that Turntable raised half a million dollars earlier this year. Or that Turntable.fm, a competitor, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/call-it-a-comeback-turntable-fm-raises-7-5m/">back from the dead</a>. It’s very 2021 to have two startups in the market with effectively the same name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>From the world of fintech:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/"><strong>Nubank raises $750M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Brazilian neobank Nubank is now worth $30 billion and has an extra three-quarters of a billion dollars in the bank. Its new capital is a sort of extension to its known Series G, though at a higher valuation. Which means it’s a new round. But, hey, it’s 2021 and rules are over.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/"><strong>Corporate spend startup Airbase raises $60M</strong></a><strong>:</strong> On the heels of competing startups Ramp and Brex raising huge new rounds, Airbase followed suit. The company is betting that its focus on midmarket companies and software will set it apart from competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our regular funding round digest:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h2>Network security startup ExtraHop skips and jumps to $900M exit</h2>
<p>News broke this morning that Bain Capital Private Equity and Crosspoint Capital Partners are purchasing Seattle-based network security startup ExtraHop.</p>
<p>Part of the Network Detection and Response (NDR) market, ExtraHop’s security solutions are for companies that manage assets in the cloud and on-site, “something that could be useful as more companies find themselves in that in-between state.”</p>
<p>A year ago, ExtraHop was closing in on $100 million in ARR and considering an IPO, so we spoke to ExtraHop CTO and co-founder Jesse Rothstein to learn more about how (and why) the deal came together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Trucks Venture Capital, a fund that focuses on early-stage entrepreneurs in transportation, is launching two new funds that it says will help build the future of transportation.</p>
<p class="p2">Its new core fund, Trucks Venture Fund 2 (TVF2), was raised over the last year and recently closed on $52,525,252. The fund is backed by three auto OEMs and three auto suppliers that make everything from bicycles to Class 8 big rig trucks, as well as one communications company, according to Trucks VC. The VC’s new follow-on fund, Trucks Growth Fund, will provide later-stage capital to some of the most promising companies already in Trucks’ portfolio.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Our mission is to fund companies making transportation safer, cleaner and more accessible,&#8221; Reilly Brennan, general partner at Trucks VC, told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Safer&#8221; companies that Trucks VC looks to invest in might focus on automated vehicles, driver monitoring or vehicle maintenance and improvements. Because we are at the beginning of a decade for zero-emission transportation, &#8220;cleaner&#8221; looks like batteries and charging, electric and hydrogen vehicle platforms and last-mile logistics. And &#8220;more accessible&#8221; means companies that focus on micromobility and mass transit, according to Brennan.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JgLctKJcVk"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/">MaaS transit: The business of mobility as a service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MaaS transit: The business of mobility as a service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/embed/#?secret=JgLctKJcVk" data-secret="JgLctKJcVk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We also believe heavily in automated vehicles in structured environments (agriculture, mining, logistics),&#8221; said Brennan. &#8220;Given the focus on delivery and changing consumer behavior, it&#8217;s not hard to see how logistics AV becomes more valuable than robotaxi. I would go so far as to say the forthcoming exits from those sectors in AV will make the previous five years of robotaxi exits (Cruise, nuTonomy, Zoox) look relatively low in comparison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trucks VC is also looking beyond the micromobility horizon. Brennan says a lot of the VCs with &#8220;good hair&#8221; have been calling the end of micromobility, so now&#8217;s the perfect time to spot emerging companies building a new wave of ideas in B2B, hardware and operating systems. The investment firm will follow these criteria when searching for both newer startups for TVF2 and for the Growth Fund.</p>
<p class="p2">The Growth Fund is the first formal entity Trucks VC has established for later-stage companies, although it&#8217;s selected a few follow-on investments in the past, says Brennan.</p>
<p class="p2">“The origin of this is somewhat unusual: we have this amazing community of people who read our newsletter (FoT) and they have been asking us for investing opportunities for years,” said Brennan. “Once Naval Ravikant showed us the platform they built at AngelList for rolling funds, we decided to use it. I think we&#8217;re the first venture fund that is using the new rolling fund structure as a growth fund.”</p>
<p class="p2">The growth fund might kick off its portfolio by investing in Universal Hydrogen, Gatik and Bear Flag Robotics, according to Brennan. TVF2 has already made seed investments to Universal Hydrogen &#8212; an LA-based startup that’s developing hydrogen storage solutions and conversion kits for commercial aircraft. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/universal-hydrogen-raises-20-5m-series-a-to-help-launch-hydrogen-aviation/"><span class="s1">Universal Hydrogen recently closed a $20.5 million Series A round</span></a> led by investor syndicate Playground Global.</p>

<p class="p2">TVF2 also made a seed investment and participated in a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/swyft-raises-17-5-million-to-bring-same-day-delivery-to-all-the-retailers-that-arent-amazon/"><span class="s1"> $17.5 million Series A to Swyft</span></a>, a company trying to rival Amazon on same-day retail delivery, and it provided seed funding to Token Transit, a mobile ticket booking app.</p>
<p class="p2">Trucks VC makes up to eight investments from its core seed funds every year, and the Growth Fund will similarly invest in one or two companies each quarter. The San Francisco-based fund, founded in 2015, has invested in well-known exits such as Joby Aviation and DeepScale, which was acquired by Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The continuing saga of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">Lordstown Motor&#8217;s struggles as a public company</a> took a new turn today as the electric truck manufacturer made yet more news. Bad news.</p>
<p>Shares of Lordstown are down sharply today after the company <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">reported in an SEC filing</a> that it does not have enough capital to build and launch its electric truck. Here&#8217;s the official verbiage (formatting, bolding: TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p>Since inception, the Company has been developing its flagship vehicle, the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to complete the development of its electric vehicles, obtain regulatory approval, begin commercial scale production and launch the sale of such vehicles.</p>
<p><strong> The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, companies that are trying to invent the future are more risky than, say, established banking concerns that are generating stable GAAP net income. I&#8217;m sure that SpaceX looked dicey at times when it was busy crashing rockets on its way to learning how to land them on drone ships.</p>
<p>But in the case of Lordstown&#8217;s admission that it cannot &#8220;fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale&#8221; of its Endurance pickup are fucking galling.</p>
<p>Why? Because when the company pitched its SPAC-led combination and public debut, it was pretty freaking confident that it would have enough cash to do so.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000121390020019762/ea124863ex99-2_diamondpeak.htm">Lordstown&#8217;s investor deck</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2163325 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?w=573" alt="" width="573" height="393" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png 573w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.21.19-PM.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></p>
<p>You will note in the &#8220;Capital Structure&#8221; section that the company claimed that it would not need more funding to go to market.</p>
<p>Now Lordstown is pretty sure it&#8217;s going to need more money. If it&#8217;s putting the possible need in a filing, it means it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the company may do to solve its problems (formatting, bolding: TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>To alleviate these conditions, management is currently evaluating various funding alternatives and may seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, mezzanine or debt securities, through arrangements with strategic partners or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions</strong>.</p>
<p>As we seek additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the debt and equity capital markets is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the company is going to have to lever itself using debt, or dilute existing shareholders through the sale of equity, and Lordstown can&#8217;t promise that it will be able to do either &#8220;on favorable terms or at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re seeing here is the difference between SEC filings, which are no-bullshit zones, and SPAC decks, which are business propaganda. Shares of Lordstown fell more than 16% during regular trading, and another 6.9% in after-hours trading, as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>This mess from the company that put out this diagram in its investor deck:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2163329 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png" alt="" width="963" height="597" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png 963w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-4.26.54-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px" /></p>
<p>In separate news, TechCrunch received an invite to a media availability to visit Lordstown&#8217;s operations in May, which included a note that the company &#8220;look[s] forward to opening [its] doors and showing you the latest progress from Lordstown Motors as [it] prepare[s] for the beginning of production in late September.&#8221; In a new missive sent today concerning the same event, the production timeline was not present.</p>
<p>So, yeah, maybe don&#8217;t trust SPAC decks much, if at all.</p>

<p>The video doorbell maker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/">acquired by Amazon in 2018</a>, has partnerships with at least 1,800 U.S. police departments (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras">and growing</a>) that can request camera footage from Ring doorbells. Prior to a change this week, any police department that Ring partnered with could privately request doorbell camera footage from Ring customers for an active investigation. Ring will <a href="https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/ring-launches-request-for-assistance-posts-on-the-neighbors-app/">now let its police partners</a> publicly request video footage from users through its Neighbors app.</p>
<p>The change ostensibly gives Ring users more control when police can access their doorbell footage, but ignores privacy concerns that police can access users&#8217; footage without a warrant.</p>
<p>Civil liberties advocates and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/u-s-senator-demands-answers-from-amazon-ring-over-its-police-partnerships/">lawmakers</a> have long warned that police can obtain camera footage from Ring users through a legal back door because Ring&#8217;s sprawling network of doorbell cameras are owned by private users. Police can still serve Ring with a legal demand, such as a subpoena for basic user information, or a search warrant or court order for video content, assuming there is evidence of a crime.</p>
<p>Ring received over 1,800 legal demands during 2020, more than double <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/law-enforcement-information-requests/">from the year earlier</a>, according to a <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/law-enforcement-information-requests-in-2020/">transparency report</a> that Ring published quietly in January. Ring does not disclose sales figures but says it has <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/21/21070402/amazon-ring-sales-jumpshot-data">&#8220;millions&#8221; of customers</a>. But the report leaves out context that most transparency reports include: how many users or accounts had footage given to police when Ring was served with a legal demand?</p>
<p>When reached, Ring declined to say how many users had footage obtained by police.</p>
<p>That number of users or accounts subject to searches is not inherently secret, but an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tech-transparency-reports-do-you-mean-translucency-reports/">obscure side effect</a> of how companies decide — if at all — to disclose when the government demands user data. Though they are not obligated to, most tech companies publish transparency reports once or twice a year to show how often user data is obtained by the government.</p>
<p>Transparency reports were a way for companies subject to data requests to push back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/twitters-new-transparency-report-is-disclosure-done-right/">against damning allegations</a> of intrusive bulk government surveillance by showing that only a fraction of a company&#8217;s users are subject to government demands.</p>
<p>But context is everything. <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/government-data-requests">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/pdf/requests-2020-H1-en.pdf">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/law-enforcement-requests-report">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en">Google</a>, and <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/information-requests.html#2020-jan-jun">Twitter</a> all reveal how many legal demands they receive, but also specify how many users or accounts had data given. In some cases, the number of users or accounts affected can be twice or more than threefold the number of demands they received.</p>
<p>Ring&#8217;s parent, Amazon, is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/amazon-government-data-demands/">rare exception</a> among the big tech giants, which does not break out the specific number of users whose information was turned over to law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring is ostensibly a security camera company that makes devices you can put on your own homes, but it is increasingly also a tool of the state to conduct criminal investigations and surveillance,&#8221; Matthew Guariglia, policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Guariglia added that Ring could release the numbers of users subject to legal demands, but also how many users have previously responded to police requests through the app.</p>
<p>Ring users can opt out of receiving requests from police, but this option would not stop law enforcement from obtaining a legal order from a judge for your data. Users can also switch on end-to-end encryption to prevent anyone other than the user, including Ring, from accessing their videos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s rare that a truly new way to make coffee is invented, and nearly all of them have one thing in common: heat. After all, it&#8217;s hot water that quickly extracts flavor and body from grounds. But <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">Osma</a>, a new device using an entirely novel coffeemaking technique, makes a rich, strong espresso-like drink at any temperature, including icy cold — and it might be the next big thing in the industry.</p>
<p>Osma is the latest project from designer Joey Roth, who evolved from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/grovemades-wooden-speaker-set-looks-like-beautiful-cybernetic-alien-eggs/">high-concept speaker tech</a> to tea and coffee tech, and now has found a way to integrate these two disparate pursuits with a unique vibratory method of extraction. And although Roth has had several successes over the years, this could be his most valuable yet.</p>
<p>To see why, it helps to understand the way coffee is ordinarily made, which generally comes down to one of two things: soaking the grounds in hot water, or forcing it through the grounds under pressure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F9Git0UoAl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/grovemades-wooden-speaker-set-looks-like-beautiful-cybernetic-alien-eggs/">Grovemade&#8217;s wooden speaker set looks like beautiful cybernetic alien eggs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grovemade&#8217;s wooden speaker set looks like beautiful cybernetic alien eggs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/grovemades-wooden-speaker-set-looks-like-beautiful-cybernetic-alien-eggs/embed/#?secret=F9Git0UoAl" data-secret="F9Git0UoAl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the first case, which includes drip and pourover, French press, and others, the heat of the water passively frees the oils and volatiles from the ground beans and then the solids, drained of flavor, are left behind through filtering.</p>
<p>The second case is espresso, in which the desired chemicals are extracted not just through heat but by the process of microcavitation. This is where the heat and pressure free CO2 from the grounds, forming tiny bubbles that quickly collapse, a process that leads to the flavor and aroma compounds being forced out as well.</p>
<p>Cold water can be used in the first method, with the advantage is that certain substances that would be destroyed by heat are retained, giving a different flavor profile. Unfortunately it can take hours or even days to brew to one&#8217;s preferred strength, and other desirable compounds degrade over that duration. And cold water can&#8217;t be used in the espresso process because steam is necessary to accomplish extraction.</p>
<p>Yet despite the inconvenience inherent to cold coffee, anyone who&#8217;s visited a café in the last decade can tell you it is enormously popular, year-round but especially in the summer. There&#8217;s endless appetite for the drink, even if all it amounts to is pouring hot coffee or espresso over ice. What if strong, delicious coffee could be made without heating it up, watering it down, or waiting for days? That&#8217;s the Osma proposition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161732" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161732" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2161732" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg 1805w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-drink.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161732" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>The Osma system is to my knowledge unlike any other brewing method. Essentially what it does is circulate water through the grounds continuously, while agitating them with a sort of standing pressure wave. It produces 8-12 ounces of a coffee that&#8217;s less concentrated than espresso, but not as mild as coldbrew, in about two minutes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161725" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161725" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2161725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png" alt="Diagram showing how coffee and water move through the Osma system." width="450" height="508" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=768,867 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=602,680 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew-diag.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="im HOEnZb adL">This is a fundamentally new expression of coffee that needs to be experienced,&#8221; said Roth when I asked him to characterize the flavor profile. He&#8217;d compared it to Kyoto-style slow drip with the added creamy mouthfeel and brighter flavors of espresso, but decided the analogy was imperfect.</span></p>
<p>His reservation is justified, as the method really is completely different. In addition to using cold water instead of hot and an acoustic wave instead of high pressure to create cavitation, the Osma Pro is unique in that it uses a circulatory process instead of one-way.</p>
<p>Almost all forms of coffee making are unidirectional: water goes in, meets up with the grounds, and coffee comes out — with the exception of percolators, which aren&#8217;t exactly the aficionado&#8217;s first choice. The Osma method, on the other hand, sucks up the water, passes it through the grounds and agitates it, then puts it back in the same vessel, where it is sucked up and passed through again.</p>
<p>This circular process can be stopped earlier or later, giving a lighter or heavier brew, but there&#8217;s a sweet spot at about two minutes that Roth thinks produces the best cup for most purposes.</p>
<p>Creating the system was equal parts serendipity and ingenuity. Roth recalled boiling water at room temperature in a commercial vacuum chamber with his co-founder Dan Yue, which sort of worked but not really, and at any rate wasn&#8217;t the type of equipment you could resell to a consumer. Yue speculated that it was the microcavitation process that allowed this extraction without significant heat.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162688" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162688" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162688 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg" alt="An iced coffee drink made with Osma Pro." width="2000" height="1807" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg?resize=768,694 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg?resize=680,614 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg?resize=1536,1388 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-brew.jpeg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2162688" class="wp-caption-text">Looks good, right? <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We verified this with a number of other experiments and confirmed that microcavitation was indeed the magic switch,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;From there we spent about two years developing what’s basically a mechanism to efficiently facilitate cavitation using acoustics in a tightly packed basket of ground coffee. With the help and insight of our partners James and Hiver (co-founders of <a href="https://www.chromaticcoffee.com/">Chromatic Coffee</a> in San Jose) we developed this into the Osma Pro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being able to pull a strong, cold coffee drink with espresso-like and cold brew-like aspects on demand could be a game-changer for coffee shops. At present they have to anticipate demand, making cold brew a day or longer before, risking shortages if demand outstrips supply, or otherwise offer hot coffee poured over ice, an accepted but rather incoherent approach.</p>
<p>At $695 the Osma Pro is a bit expensive for home use, but quite in line with the type of equipment used by most cafés. Like Roth&#8217;s other work, the industrial design is simple and beautiful. When you factor in its small footprint (about the size of a standing grinder) and the fact that it frees up valuable fridge space that would otherwise be filled with gallons of coldbrew, it starts to make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161723" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161723" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2161723 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg" alt="Close-up of the side of the Osma machine, with etched limited number." width="1024" height="742" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=1536,1114 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osma-basket.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161723" class="wp-caption-text">A limited run of a thousand&#8230; for now. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why an unnamed but apparently major coffee company has indicated interest in partnering with Roth on the machine, as he coyly explained. Selling a couple hundred to boutique coffee shops is nice, and Roth did say that pre-orders are beyond expectations, but a big time partner that could move units in the thousands? That&#8217;s the start of a global business empire.</p>
<p>Incidentally the whole thing started with a device that may now sadly be defunct. The first Osma brew I encountered was a portable, battery-powered device Roth sent me in beta form to test out that used biodegradable coffee pods and a scaled-down version of the acoustic agitation process. But this ended up being a sort of development dead end — while an interesting tech demo and pretty good at making coffee, it quickly became clear that the countertop version, which was improving rapidly, was the future of the company.</p>
<p>The only real question now is what to call the drink. I suggested coldpresso (icepresso is more euphonious but too close to the original), Roth thought cold flash but admitted everything he thought up was corny. Whatever it&#8217;s called, you can probably expect to start seeing it at your local &#8220;serious&#8221; coffee spot. If you run one of those or drink enough cold coffee to justify a major purchase, you can get in line to pick up a machine <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">at the Osma website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Fisker Inc. has set a moonshot goal of creating its first climate-neutral car by 2027.</p>
<p>Fisker has yet to bring a vehicle to market — climate neutral or not — making this an ambitious target. The all-electric Fisker Ocean SUV, which is still on track to go into production in November 2022, will not be climate neutral, according to CEO Henrik Fisker, who laid out the target as part of a broader update Tuesday to investors. Instead, this will be another yet to be announced vehicle.</p>
<p>Henrik Fisker, a serial entrepreneur who rose to fame as the designer behind iconic vehicles like the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, the production launch design of the Aston Martin DB9 and the BMW Z8 roadster, also provided a few other updates during the investor call. He said the Ocean will have an anticipated range of up to 350 miles, beyond the previously estimated 300 miles. The company has received more than 14,000 reservations for the Ocean as of March, according to an <a href="https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/33813J/20210412/AR_468005.PDF">annual report</a> distributed to shareholders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fisker, which went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Apollo Global Management Inc. in October at a valuation of $2.9 billion, aims to have four vehicles to market by 2025. One of those, Fisker hinted at Tuesday, could be a luxury vehicle which he called the “UFO” that will use the company&#8217;s FM29 platform architecture.</p>
<h2>Fisker&#8217;s carbon-neutral plan</h2>
<p>Other companies across industries have made promises to hit that carbon-neutral goal before. Henrik Fisker emphasized to investors that the company will not purchase carbon offsets to accomplish that climate-neutrality goal. Carbon offsets are credits that companies can purchase to “claim” a reduction in CO2 toward their project or product. Instead, Fisker said they will work with suppliers to develop climate-neutral materials and manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>The company lays out some of its proposed strategies on its <a href="https://www.fiskerinc.com/climate-neutral-vehicle">website</a>, where it splits the vehicle lifecycle into five phases: upstream sourcing, manufacturing and assembly, logistics, the use phase and end-of-life. For each phase, the company lists a few bullet points, such as localizing manufacturing. Even with these plans, achieving climate neutrality in vehicle production will be extremely difficult. Vehicles use materials and components such as steel that are notoriously hard to decarbonize, for example.</p>

<p>Fisker said that the company’s manufacturing partners have climate-neutral goals of their own, which is true for automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr. The company inked a deal with Fisker to exclusively manufacturer the Fisker Ocean in Europe. Magna set a target of climate neutrality for its European operations by 2025 and globally by 2030. Foxconn, Fisker’s other major partner for its second, lower-price vehicle dubbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">Project PEAR</a>, also has a net-zero emissions goal, but it is set for the middle of the century.</p>
<p>Moonshot goals such as this one could help push innovation in manufacturing processes and encourage other automakers and suppliers to reach for the same targets. Other automakers such as Polestar and Porsche have all made carbon-neutral promises with deadlines of 2030, while Mercedes has said it will hit that target in 2039.</p>
<p>Fisker does seem to have a plan for how it might be able to recycle or reuse some of its EV batteries once they&#8217;re no longer useful in the vehicle. The company plans to extend its leasing program across the entire estimated 15-year lifespan of the vehicle, which would theoretically ensure that Fisker will be in possession of a number of its vehicles when they reach end-of-life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple in 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">closed its $400 million acquisition</a> of music recognition app Shazam. Now, it&#8217;s bringing Shazam&#8217;s audio recognition capabilities to app developers in the form of the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shazamkit/">ShazamKit</a>. The new framework will allow app developers &#8212; including those on both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shazamkit">Apple platforms</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shazamkit/android/">Android</a> &#8212; to build apps that can identify music from Shazam&#8217;s huge database of songs, or even from their own custom catalog of pre-recorded audio.</p>
<p>Many consumers are already familiar with the mobile app Shazam, which lets you push a button to identify what song you&#8217;re hearing, and then take other actions &#8212; like viewing the lyrics, adding the song to a playlist, exploring music trends, and more. Having first launched in 2008, Shazam was already one of the oldest apps on the App Store when Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/sources-apple-is-acquiring-music-recognition-app-shazam/">snatched</a> it up.</p>
<p>Now the company is putting Shazam to better use than being just a music identification utility. With the new ShazamKit, developers will now be able to leverage Shazam&#8217;s audio recognition capabilities to create their own app experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are three parts to the new framework: Shazam catalog recognition, which lets developers add song recognition to their apps; custom catalog recognition, which performs on-device matching against arbitrary audio; and library management.</p>
<p>Shazam catalog recognition is what you probably think of when you think of the Shazam experience today. The technology can recognize the song that&#8217;s playing in the environment and then fetch the song&#8217;s metadata, like the title and artist. The ShazamKit API will also be able to return other metadata like genre or album art, for example. And it can identify where in the audio the match occurred.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2163306" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?w=374" alt="" width="374" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg 694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=82,150 82w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=165,300 165w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=374,680 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-3.42.16-PM.jpg?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p>When matching music, Shazam doesn&#8217;t actually match the audio itself, to be clear. Instead, it creates a lossy representation of it, called a signature, and matches against that. This method greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network. Signatures also cannot be used to reconstruct the original audio, which protects user privacy.</p>
<p>The Shazam catalog comprises millions of songs and is hosted in cloud and maintained by Apple. It&#8217;s regularly updated with new tracks as they become available.</p>
<p>When a customer uses a developer&#8217;s third-party app for music recognition via ShazamKit, they may want to save the song in their Shazam library. This is found in the Shazam app, if the user has it installed, or it can be accessed by long pressing on the music recognition Control Center module. The library is also synced across devices.</p>
<p>Apple suggests that apps make their users aware that recognized songs will be saved to this library, as there&#8217;s no special permission required to write to the library.</p>

<p>ShazamKit&#8217;s custom catalog recognition feature, meanwhile, could be used to create synced activities or other second-screen experiences in apps by recognizing the developer&#8217;s audio, not that from the Shazam music catalog.</p>
<p>This could allow for educational apps where students follow along with a video lesson, where some portion of the lesson&#8217;s audio could prompt an activity to begin in the student&#8217;s companion app. It could also be used to enable mobile shopping experiences that popped up as you watched a favorite TV show.</p>
<p>ShazamKit is current in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/shazamkit">beta</a> on iOS 15.0+, macOS 12.0+, Mac Catalyst 15.0+, tvOS 15.0+, and watchOS 8.0+. On <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shazamkit/android/">Android</a>, ShazamKit comes in the form of an Android Archive (AAR) file and supports music and custom audio, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>, app and game designer Panic&#8217;s first shot at hardware, finally has a firm price and ship date, as well as a bunch of surprise features cooked up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/panics-playmate-is-a-pint-sized-gaming-machine-with-a-season-of-12-intriguing-titles/">since its announcement in 2019</a>. The tiny handheld gaming console will cost $179, ship later this year and come with a 24-game &#8220;season&#8221; doled out over 12 weeks. But now it also has a cute speaker dock and low-code game creation platform.</p>
<p>We first heard about Playdate more than two years ago, were charmed by its clean look, funky crank control, and black and white display, and have been waiting for news ever since. Panic&#8217;s impeccable design credentials combined with Teenage Engineering&#8217;s creative hardware chops? It&#8217;s bound to be a joy to use, but there wasn&#8217;t much more than that to go on.</p>
<p>Now the company has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeWGukDrc1U">revealed all the important details</a> we were hoping for, and many more, to boot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163268" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163268" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163268" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg" alt="The Playdate handheld with a person playing a game on it." width="1024" height="627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg 1466w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-play.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163268" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Panic</p></div></p>
<p>Originally we were expecting 12 games to be delivered over 12 weeks, but in the intervening period it seems they&#8217;ve collected more titles than planned, and that initial &#8220;season&#8221; of games has expanded to 24. No one knows exactly what to expect from these games except that they&#8217;re exclusive to the Playdate and many use the crank mechanic in what appear to be fun and interesting ways: turning a turntable, opening a little door, doing tricks as a surfer, and so on.</p>
<p>The team hasn&#8217;t decided how future games will be distributed, though they seem to have some ideas. Another season? One-off releases? Certainly the presence of a new game by one-man indie hit parade Lucas Pope would sell like hotcakes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163265" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163265" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png" alt="Screenshots of the Pulp game creation tool." width="1024" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png 1701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=1536,697 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/devtools-screenshots.39d1689b7a5f.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Panic</p></div></p>
<p>But the debut of a new lo-fi game development platform called Pulp suggests a future where self-publishing may also be an option. This lovely little web-based tool lets anyone put together a game using presets for things like controls and actions, and may prove to be a sort of tiny Twine in time.</p>
<p>A dock accessory was announced as well, something to keep your Playdate front and center on your desk. The speaker-equipped dock, also a lemony yellow, acts as a magnetic charging cradle for the console, activating a sort of stationary mode with a clock and music player (Poolsuite.fm, apparently, with original relaxing tunes). It even has two holes in which to put your pens (and Panic made a special yellow pen just for the purpose as well).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163267" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163267" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg" alt="Playdate attached to its little cubical dock." width="1024" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/playdate-dock.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Panic</p></div></p>
<p>The $179 price may cause some to balk — after all, it&#8217;s considerably more than a Nintendo 3DS and with the dock probably approaches the price of a Switch. But this isn&#8217;t meant to be a competitor with mainstream gaming — instead, it&#8217;s a sort of anti-establishment system that embraces weirdness and provides something equally unfamiliar and undeniably fun.</p>
<p>The team says that there will be a week&#8217;s warning before orders can be placed, and that they don&#8217;t plan to shut orders down if inventory runs out, but simply allow people to preorder and cancel at will until they receive their unit. Shipping will begin in late 2021, and if the 20,000 units in the initial run don&#8217;t cover it, they&#8217;ll make more and ship as they come in.</p>
<p>We hope to get one ourselves to test and review, but since part of the charm of the whole thing is the timed release and social aspect of discovery and sharing, it&#8217;s more than likely we&#8217;ll be experiencing it along with everyone else.</p>
<p>(This article originally stated Playdate ships next month, but it will actually ship later — preorders begin next month.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toast has raised more than $900 billion and is reportedly valued at over $5 billion. But back in 2011, no one knew this startup would see such meteoric success. It had a few things going for it, of course — founder Aman Narang hailed from Endeca, where he was a software engineer and product lead with a reputation for being able to ship a lot of software quickly.</p>
<p>But the ambitions behind Toast were big and complicated, and enough to give pause to any investor. Kent Bennett was one such VC, and while he had conviction in the founding team, he wasn&#8217;t convinced that they could tackle such a big problem.</p>
<p>Toast is a restaurant POS system that acts as a sort of operating system for an establishment, managing everything from online orders, deliveries and marketing to payroll and team management as well as the actual point of sale. Being able to do all that requires building a number of complex products, such as payments.</p>
<p>Early on, Bennett had told Narang not to build a restaurant POS. To him, it was too complicated and nuanced, which is why the systems from the &#8217;90s were still deeply entrenched 20 years later. However, he did offer space in the Bessemer office for the Toast team to work on their product.</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught up with Aman and he told me that they did this interesting thing after hearing that a lot of their customers were frustrated by payments platforms, which are separate from the POS,&#8221; said Bennett. &#8220;Aman said they built their own payments platform. Once again, I was like, &#8216;You did what? You&#8217;re not allowed to build payments.&#8217; But he told me that they built it and it improves their products, and that, by the way, they make a margin on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bennett said that when they added up the margins from the payments and the POS, it was impactful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hit me like a ton of bricks,&#8221; said Bennett. &#8220;This is a really good business.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, it became his obsession. And though it took a few more quarters to close the deal, they eventually got there. Bessemer led the company&#8217;s Series B financing in 2016.</p>
<p>We spoke to Bennett and Narang recently on an episode of Extra Crunch Live to explore the story of how they came together for the deal, what makes the difference for both founders and investors when fundraising, and the biggest lessons they&#8217;ve learned so far. The episode also featured the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where audience members pitched their products to Bennett and Narang and received live feedback.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is open to everyone each Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT, but only Extra Crunch members are able to stream these sessions afterward and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/">watch previous shows on-demand</a> in our episode library.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of the Toast system, or maybe because of it, Narang says the fundamentals are the most important part of communicating the business, especially when fundraising.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With increased demand from the pandemic, Canalys reports that <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/us-pc-market-q1-2021?ctid=2122-fb76209fd80bef7f0644eb40d74d243f">U.S. PC shipments were up 73%</a> over the same period last year. That added up to a total of 34 million units sold. While Apple had a good quarter with sales up 36%, it was surpassed by HP, which sold 11 million units in total with annual growth up an astonishing 122.6%.</p>
<p>As Canalys pointed out, the first quarter tends to be a weaker one for Apple hardware following the holiday season, but it&#8217;s a big move for HP nonetheless. Other companies boasting big growth numbers include Samsung at 116% and Lenovo at 92.8%. Dell was up 29.2%, fairly modest compared with the rest of the group.</p>
<p>Overall though it was a stunning quarter as units flew off the shelves. Canalys Research Analyst Brian Lynch says some of this can be attributed to the increased demand from 2020 as people moved to work and school from home and needed new machines to get their work done, but regardless the growth was unrivaled historically. &#8221; … Q1 2021 still rates as one of the best first quarters the industry has ever seen. Vendors have prioritized fulfilling U.S. backlogs before supply issues are addressed in other parts of the world,&#8221; Lynch said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, low-cost Chromebooks were the most popular item as people looking to refresh their devices, especially for education purposes, turned to the lower end of the PC market, which likely had a negative impact on higher-priced Apple products, as well contributing to its drop from the top spot.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Samsung and other Chromebook vendors really shined. The firm reports that over the last year Chromebook sales shot up 548% with Samsung leading that growth with an astonishing 1,963% growth rate. Asus, HP and Lenovo all reported Chromebook sales rates up over 900%.</p>
<p>Those numbers include desktops, notebooks, tablets and workstations, but it was the notebook and tablets that get the bulk of the action here with notebooks up a whopping 131% YoY. While tablets didn&#8217;t grow at the same rate, sales were still up 51% with 11 million units sold in the quarter.</p>
<p>The company does not expect the market to slow significantly in the coming quarters with continued demand in the education market. While parts shortages, particularly in the chip market, continue to dog the industry, this will only continue to feed demand in the coming quarters, according to the firm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s only been nine months since Dispo rebranded from David’s Disposable. But the vintage-inspired photo-sharing app has experienced a whiplash of ups and downs, mostly due to the brand’s original namesake, YouTuber David Dobrik.</p>
<p>Like Clubhouse, Dispo was one of this year’s most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html">hyped up</a> new social apps, requiring an invite from an existing member to join. On March 9, when the company said “<a href="https://twitter.com/DispoHQ/status/1369380343963324421">goodbye waitlist</a>” and opened the app to any iOS user, Dispo looked poised to be a worthy competitor to photo-sharing behemoths like Instagram. But, just one week later, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">Business Insider reported</a> on sexual assault allegations regarding a member of Vlog Squad, a YouTube prank ensemble headed by Dispo co-founder David Dobrik. Dobrik had posted a now-deleted vlog about the night of the alleged assault, joking, “<a href="https://twitter.com/defnoodles/status/1372024094867091461">we’re all going to jail</a>” at the end of the video.</p>
<p>It was only after venture capital firm Spark Capital decided to “sever all ties” with Dispo that Dobrik stepped down from the company board. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">a statement made to TechCrunch</a> at the time, Dispo said, “Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly — our community — stand for building a diverse, inclusive and empowering world.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dispo capitalizes on Gen Z and young millennial nostalgia for a time before digital photography, when we couldn’t take 30 selfies before choosing which one to post. On Dispo, when you take a photo, you have to wait until 9 AM the following day for the image to “develop,” and only then can you view and share it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spark Capital decides to &#8216;sever all ties&#8217; with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/embed/#?secret=xJsNqszNav" data-secret="xJsNqszNav" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In both February and March of this year, the app hit the top 10 of the Photo &amp; Video category in the U.S. App Store. Despite the backlash against Dobrik, which resulted in the app’s product page being bombarded with negative comments, the app still hit the top 10 in Germany, Japan and Brazil, according to their press release. Dispo reportedly has not yet expended any international marketing resources.</p>
<p>Now, early investors in Dispo like Spark Capital, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled have committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">donate any potential profits</a> from their investment in the app to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault. Though Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-david-dobriks-retro-photo-app-dispo-raises-20-million-0a056861-6ea2-46d2-92af-eda697eb179b.html">reported the app’s $20 million Series A funding</a> news in February, Dispo put out a press release this morning confirming the financing event. Seven Seven Six and Unshackled Ventures remain listed as investors, while Spark Capital is not. Other notable names involved in the project include high-profile photographers like Annie Leibovitz and Raven B. Varona, who has worked with artists like Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Actresses Cara Delevingne and Sofía Vergara, as well as NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, are also involved with the app as investors or advisors.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Early investors in Dispo to donate any potential profits from the photo-sharing app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/embed/#?secret=3LlcnwhIH2" data-secret="3LlcnwhIH2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dobrik’s role in the company was largely as a marketer &#8212; CEO Daniel Liss co-founded the app with Dobrik and has been leading the team since the beginning. After Dobrik’s departure, the Dispo team &#8212; which remains less than 20 members strong &#8212; took a break from communications and product updates on the app. It’s expected that after today’s funding confirmation, the app will continue to roll out updates.</p>
<p>Dispo is quick to shift focus to the work of their team, which they call “some of the most talented, diverse leaders in consumer tech.” With the capital from this funding round, they hope to hire more staff to become more competitive with major social media apps with expansive teams, like Instagram and TikTok, and to experiment with machine learning. They will also likely have some serious marketing to do, now that their attempt at influencer marketing has failed massively.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, Dispo is promoting the app as a mental health benefit, hoping to shift the tide away from manufactured perfectionism toward more authentic social media experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new era of startups must emerge to end the scourge of big tech’s destruction of our political fabric and willful ignorance of its impact on body dysmorphia and mental health,&#8221; CEO Daniel Liss writes in a Substack post titled <a href="https://dlisscious.substack.com/p/dispo-20">Dispo 2.0</a>. &#8220;Imagine a world where Dispo is the social network of choice for every teen and college student in the world. How different a world would that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>But, for an app that propelled to success off the fame of a YouTuber with a history of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/04/david-dobrik-allegations-controversies-timeline.html">less than savory behavior</a>, that messaging might fall flat.</p>
<p>According to Sensor Tower, the highest Dispo has ever ranked in the Photo &amp; Video category on the U.S. App Store was in January 2020, when it was still called David&#8217;s Disposable. The app ranked No. 1 in that category from January 7 to January 9, and on January 8, it reached No. 1 among all free iPhone apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’d be forgiven for being confused. I’ve been following this story and am currently writing it and I&#8217;m still fairly confused. But <a href="https://linktr.ee/turntablettfm">Turntable (or tt.fm)</a>, not to be confused with Turntable.fm (the name of both the original and recently re-released social music app) today just announced that it has launched iOS, Android and desktop versions of its own service.</p>
<p>By way of brief explanation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/turntable-fm-shutting-down-so-company-can-focus-on-turntable-live-events-platform/">the original Turntable.fm shut down in 2013</a> to focus on a live music platform. It was a sad day for those of us who wasted countless workday hours on the site. But stuff happens. People change, companies pivot.</p>
<p>Of course, that nostalgia returned something fierce when we were all stuck inside for the past year, searching for a social connection. Those of us of a certain age who maybe haven’t gone all in on Twitch started pining for the site. So founder Billy Chasen planned a return. In its current beta iteration, it’s a bit of a time capsule, albeit with a few key changes like relying on YouTube streaming to circumvent some royalty issues. It works well. I’ve been using it. It’s fun. Oh, and the company just raised $7.5 million to bring it into the new decade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Seemingly around the same time, an early Turntable.fm employee decided to launch another take on the service. Focused on mobile usage and opting for the crowdfunding route, TT.fm rode that wave of nostalgia to $500,000 in funding, announced back in March.</p>
<p>Today that service is launching in beta. It’s in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as we speak. Or you can visit it in a browser. Like Turntable.fm, tt.fm (as we’re going to refer to it for simplicity’s sake) relies on third-party music services. At launch, music is pulled from a linked Spotify or Apple Music account, as well as Soundcloud. YouTube functionality is coming soon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rdTlliIThb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/call-it-a-comeback-turntable-fm-raises-7-5m/">Call it a comeback: Turntable.fm raises $7.5M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Call it a comeback: Turntable.fm raises $7.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/call-it-a-comeback-turntable-fm-raises-7-5m/embed/#?secret=rdTlliIThb" data-secret="rdTlliIThb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you can see from the above shot, the offering is based on the same format as Turntable.fm, with similar but different graphics. DJs play songs on the stage and the audience bops their heads in approval if they like it. One of the ways the new offering is looking to distinguish itself is through hosted DJ sets from artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Original Turntable fans are eager to get back on the dancefloor and have been asking for a product that serves their needs,” Perla said in a release, &#8220;including live DJ sets, social networking with music fans, music sharing and an online music community.”</p>
<p>As a fan of Turntable.fm, suddenly going from zero to two services feels like an embarrassment of riches. But the question remains whether it can move beyond a niche and really thrive in the crowded media environment of 2021. There’s probably room for one Turntable.fm.</p>
<p>But two? This already strange story is likely only getting stranger.</p>
