										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of a pickup truck is not all about torque, horsepower, towing and hauling. Ford’s newest electric F-150 Lightning, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">unveiled Wednesday</a>, is trying to change the meaning of truck power with a system that can provide energy to a customer&#8217;s home in the event of an outage.</span></p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t alone in its effort to show consumers the benefits of an all-electric vehicle. Others, such as Lucid Motors have also touted this capability.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe winter storms in February caused a massive power outage in Texas, with more than 4.5 million homes and businesses left without power for days. 151 people were killed as a result. The F-150 Lightning&#8217;s 9.6 kW of Back Up Power can provide full home power for up to three days on a full charge of battery.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your F-150 Lightning is plugged in when your outage occurs, intelligent backup power will automatically kick in to power your home,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s energy services lead, in a video briefing prior to the reveal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When power is restored, the truck automatically reverts to charging its battery.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar, battery storage and energy services provider Sunrun has partnered with Ford to install the 80-amp Ford Charge Station Pro and home integration system, which comes standard with the extended range battery, to power the intelligent backup power system. While they’re in the neighborhood, Sunrun will also give customers the option of installing a solar and battery system for their home. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155195" style="width: 8810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155195" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2155195 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg" alt="Ford F-150 EV lightning" width="8800" height="4950" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg 8800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8800px) 100vw, 8800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2155195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who want to spend time away from home, an additional 9.6 kW Pro Power Onboard battery source, which is up from 7.2kW in the F-150 hybrid, can power anything from loudspeakers and TVs to electric dirt bikes, circular saws and jackhammers. The truck features 11 outlets in the bed, the cabin interior and the mega power “frunk” AKA front trunk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery also distributes power intelligently. So if a driver is at a worksite powering tools and the battery level falls below a third of its total range, the driver will get a notification so they can decide if they want to keep at it or save the juice for driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers also don’t need to think too much about where the nearest charging station is. They can set it and forget it, letting the truck handle switching off pro power onboard if the battery level approaches the distance it takes to get to the nearest charge. Charge information both for the Back Up Power and the Pro Power are reflected on the Ford app and the car&#8217;s infotainment screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the F-150 Lightning currently can give your home the backup power it needs, in the future, the aim is for subsequent models to be used as a home management tool, according to a Ford spokesperson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“F-150 Lightning is reinventing the idea of vehicle power,” said O’Gorman.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Ford F-150, the profitable cornerstone of the U.S. automaker&#8217;s business, now has an all-electric sibling.</p>
<p>Ford unveiled Wednesday the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric pickup truck that is a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $22 billion investment into electrification. The vehicle is one of a trifecta of Ford EV debuts and launches in the past year. And it is possibly the most meaningful in terms of the bottom line. The Ford F-150 Lightning, which will be built at the automaker&#8217;s Rouge factory in Dearborn, Michigan, follows the introduction of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E and the E-Transit, a configurable all-electric cargo van focused on commercial customers.</p>
<p>Ford had a challenging gig with the F-150 Lightning. The truck would need everything that has made its gas-powered counterpart the best-selling vehicle in North America as well as new benefits that come from going electric. That means torque, performance, towing capability and the general layout has to meet the needs of its customers, many of whom use it for commercial purposes. The vehicle specs suggest that Ford has delivered on the torque and power, while keeping the same cab and bed dimensions as its gas counterpart.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That last detail is notable because by keeping the same dimensions, it is able to accommodate the thousands of F-150 truck accessories that exist today. If Ford has any hope of converting its current customer base, decisions like this one matter.</p>
<p>Will it convert or will the F-150 Lightning attract a whole new group of customers? It&#8217;s a question that won&#8217;t be answered until it comes to market in spring 2022.</p>
<p>The Lightning will be a hit for Ford, according to analysts like iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ford went well beyond installing a battery pack in a traditional F-150,&#8221; Brauer said. &#8220;The automaker&#8217;s comprehensive approach to the Lightning&#8217;s design, performance, and advanced features would make it a desirable truck with a traditional engine. The electric powertrain, and the instant torque and increased cargo and towing capacity that come with it, along with the ability to seamlessly power a house for multiple days, are additional benefits beyond the Lightning&#8217;s sleek styling, rapid acceleration, and high-tech amenities. It&#8217;s obvious Ford recognizes both the opportunity and risk presented by the shift toward electric vehicles, and the automaker has clearly committed to keeping the F-150 viable in a battery-powered world.&#8221;</p>
<p><div style="width: 2160px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2155171-1" width="2160" height="2160" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will be offered in four trims, which includes the base, XLT, Lariat and Platinum series, and two battery options. The truck, which has an aluminum alloy body, is powered by two in-board electric motors, comes standard with four-wheel drive, and has an independent rear suspension. Ford is only releasing two prices at the moment. The base version will be priced at $39,974 before any federal or state tax credits, while the mid-series XLT model will start at $52,974.</p>
<p>The overall length of the standard-range battery model (specs from other trims are yet to be published) is 232.7 inches, one inch longer than the gas-powered F-150. The Lightning&#8217;s wheelbase is essentially the same, with just one-tenth of an inch separating it from its combustion engine and hybrid cousins.</p>
<p>One notable difference between the electric and gas 4&#215;4 versions of the F-150 is the ground clearance. The Lightning has ground clearance of 8.9 inches compared to 9.4 in the original F-150. That half-inch loss is possibly caused by the metal skid plates that are meant to protect the battery and inboard motors from the terrain.</p>
<p>The standard battery range truck delivers a targeted 426 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque. The F-150 Lightning equipped with the extended-range battery helps push the horsepower to 563 (or 420 kW) and has the same torque, which Ford says is the most of any F-150 ever.</p>
<p>The vehicle&#8217;s battery has a targeted range of 230 miles in the standard and pops up to 300 miles in the extended version. One question remains: how will the range be affected by towing a boat or trailer?</p>
<p>Ford doesn&#8217;t provide that information, and until the EPA gives its estimated range and people start towing cars, boats and snowmobiles, it might not clear.</p>
<p>Ford does point to two features meant to help drivers understand just how far they can travel before charging. The first is called &#8220;onboard scales,&#8221; which uses sensors on the truck to estimate payload so drivers know the weight of what they&#8217;re hauling. Now, payload &#8212; the weight a truck can carry &#8212; is different from towing capacity, which is the weight it can tow. But &#8220;onboard scales&#8221; work alongside yet another feature called &#8220;intelligent range,&#8221; which takes into consideration towing info, payload, weather and more, according to Ford.</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t backing away from payload and towing capacity. Ford notes that the new frame on the truck uses the strongest steel ever put in an F-150 frame and supports a maximum 2,000-pound payload and up to 10,000-pound towing capacity.</p>
<h2>Inside the Lightning</h2>
<p>Just like the newly refreshed gas-powered F-150, the Lightning is filled with connected car tech and advanced driving assistance features. The higher level trims of the Lightning — the Lariat and Platinum versions — will come with Ford&#8217;s Sync 4A infotainment system that can support over-the-air software updates. That means the system rollout upgrades to the vehicle, such as adding or improving driver assistance features and keeping maps up to date. SYNC 4 will offer third-party apps through its AppLink system, including Waze and a version of Amazon&#8217;s Alexa called Ford+Alexa.</p>
<p>The Sync 4A system, which will feature natural voice control and real time mapping, will be displayed on a 15.5-inch touchscreen that looks a lot like what is inside the new Mustang Mach-E electric crossover. In front of the driver is a 12-inch instrument cluster that can be customized. This digital cluster will also relay important information to the driver on how the battery is operating, the regenerative braking and the advanced driver assistance system functions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really is the smartest F-150 we&#8217;ve ever made,&#8221; said Darren Palmer, general manager of battery electric vehicles at Ford Motor Company. &#8220;F-150 Lightning offers an immersive touch screen,<br />
giving our customers all the info they want in an instant &#8212; a real-time view of where they&#8217;re going, what they&#8217;re hauling or how much real-world range they&#8217;ve got banked. And with Ford<br />
Power-Up software updates, the experience is only going to get better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will also offer Blue Cruise, the automaker&#8217;s new hands-free driving feature, which will also be available on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year. That hands-free capability &#8212; which uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition &#8212; has undergone some 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford emphasized in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">announcement in April</a>. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver&#8217;s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p>The hands-free system will be available on vehicles equipped with Ford&#8217;s Co-Pilot360 Technology and will only work on certain sections of divided highways. The system, which will be rolled out via software updates later this year, will initially be available on more than 100,000 miles of highways in North America.</p>
<h2>Charging and power</h2>
<p>Charging is of course critical to driving any electric vehicle. But it isn&#8217;t just about having the ability to plug in. Communicating how, when and where is the crux. Ford said customers will receive a<br />
notification if their truck&#8217;s battery falls below one-third of its total range. The intelligent range, which as noted above takes into consideration towing info, payload, weather, is also communicated to the driver. The accompanying FordPass app also gives customers information on charging locations. Inside the vehicle, a driver can use the infotainment system to identify and navigate to charging stations.</p>
<p>The truck also has onboard power source, which in the standard trim offers 2.4 kilowatts of power while Lariat and Platinum series come standard with 9.6 kilowatts of power — a combination of up to 2.4 kilowatts available through the truck&#8217;s so-called &#8220;mega power frunk&#8221; and up to 7.2 kilowatts through outlets in the cab and bed.</p>
<p>Ford also touted its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> 9.6 kW of back up power, which it says can provide energy to a home during a blackout for three days and as many as 10 with rationing. </span></p>

<p>Founded in 2014, <a href="https://www.greatdealscorp.com/">Great Deals </a>is an e-commerce enabler that helps brands like Abbot, L’Oréal and Unilever build their online retail operations in the Philippines. The startup announced today that it has raised $30 million in Series B funding led by <a href="https://www.fastlogistics.com.ph/">Fast Group</a>, one of the Philippines’ biggest logistics firms, with support from CVC Capital Partners. Navegar, which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/great-deals-e-commerce">led Great Deals&#8217; Series A</a>, also returned for this round.</p>
<p>The transaction was advised by Rocket Equities. The investment by Fast Group, which has a fleet of more than 2,500 vehicles and 90,000 stores in its distribution network, marks the beginning of a strategic partnership. Great Deals will use part of the new capital to build an automated fulfillment center, and the deal will help it increase its penetration outside the Greater Manila Area and offer more Instant Commerce, or deliveries under one hour.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Happy Wednesday, friends! It was another super-busy day in the tech world. I had my sights on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/as-q2s-lull-fades-unicorn-ipos-are-revving-up/">Squarespace’s public debut</a>, as well as the value of Coinbase’s stock, which may be tracking the price of bitcoin a bit more literally than some folks expected. And if you are a long-term crypto holder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/bitcoin-crashes-as-investors-fear-crypto-bull-market-could-be-nearing-its-end/">congrats on the buying opportunity</a>. If you are a short-term crypto holder, yes, you can have a drink now regardless of what time it is. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/india-tells-whatsapp-to-withdraw-its-new-policy-terms/">Whatsapp v. India</a>:</strong> The scrap between <strong>Facebook’s Whatsapp</strong> service and the Indian government continued today as the nation-state “once again directed the Facebook-owned company to withdraw the planned update.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/">Telehealth + fertility</a>:</strong> Famous for its initial men’s health products, <strong>Ro</strong> (née Roman) purchased <strong>Modern Fertility</strong> today, a fertility-focused startup founded in 2017. Our question is how Ro’s telehealth approach will fit with reproductive health.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap/">Squarespace flops</a>:</strong> <strong>Squarespace’s</strong> direct listing set a reference price of $50, valuing the company sharply lower than its final private price ($10 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation/">set earlier this year</a>). Then its stock fell further.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>From the <strong>TechCrunch Events</strong> side of things, Tess Hatch, a vice president and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, is </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/bessemers-tess-hatch-will-join-us-as-a-judge-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/"><em>coming to Disrupt</em></a><em>. Which is very hype.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We’re shaking things up today and talking about product first and venture capital rounds second. Sound good?</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/otter-ais-new-assistant-can-automatically-transcribe-your-zoom-meetings/"><strong>Otter.ai’s</strong> new product: Otter Assistant</a>. It can transcribe your <strong>Zoom</strong> calls. For reporters, this is <em>huge</em> as a note-taking tool. But it will likely find even broader remit in the business world. Don’t forget that Otter raised $50 million just a few months ago. (For more on the voice transcription space, check out <strong>Deepgram’s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/deepgram-raises-12m-for-enterprise-speech-recognition/">2020-era funding round.</a>)</p>
<p>Second in the product category, <strong>Liquid Instruments</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/liquid-instruments-raises-13-7m-to-bring-its-education-focused-8-in-1-engineering-gadget-to-market/">raised $13.7 million</a> to bring its <strong>Moku:Go</strong> product to classrooms and labs everywhere. What does the Go do? It “combines several commonly used tools into one compact package, saving room on your workbench or classroom while also providing a modern, software-configurable interface,” TechCrunch reported.</p>
<p>Moving onto some purely financial coverage from startup-land, here are four neat rounds we dug into more deeply:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/construction-tech-startup-assignar-raises-20m-in-fifth-wall-led-series-b/"><strong>$20M for Assignar</strong></a>: Construction tech is a busy sector, not merely because the construction sector is itself rather active; the digital transformation push that we’ve seen around the business is also touching down in the world of mortar and bricks. Its software helps contractors and subcontractors “connect to the field and vice versa,” according to its CEO Sean McCreanor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Fellow construction tech player <strong>Procore</strong> is going public as we speak. So the market that Assignar is playing in is active in both early- and late-stage terms.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/formlabs-raises-150m/"><strong>$150M for Formlabs</strong></a>: 3D printing has come of age, it appears, as Massachusetts-based Formlabs closed a nine-figure round for its printing tech. SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the round, which values the company at around $2 billion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Formlabs wants to improve 3D printing machines while also making them cheaper. If it can pull that off, whole sectors could be shaken up.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/super-raises-50m-to-cover-home-repairs-and-maintenance-via-a-subscription-model/"><strong>$50M for Super</strong></a>: If you own a home, you are familiar with how rapidly entropy will ensure that you have a regular stream of repair bills. Why not convert those into a monthly subscription? That’s what Super is working to do, and now it has cash to pursue its vision after growing 7x since last April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care</em></strong><em><strong>?</strong> The subscription push is far more than merely an enterprise-software affair, or something related to consumer entertainment. Anything as a service is where we are in 2021.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/"><strong>$250M for Pipe</strong></a>: Pipe is a platform that allows companies to sell their future, predictable revenue streams to investors. It’s best known for working with SaaS companies, but is expanding into other business types as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Pipe has been growing at a torrid pace, and raising capital at a similar clip. It’s either onto something super huge, or the market for financial products is just bonkers for now. Either way, it’s an interesting option for software startups hunting for cash.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>5 innovative fundraising methods for emerging VCs and PEs</h2>
<p>According to David Teten, founder of Versatile VC, five new strategies are gaining traction among fund managers looking to raise capital from family offices and high-net-worth individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online communities and virtual events.</li>
<li>Platforms that help other investors access your fund.</li>
<li>Soliciting under the 506(c) designation.</li>
<li>Launching a rolling fund.</li>
<li>Crowdfunding from retail investors into a general partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a summary of a class he taught for the Oper8r VC fund accelerator, Teten offers actionable advice for anyone who wants to connect with pre-qualified investors.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today from the world of Big Tech, we’re pausing to listen to our own Editor in Chief <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer">Matthew Panzarino</a> discuss the new iPad Pro, which he thinks has amazing hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen:</strong> “The mini-LED-driven Liquid Retina XDR display is probably the best display that’s ever shipped on a mobile computer. It’s just fantastic.”</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> “The M1 chip is absolutely blistering.”</li>
<li><strong>Imaging: </strong>“The new iPad Pro cameras are pretty fantastic; both front and back are now very usable and the new front camera especially benefits from an increase in resolution and new wide-angle optics.”</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard: </strong>“The overall feel of the keyboard is still great, a really nice typing experience.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But then there’s the software. Which Panzarino is not stoked about. It’s aging, he argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other side of this coin that isn’t so shiny is the iPad’s aging software. It’s just as good as it was when I wrote my review of the iPad Pro in 2020 — at which point my conclusions were “you can adapt to it but it could be better.” That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years, I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability.</p>
<p>I have a very simple ask for the iPad’s software: I want to feel the same energy, vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple has now come to the crossroad that Microsoft tried to meet with Windows 8 and failed; how do you build an OS that serves either two form factors (touch and mobile, and desktop) well, or two OSs that can share enough third-party software so that neither is neglected? We’ll know more at WWDC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I would also count myself as a serial entrepreneur because I've been doing this for more than 20 years."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle company Arrival wants to break the current auto manufacturing model. Instead of one giant factory and an assembly line, Arrival’s commercial electric vans, buses and cars are robotically built in small, regional microfactories, of which the company wants to open 31 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you want to achieve something radically more efficient, you have to go deeper, into complex, high-level computational algorithms that are not normally used in consumer-facing products.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The London-based company, founded in 2015, joined the ranks of EV companies going public via SPAC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/">merging with blank-check company CIIG Merger Corp</a>. in March. UPS has already ordered 10,000 of Arrival’s robotically engineered vans, and the company recently signed a deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/uber-and-arrival-partner-to-create-an-ev-for-ride-hail-drivers/">Uber to create purpose-built EVs for ride-hail drivers</a>.</p>
<p>Arrival founder Denis Sverdlov has been at the intersection of technological advancement and societal change before. Born in the nation of Georgia, Sverdlov founded his first company at 22 selling IT consulting software to enterprise customers. Since then, he has built and exited multiple companies, most notably telecommunications operator Yota Group. Founded in 2007, the same year the iPhone came out, Yota eventually launched a 4G network across Russia, coupling it with an HTC smartphone that would facilitate the use of the network. Sverdlov sold the company in 2012 for $1.5 billion, did a brief stint as the Russian deputy communications and mass media minister, and then went on to start Arrival. Oh, and he founded electric autonomous car race <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/1457671/">Roborace</a> in 2015, too, just ‘cause.</p>
<p>With the same sense that fast, mobile internet and big screens would change the telecoms industry back in 2007, Sverdlov began to see a perfect storm brewing in the EV world over the last decade. In 2015, he founded Arrival in anticipation of a switch to electric as well as advancements happening in material, research and development in the robotics industry. He predicts this will have an even bigger impact on the automotive industry than 4G had on telecommunications.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Denis, your first company was a telecom operator and you were behind the creation of Roborace. Now you&#8217;re trying to change the way the auto industry makes cars with Arrival. Are you a serial entrepreneur who is already thinking about the next thing? Or are you pretty involved in this one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dennis Sverdlov: </strong>Yeah, I&#8217;m quite involved with Arrival, and I expect to see many new technologies and enablers come out of this journey. For example, if you take our robotic technologies, which we use for microfactories, you can easily see how that will be used in other industries, as well, so it&#8217;s not going to be used only for automotive.</p>
<p>But as a company, we need to focus on what we do today because we need to achieve a lot here, and I think it&#8217;s important to focus on that. But, yeah, I would also count myself as a serial entrepreneur because I&#8217;ve been doing this for more than 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think that your past business decisions have informed your current strategy with Arrival?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric aviation company Wisk Aero filed a motion for a preliminary injunction Wednesday in its ongoing lawsuit with rival electric air travel startup Archer Aviation. The injunction could put a serious wrench in Archer’s operations should the courts approve it.</p>
<p>Wisk has asked the court to immediately prohibit Archer from using 52 trade secrets that it alleges were stolen by former employees who were later hired by Archer. The trade secrets “span the gamut of systems within the aircraft and processes for development,” a Wisk spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“This a baseless motion in a baseless lawsuit,&#8221; an Archer spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Archer independently designed its aircraft, before any employees from Wisk joined Archer, and Archer looks forward to demonstrating that in court. Archer is moving forward with its business plans, including the development, certification and production of its proprietary aircraft.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the widespread subject matter of the trade secrets, an injunction would likely limit Archer&#8217;s operations. The courts have not yet ruled on whether Archer misappropriated trade secrets, as Wisk alleged in its original filing on April 6. Wisk says it discovered the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/"> trade secret theft</a> after it sent the work laptops of a departing employee to an outsider investigator, who discovered that the employee had downloaded nearly 5,000 files. This employee is now a senior power electronics engineer at Archer.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a separate federal investigation into a former Wisk employee who now works for Archer, based on Wisk&#8217;s trade secret allegations.</p>
<p>Archer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824502/000110465921047190/tm2112310d1_8k.htm">said in a filing</a> with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission that it had &#8220;placed an employee on paid administrative leave in connection with a government investigation and a search warrant issued to the employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>The injunction hearing has not been scheduled. It will likely occur within the next few days due to the nature of the request. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under case no. 5:21-cv-2450.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated to include Archer&#8217;s comments and to reflect that a former Wisk employee who now works at Archer, not Archer or its senior management, is the subject of the FBI&#8217;s investigation. </em></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our startup employs several individuals who are on work visas or have employment authorization. Many of them have been waiting for quite a while for the government to tell them their applications have been received. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why? When will things be back on track? We have a few employees who are waiting for green cards, and a few F-1 visa holders who will be extending their OPT to STEM OPT. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything we can do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Patient in Pasadena</strong></p>
<p>Dear Patient,</p>
<p>Thanks for your questions. Last September, an increase in applications submitted to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) amid COVID-19-related staff reductions created a substantial backlog and subsequent delay in USCIS sending out receipt notices.</p>
<p>My law firm partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, and I provided an update on receipt notices on a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/071-where-is-my-receipt-notice/">podcast</a>. Dedicating an entire episode to receipt notices was unthinkable a year ago because applicants usually received receipt notices within one to three weeks after USCIS received their application.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, USCIS sends a letter called a receipt notice to applicants when it receives an application. The receipt notice — also known as a Notice of Action or Form I-797 — contains information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the application was accepted, in which case you will be notified of how it will be processed, or rejected if it was not filed appropriately, such as not using the latest form or forgetting to check a box on the application form.</li>
<li>A receipt number, which can be used to check the status of your case either <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do">online</a> or by phone.</li>
<li>The date your application was received, which for most green card applications is the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/028-all-about-priority-dates/">priority date</a>. (Priority dates for the EB-2 and EB-3 green cards are when the Labor Department received the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/020-sponsoring-employees-for-perm-green-cards/">PERM Labor Certification</a> application.) A priority date determines your place in line for a green card number to become available based on the green card category and the green card candidate’s country of birth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What caused the backlog?</h2>
<p>Before the pandemic, applicants would typically be notified in less than one month after USCIS received their application. Currently, applicants are receiving their receipt notice as long as eight to nine weeks after USCIS received their application, and sometimes longer.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, coronavirus-related staffing reductions at USCIS coupled with a substantial jump in the number of applications submitted prompted huge delays that began in September. Application submissions surged primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipation of fee hikes that were slated to go into effect on October 2, 2020, before being blocked by a federal court judge.</li>
<li>Rapid forward movement in the monthly Visa Bulletin for some green card categories, which meant green card numbers became available to many waiting in line.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An FDA pathway that’s greased the gears for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs has paved the way for something else: a new take on electroencephalography (EEG), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the established brain-monitoring technique in which metallic electrodes are placed on the scalp to measure the brain’s electrical activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 17, DC-based startup iCE Neurosystems </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ice-neurosystems-announces-fda-510-173000465.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a version of FDA approval for a subcutaneous electrode called iCE-SG, designed to monitor the brain’s electrical activity from beneath the skin of the scalp. That electrode comes on the back of a 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for iCE Neurosystems’ software platform called iCEWav, which was used in a D.C. area hospital to monitor the brain activity of patients in medically-induced comas during the Covid-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iCE Neurosystems electrode and software are, essentially, a new take on traditional EEG. The electrode is designed to sit beneath the scalp for days and analyze brain activity, and the software component is designed to integrate that data with vital signs like heart rate or blood pressure. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time we&#8217;ve got this massive, high-fidelity, continuous, integrated data set from both brain and body,” says Alan Waziri, a neurosurgeon and company co-founder. “That allows us to really understand what&#8217;s happening in the brain to drive timely clinical decisions, and fundamentally change outcomes for these patients.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iCE was founded by Waziri and colleagues from his time as a resident at Columbia University Medical Center in 2017. As of 2021, the company has nine full</span><b>&#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">time employees, and has raised a total of $4.5 million, including a recent round of $2.95 million from private investors in April 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcutaneous electrode and software combination is part of iCE Neurosystems bigger picture: to create a full platform for continuous monitoring of the brain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are examples of use cases where continuous monitoring may prove beneficial. For instance, a 2019 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England Journal of Medicine</span></i> <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812757"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that specialized EEG monitoring might detect signs of consciousness in otherwise unresponsive patients. That study was authored by </span><a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/jan-claassen-md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan Claassen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the director of Critical Care Neurology at Columbia who is also co-founder and minority shareholder at iCE Neurosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another</span><a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/92/1/e9"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2019 paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that continuous monitoring via EEG was associated with fewer deaths in hospitals. But only 22,728 of the over 7 million people analyzed in the study had access to continuous EEG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waziri’s aim is to increase that number. Subcutaneous electrodes, he’s betting, are a first step. The iCE-SG electrodes should be easy to install and don’t require the technical expertise usually required to prepare and administer an EEG, explains Waziri. </span><a href="https://jintensivecare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40560-018-0310-z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other scientists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also noted technical expertise needed to use and interpret traditional EEG is cumbersome and has stood in the way of long-term EEG monitoring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA approval documents note that the iCE-SG devices are approved to remain beneath the skin for 14 days, but Waziri says he’s obtained continuous monitoring of brain activity for up to 35 days. A long-term EEG analysis, by comparison, might last several days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s almost like placing an IV,” Waziri says. “Basically a routine clinician at the bedside can place these in under five minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the platform alone can’t address the need for expertise to interpret this data. Waziri’s answer to that question is to make this data shareable.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a hospital, data collected by platform is stored on the cloud. However, a hospital could opt into sharing data on another platform iCECloud Knowledge with other medical institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From participating institutions, all the data we collect gets put in there and is made available to anyone who is using our system,” he says. “Our goal is to almost kind of crowdsource the analysis of the data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, iCENeurosystems has pursued two forms of FDA approval for the software and the electrode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electrode and the full platform have received FDA premarket approval through the 510(k) pathway – a type of pre-market approval that allows a medical device to go to market without additional FDA review because it’s substantially similar to other products already on the market (In this case, that tech is a traditional EEG). The iCEWav system was granted 510(k) approval in </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191868.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the electrode received it in </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K201678.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pathway is one of the </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0653-6#:~:text=The%20US%20Food%20and%20Drug,among%20purveyors%20of%20new%20devices."><span style="font-weight: 400;">most expedient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways to get a medical device onto the market, but has also </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955380/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">faced criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it doesn’t require a device to be tested for safety or efficacy through clinical trials. Waziri says there “haven’t been any complications” from the devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, iCEWave </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done time in the clinical setting in a major D.C. hospital, though Waziri won’t disclose which one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, the DC based startup iCE Neurosystems was in the midst of testing iCEWav when the pandemic hit. Some Covid-19 patients required intense cardiopulmonary support that required use of medically induced comas. Technicians typically use EEG to monitor these patients, but iCE Neurosystems also received a trial run, says Waziri, as the hospital was looking for long-term methods of monitoring patients brain activity without having technicians visit multiple times per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They had our system in place because we were running a clinical trial in patients with cardiac arrest, and they asked us if they could use the system for monitoring their critically ill COVID patients. They actually applied to the FDA and the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the software,” Waziri says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far Waziri and iCENeurosystems hasn’t published any peer-reviewed data from that trial at the D.C. area hospital, but he says the company has two forthcoming manuscripts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Waziri says that iCE Neurosystems is working towards getting more devices into more hospitals. He says they’re in talks with an additional five hospitals, with the goal of beginning a Series A funding raise in mid 2022. </span></p>

<p>OpenUnit has now raised a $1 million seed round, and acquired the IP of a fellow YC company along the way.</p>
<p>Since we last heard from OpenUnit, they&#8217;ve been expanding to locations around the U.S. and Canada, and now have a waitlist over 800 facilities deep, the team tells me.</p>

<p>OpenUnit co-founder Taylor Cooney was quick to point out that this seed round is as much about strategic partnerships as it is about the money. Neither Taylor nor co-founder Lucas Playford had much to do with the storage industry until a knock at the door led them down a rabbit hole. As<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/openunit-aims-to-be-shopify-for-self-storage-facilities/"> I wrote back in August</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Taylor’s landlords came to him with an offer: they wanted to sell the place he was renting, and they’d give him a stack of cash if he could be out within just a few days. Pulling that off meant finding a place to keep all of his stuff while he looked for a new home, which is when he realized how antiquated the self-storage process could be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the 20+ investors participating in the round, six are from the self-storage industry, from prior/current facility owners to the director of the Canadian Self Storage Association. For some of them, it&#8217;s their first time investing in a tech or software company — but all potentially bring something to the table beyond money.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not to say they&#8217;re just letting that money sit around. They&#8217;ve grown the team from just Taylor and Lucas up to five, and are still looking to grow. Meanwhile, Taylor tells me the company has acquired the IP of fellow Y Combinator W20 batchmate Affiga, a product that aimed to automatically provide insights about a new customer after a transaction is made.</p>
<p>Writes Taylor: &#8220;As self-storage companies move services like rentals, leases, and payments online, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult for them to &#8216;know&#8217; their customers. We see the integration into our product as a way to help self-storage operators bridge the gap between their online and in-store customer experiences, where the personal touch tends to be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Affiga initially shut down its operations back in 2020. After OpenUnit realized they wanted something similar in their product, they set out to buy rather than build. &#8220;With a decade in e-commerce under their belt,&#8221; Taylor tells me, &#8220;their founder had a much better approach to this then we would&#8217;ve come up with.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Besides getting more people off the waitlist and onto the platform, they&#8217;re exploring other opportunities, including potentially providing loans to facilities looking to expand or renovate. Because OpenUnit is both the management platform and the payments provider, they have deep insights on how a facility is doing; they know how much a location makes, how punctual their customers are with payments, etc. Take that data and mash it up with insights on what improvements can increase revenue, and it seems like a pretty straightforward formula.</p>
<p>This round includes investment from Garage Capital, Advisors Fund, Insite Property Group, SquareFoot co-founder Jonathan Wasserstrum, and a number of angel investors.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Approaching institutions to raise capital for your venture capital or private equity fund is relatively transparent, but what if you’re targeting family offices and high-net-worth individuals? I see five innovative new methods for raising capital that emerging managers such as <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a> are using, which I’ve ranked in roughly descending order of popularity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Join online communities and virtual conferences where investors participate.</li>
<li>Use a platform that helps other investors access your fund.</li>
<li>Generally solicit under the 506(c) designation.</li>
<li>Launch a rolling fund.</li>
<li>Crowdfund from retail investors into your general partnership.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will Stringer, CEO of <a href="https://www.chisos.io/">Chisos</a>, feels most family offices won’t respond to cold outreach. &#8220;You need to build a true relationship with family office investors or other general partners that can make warm intros to family office decision-makers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Family offices, more than any other allocator, rely on trust. [It&#8217;s] not always the case (and always changing), but today it&#8217;s still the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When you’re raising capital for a fund, you’re fundamentally selling a luxury good, which is seen as more valuable because it’s scarce. That’s part of the secret of the hedge fund industry’s success in gathering assets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The obvious solution therefore is to get in touch with your friends who have earlier raised or pitched to the family offices. You may also find professional intermediaries who are willing to make an introduction to family offices.</p>
<p>That said, the five methods I outline below may be faster and more efficient.</p>
<h2>Join online communities and virtual conferences where investors participate</h2>
<p>To meet other VCs (some of which may become LPs), among your options are <a href="http://confluence.vc/">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://genzmafia.com/">Gen Z Mafia</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/shr1LP3zhjgLY2vZC?utm=website">InnovatorsRoom</a> (European focus) and <a href="https://www.techaviv.com/">TechAviv</a> (Israeli focus). To find others, see: <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2021/02/24/how-to-find-the-right-online-communities/">How to find the right online communities</a>. I maintain a proprietary database of the communities I’ve found most valuable, which I share with other members of the Versatile team.</p>
<p>These venues allow you to efficiently get in front of many pre-qualified investors and follow up with those who seem like a tight fit. Unsurprisingly, the best online communities are limited strictly to LPs. Ideally, you’d partner with an anchor/friendly LP who can pass the word on your fund to other potential investors.</p>
<p>In general, at virtual conferences, I recommend first fill out your online profile with all possible keywords and your photo. Side-channeling is powerful and is the equivalent of going into a corner at a conference and talking privately. Look up the profiles of all the people attending a conference or in an online community and send the relevant folks a customized message introducing yourself.</p>
<p>This is one of the primary advantages of virtual events versus traditional face-to-face conferences, where people do not conveniently wear a hat with their LinkedIn profile visible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tapping the tiny screen of the Apple Watch with precision has a certain level of fundamental difficulty, but for some people with disabilities it&#8217;s genuinely impossible. Apple has remedied this with a new mode called &#8220;Assistive Touch&#8221; that detects hand gestures to control a cursor and navigate that way.</p>
<p>The feature was announced as part of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/">a collection of accessibility-focused additions across its products</a>, but Assistive Touch seems like the one most likely to make a splash across the company&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>It relies on the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer, as well as data from the heart rate sensor, to deduce the position of the wrist and hand. Don&#8217;t expect it to tell a peace sign from a metal sign just yet, but for now it detects &#8220;pinch&#8221; (touching the index finger to the thumb) and &#8220;clench&#8221; (make a loose fist), which can act as basic &#8220;next&#8221; and &#8220;confirm&#8221; actions. Incoming calls, for instance, can be quickly accepted with a clench.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Most impressive, however, is the motion pointer. You can activate it either by selecting it in the Assistive Touch menu, or by shaking your wrist vigorously. It then detects the position of your hand as you move it around, allowing you to &#8220;swipe&#8221; by letting the cursor linger at the edge of the screen, or interact with things using a pinch or clench.</p>
<p>Needless to say this could be extremely helpful for anyone who only has the one hand available for interacting with the watch. And even for those who don&#8217;t strictly need it, the ability to keep one hand on the exercise machine, cane or whatever else while doing smartwatch things is surely an attractive possibility. (One wonders about the potential of this control method as a cursor for other platforms as well&#8230;)</p>

<p>Assistive Touch is only one of many accessibility updates Apple shared in this news release; other advances for the company&#8217;s platforms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SignTime, an ASL interpreter video call for Apple Store visits and support</li>
<li>Support for new hearing aids</li>
<li>Improved VoiceOver-based exploration of images</li>
<li>A built-in background noise generator (which I fully intend to use)</li>
<li>Replacement of certain buttons with non-verbal mouth noises (for people who have limited speech and mobility)</li>
<li>Memoji customizations for people with oxygen tubes, cochlear implants and soft helmets</li>
<li>Featured media in the App Store, Apple TV, Books and Maps apps from or geared toward people with disabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s all clustered around Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is tomorrow, May 20th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may not be familiar with the term &#8220;dark patterns&#8221; but the manipulative design phenomenon is ubiquitous in the apps and services we use every day.</p>
<p>Dark patterns nudge consumers to make choices that enrich companies, usually at their own expense. That can look like misleading wording that leads someone to sign their personal data away or a hidden button that results in a renewed subscription they&#8217;d probably rather cancel.</p>
<p>If you run across a sketchy dark pattern design, you can now report it on <a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/">Darkpatternstipline.org</a>, a dedicated site hosted by Consumer Reports. The new tip line is a joint project from the EFF, PEN America, Consumer Reports and Access Now, among other digital rights advocates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Collecting dark pattern reports is an effort that could actually have teeth now, thanks to new laws taking aim at the manipulative design practice.</p>
<p>In March, California modified its landmark privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-approval-additional-regulations-empower-data">ban dark patterns in tech&#8217;s own backyard</a>. &#8220;These protections ensure that consumers will not be confused or misled when seeking to exercise their data privacy rights,&#8221; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said of the new regulations.</p>
<p>Even Congress is worried about dark patterns. In 2019, a bipartisan bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1084/all-info">called the DETOUR Act</a> sought to outlaw user interfaces &#8220;obscuring, subverting, or impairing user autonomy&#8221; for large companies with more than 100 million users. While that legislation didn&#8217;t go anywhere, coercive design choices are one of the many concerns that lawmakers have on their radar as they seek to implement new federal regulations for Big Tech companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Part of learning to be an engineer is understanding the tools you&#8217;ll have to work with — voltmeters, spectrum analyzers, things like that. But why use two, or eight for that matter, where one will do? The Moku:Go combines several commonly used tools into one compact package, saving room on your workbench or classroom while also providing a modern, software-configurable interface. Creator Liquid Instruments has just raised $13.7 million to bring this gadget to students and engineers everywhere.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154471" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154471" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154471" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg" alt="Students at a table use a Moku Go device to test a circuit board." width="470" height="470" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg 1410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-team.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154471" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Liquid Instruments</p></div></p>
<p>The idea behind <a href="https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokugo/">Moku:Go</a> is largely the same as the company&#8217;s previous product, the <a href="https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokulab/">Moku:Lab</a>. Using a standard input port, a set of FPGA-based tools perform the same kind of breakdowns and analyses of electrical signals as you would get in a larger or analog device. But being digital saves a lot of space that would normally go toward bulky analog components.</p>
<p>The Go takes this miniaturization further than the Lab, doing many of the same tasks at half the weight and with a few useful extra features. It&#8217;s intended for use in education or smaller engineering shops where space is at a premium. Combining eight tools into one is a major coup when your bench is also your desk and your file cabinet.</p>
<p>Those eight tools, by the way, are: waveform generator, <em>arbitrary</em> waveform generator, frequency response analyzer, logic analyzer/pattern generator, oscilloscope/voltmeter, PID controller, spectrum analyzer and data logger. It&#8217;s hard to say whether that really adds up to more or less than eight, but it&#8217;s definitely a lot to have in a package the size of a hardback book.</p>
<p>You access and configure them using a software interface rather than a bunch of knobs and dials — though let&#8217;s be clear, there are good arguments for both. When you&#8217;re teaching a bunch of young digital natives, however, a clean point-and-click interface is probably a plus. The UI is actually very attractive; you can see several examples by <a href="https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokugo/">clicking the instruments on this page</a>, but here&#8217;s an example of the waveform generator:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154469" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wfg3.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154469" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154469" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wfg3.gif" alt="Graphical interface for a waveform generator" width="1000" height="541" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Liquid Instruments</p></div></p>
<p>Love those pastels.</p>
<p>The Moku:Go currently works with Macs and Windows but doesn&#8217;t have a mobile app yet. It integrates with Python, MATLAB and LabVIEW. Data goes over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Compared with the Moku:Lab, it has a few perks. A USB-C port instead of a mini, a magnetic power port, a 16-channel digital I/O, optional power supply of up to four channels and of course it&#8217;s half the size and weight. It compromises on a few things — no SD card slot and less bandwidth for its outputs, but if you need the range and precision of the more expensive tool, you probably need a lot of other stuff too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154979" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154979" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154979" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg" alt="A person uses a Moku Go device at a desk." width="450" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg 1410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154979" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Liquid Instruments</p></div></p>
<p>Since the smaller option also costs $500 to start (&#8220;a price comparable to a textbook&#8221;&#8230; yikes) compared with the big one&#8217;s $3,500, there&#8217;s major savings involved. And it&#8217;s definitely cheaper than buying all those instruments individually.</p>
<p>The Moku:Go is &#8220;targeted squarely at university education,&#8221; said Liquid Instruments VP of marketing Doug Phillips. &#8220;Professors are able to employ the device in the classroom and individuals, such as students and electronic engineering hobbyists, can experiment with it on their own time. Since its launch in March, the most common customer profile has been students purchasing the device at the direction of their university.&#8221;</p>
<p>About a hundred professors have signed on to use the device as part of their fall classes, and the company is working with other partners in universities around the world. &#8220;<span id="m_-2565074456567346020gmail-docs-internal-guid-6d2963ea-7fff-6a4b-4358-beccb3ace6a1">There is a real demand for portable, flexible systems that can handle the breadth of four years of curriculum,&#8221; Phillips said.</span></p>
<p>Production starts in June (samples are out to testers), the rigors and costs of which likely prompted the recent round of funding. The $13.7 million comes from existing investors <span id="m_-1917794109127701751gmail-docs-internal-guid-233761ac-7fff-d305-b540-d9cc63aed5e0">Anzu Partners and ANU Connect Ventures, and new investors F1 Solutions and Moelis Australia’s Growth Capital Fund. It&#8217;s a convertible note &#8220;in advance of an anticipated Series B round in 2022,&#8221; Phillips said. It&#8217;s a larger amount than they intended to raise at first, and the note nature of the round is also not standard, but given the difficulties faced by hardware companies over the last year, some irregularities are probably to be expected.<br />
</span></p>
<p>No doubt the expected B round will depend considerably on the success of the Moku:Go&#8217;s launch and adoption. But this promising product looks as if it might be a commonplace item in thousands of classrooms a couple years from now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/five-maps-updates-io-2021">announced</a> a series of updates coming to Google Maps as part of the company&#8217;s larger goal of delivering more than 100 AI-powered improvements to the platform by year-end. Among the new improvements, detailed during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021">Google I/O&#8217;s developer conference</a> this week, are new routing updates, Live View enhancements, an expansion of detailed street maps, a new &#8220;area busyness&#8221; feature and a more personalized Maps experience.</p>
<p>The new routing updates will involve the use of machine learning and navigation information to help reduce &#8220;hard-braking moments&#8221; &#8212; meaning, those times when traffic suddenly slows, and you have to slam on your brakes.</p>
<p>Today, when you get your directions in Maps, Google calculates multiple route options based on a variety of factors, like how many lanes a road has or how direct the route is. With the update, it will add one more: which routes are least likely to cause a &#8220;hard-braking moment.&#8221; Google will recommend the route that has the least likelihood of those sorts of moments, if the ETA is the same or the difference is minimal between another route. The company says it expects this change could potentially eliminate 100 million hard-breaking events in routes driven with Google Maps every year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live View, Google Maps&#8217; augmented reality feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/08/google-launches-live-view-ar-walking-directions-for-google-maps/">launched in 2019</a> will soon become available directly from the map interface so you can instantly explore the neighborhood and view details about nearby shops and restaurants, including how busy they are, recent reviews and photos. It also will be updated to include street signs for complex intersections, and will tell you where you are in relation to places like your hotel, so you can make your way back more easily, when in unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154940" style="width: 492px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154940" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2154940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?w=482" alt="" width="482" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg 860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=106,150 106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=213,300 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=768,1084 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=482,680 482w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google will also expand the more detailed maps it first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-maps-adds-street-level-details-in-select-cities-more-colorful-imagery-worldwide/">rolled out to</a> New York, San Francisco and London last year. These maps offer more granularity, including both natural features and street info like the location of sidewalks, crosswalks and pedestrian islands, for example. The information can be particularly useful for those who navigate a city by foot, scooter, bike, or in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>By the end of 2021, these detailed maps will be available in 50 more cities, including  Berlin, São Paulo, Seattle and Singapore.</p>

<p>Another new feature expands on the &#8220;busyness&#8221; information Google already provided for businesses, based on anonymized location data collected by Maps users. During the pandemic, that feature became a useful way to avoid crowds at local stores and other businesses, for health and safety. Now, Google Maps will display &#8220;busyness&#8221; info for parts of towns or neighborhoods, to help you either avoid (or perhaps locate) crowded areas &#8212; like a street festival, farmers&#8217; market or nightlife spot, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154945" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154945" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2154945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg 1874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=1536,911 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Google Maps will begin customizing its interface to the individual in new ways.</p>
<p>For starters, it may show relevant information based on the time of day where you are.</p>
<p>For instance, when you open the map at 8 a.m. on a weekday, you may see coffee shops more prominently highlighted, but at night, you may see dinner spots. If you&#8217;ve traveled out of town, Google Maps may instead show you landmarks and tourists attractions. And if you want to see more of the same, you can tap on any place to see similar places nearby.</p>

<p>Google says these features will roll out globally across iOS and Android in the coming months, but did not provide an exact time frame for each specific feature. The more detailed maps will arrive by year-end, however.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Emeritus plans to acquire iD Tech, a STEM education service for children, which brings a whole different set of customers to its umbrella.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mumbai-based<a href="https://emeritus.org/"> Emeritus</a>, an edtech company that works with universities to create online upskilling courses for employed folks, just spent a big chunk of cash to break into K-12.</p>
<p>Emeritus, which is part of the Eruditus group, announced today that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.idtech.com/">iD Tech</a>, a STEM education service for children. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, is estimated to be around $200 million and leaves iD Tech operating as an independent brand for now.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In order to execute on lifelong learning, a company needs to be able to seamlessly transition its audiences &#8212; from high school to college to post-employment &#8212; between products.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-backs-indian-education-startup-eruditus-in-113-million-fundraise/">Eruditus raised a $113 million Series D</a> from investors including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia India and Leeds Illuminate. Today, the startup has more than 200 programs, from bootcamps to online degree programs, that are offered to career folks in partnership with more than 50 of the world’s top universities, including MIT, Harvard and Columbia. ID Tech brings a whole different set of customers to its umbrella: The startup offers courses for elementary through high-school students across the globe taught by college students in the U.S.</p>
<p>The acquisition will allow Emeritus, which has been on a hiring and fundraising tear as of late, to grow beyond adult learning and well into the world of lifelong learning. It’s a trend we spotted back in a January edtech investor survey: Investors then mentioned how remote education needs to extend beyond school hours as learners become more multilayered. Edtech companies would soon have to find ways to create value for students throughout their educational experience, starting from early childhood into post-employment.</p>
<p>Breaking into lifelong learning sounds great, but it’s a complex goal, given that a freshman in high school learns differently than a full-time employed professional with six years of experience. Emeritus CEO and co-founder Ashwin Damera spoke to TechCrunch to explain why it makes sense from a product and revenue perspective.</p>
<p>“Last year we started seeing a lot of K-12 teaching moving online,” Damera said. “Then we opened our eyes and said, we used to think that this audience is not ready to learn online, but maybe we should relook at that assumption.”</p>
<h2>The universe of universities</h2>
<p>In order to execute on lifelong learning, a company needs to be able to seamlessly transition its audiences &#8212; from high school to college to post-employment &#8212; between products. In Emeritus’ case, Damera explained how the two companies already overlap in the middle of that chain: higher ed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> super early-bird deal took our best deal in its beak and flew the coop. But you can still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> and exhibit in our virtual expo area at a great price. Take advantage of our early-bird deal, cross an item off your to-do list and keep $50 in your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The early-bird deadline is <strong>August 6 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>, and if that feels like a long way off, don’t be fooled. It’ll be here before you know it, and Startup Alley Passes are selling faster than ever<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">. Get yours for just $249</a> while you can.</p>
<p>In addition to your virtual exhibit space and the abundance of networking that goes on in the Alley, we have additional opportunities for exhibitors. For starters, each exhibiting startup gets to participate in a breakout pitch-feedback session.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You’ll have two minutes to pitch live to TechCrunch staff and thousands of Disrupt attendees around the world. And you’ll receive plenty of great feedback to improve your pitch deck.</p>
<p>“I walked away with a bunch of notes to reorganize my pitch deck. It&#8217;s a lot of work, but it’s very rewarding because now I have a clear path. Disrupt was like an authoritative instruction manual for how to finish my pitch deck.” — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The TechCrunch Editorial team will choose two outstanding exhibiting startups to be Startup Battlefield Wild Cards. Those founders will get to compete for the $100,000 (equity-free) cash and massive exposure in the Startup Battlefield. It. Could. Be. You.</p>
<p>Team TechCrunch will also host a series of Startup Alley Crawls — one hour for each business category. Editors will go live on the Disrupt stage and interview various founders exhibiting in Startup Alley. It’s great global exposure.</p>
<p>Here’s another big reason to get your exhibitor pass sooner rather than later. It’s a new opportunity called Startup Alley+ and you must purchase a Startup Alley Pass <strong>before Friday, June 4 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong> to be eligible for this VIP Disrupt experience. TechCrunch will choose up to 50 startups to participate. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/heres-all-the-biz-dev-support-startup-alley-founders-get-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">Read about all the perks and benefits here</a>. Get your pass before the deadline, because the Startup Alley+ experience kicks off in July at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">Early Stage 2021 — Marketing and Fundraising</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is resuming work on reducing the granularity of information presented in user-agent strings on its Chrome browser, it <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/update-on-user-agent-string-reduction.html">said today</a> &#8212; picking up an effort it put on pause last year, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it said it wanted to avoid piling extra migration burden on the web ecosystem in the middle of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>The resumption of the move has implications for web developers as the changes to user-agent strings could break some existing infrastructure without updates to code. Although Google has laid out a pretty generous-looking timeline of origin tests &#8212; and its blog post emphasizes that &#8220;<i>no User-Agent string changes will be coming to the stable channel of Chrome in 2021</i>&#8220;. So the changes certainly won&#8217;t ship before 2022.</p>
<p>The move, via development of its Chromium engine, to pare back user-agent strings to reduce their ability to be used to track users is related to Google&#8217;s overarching Privacy Sandbox plan &#8212; aka the stack of proposals it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">announced in 2019 </a>&#8212; when it said it wanted to evolve web architecture by developing a set of open standards to &#8220;fundamentally enhance&#8221; web privacy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of this move toward a more private default for Chromium is depreciating support for third party tracking cookies. Another part is Google&#8217;s proposed technological alternative for on-device ad-targeting of cohorts of users (aka FLoCs).</p>
<p>Cleaning up exploitable surface areas like fingerprintable user-agent strings is another component &#8212; and should be understood as part of the wider &#8216;hygiene&#8217; drive required to deliver on the goals of Privacy Sandbox.</p>
<p>The latter remains a massive, tanker-turning effort, though.</p>
<p>And while there has been some suggestions Google could be ready to ship Privacy Sandbox in early 2022, given the timelines it&#8217;s allowing for origin tests of the changes to user-agent strings &#8212; a seven phase rollout, with two origin trials lasting at least six months apiece &#8212; that looks unlikely. (At least not for all the constituent parts of the Sandbox to ship.)</p>
<p>Indeed, back in 2019 Google was upfront that the changes it had in mind would not come overnight, saying then: &#8220;It’s going to be a multi-year journey&#8221;. Albeit in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">January 2020</a> it seemed to dial up at least part of the timeline, saying it wanted to phase out support for third party cookies within two years.</p>
<p>Still, Google can&#8217;t realistically depreciate tracking cookies without also shipping changes in browser standards that are needed to provide publishers and advertisers with alternative means to do ad targeting, measurement and fraud prevention. So any delay to elements of the Privacy Sandbox could have a knock-on impact on its &#8216;two-year&#8217; timeline to end support for third party cookies. (And 2022 may well be the very earliest the shift could happen.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s push and pull going on here, as Google&#8217;s effort to retool web infrastructure &#8212; and, more specifically, to change how web users and activity can and can&#8217;t be tracked &#8212; has massive implications for many other web users; most notably the adtech players and publishers whose businesses are deeply embedded in this tracking web.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it has faced a lot of pushback from those sectors.</p>
<p>Its plan to end support for third party tracking cookies is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">under regulatory scrutiny in Europe</a> &#8212; where advertisers complained it&#8217;s an anti-competitive power move to block third parties&#8217; access to user data while continuing to help itself to masses of first party user data (given its dominance of key Internet services). So depending on how regulators respond to ecosystem concerns Google may not be able to keep full control of the timeline, either.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, from a privacy perspective, Chrome paring back user-agent strings is a welcome &#8212; if overdue &#8212; move.</p>
<p>Indeed Google&#8217;s blog post notes that it&#8217;s the laggard vs similar efforts already undertaken by the web engines underlying Apple&#8217;s Safari browser and Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox.</p>
<p>&#8220;As noted in the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints#explainer-reducing-user-agent-granularity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agent Client Hints explainer</a>, the User Agent string presents challenges for two reasons. Firstly, it <a href="https://w3c.github.io/fingerprinting-guidance/#passive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passively exposes</a> quite a lot of information about the browser for every HTTP request that <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/#unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be used for fingerprinting</a>,&#8221; Google writes, fleshing out its rational for the change. &#8220;Secondly, it has grown in length and complexity over the years and encourages error-prone string parsing. We believe the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agent Client Hints API</a> solves both of these problems in a more developer- and user-friendly manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, an independent consultant and security and privacy researcher who has advised the W3C on technical architecture and standards, describes the incoming change as &#8220;a great privacy improvement&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The user-agent change will reduce entropy and so reduce identifiability,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;I view it as a great privacy improvement because considering IP address and the UA string at the same time is highly identifying. UAs are not exactly simplified in Firefox/Safari in the way Chrome suggests doing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog post notes that its UA plan was &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">designed with backwards compatibility in mind&#8221;, and seeks to reassure developers &#8212; adding that: &#8220;While any changes to the User Agent string need to be managed carefully, we expect minimal friction for developers as we roll this out (i.e., existing parsers should continue to operate as expected).</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If your site, service, library or application relies on certain bits of information being present in the User Agent string such as <b>Chrome minor version</b>, <b>OS version number</b>, or <b>Android device model</b>, you will need to begin the migration to use the <a href="https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agent Client Hints API</a> instead,&#8221; it goes on. &#8220;If you don’t require any of these, then no changes are required and things should continue to operate as they have to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Google&#8217;s reassurances, Olejnik suggested some web developers could still be caught on the hop &#8212; if they fail to take note of the development and don&#8217;t made necessary updates to their code in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Web developers may be concerned as certain libraries or backend systems depend on the strict UA string existing as today,&#8221; he noted, adding: &#8220;Things may stop working as intended. This might be a sudden and surprising breakage. But the actual impact at a scale is unpredictable.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bipartisanship has long been out of fashion, but one common pursuit among Democrats and Republicans in Washington has been placing Big Tech companies under a microscope.</p>
<p>Congressional committees have held scores of hearings, lawsuits have been filed and legislation has been introduced to regulate privacy and data collection. The knock-on effect of these reforms for young companies and their venture investors is unclear. But one aspect of increased antitrust scrutiny — restrictions on acquisitions — would have a significant negative effect on our entrepreneurial ecosystem, and policymakers should approach these changes with caution.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions are an important element of the startup ecosystem</h2>
<p>For VC-backed companies, there are effectively three outcomes: standalone company (often via an IPO), merger or acquisition, or bankruptcy. Despite best efforts, company failure is the most common outcome &#8212; more than <a href="https://innovationfootprints.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/startup-genome-report-extra-on-premature-scaling.pdf">90%</a> of startups fail. Fortunately, the success stories are often companies with a big impact, like Moderna and Zoom, which helped the world in the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Acquisitions contribute to the health of the startup ecosystem, as entrepreneurs who realize liquidity through the sale of their company regularly go on to found innovative new companies and often invest in other startups as angel investors or venture capitalists.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are optimists by nature, and so when the company journey begins, there is great hope of one day creating a standalone public company. However, in most cases, an IPO is not possible. The reality is that entrepreneurship is incredibly hard, and the journey from infancy to public company is one that relatively few companies achieve.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/globalassets/library/uploadedfiles/content/trends_and_insights/reports/startup_outlook_report/suo_global_report_2020-final.pdf">2020 Global Startup Outlook</a> puts it this way: “[T]he fact is most entrepreneurs never expect to reach a public market exit.” Accordingly, 58% of startups expect to be acquired<strong>.</strong> NVCA-Pitchbook <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NVCA-2021-Yearbook.pdf">data</a> on acquisitions and IPOs back up the sentiment of founders when it comes to likely exit opportunities. In 2020, there was an approximately 10:1 ratio of acquisitions of VC-backed companies to IPOs, with 1,042 venture-backed companies acquired and 103 entering the public markets.</p>
<p>Some might argue that acquisitions are more dominant today because of the anti-competitive motivations of current tech incumbents. But as Patricia Nakache of Trinity Ventures said in <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Testimony-of-Patricia-Nakache-SJC-as-submitted-9-23-19.pdf">testimony</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee: “[Acquisitions have] been commonplace in the U.S. since before the dawn of the modern venture capital industry.” In fact, today we are witnessing <em>fewer </em>acquisitions relative to IPOs than in years past, as the average acquisition-to-IPO ratio since 2004 is approximately 15:1. This is happening against a backdrop of challenges in taking small-cap companies public that has reduced the number of companies in the public markets today.</p>
<p>Acquisitions contribute to the health of the startup ecosystem, as entrepreneurs who realize liquidity through the sale of their company regularly go on to found innovative new companies and often invest in other startups as angel investors or venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, acquisitions help power the returns of VC funds, thereby allowing VCs to raise new funds and invest in the next generation of entrepreneurs. This “recycling effect” is one of the key drivers of dynamism in our economy and should not be slowed down.</p>
<h2>Acquisition changes could impact entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Despite the importance of acquisitions, antitrust reform has included significant changes to how acquisitions are assessed by the federal government. The two most prominent examples in this space are Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement">Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act</a> (CALERA) and Sen. Josh Hawley’s <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-introduces-trust-busting-twenty-first-century-act-plan-bust-anti-competitive-big#:~:text=The%20Trust%2DBusting%20for%20the%20Twenty%2DFirst%20Century%20Act%20will%3A&amp;text=Replace%20the%20outdated%20numerically%2Dfocused,of%20competition%20in%20the%20U.S.">Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act</a>.</p>
<p>These bills are likely a reaction to <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">findings</a> that incumbents have acted like Pac-Man, gobbling up would-be competitors before they become a competitive problem. But both proposals would ultimately harm startup activity and competition rather than propel it.</p>
<p>A common thread between these proposals is to restrict acquisitions by companies valued at more than $100 billion. Hawley’s bill would impose an outright ban on acquisitions by companies of that market cap that “lessen competition in any way.”</p>
<p>Klobuchar’s bill would shift the burden of proof to parties to an acquisition, a major change because the U.S. government bears the burden currently. This means if the government challenges an acquisition in federal court, the parties to the acquisition must demonstrate it does not “create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition.” If that standard is not met, the acquisition could be blocked.</p>
<p>Both proposals have negative ramifications for venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>First, consider the scope of the proposals: A $100 billion company is indeed a large one, but setting the threshold there captures <em>far</em> more than the large tech companies that have been hauled before Congress for antitrust hearings. Globally, about 150 companies are valued at $100 billion or more, and the U.S. is home to more than 80 of those companies. That exposes acquirers as wide-ranging as Estee Lauder, John Deere, Starbucks and Thermo Fisher Scientific. If you are struggling to recall those companies being under the antitrust spotlight, then you are not alone.</p>
<p>Second, the legal standards imposed by these new bills are daunting. Klobuchar’s proposal leaves startups scratching their heads on where the line is on which acquisitions are tolerated, while Hawley’s bill throws up a misguided red light for vast amounts of acquisitions. These two standards are particularly vexing since acquirers are generally looking for acquirees that complement their existing business. In addition, many of the most acquisitive companies are multifaceted ones that presumably compete with an array of other companies in some way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the bills from Klobuchar and Hawley would disrupt an important part of our nation’s startup ecosystem. Acquisitions act like grease to help keep the wheels moving by injecting liquidity into the system so participants can move on to create new and hopefully better companies for our country. Those wheels should not be slowed down when the country needs all the entrepreneurship it can muster.</p>
