										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re fresh off of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pittsburgh-city-spotlight/">our big Pittsburgh event</a>, and I’ll have more thoughts on that for you next week, once we’ve crawled through all of the interviews, published profiles and all of that fun stuff. t  I admit that I’m also partly putting that off because there’s just a ton of investment news to get through in the meantime. Though I do want to note that the Pittsburgh Robotics Network held its own big event the<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/robotics_ai_industry_leaders_announce_commitment_to_make_pittsburgh_the_robotics_capital_of_the_world/prweb18041387.htm"> same day as ours</a> &#8212; honestly, there&#8217;s just a ton of activity in the city this week, including visits from some national politicians.</p>
<p>Per the PRN press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>The alliance brings together leaders from top robotics companies, research institutions and universities in the Pittsburgh area, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Argo AI, Aurora, the University of Pittsburgh, Kaarta, RE2 Robotics, Neya Systems, Carnegie Robotics, HEBI Robotics, Near Earth Autonomy, BirdBrain Technologies, Omnicell and Advanced Construction Robotics. The Richard King Mellon Foundation commemorated this membership milestone with a grant of $125,000 to support the continued growth of the PRN.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I hinted the other week that there would be a uptick in funding announcements, and we’ve certainly seen that come to fruition. Once upon a time, we used to have this thing called the summer doldrums. Maybe it’s the pandemic, but formerly slow season no longer really applies here. VCs are still super bullish on robotics and keep pumping money in across the category.</p>
<p>Before we get started, however, a bit of a somber note to say goodbye to Pepper – for now, at least. A rep for SoftBank Robotics confirmed with TechCrunch that the company will be hitting pause on the production of affable robotic greeter.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"> Reuters was first to report</a> a “retrenchment” in SoftBank’s robotics, including the elimination of 330 roles in France. The company noted in a press release, &#8220;Since 2012 SoftBank Robotics Group, a subsidiary of SoftBank, has invested in Humanoid Robotics and intends to keep Pepper &amp; NAO robots business moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1077715" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1077715" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1077715" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg" alt="NAO Robot" width="618" height="620" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg 618w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nao-robot.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1077715" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Aldebaran Robotics under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC-BY-3.0 license</a></p></div></p>
<p>As a refresher, the investment giant’s 2021 acquisition of French robotics startup Aldebaran Robotics gave rise to both SoftBank Robotics and Pepper. The latter evolved from Nao, a research robot that had pretty wide scale adoption in that world. To this day, you’ll still see the ‘bot at universities and research institutes all over.</p>
<p>Pepper was an attempt to bring some of that underlying technology to a broader commercial audience. The robot was made life-size and designed to hold a tablet and greet people. And, honestly, that was kind of it. Technology in search of a problem, as the saying goes – sophisticated robotics that can greet you at an Applebee’s or offer you some information at the airport.</p>
<p>Precisely why Pepper didn’t work out – and how much issues from the past year played into that – is something better saved for a deeper dive, but I’ve always been skeptical of how useful the robot really was. You’d be hard-pressed to find a compelling argument that this was something that required advanced robotics. Of course, a far more compelling argument can be made that specializing in building research robotics is, at best, a loss leader.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170829" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170829" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2170829" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170829" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CMR Surgical</p></div></p>
<p>That said, there’s still plenty to get excited about on the robotics investment front. And while SoftBank Robotics may be scaling down, the company’s investment arm appears very bullish on robotics that go beyond just holding up signage. The Vision Fund 2 led a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/surgical-robotics-company-cmr-raises-600m/">$600 million Series D for CMR Surgical</a>. The U.K.-based surgical robotics firm is now a unicorn three-times over, with a $3 billion valuation for its keyhole surgery tech.</p>
<p>What I find most appealing about the category is its promise of effectively leveling the playing field for highly specialized procedures. That accessibility could prove huge for developing nations and other markets where premium healthcare is more difficult to come by.</p>

<p>Soft Robotics (like SoftBank Robotics, but with less &#8220;bank&#8221;), meanwhile, specifically cited pandemic demand in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/soft-robotics-raises-another-10m-citing-pandemic-related-demand/"> the $10 million extension</a> of its $23 million Series B. Not to go all Upton Sinclair on you, but the meat processing industry sounded utterly hellish through much of the pandemic (as a non-meat eater myself, I’ll save you from some of my more personal reflections on the matter). Soft Robotics has long been among the more compelling startups in the robotic picking space, courtesy of its pneumatic powered grippers that are capable of moving around easily damaged food stuffs.</p>

<p>Speaking of moving around fragile foods, we exclusively reported this morning that 2019 Startup Battlefield finalist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/after-8-4m-raise-strawberry-picking-robotics-startup-traptic-begins-commercial-deployment/">Traptic has begun commercial deployment</a> for its strawberry-picking robot. That follows a previously unannounced $5 million Series A, bringing its full funding to $8.4 million to date. Like so many other industries, field work suffered a massive headcount shortage during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Botrista <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/robotic-beverage-maker-botrista-raises-10m/">also announce a Series A this week,</a> for its drink-mixing robotic kiosk. The company raised $10 million for further deployment of its system, which is capable of mixing up to eight ingredients in around 20 seconds. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/construction-robotics-company-toggle-raises-8m/">Toggle’s Series A</a>, meanwhile, netted the New York-based construction robotics company $8 million.</p>

<p>Never a dull moment. Here&#8217;s the fun of writing a large roundup on Wednesday for Thursday. Sometimes big news breaks in the morning (to all you running robotics startups, if you could hold off on announcing big news on Thursdays, that would be great help to me. Thanks in advance), like Zebra&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/zebra-technologies-is-acquiring-warehouse-robotics-company-fetch/">intention to acquire Fetch for $290 million</a>. I&#8217;ve got some more thoughts on this in piece and will be sharing some later, but meantime, a quote from Fetch CEO Melonee Wise,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fetch team is excited to join Zebra and accelerate the adoption of flexible automation through AMRs and our cloud-based robotics platform. Together we have the right team with the right technology to provide end-to-end solutions that solve real customer problems. By helping customers dynamically optimize and holistically orchestrate their fulfillment, distribution, and manufacturing operations, together we help enable their ability to stay ahead of growing demand, minimize delivery times and address shrinking labor pools.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>*Picking berries not to be confused with picking&#8230;anything else. We&#8217;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjJvBarVRss">rooting for you, Biz</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is making it possible to store digital versions of either Covid-19 test results or vaccination cards on users&#8217; Android devices. The company on Wednesday announced it&#8217;s updating its <a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/passes">Passes API</a>, which will give developers at healthcare organizations, government agencies, and other organizations authorized by public health authorities the ability to create digital versions of tests and vaccination cards which can then be saved directly to the user&#8217;s device. The Passes API is typically used to store things like boarding passes, loyalty cards, gift cards, tickets and more to users&#8217; Google Pay wallet. However, the Google Pay app in this case will not be required, Google says.</p>
<p>Instead, users without the Google Pay app will have the option to store the digital version of the Covid Card directly their device, where it&#8217;s accessible from a homescreen shortcut. Because Google is not retaining a copy of the card, anyone who needs to store the Covid Card on multiple devices will need to download it individually on each one from the healthcare provider or other organization&#8217;s app.</p>
<p>The cards themselves show the healthcare provider or organization&#8217;s logo and branding at the top, followed by the person&#8217;s name, date of birth, and other relevant information, like the vaccine manufacturer or date of shot or test. According to a support document, healthcare providers or organizations could alert users to the ability to download their card via email, text, or through a mobile website or app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an example photo, Google showed the Covid-19 Vaccination Card from Healthvana, a company that serves L.A. County, However, it didn&#8217;t provide any other information about which healthcare providers are interested in or planning to adopt the new technology.</p>
<p>The Passes API update doesn&#8217;t mean Android users can immediately create digital versions of their Covid vaccination cards &#8212; something people have been taking pictures of as a means of backup or, unfortunately in some cases, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/keep-your-covid-19-vaccine-card-safe-but-dont-laminate-it-heres-why">laminating</a> it. (That&#8217;s not advised, however, as the card is meant to be used again for recording booster shots.)</p>
<p>Rather, the update is about giving developers the ability to begin building tools to export the data they have in their own systems about people&#8217;s Covid tests and vaccinations to a local digital card on Android devices. To what extent these digital cards will become broadly available to end users will depend on developer adoption.</p>
<p>For the feature to work, the Android device needs to run Android 5 or later and it will need to be <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7165974">Play Protect certified</a>, which is a licensing program that ensures the device is running real Google apps. Users will also need to set a lock screen on their device for additional security.</p>
<p>Google says the update will initially roll out in the U.S., followed by other countries.</p>
<p>The U.S. is behind other markets in making digital version of vaccination cards possible. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-eus-covid-19-digital-certificates-are-up-and-running/">Today, the EU&#8217;s Covid certificate</a>, which shows an individual&#8217;s vaccination status, test results or recovery status from Covid-19, went live. The certificate (EUDCC) will be recognized by all EU members, and will aid with cross-border travel. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/01/1020154/israels-green-pass-is-an-early-vision-of-how-we-leave-lockdown/">Israel released a vaccine passport</a> earlier this year that allows vaccinated people to show their &#8220;green pass&#8221; at places that require vaccinations. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/06/17/national/vaccine-passports-travel-japan/">Japan aims</a> to have vaccination passports ready by the end of July for international travel.</p>
<p>In the U.S., <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027768/us-vaccine-passport-guide/">only a few states have active vaccine certification apps.</a> Many others have either outright banned vaccine passports &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/">has become</a> a politically loaded term &#8212; or are considering doing so.</p>
<p>Given this context, Google&#8217;s digital vaccination card is just that &#8212; a digital copy of a paper card. It&#8217;s not tied to any other government initiatives nor is it a &#8220;vaccine passport.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A number of angels also put money in the round, including Justo.mx founder Ricardo Weder, Luuna’s Carlos Salinas from Luuna and Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowports raised its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/nowports-raises-5-3-million-to-become-latin-americas-digital-shipping-answer-to-flexport/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initial seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 after graduating from Y Combinator’s Winter 2019 batch with a mission to innovate the freight forwarding industry by helping companies improve the import process. Its software and services track freight shipments from ports to destinations across Latin America. Over time, it has expanded its offerings and now also automates insurance policies for, and provides financing, to its clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this way, we allow our clients to import and export more, which helps them grow their businesses and improves the foreign trade conditions of the region,&#8221; said Nowports CEO and co-founder Alfonso de los Rios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a good year for Nowports, which saw its revenue climb by 605% compared to 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our 2021 goal is 400% to 600%,” de los Rios told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has offices in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay. Nowports plans to use its new capital in part to expand its 160-person team to China, according to de los Rios. It also plans to expand its logistics and financial services and to “solidify its most important routes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With platforms, algorithms with AI and integrations, our platform allows companies to take control of their shipments and plan and predict the best timing to move the freight based on the needs of their own company,” he said at the time of the company’s seed raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal with the series A is to position ourselves as the biggest digital freight forwarder in the region and expand our venture financing solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of millions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of containers are imported and exported from Latin America each year, and nearly half of them are either delayed or lost due to mismanagement. And, an estimated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of shipping containers suffer delays due to disorganized processes or errors during transport, which ends up costing companies billions per year. It’s a big opportunity. And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowports pledges to shippers that its digital management software will keep track of each container. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Slow, inefficient, and manual processes in international logistics are disassociated from today&#8217;s technological world&#8221;, said Nowports co-founder and COO Maximiliano Casal. “Customers are looking for solutions that can improve their logistics processes adapted to current challenges of international trade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two co-founders of Nowports met at a program at Stanford University, with de los Rios hailing from a family with deep ties to the shipping industry. He and Casal linked up and the two began plotting a way to make the deeply inefficient industry more modern and transparent. To familiarize himself with the market for which he’d be developing a technology, Casal worked with a freight forwarder in Kansas City that had been operating for more than 30 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Sidgmore, co-founder and partner of seed round lead investor Broadhaven Ventures, described the team as “visionaries in the freight forwarding industry who see the ability to build the operating system for the shipping industry, much like Carta has done for equity ownership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to track and digitize the supply chain process was never more apparent than with the recent blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given, which became a meme that represented the impacts of inefficiencies in the supply chain, Sidgmore said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nowports has created industry leading technology to help its customers know when to turn starboard or port side,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Gottschalk, senior advisor of Mouro Capital, said the Nowports platform brings both “transparency and technology” to a global client base.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A regulation underpinning a digital certification system for individuals in the European Union to verify their COVID-19 status via a common credential has gone into application today &#8212; on schedule.</p>
<p>From today, almost all EU Member States are now able to issue and verify digital certificates, per the Commission &#8212; with only a handful of (mostly) EEA countries still pending a step, according to its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">website</a>.</p>
<p>A number of countries had started issuing certificates earlier. The regulation also allows for a six-week phasing in period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission said more than 200 million certificates have been generated already.</p>
<p>The &#8220;EU Digital COVID Certificate&#8221; &#8212; which has gone through a few names since the idea was publicly floated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/">back in January</a> &#8212; is intended to help facilitate cross-border travel within the bloc by providing standardized and universally accepted certification.</p>
<p>EU citizens still have the right to free movement &#8212; even without the certificate &#8212; but having the common credential may help facilitate travel around the bloc, such as by exempting holders from needing to undergo COVID-19-related restrictions like quarantine.</p>
<p>Certificates can be issued to people within EU Member States who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus with a verified vaccine; who have previously had the disease (and therefore have antibodies); or to people who have had a recent negative test.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s been called a &#8220;digital&#8221; certificate, a paper version can also be issued &#8212; which similarly contains a scannable QR code (albeit printed) &#8212; so there&#8217;s no requirement for individuals to have a mobile device to be able to use the certificate to help them travel.</p>
<p>Certificates are also issued free of charge.</p>
<p>The Commission has previously said that no personal data is “exchanged or retained” during the digital certificate verification process. Signature keys for the verification are stored on servers at a national level and only accessed — via a centralized gateway — at the point the certificate is scanned.</p>
<p>The EU rules for the digital certificate stipulate that Member States must refrain from imposing additional travel restrictions on holders &#8212; unless such steps are &#8220;necessary and proportionate&#8221; to safeguard public health.</p>
<p>The regulation is due to expire in a year&#8217;s time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We first covered Traptic back in 2019, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/traptic-uses-3d-vision-and-robotic-arms-to-harvest-ripe-strawberries/">appeared as a Battlefield finalist</a> on stage at Disrupt SF. Today, the South Bay robotics startup is announcing some major progress. For starters, it began commercial deployment of its strawberry-picking mobile robot early this month.</p>
<p>Traptic tells TechCrunch that Blazer-Wilkinson, a top-five U.S. strawberry producer, began to deploy the technology in June, the system working in tandem with human pickers. That follows a pilot in 2020, when many agriculture companies were seeking assistance amid pandemic-related shortages.</p>
<p>Even prior to COVID-19, labor shortages have resulted in tremendous waste. According to Traptic’s figures, roughly 10% of U.S. strawberries rot in the field, unpicked, resulting in up to $300 million in waste, annually. During the pandemic, there was an even larger crunch, as H-2A workers suffered from restricted travel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s acceleration comes thanks to an unannounced $5 million Series A from Collaborative Fund, Homebrew Ventures and K9 Ventures that arrived in late-2019, before COVID-19 was on the world’s radar. &#8220;We used the recent funding to run a successful pilot,&#8221; cofounder and CEO Lewis Anderson tells TechCrunch, &#8220;design and build our commercial-scale machine, and start our first paid deployment.&#8221; The latest round followed an early-stage $3 million raise in 2017 and $400K the year prior. The company has raised $8.4 million in total.</p>

<p>“As record heat waves force farmworkers indoors and stifle harvests this week, Traptic&#8217;s mission has become more timely than ever,” Collaborative Fund’s Craig Shapiro said in comment offered to TechCrunch. “The launch of their robotic strawberry picker in commercial fields is a big step forward for the $10 billion strawberry market, and a peek into the future of agricultural production more broadly. Collaborative is proud to get behind a technology that can heighten crop security while creating safer jobs across the food supply chain, and we&#8217;re confident that Traptic is the right team to see that vision through.”</p>
<p>Traptic’s system combines 3D cameras and AI vision with robotic arms capable of plucking the fragile fruit without damaging it. The company currently employees around a dozen people largely in robotics and engineering and is advised by Pieter Abbeel of UC Berkeley and Serge Belongie of Cornell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zebra Technologies this morning <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210701005144/en/Zebra-Technologies-to-Acquire-Fetch-Robotics">announced its intention</a> to purchased Bay Area-based warehouse robotics firm, Fetch. The $290 million deal finds the enterprise corporation snapping up 95% of the company, in addition to the 5% it already owns.</p>
<p>The deal comes as interesting in warehouse and fulfillment robotics is continuing to heat up, both in the wake of pandemic-fueled labor shortages and as retails are looking for any potential upper-hand in the battle against Amazon’s dominance. It’s been a huge driver for investments in small and large robotics firms alike, including the recently SPACed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/">Berkshire-Grey.</a></p>
<p>Zebra, for its part, has been extremely aggressive in the category of late. In addition to launching its own retail robotics like the SmartSight inventory system announced early last year, the company has been investing in Fetch’s direct competitors like Locus, for which it led a $40 million Series D last June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>From the outside, it seems that Zebra is may be looking to consolidate the market around a single unified play. As Locus CEO Rick Faulk told me during another recent round, “We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>
<p>He added, at the time, that the company had no interest in being acquired. I can’t say for certain that Zebra was actively pursuing it, but if today’s news is any indication, it’s clear that the company was looking to jump in with both feet – and Fetch’s diverse, modular offering is a pretty good place to start.</p>

<p>“The acquisition of Fetch Robotics will accelerate our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and growth in intelligent industrial automation by embracing new modes of empowering workflows and helping our customers operate more efficiently in increasingly automated, data-powered environments,” Zebra CEO Anders Gustafsson said in a release. “This move will also extend our ongoing commitment to optimize the supply chain from the point of production to the point of consumption. We are excited to welcome the Fetch team to the Zebra family.”</p>
<p>Fetch CEO Melonee Wise adds, “The Fetch team is excited to join Zebra and accelerate the adoption of flexible automation through AMRs and our cloud-based robotics platform. Together we have the right team with the right technology to provide end-to-end solutions that solve real customer problems. By helping customers dynamically optimize and holistically orchestrate their fulfillment, distribution, and manufacturing operations, together we help enable their ability to stay ahead of growing demand, minimize delivery times and address shrinking labor pools.”</p>
<p>We’ve reached out for additional comment. The deal is pending the standard regulatory approval. It’s expected to close in Q3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For edtech startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/">it’s always been easier to go direct-to-consumer</a> than it is to sell into school districts. The latter has stodgy and strict sales cycles, while the former has a bit more flexibility when it comes to opening up that wallet. The pandemic added validation to this dynamic by supercharging consumer companies like Quizlet and Outschool, bringing them into the unicorn club.</p>
<p>Despite this growth, many startups still think that going B2B, directly into schools, will have the biggest impact on students, especially those who may not be able to afford supplemental services out of school. And while it&#8217;s the long game, Montreal-based <a href="https://paper.co/">Paper,</a> an educational software provider that powers tutoring services in schools, just gave the sector a massive signal that venture-backed returns and school districts can exist in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Paper announced that it has raised $100 million USD in a Series C round led by IVP. Other investors include Framework Venture Partners, Bullpen Capital, Reach Capital, Birchmere Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, BDC Capital and ETW.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, founded in 2014, sells tutoring software to K-12 schools in the United States and Canada. Its software allows students to request live tutor help on-demand, which can then be delivered in four languages across 200 subject areas. In the last year, Paper has grown from 100 tutors to 1000 tutors.</p>
<p>“School districts are not necessarily comfortable working with a company where these educators who have access to all their children are just contractors popping online and disappearing,” said Paper CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/pacutler">Philip Cutler</a>. “[Our tutors] are held to all the same professional standards that a classroom teacher would be.” The company has made its tutors part-time workers, to add a layer of incentive and formality to the working relationship and potentially limit attrition.</p>
<p>Cutler sees Paper as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">an alternate pathway for teachers looking to make a living</a> outside of traditional school districts. However, scalability demands could inherently clash with what teachers came to the profession to do &#8211; prioritizing speed and number of finished queries instead of consistent, repeatable help.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sClobbnHOH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/embed/#?secret=sClobbnHOH" data-secret="sClobbnHOH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, the flexibility around how Paper&#8217;s advice looks and arrives is compelling. Paper claims it has 24/7 support, and that a student can request live chat help for five minutes, or for hours depending on the nature of the assignment. Since the company goes in-district, teachers can see where students are struggling most and cater class time to problem areas.</p>
<p>The company embodies a lot of what companies like Quizlet, Course Hero and Brainly have somewhat only recently invested in:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/"> the rise of smart, not slow, tutoring sessions. </a>They’re all betting that that modern-day extra help may not look like a Zoom, but instead a live chat with a white board feature tacked on.</p>
<p>The company declined to disclose valuation, but instead pointed to other growth metrics to illustrate its positioning in the market. Paper grew its staff from 30 employees to 130 employees. It has also grown 40x in revenue over the past two years, which Cutler said is mostly fueled by strong renewals and the network effect within school districts.</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t want to be the last district in your community or your area to have it, so we&#8217;ve seen a lot of adoption from that perspective,” he said.</p>
<p>Cutler admitted that there hasn’t been too many breakout B2B edtech businesses for the sector, but he thinks Paper’s latest raise &#8211; its third in the past 18 months &#8211; could be a signal that the entrepreneurial energy of direct-to-consumer might finally be making its way into the hallway.</p>

<p>“I think school districts are more receptive than they&#8217;ve ever been to changing and trying new things, and the last month has really shown us that you can actually take risks and you can try different things in school.”</p>
<p>He added: “It’s been lost in education for a while, and I’m proud of what’s happened over the last year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous driving system developer Ghost Locomotion has raised a $100 million Series D funding round, led by Sutter Hill Ventures. Returning investor Founders Fund also participated in the round, along with Coatue. The money will be used toward R&amp;D as the company continues to develop its highway self-driving and crash prevention technology.</p>
<p>Ghost has been working on a universal collision avoidance technology. The system is premised on the idea that an autonomous driving system doesn’t need to recognize and categorize objects prior to avoiding them – a major paradigm shift. Most systems begin by identifying an object and then use image localization to determine its size, distance and other relevant features.</p>
<p>“We skip that step,” Ghost CEO John Hayes told TechCrunch. “We’re going to recognize anything, any mass that appears in the scene, and then we can get a distance and relative velocity to that. We can start making decisions directly off that data before we’ve classified anything.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ghost instead tracks the movement of clusters of pixels in a scene. Hayes pointed to instances where an object is misclassified, or objects that the system hasn’t trained on, as possible failure modes and a reason why classification does not need to be a prerequisite for collision avoidance. Much of this comes down to the certainty of the system’s decisions. According to Ghost, an autonomous system that starts from image recognition is one loaded with lots of opportunity for uncertainty – and it argues, less safe actions on the road.</p>
<p>One obvious counter-argument is that objects should be classified because they behave differently – a vehicle acts differently than a pedestrian, so classification is what allows a system to predict their behavior. But Hayes said that one shouldn&#8217;t start with classification, but collision avoidance. &#8220;And then if you want to make predictions, you can still do classification,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One benefit of its system, according to Ghost, is that it requires less computational power – an important consideration for vehicle owners, as higher processing demands can translate into less fuel efficiency. It’s also important for battery electric vehicles that have autonomous driving systems, as each watt of computer power demanded by the AV system can cause a reduction in driving range. Tesla, for example, revealed in 2019 that driving range could be reduced by up to 25% when the driver-assist system was enabled.</p>

<p>Ghost has performed most if its tests off-road, by setting up physical obstacles or by using augmented reality up against a real vehicle. It has not yet started testing its collision avoidance system in an urban environment, where decision complexity skyrockets considerably. Nor has it started testing on public highways – that will begin this year, and scale up next year, with a human safety driver behind the wheel, Hayes said.</p>
<p>The company seems to have slightly altered its market roadmap since it last talked to TechCrunch in 2019. Then, Ghost was developing a consumer kit that would give privately owned passenger vehicles autonomous driving capability on highways. It had estimated that it would debut the kit in 2020, for less than Tesla’s Autopilot package (which went for around $7,000 at the time).</p>
<p>The company hasn’t completely closed the door on this model – Hayes said that “we want to get this in front of customers” – but now it’s also talking about working with automakers directly to get its technology stack into vehicles before they’re even sold.</p>
<p>“We’ll find any path to market we can take,” he added. Under the straight-to-consumer model, the company is starting with a limited number of compatible models, and the cars must be relatively new due to the minimum technological requirements of the system.</p>
<p>Along with the funding news, Ghost also said it had brought on Jacqueline Glassman, former Chief Counsel and Acting Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as General Counsel. She joined the company in April and will likely play a key role as Ghost joins other autonomous driving technology developers in the path to commercialization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is embracing longer videos. The company announced this morning it will roll out the option to create videos of up to 3 minutes in length after first testing the change with a larger number of creators over the past several months. Previously, TikTok videos could be up to 60 seconds in length, after initially expanding from 15-second clips. This 60-second video format had since been copied by newer TikTok competitors, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Snapchat Spotlight</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">YouTube Shorts</a>.</p>
<p>According to TikTok, the company decided to expand its max video length based on feedback it heard from its creator community. For some kinds of content, creators wanted more time and flexibility when filming &#8212; like when they were filming cooking demos, beauty tutorials, educational content, and comedic sketches, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;With longer videos, creators will have the canvas to create new or expanded types of content on TikTok, with the flexibility of a bit more space,&#8221; explained TikTok Product Manager Drew Kirchhoff, in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/longer-videos">announcement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before the expansion to 3 minutes, many creators had worked around TikTok&#8217;s limitations by encouraging viewers to &#8220;like and follow&#8221; them for part 2 (or 3, or 4&#8230;) of their video series. That may have worked to gain some additional followers, but it became frustrating to viewers who didn&#8217;t want to scroll through the creators&#8217; other videos just to find the rest of the video content they had originally been interested in. It also made it clear how many TikTok creators were having to find a solution to an artificial limitation that didn&#8217;t need to exist.</p>
<p>This change to video length could make TikTok even more of a competitor to YouTube, which has been worried enough about TikTok&#8217;s growth to launch its own TikTok rival directly in its own app, YouTube Shorts. But TikTok understands its platform advantage isn&#8217;t how short the videos are, it&#8217;s the combination of features it offers &#8212; including its extensive library of special effects, AR tools, music catalog, and the dialog created among creators by way of specialized tools like stitches and duets.</p>
<p>Other rivals are also taking notice of the TikTok threat.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Instagram Head <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?s=21">Adam Mosseri said</a> the Facebook-owned app historically associated with photo-sharing would soon begin experimenting with making short, entertaining videos a more central part of the Instagram experience. He promised Instagram would test out with new ways to better embrace video, including &#8220;fullscreen, immersive, entertaining, mobile-first video.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, there&#8217;s some really serious competition right now. TikTok is huge. YouTube is even bigger,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>TikTok had first begun tests of 3 minutes videos <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnavarra/status/1334125358103277575?lang=en">late last year.</a> The company  says the option to film longer videos will roll out to global users over the weeks ahead. Users will be notified when they receive the update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most companies don&#8217;t announce their first venture investment after almost 20 years in the business, nor do they announce that round is the equivalent of a good startup&#8217;s entire private fundraising history. But <a href="https://articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, a SaaS training and development platform, is not your typical company and today it announced a whopping $1.5 billion investment on a $3.75 billion valuation.</p>
<p>You can call it Series A if you must label it, but whatever it is, it&#8217;s a hefty investment by any measure. General Atlantic led the round with participation from Blackstone Growth and Iconiq Growth. GA claims it&#8217;s one of the largest A rounds ever, and I&#8217;m willing to bet it&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>CEO Adam Schwartz founded the company with his life savings in 2002 and hasn&#8217;t taken a dime of outside investment since. &#8220;Our software enables organizations to develop, deliver, and analyze online training that is engaging and [interesting] for enterprises and SMBs,&#8221; Schwartz explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that the company started back in 2002 as a plug-in for PowerPoint. Today it is a software service with the goal of helping enable everyone to deliver training, even if they aren&#8217;t a training professional. Articulate actually has two main products, one is a set of tools for companies building training that connects to an enterprise learning management system or LMS. The other is aimed at SMBs or departments in an enterprise.</p>
<p>Its approach seems to be working with the company reporting it has 106,000 customers across 161 countries including every single one of the Fortune 100. Schwartz was loath to share any additional metrics, but did say they hope to use this money to grow 10x over the next several years.</p>

<p>Company president Lucy Suros, who has been with the organization for a decade, says even with this success, they see plenty of opportunity for growth and they felt taking this capital now would really enable them to accelerate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the most dominant player by far in course offering apps, but when you look at that whole ecosystem and you think about where companies are in transforming from instructor-led training to online training, they&#8217;re still really in the early innings so there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Anton Levy, co-president and managing director at General Atlantic, who is leading the investment for the firm, says that this is a &#8220;big, bold, incredible business&#8221; and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re making an investment of this size and scope. &#8220;The reason we&#8217;re stepping up in such a large way, and what&#8217;s such a large check for us, is because of the business they&#8217;ve built, the team they&#8217;ve built, and frankly the market opportunity that they&#8217;re playing in and their ambition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today the company has 300 employees and they have been working as a remote company long before COVID. With the new capital, that number could triple over the next several years. Suros says that when she started at the company, there were 50 employees, mostly male engineers and she went to work to make it a more diverse work environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve put emphasis and a lot of just structural things in place to ensure that we are bringing more [diverse] people to the table, and then supporting folks once they&#8217;re here,&#8221; she said. With the new capital, the company announced a lot of new benefits and she said those were developed with the idea of helping break down barriers for under-represented groups in their ranks including covering gender transition-related costs.</p>
<p>She says that one of the benefits of becoming more visible as a company is being able to talk about and their <a href="https://articulatehco.com/#/lessons/4QO-wAZFGaknlor-QI8Heibaff8OM7yF">human-centered organization framework</a>, the set of principles the company put in place to define its values. &#8220;[We think about] how that can impact the employees and drive human flourishing for its own sake, and that also happens to lead to better business outcomes. But we&#8217;re really also interested in it from [the standpoint that] we want to be good and do good in the world and promote human flourishing at work,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company seems to have been doing just fine up until now, but with this kind of capital, it aims to take the business to another level, while trying to be good corporate citizens as they do that.</p>

<p>&mdash; Ulrich Kelber (@UlrichKelber) <a href="https://twitter.com/UlrichKelber/status/1408380956495450114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While Kelber&#8217;s own agency, the BfDi, does not appear to have a Facebook Page (although Facebook&#8217;s algorithms appear to generate this <a href="https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=105963429443828&amp;__tn__=%2As-R">artificial stub</a> if you try searching for one) plenty of other German federal bodies do &#8212; such as the Ministry of Health, whose public page has more than 760,000 followers.</p>
<p>The only alternative to such pages vanishing from Facebook&#8217;s platform by Christmas &#8212; or else being ordered to be taken down early next year by Kelber &#8212; seems to be for the tech giant to make more substantial changes to how its platform operators than it has offered so far, allowing the Pages to be run in Germany in a way that complies with EU law.</p>
<p>However Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">a long history</a> of ignoring privacy expectations and data protection laws.</p>
<p>It has also, very recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">shown itself more than willing</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/">reduce the quality of information available to users</a> &#8212; if doing so further its business interests (such as to lobby against a media code law, as users in Australia can attest).</p>
<p>So it looks rather more likely that German government agencies will be the ones having to quietly bow off the platform soon&#8230;</p>

<p>Kelber says he&#8217;s avoided taking action over the ministries&#8217; Facebook Pages until now on account of the public bodies arguing that their Facebook Pages are an important way for them to reach citizens.</p>
<p>However his letter points out that government bodies must be &#8220;role models&#8221; in matters of legal compliance &#8212; and therefore have &#8220;a particular duty&#8221; to comply with data protection law. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">EDPS is taking a similar tack by reviewing EU institutions&#8217; use of US cloud services giants</a>.)</p>
<p>Per his assessment, an &#8220;addendum&#8221; provided by Facebook in 2019 does not rectify the compliance problem and he concludes that Facebook has made no changes to its data processing operations to enable Page operators to comply with requirements set out in the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>A ruling by Europe&#8217;s top court, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/europes-top-court-takes-a-broad-view-on-privacy-responsibilities-around-platforms/">June 2018</a>, is especially relevant here &#8212; as it held that the administrator of a fan page on Facebook is jointly responsible with Facebook for the processing of the data of visitors to the page.</p>
<p>That means that the operators of such pages also face data protection compliance obligations, and cannot simply assume that Facebook&#8217;s T&amp;Cs provide them with legal cover for the data processing the tech giant undertakes.</p>
<p>The problem, in a nutshell, is that Facebook does not provide Pages operates with enough information or assurances about how it processes users&#8217; data &#8212; meaning they&#8217;re unable to comply with GDPR principles of accountability and transparency because, for example, they&#8217;re unable to adequately inform followers of their Facebook Page what is being done with their data.</p>
<p>There is also no way for Facebook Page operators to switch off (or otherwise block) wider processing of their Page followers by Facebook. Even if they don&#8217;t make use of any of the analytics features Facebook provides to Page operators.</p>
<p>The processing still happens.</p>
<p>This is because Facebook operates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">a take-it-or-leave it &#8216;data maximizing&#8217; model</a> &#8212; to feed its ad-targeting engines.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s an approach that could backfire if it ends up permanently reducing the quality of the information available on its network because there&#8217;s a mass migration of key services off its platform. Such as, for example, every government agency in the EU deleted its Facebook Page.</p>
<p>A related <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Fachthemen/Inhalte/Telefon-Internet/Datenschutzpraxis/FacebookFanpages.html">blog post on the BfDi&#8217;s website</a> also holds out the hope that &#8220;data protection-compliant social networks&#8221; might develop in the Facebook compliance vacuum.</p>
<p>Certainly there could be a competitive opportunity for alternative platforms that seek to sell services based on respecting users&#8217; rights.</p>

<p>Discussing the BfDis intervention, Luca Tosoni, a research fellow at the University of Oslo&#8217;s Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law, told TechCrunch: &#8220;This development is strictly connected to recent CJEU case law on joint controllership. In particular, it takes into account the Wirtschaftsakademie ruling, which found that the administrator of a Facebook page should be considered a joint controller with Facebook in respect of processing the personal data of the visitors of the page.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not mean that the page administrator and Facebook share equal responsibility for all stages of the data processing activities linked to the use of the Facebook page. However, they must have an agreement in place with a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities. According to the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Facebook’s current data protection &#8216;Addendum&#8217; would not seem to be sufficient to meet the latter requirement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth noting that, in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/europes-top-court-sharpens-guidance-for-sites-using-leaky-social-plug-ins/">Fashion ID ruling</a>, the CJEU has taken the view that the GDPR’s obligations for joint controllers are commensurate with those data processing stages in which they actually exercise control,&#8221; Tosoni added. &#8220;This means that the data protection obligations a Facebook page administrator would normally tend to be quite limited.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Warnings for other social media services</h2>
<p>This particular compliance issue affects Facebook in Germany &#8212; and potentially any other EU market. But o<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ther social media services may face similar problems too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For example, Kelber&#8217;s letter flags an ongoing audit of Instagram, TikTok and Clubhouse &#8212; warning of &#8220;deficits&#8221; in the level of data protection they offer too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He goes on to recommend that agencies avoid using the three apps on business devices.  </span></p>
<p>In an earlier, <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/DokumenteBfDI/AccessForAll/2021/2019_Soziale-Medien-Deutscher-Bundestag.html">2019 assessment</a> of government bodies&#8217; use of social media services, the BfDi suggested usage of Twitter could &#8212; by contrast &#8212; be compliant with data protection rules. At least if privacy settings were fully enabled and analytics disabled, for example.</p>
<p>At the time the BfDi also warned that Facebook-owned Instagram faced similar compliance problems to Facebook, being subject to the same &#8220;abusive&#8221; approach to consent he said was taken by the whole group.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on Kelber&#8217;s latest recommendations to government agencies, Facebook did not engage with our specific questions &#8212; sending us this generic statement instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the end of 2019, we updated the Page Insights addendum and clarified the responsibilities of Facebook and Page administrators, for which we took questions regarding transparency of data processing into account. It is important to us that also federal agencies can use Facebook Pages to communicate with people on our platform in a privacy-compliant manner.”</p></blockquote>
<p>An additional complication for Facebook has arisen in the wake of the legal uncertainty following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">last summer&#8217;s Schrems II ruling</a> by the CJEU.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield arrangement, which had allowed companies to self-certify an adequate level of data protection, removing the easiest route for transferring EU users&#8217; personal data over to the US. And while the court did not outlaw international transfers of EU users&#8217; personal data altogether it made it clear that data protection agencies must intervene and suspend data flows if they suspect information is being moved to a place, and in in such a way, that it&#8217;s put at risk.</p>
<p>Following Schrems II, transfers to the US are clearly problematic where the data is being processed by a US company that&#8217;s subject to FISA 702, as is the case with Facebook.</p>
<p>Indeed, Facebook&#8217;s EU-to-US data transfers were the original target of the complainant in the Schrems II case (by the eponymous Max Schrems). And a decision remains pending on whether the tech giant&#8217;s lead EU data supervisor will follow through on a preliminary order last year to it should suspend its EU data flows &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">due in the coming months</a>.</p>
<p>Even ahead of that long-anticipated reckoning in Ireland, other EU DPAs are now stepping in to take action &#8212; and Kelber&#8217;s letter references the Schrems II ruling as another issue of concern.</p>
<p>Tosoni agrees that GDPR enforcement is finally stepping up a gear. But he also suggested that compliance with the Schrems II ruling comes with plenty of nuance, given that each data flow must be assessed on a case by case basis &#8212; with a range of supplementary measures that controllers may be able to apply.</p>
<p>&#8220;This development also shows that European data protection authorities are getting serious about enforcing the GDPR data transfer requirements as interpreted by the CJEU in Schrems II, as the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom flagged this as another pain point,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the German Federal Commissioner sent out his letter on the use of Facebook pages a few days before the EDPB adopted the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">final version its recommendations on supplementary measures for international data transfers</a> following the CJEU Schrems II ruling. Therefore, it remains to be seen how German data protection authorities will take these new recommendations into account in the context of their future assessment of the GDPR compliance of the use of Facebook pages by German public authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such recommendations do not establish a blanket ban on data transfers to the US but impose the adoption of stringent safeguards, which will need to be followed to keep on transferring the data of German visitors of Facebook pages to the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe/">recent judgment by the CJEU</a> reaffirmed that EU data protection agencies can, in certain circumstances, take action when they are not the lead data supervisor for a specific company under the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism &#8212; expanding the possibility for litigation by watchdogs in Member States if a local agency believes there&#8217;s an urgent need to act.</p>
<p>Although, in the case of the German government bodies&#8217; use of Facebook Pages, the earlier CJEU ruling finding on joint law controllership means the BfDi already has clear jurisdiction to target these agencies&#8217; Facebook Pages itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Primary care company One Medical has apologized after it sent out an email that exposed hundreds of customers&#8217; email addresses.</p>
<p>The email sent out by One Medical on Wednesday asked to &#8220;verify your email,&#8221; but one email seen by TechCrunch had more than 980 email addresses copied on the email. The cause: One Medical did not use the blind carbon copy (bcc:) field to mass email its customers, which would have hidden their email addresses from each other.</p>
<p>Several customers took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaggs/status/1410390055839944704">complain</a>, but also express sympathy for what was quickly chalked up to an obvious mistake. Some users reported varying numbers of email addresses on the email that they received.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>We asked One Medical how many customers had their email addresses exposed and if the company plans to report the incident to state governments, as may be required under state data breach notification laws, but we did not immediately hear back.</p>
<p>In a brief statement <a href="https://twitter.com/onemedical/status/1410399594513567747">posted to Twitter</a>, One Medical acknowledged the mistake, said: &#8220;We are aware emails were sent to some of our members that exposed recipient email addresses. We apologize if this has caused you concern, but please rest assured that we have investigated the root cause of this incident and confirmed that this was not caused by a security breach of our systems. We will take all appropriate actions to prevent this from happening again.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the scale of security lapses, this one is fairly low down on the impact scale — compared to a breach of passwords, or financial and health data. But the exposure of email addresses can still be used to identify customers of the company.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based One Medical, backed by Google&#8217;s parent company Alphabet, went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/alphabet-backed-primary-care-startup-one-medical-files-to-go-public/">public last year</a> just prior to the start of the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting today, Pinterest will prohibit all advertisers from sharing ads that promote weight loss. This includes any language and imagery that encourages weight loss, promotes weight loss products, idealizes certain body types, or references the BMI (which is often <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/the-bizarre-and-racist-history-of-the-bmi-7d8dc2aa33bb">a poor indicator of overall health</a>). This makes Pinterest the first major social media platform to take this stance.</p>
<p>Social media has played a role in promoting harmful beauty standards for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/over-a-year-after-new-content-policies-self-harm-social-media-still-thrives/">as long as it&#8217;s existed</a>. But even as &#8220;body positivity&#8221; has eclipsed the &#8220;thinspo&#8221; that proliferated on Tumblr a decade ago, sometimes, the trend can be a thin veil for weight stigma. Take a company like Weight Watchers, for example, which <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/03/weight-watchers-name-change-ww-dieting-culture.html">re-branded</a> to WW (&#8220;Wellness That Works&#8221;) in 2018, yet continues to boast its members&#8217; weight loss stories on its website. Even when online content about weight loss is well-meaning, it often contributes to a rise in disordered eating behavior rather than healthy habits, which is why <a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1256525/the-wellness-industry-thrives-on-the-fear-of-death/">the wellness industry can be so harmful</a>.</p>
<p>Pinterest developed its updated ad policy with guidance from the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/">National Eating Disorders Association</a> (NEDA), which has also worked with platforms like Tumblr and Facebook in the past. Since March 2020, the onset of the pandemic in the US, NEDA has experienced an increase in activity on its helplines for people struggling with eating disorders. As Vox&#8217;s Rebecca Jennings <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22226997/body-positivity-instagram-tiktok-fatphobia-social-media">pointed out</a>, people started spending even more time online during lockdown, which means more exposure to content that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/limiting-social-media-use-reduced-loneliness-and-depression-in-new-experiment/">makes us feel bad</a> about ourselves. Even the TikTok-famous sixteen-year-old actress Sissy Sheridan <a href="https://twitter.com/sissysheridan/status/1261075790168576000">tweeted</a>, &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">i liked my body before i downloaded tik tok.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<div class="css-1dbjc4n">Pinterest&#8217;s new policy can make a tangible difference, especially if it sets a precedent for other major platforms to follow suit. Social media platforms have a responsibility to minimize the harmful activity that happens on their apps, but how far can the impact of these new policies extend? Pinterest reported that searches for &#8220;body neutrality&#8221; are up 5x since last year, offering an alternative to the &#8220;body positivity&#8221; movement, which is often just diet culture in a trench coat. But especially on algorithm-driven apps like TikTok, we can&#8217;t always control the content that comes up on your For You page. If you like to cook, TikTok will show you cooking videos, but the AI isn&#8217;t smart enough to filter out cooking accounts with &#8220;weight loss&#8221; in their bios if you don&#8217;t engage with that content. Pinterest recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">its own TikTok competitor</a>, and of course, Instagram is trying to capture the success of TikTok through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/new-instagram-insights-make-its-tiktok-competitor-reels-more-appealing/">Reels</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">Pinterest&#8217;s ad policy update is a good start, and one that can only have a positive impact if other platforms follow its lead. But social media reflects our culture back to us, and until there&#8217;s a broader cultural shift to understand that &#8220;weight loss&#8221; and &#8220;wellness&#8221; aren&#8217;t synonymous, an ad policy can only go so far.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.codat.io/">Codat</a>, a startup that provides APIs to link small-business fintech data to external services, announced that it has closed a $40 million round led by Tiger Global. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/codat-raises-10-million-to-aggregate-all-financial-data-from-small-businesses/">raised $10 million in a Series A around a year ago</a> that Index led; Codat also raised some strategic capital in the interim, but declined in an interview to provide more detail.</p>
<p>The company also declined to provide any guidance regarding how much its valuation changed in the last year between lettered rounds.</p>
<p>That Codat managed to raise more money is not a surprise, as the startup told TechCrunch that it grew its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 3x from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. The company&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterdeveloper/">Pete Lord</a> disclosed that the company is on track to repeat the feat this year. Such growth would imply a 9x gain in revenue at the end of 2021 compared to the result from two years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things are going well at Codat, in other words.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s API connects corporate data from internal SMB systems &#8212; QuickBooks, iZettle etc. &#8212; to external providers. The use cases for the service are easy to understand. If a small business wants to apply for a loan, the ability to provide a potential lender with its financial data in a quick, digital fashion would be useful. Codat would happily facilitate that data linkage.</p>
<p>The startup sells to financial service players, unsurprisingly, and vertical SaaS companies; serving the vertical SaaS space is big business, given that this is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/2171608/">second piece of news</a> targeting the software varietal that TechCrunch has seen this week.</p>
<p>Building the Plaid for SMB data is a big job, so it&#8217;s not surprising that Codat has been busy hiring. From around 50 employees at the time of its Series A, the startup is now quickly approaching the 150-employee mark. Lord said that the company is hoping to end the year with around 250 staff.</p>

<p>The startup has an interesting array of products that are not its API service. Codat offers a visualization tool, for example, to display single-company data for customers in a more digestible format. And, the startup that it released a service called &#8220;Insights&#8221; that provides a method of cross-referencing ingested data from different services. Per Lord, Codat is bundling its other pieces of software with its API today. Asked why the startup isn&#8217;t charging separately for the tools, the CEO said that Codat is more focused on maximizing usage of its core service.</p>
<p>This leaves us with two questions regarding the future of Codat. The first is when &#8212; perhaps <em>if</em> &#8212; the startup charges for its non-core services that make its API tool more useful. And the second deals with the size of companies&#8217; data that it hopes to provide the connective tissue for. Today Codat focuses on SMBs, though it is creeping higher in terms of the size of companies that might to pass their data through its API to other groups.</p>
<p>The two questions are linked. Codat wants to maximize its API usage because it charges customers based on the number of companies that they are connecting to; there are many more SMBs than large companies, so going after that slice of the larger corporate landscape makes sense. As does offering value-add services on top of its API if it keeps its SMB-focus.</p>
<p>But as Codat builds out its service, data from larger companies may more land inside its remit. And if they do, the company&#8217;s current model would prove slightly dissonant. A different pricing scheme for connecting to larger companies might work. Or a focus on charging for <em>data passed</em>, and not <em>companies connected</em> more generally. It will be interesting to watch the company&#8217;s business model evolve over time.</p>
<p>Regardless, the company is busy hiring in San Francisco, New York, and London. Let&#8217;s see how far its new Tiger check can take it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karin Tsai joined Duolingo in 2012 and is now the director of engineering. Yesterday, at TechCrunch’s City Spotlight: Pittsburgh, she spoke on the company’s extensive development process and unique culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This interview was pre-recorded and aired a day after the company filed its SEC Form S-1 ahead of its initial public offering. As per SEC regulations, the company is now in a quiet period and it’s fair to say that Tsai gave the company’s last interview for quite a while.</p>
<p>This interview is the latest in TechCrunch’s deep dive into Pittsburgh’s Duolingo. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">we published a four-part series on the company</a> that includes Duolingo’s origin story, it’s product-led growth strategy, monetization plan, and how develops and implements new initiatives and features.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="60dcd23f4659554a276adba5" post-id="2172376"></div> </p>
<h2>And it all starts with an A/B test</h2>
<p>Tsai works with the some 170 engineers at Duolingo, which make up the vast majority of the company. That composition has led to A/B testing turning into a key part of Duolingo&#8217;s strategy, as it works to create an app that has effective yet inclusive gamification. At any given time, there might be 100 different A/B tests running, which caused Duolingo&#8217;s analytics team to even build a dashboard to track impact of experiments. Tsai walked us through an early realization of the common test below:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">[A/B testing] has been such a key lever in our success as a company. I think one of the things that was important for us was to keep an open mind to tests that fail. So I think one of the temptations we have is to come with a preconceived notion of what should win when we run the test. If it doesn&#8217;t win, we just assume [that] there was some bug or some error, and not really pause to think </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">why</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> did that experiment lose. So, I would recommend for any startups looking to really integrate A/B testing into the fabric of their decision making: keep an open mind on what you might be missing about what your users are telling you through the data. Also, always be open to improving what you actually measure. At the beginning, we just kind of flatly measured learner retention [and] how many daily active users we had. But after a while, we decided to be a little more fine-grained about what we measured. So we measure new user retention versus existing user retention to sort of see the difference between how our new users are perceiving Duolingo, etc. And over time, you add more and more of these metrics, you could get a fuller picture of what what your changes actually doing. </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong>(Timestamp: 2:53)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">One quirk that came up during the Duolingo EC-1</a> is that Duolingo&#8217;s product team usually A/B tests new features in the French course for English speakers. It&#8217;s not because of any secret preferences, but because the course is so popular that it makes more statistical sense to test it out in this course before rolling it out to other languages. In contrast, if a team tested a feature in the Hindi course for English speakers, it would take a longer time to get useful results.</p>
<p>An A/B experiment that stands out in Tsai&#8217;s mind has to do with the subscription page, and saying no to increasing the bottom line.</p>
<blockquote><p>On our subscription page, we offer a free trial of the subscription. Before, the button used to say &#8216;start your seven day free trial.&#8217; We changed it to &#8216;start using Duolingo for free for a week&#8217; just to play around with copy. And we didn&#8217;t really expect too much from that, we just wanted to shorten the text.</p>
<p>It turns out that this ended up making us a lot more revenue per day. However, learner retention took a hit, and especially new user retention. Our hypothesis was that actually changing from &#8216;start my free trial&#8217; to &#8216;start my free week&#8217; made people think that they had to pay to use Duolingo. So, a lot more people actually subscribed because they thought they needed to pay. But we lost some learners, because they thought the experience was just overall not free. So we actually reverted that change, even though it made us some money. We learned a lot about how precise copy really needs to be to convey meaning. So, it was a really great learning to find that actually being more transparent with how you monetize, actually led to more modern successful monetization. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:47)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>On prioritizing monetization</h2>
<p>Duolingo notoriously launched with a bold promise: no advertisements, subscriptions or in-app purchases — approaches that now all exist on the platform. While the company appears to be doing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/?tpcc=ECTW2020">just fine financially now</a>, the choice to start charging was not easy, and felt directly in conflict with Duolingo&#8217;s mission to provide free education.</p>
<p>Tsai, who watched the company grow from 15 people to 400 plus, explained how she personally felt the company resolved that tension and ultimately made the move to charge some of its users, about 5%, money.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the way that we approach this is maybe idealistic. I can just speak for myself: oftentimes, it&#8217;s tempting for companies to either turn evil or feel like they&#8217;re turning evil once they start to monetize, right? But the reality is, hosting costs, salaries, etc, do cost a lot of money. If you want to continue hiring top talent, you need to make revenue and be able to support that. And the way that we approach it at Duolingo is that we know we can&#8217;t actually accomplish our mission without also being a sustainable company. If Duolingo continued being on VC funding the whole time, we would not be sustainable in the long term. If we do buy in so much, and love our products so much that we do want it to last hundreds of years. And to do that, we need to make sure we&#8217;re monetizing in a sustainable way. So I think that the way that we resolve tension in the company is that no matter what area you are working in, everyone has a common purpose to that end.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of benefit of the doubt that you kind of get for free by having a strong culture. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 8:21)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>How debate can live harmoniously within a startup</h2>
<p>The strong culture that Tsai is talking about was re-invented during the pandemic, when Duolingo along with many tech companies turned to distributed work.I wondered if remote work can make debate and disagreement, on something as small as an A/B test or as big as a monetization opportunity, difficult. Tsai mentioned a weekly e-mail from co-founder Luis von Ahn that made all the difference, as well as some transparency on failure.</p>
<blockquote><p>Luis our CEO sent started sending us a weekly company update every Monday morning. One of the first updates he gave was just a reminder to have empathy for your fellow what we call Duo&#8217;s, or fellow Duolingo employees. He sent those reminders often. I think this culture of empathy and constant reminders says that in a remote world, it&#8217;s harder to read social cues, body cues and it&#8217;s easier to bring more to work than maybe you normally would. I think during those times where there was maybe debate, we always were just reminded to have empathy, to realize that there&#8217;s a lot going on in everyone&#8217;s lives at the moment, and that what is being communicated may not be the entire picture of what someone&#8217;s going through. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 11:45)</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another aspect that actually helps a lot is that we send out every single experiment result that gets launched or killed. So the entire company continues to know how we make decisions and which way they go. So by the time someone&#8217;s running their own experiments and making these decisions, they would have seen hundreds of examples of calls we made in the past. And we tend to emphasize the more controversial ones as well, so that the entire company could be in line with how we make decisions. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:11)</strong></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>We ended up a conversation about opinions. From the jump, Duolingo has been an opinionated company &#8211; from where its based to how much it raised to how it wants to monetize (and differentiate from competitors). But that is easier said than done, especially in a polarized world.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s important to be strong about what you believe in. I think it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing to be opinionated, but I think it is important to also be open minded that not everyone will agree to be respectful of those positions. As a company, [your opinions] really needs to be [clear] from the beginning because it is always harder to add on. Suddenly, sudden opinions are in contrast with what a company has demonstrated through its actions. So I think avoiding hypocrisy is the most important thing when you do have strong opinions, and Duolingo has strong opinions about many things. I think [our opinions] are all consistent with how the company has operated from the beginning. And that has really helped us. And we tend to attract talent that believes in those missions. We&#8217;ve encoded those operating principles and actually written them down. And it is okay and reasonable for someone to disagree with this approach, but this is at least how we&#8217;ve decided to do it at Duolingo. And that makes it clear to people that we&#8217;ve intentionally made the decisions to go one way or the other on these things. So that has really helped, I think, unify everyone and understanding how that company operates.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 19:46)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br/">Mercado Bitcoin</a>, a Latin American digital assets exchange, has raised $200 million in Series B funding from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/">SoftBank Latin America Fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round values </span><a href="https://www.2tmgroup.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2TM Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mercado Bitcoin’s non-operating parent company, at $2.1 billion, ranking it among the </span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top 10 unicorns in Latin America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding comes just months after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercado Bitcoin’s Series A round (of an undisclosed amount) in January of 2021, which was co-led by G2D/GP Investments and Parallax Ventures, with participation from HS Investimentos , Gear Ventures, Évora and Genial.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also comes after an impressive first half of the year for the company. Between January and May 2021, Mercado Bitcoin says that about 700,000 new customers signed up to use its services, bringing its customer base to 2.8 million. That’s more than more than </span><a href="http://www.b3.com.br/pt_br/market-data-e-indices/servicos-de-dados/market-data/consultas/mercado-a-vista/perfil-pessoas-fisicas/faixa-etaria/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of the entire individual investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> base on Brazil’s stock exchange, according to the company. Also, during the first five months of the year, Mercado Bitcoin saw its trade volume surge to $5 billion, which is more than the total volume it saw in its first seven years combined. It’s also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 times the volume experienced during the same period in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by brothers Gustavo and Mauricio Chamati in 2013, Mercado Bitcoin was the first crypto exchange in Brazil. The company has been profitable since 2018, and until January 2021 had been bootstrapped from inception, reinvesting its cash generation into growth and portfolio expansion, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and 2TM Group Executive Chairman Roberto Dagnoni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This makes us a somewhat unique case in the ecosystem and among our fintech peers in general &#8211; few companies have managed to reconcile over 100% year-over-year growth with a positive bottom line,” he told TechCrunch, describing Mercado Bitcoin as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the crown j</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ewel” of 2TM Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holding company owns a number of other entities such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meubank, a multi-asset wallet and account service currently waiting for a Brazilian Central Bank license; Bitrust, a qualified digital custodian and Clearbook, an equity crowdfunding platform, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, 2TM Group became the first company in the world to tokenize public debt assets. Then in 2020, the company issued Futecoin, the world’s first digital asset based on FIFA&#8217;s solidarity mechanism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have also tokenized or distributed private debt, carbon credits and a variety of utility and DeFi tokens,” Dagnoni said. This year, Bitrust will extend the first Latin America based Digital Custody service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a lot more to come, and the series B round will be a relevant factor in supporting continuous innovation,” Dagnoni added. While he declined to reveal the amount of the Mercado Bitcoin’s Series A round, he said it allowed the company to invest around $40 million in expanding its operations in Brazil this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Mercado Bitcoin has about 500 employees. That compared to around 200 a year ago. By year’s end, Dagnoni projects it will have a headcount of about 700.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides hiring, he said that Mercado Bitcoin/2TM will also use the new capital toward expanding its service offerings and investing in infrastructure “to meet the soaring demand for crypto in the region.” In particular, the company will be focusing on acquiring new customers and product listings as well as expanding to other countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Chile “through a combination of M&amp;A and greenfield operations,” according to Dagnoni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly has driven so much growth for Mercado Bitcoin? Dagnoni believes there are a number of factors behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people around the world are realizing that digital assets and cryptocurrencies are both innovative in their technological foundations and are efficient in storing of value, and Brazil is no exception to this trend,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the country has seen some of the lowest interest rates on record, which he said has fueled the development of the alternative assets industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crypto is taking advantage of this trend, which is also on display for other asset classes, such as VC and private equity,” Dagnoni said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he believes that the fact that Brazil’s financial services industry is so concentrated has spelled opportunity for fintechs in general in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paulo Passoni, managing partner at SoftBank’s SBLA Advisers Corp<b>.</b> (which manages the SoftBank Latin America Fund) described Mercado Bitcoin as a “regional leader in the crypto space” that is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapping into a huge local and regional addressable market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added: “At SoftBank we look to invest in entrepreneurs who are challenging the status quo through tech-focused or tech-enabled business models that are disrupting an industry – Mercado Bitcoin is doing just that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>SoftBank has been active in Latin America as of late. In early June, the Japanese investment conglomerate said it would invest &#8220;up to $150 million&#8221; in Grupo Bursátil Mexicano (GBM), a 35-year-old investment platform in the Mexican stock market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to back Indian embedded finance startup Yap, according to more than half a dozen people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The New York-headquartered firm is in talks to lead a $35 million financing round in Yap &#8212; also known as YapPay and M2P &#8212; that values the Bangalore-headquartered startup at about $350 million, up from about $67 million in March this year (per data insight platform Tracxn), the people said.</p>
<p>At the current stages of negotiation, Tiger Global plans to invest between $25 million to $30 million in the new round (a Series C), some of the people said. The round hasn&#8217;t closed, so the deal size could become larger and other terms too may change, people said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yap operates an API infrastructure platform that allows other startups to support and build payments services. Yap, which has raised about $15.9 million to date, counts Better Capital, BeeNext, AngelList, Omidyar Network, 8i among its existing investors.</p>
<p>If the deal materializes, it will be the latest investment from Tiger Global in India, where it has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">backed over a dozen startups this year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a>, the startup based out of Turkey that has built a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.5 billion business</a> out a mobile app that lets consumers buy groceries and get them delivered in minutes, has grown its business up to now organically: targeting urban markets across Europe (and soon the U.S.) where it is disrupting the well-stocked cornershop with a service that needs even less effort and time from the average shopper. Now, it&#8217;s changing up that strategy with its first acquisition to break into three more countries.</p>
<p>The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.theblok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blok</a>, another &#8220;instant delivery&#8221; grocery service based out of Barcelona. Financial of the deal are not being disclosed but from what I understand, Blok (previously called Huvi Technologies) was bootstrapped, fairly new and small (launching only in February 2021), and was already shopping itself around.</p>
<p>Founded by Vishal Verma, Hunab Moreno and Varun Kapoor, Blok is active in Spain and Italy, where its biggest markets were Madrid, Barcelona and Milan. Portugal was on its roadmap pre-Getir, and it will also launch there soon. More than 120 employees will be joining Getir as part of the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getir has been around since 2015 and is profitable in Turkey on a mix of services that started with its fast delivery but has since expanded to other categories like wider grocery options (GetirMore, with longer delivery turnarounds), restaurant delivery (GetirFood), local business delivery (GetirLocals), and&#8230; water delivery (GetirWater).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s given Getir momentum it is now using to expand its flagship fast grocery model into other markets like the UK &#8212; I see its mopeds around my neighborhood in London <em>all</em> the time &#8212; the Netherlands, and Paris and Berlin. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions that it&#8217;s raised this year</a> (Getir has raised about $1 billion in total now) will also be used to get the company into the U.S. market, where it will go head to head with homegrown rivals in the same space such as GoPuff.</p>
<p>But while it may be one of the earliest movers and possibly the best capitalised, Getir is by no means the only player of its kind.</p>
<p>The European market is positively flush right now with startups that are building services around the same basic principles of super-fast delivery across an assortment of around 1,500 goods &#8212; typically much smaller than what you might find in a grocery store (17,000 is a normal number there), and closer to what you might get in the kind of quick-stop small market that exists throughout urban centers in Europe.</p>
<p>These startups, which include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapp</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cajoo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weezy</a> and many others have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars &#8212; but still less than $2 billion, Getir CEO and co-founder Nazim Salur estimated to me &#8212; to scale their operations.</p>
<p>Take up has been fairly enthusiastic, in part fueled by the pandemic and the fact that many people have been living under stay-at-home orders, or simply keen to stay out of public places to minimize Covid-19 spread; but also fueled in part by getting good traction with millennial and other younger consumers, who have really taken to using their mobiles for all practical chores, which get turned into leisure activities when they become apps.</p>
<p class="p1">Before Covid, Getir was seeing threefold growth annually, with some years, such as 2017, the company growing fivefold, Salur said. &#8220;During Covid we also grew 5x but without it, it would have been 4x. It accelerated our growth but Covid is not the main reason people use us. It&#8217;s mainly because we&#8217;re a big convenience. It means we can grow. In Turkey, life&#8217;s back to normal but every month we still grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, is it a big enough market for all these players? We&#8217;ve already heard of at least one that is struggling to raise more to compete &#8212; capital is key, given the balance of logistics and delivery, dark stores to stock items, having the items themselves to sell, not to mention the heavy competition &#8212; and is looking for a buyer as a result.</p>
<p>In that context, it might not be a surprise to hear that Blok hadn&#8217;t raised any notable funding itself and while it had built out some technology and a team of people, it was ready to sell up less than six months after launching.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are very excited to join hands with the pioneers of ultrafast delivery on our shared goal to lead the on-demand grocery market in Southern Europe,&#8221; said Verma from Block, in a statement. &#8220;This acquisition allows us to leverage Getir’s deep industry know-how, relationships and technology, while combining that with our world class team and execution capabilities to create a formidable leader in this part of the world. We’ve had a great response from all our launches in Spain and Italy and can&#8217;t wait to double down on our efforts alongside Getir.&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite this pretty obvious picture of consolidation-in-the-making, Getir isn&#8217;t going to get into the business of consolidating all that, though &#8212; well, not yet, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getir will not become an acquisition company, acquiring one after the other. That&#8217;s not the way we operate,&#8221; Salur, who co-founded the company with Serkan Borancili and Tuncay Tutek, said in an interview. &#8220;But, it’s a free market and if there is a good reason, a solid good reason, we might consider it. We won’t be going after ten different companies in this world, but if the right opportunity shows itself we’ll talk to people.&#8221;</p>
