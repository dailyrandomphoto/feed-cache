										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two of the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce players <a href="https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-com-and-shopify-ink-strategic-partnership-to-simplify-cross-border-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are joining joined hands</a>. Major Chinese online retailer JD.com has formed a strategic partnership with Ottawa-based Shopify to help global brands tap China&#8217;s enormous appetite for imported goods, as well as helping Chinese merchants sell overseas.</p>
<p>The news is turning heads in China&#8217;s cross-border e-commerce community. The first part of the deal will put the JD-Shopify alliance in direct competition with Alibaba. The JD nemesis has a sprawling import business, which counted 35,000 international brands<a href="https://www.alizila.com/chinas-gen-z-lead-demand-for-imports-on-alibabas-tmall-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> as of late</a>. Last year, over 6,000 brands entered China via Alibaba.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alibaba acquires NetEase Kaola in deal worth $2 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/alibaba-acquires-netease-kaola-in-deal-worth-2-billion/embed/#?secret=hUibYAIIAt" data-secret="hUibYAIIAt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>JD has been importing goods into China for years, but the existing brand onboarding process can take as long as a year. JD, often described as the Amazon of China for its heavy investment in logistics, will create a fast track for Shopify-powered brands to start selling to JD&#8217;s 500 million active buyers in as soon as four weeks. The platform will use tools like automated translation and price conversation to get sellers ready and will be flying goods via its fleet of cargo flights between the U.S. and China to start with.</p>
<p>JD doesn&#8217;t only intend to help brands market and sell in China. The company has also rolled out a neat supplier sourcing service for Shopify store owners called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhYJwnVDnc&amp;ab_channel=JDWorldwideApps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Sourcing</a>. Sellers will submit a product request via JD Sourcing, and once JD confirms the product is available in its inventory, the Chinese e-commerce company will get it to one of its overseas warehouses, ready to be listed on Shopify stores and sent to consumers via drop-shipping.</p>
<p>The other part of the deal, which is to bring Chinese goods overseas via Shopify&#8217;s direct-to-consumer solution, competes in a very crowded space. Amazon has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building itself up as a gateway for Chinese exporters</a>, employing an army of staff in the country to scour and manage merchants. While Amazon&#8217;s recent crackdown on fake reviews has sent shockwaves through China&#8217;s e-commerce industry, the Seattle-based titan remains a highly attractive channel for exporters, thanks to its market dominance.</p>
<p>To cope with stricter platform policies, many Amazon sellers are increasingly investing in product design and branding. Others choose to take up acquisition offers from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/markai-china-amazon-aggregator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand aggregators, also called Amazon roll-ups</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The JD-Shopify collaboration could offer a new alternative for Chinese exporters. Shopify has long been an option for those that want to amplify their brands, but autonomy comes with more work, requiring sellers to be more hands-on with marketing and logistics fulfillment.</p>
<p>Through the Shopify partnership, JD promises to &#8220;simplify access and compliance for Chinese brands and merchants looking to reach consumers in Western markets&#8221; and support them to &#8220;set up their DTC channels through Shopify.&#8221; Cross-border shipping will be taken care of by JD.</p>
<p>The two e-commerce giants appear to complement each other nicely &#8212; Shopify brings the range of products and JD offers its extensive global warehousing and shipping infrastructure. It&#8217;s an alliance worth watching.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The airline industry claims a “catastrophic” event could unfold on Wednesday when AT&amp;T and Verizon activate their new C-Band 5G networks. In a letter obtained by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/?taid=61e5bf0cd96d620001fd8b5b&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the CEOs of several prominent passenger and cargo airlines, including Delta, United and Southwest, warn interference from 5G cell towers could affect the sensitive safety equipment on their planes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded,&#8221; they state in the letter, which was sent to the heads of the White House Economic Council, Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. &#8220;Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>The airlines have asked that AT&amp;T and Verizon not offer 5G service within 2 miles of some of the country’s busiest and most vital airports. They’re also urging the federal government to ensure “5G is deployed except when towers are too close to airport runways until the FAA can determine how that can be safely accomplished without catastrophic disruption.&#8221; The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-5g-buffer-zones-airports-133305569.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">established 5G buffer zones</a> at 50 airports on January 7th.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The letter is the latest development in the ongoing back and forth between the airline and wireless industries. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon spent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>nearly $80 billion</ins></a> at the start of 2021 to secure the repurposed C-Band spectrum the FCC had put up for auction. In November, AT&amp;T and Verizon agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-c-band-5g-due-to-faa-164549890.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>delay</ins></a> their C-Band rollouts to January 5th to help the FAA address any interference concerns. They later proposed limiting the power <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-fcc-letter-aircraft-safety-211130190.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>output of cell towers</ins></a> close to airports and agreed to a further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-5g-expansion-061847173.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>two-week delay</ins></a> on January 4th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Los Angeles-based sports training platform Mustard this week announced a $3.75 million round. Led by Lake Nona Sports &amp; Health Tech Fund, this latest raise follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/mustard-raises-1-7m-to-improve-athletic-mechanics-with-ai/">$1.7 million round</a> back in late-2020, bringing the firm’s funding-to-date up to $6 million.</p>
<p>New investors this time out are Mark Cuban, OneTeam Partners, Ronnie Lott, Justin Rose, the Major League Soccer Players Association and the United States Women&#8217;s National (Soccer) Team Players Association, joining a list of existing investors that includes big name athletes like quarterback Drew Brees and pitching legend Nolan Ryan.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many young athletes out there who could be future Olympians, MLB pitchers, or high school state champions in whatever sport they&#8217;re passionate about,&#8221; Brees said in a statement offered up to TechCrunch. &#8220;For me, that was football. Unfortunately, many young athletes lack access to the type of coaching I received. I believe Mustard truly levels the playing field, making elite training accessible and affordable for young, aspiring athletes, and I&#8217;m proud to support their mission.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2258109" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258109" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2258109" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rocky-and-Tom.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258109" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mustard</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The expanded roster of investors comes as the firm looks to expand its coaching offerings beyond baseball &#8212; the root of its…quirky name (i.e. “put a little mustard” on a pitch). The list of additional sports includes golf, soccer and football. Golf seems like an easy enough jump from baseball, in terms of offering feedback to an athlete executing a move from a relatively stationary position. The company says part of the funding will go toward hiring additional team members to help them expand the offering.</span></p>
<p>“Our new investors bring force-multiplying experience and connections across all major American sports,” CEO Rocky Collis said in a release. “As we expand our platform to include additional major sports beyond baseball, athletes everywhere will be able to learn their personal recipe for improvement, regardless of their resources.”</p>
<p>Mustard’s sensor-free approach to data capture is what it hopes will set it apart from other offerings. The technology is a relatively low barrier of entry on this front, using a smartphone camera to collect mechanics of a given movement through a team that includes a number of former Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) employees. From there, the app offers feedback, in the form of a &#8220;report card.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brooklyn-based Upward Farms this week unveiled plans to launch a massive 250,000-square-foot vertical farm. Set for an early-2023 opening, the site will be located in Northeastern Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County. It’s a massive footprint for a vertical farm &#8212; particularly for a category that prides itself on limited land use. The roughly six acres of land puts the farm at multiple times the size of the competition’s space. The location is Upward’s third farm.</p>
<p>The farm will specifically focus on microgreens &#8212; a popular choice for indoor farming, due to its flexibility and limited spatial requirements versus other crops. Rather than the hydroponic or aeroponic growing method used by most of the competition, Upward relies on aquaponics, a looped system that utilizes fish to grow plants through the production of natural fertilizer.</p>
<p>The interesting twist to the system is that the company also sells its farm-grown bass. In December, the company announced that &#8212; in addition to selling produce at select New York Whole Foods locations &#8212; it would begin selling striped bass at Greenpoint Fish and Lobster in Brooklyn.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“With this new facility, we’ll be able to reach some of the most populous areas of the US, and nearly 100 million Americans, within a single day of distribution versus the week it can take to receive products from the west coast,” co-founder and CEO Jason Green said in a release. “This is a local success story with massive global implications for how and where food is grown, and the next generation of manufacturing technology.”</p>
<p>After getting up and running, Upward plans to begin sales from the farm in early 2023. The company, which raised a $121 million Series B last year, also plans to expand to additional markets in the coming year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Using a mobile phone app, a farmer can assign a job to one of the tractors, like mowing the field.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://agtonomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agtonomy</a> co-founder and CEO Tim Bucher was born and raised on a farm and was deep into his own farming business when he took a computer course while at UC Davis and got hooked.</p>
<p>It was that parallel agriculture/technology career that led him to start Agtonomy, a hybrid autonomy and tele-assist service startup that turns tractors and other equipment into autonomous machines to provide a low-cost, technology-enabled labor force for local farms to manage such equipment.</p>
<p>It came out of stealth mode last September with $4 million in seed funding from a group of backers that included Grit Ventures, GV and Village Global.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258220" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Grit and GV came back again to invest in the South San Francisco-based company and were part of a $5 million seed extension, led by Toyota Ventures, with participation from Flybridge, Hampton VC, E²JDJ and Momenta Ventures. The latest funding gives Agtonomy $9 million in total funding to date.</p>
<p>Having just raised funding, Bucher wasn’t expecting to raise again so soon, but when he saw the outlook for 2022 that agtech was going to be the No. 1 “hot area” for the year and beyond, he decided to take the additional funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Five years ago, it was hard to get any VC attention related to agtech, but there has just been overwhelming interest from investors, and though we are just starting out, local agriculture needs help now,” he added. “The funding will accelerate our trials and additional partners and essentially turbo-charge our activities and ability to double down at the speed in which we are moving, which includes expanding the team.”</p>
<p>Bucher anticipates having 50 trials going and to double the company’s 20-person headcount in the next few months.</p>
<p>Agtonomy is as simple as calling an Uber driver, he said. Using a mobile phone app, a farmer can assign a job to one of the tractors, like mowing the field. He believes self-driving technology like this, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/john-deeres-self-driving-tractor-arrives-later-this-fall/">what other companies like John Deere are doing</a>, will help to alleviate the decades of labor shortages in farms around the world.</p>
<p>The company has a small fleet of what he called “proof of concept” electric vehicles that have been operating for a year at Bucher’s Trattore Farms. He says the farm work on his farm is almost entirely done with these vehicles.</p>

<p>Bucher expects a commercial launch to happen in 2023, and the company will initially start with a few hundred tractors. In comparison, some 300,000 tractors are sold each year, he added. The tractors can be anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million, with companies like John Deere typically going after big farms.</p>
<p>In contrast, Agronomy’s autonomous vehicles will cost around $50,000, which Bucher believes will encourage larger farms to purchase a swarm of smaller machines that can run 24 hours a day, be more environmentally friendly and not tear up the land.</p>
<p>Jim Adler, the founding managing director of Toyota Ventures and an executive advisor at Toyota Research Institute, said in a written statement that “fully autonomous vehicles will become a reality on farms where they are more desperately needed much more quickly than they will on city streets.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Bucher believes that many of the autonomous vehicles today cater to more “convenience technologies,” while companies in the agtech space are building similar vehicles in what he calls “necessity technology.”</p>
<p>“It is kind of a perfect storm with consumer demand, climate change, electrification and labor shortage in farming,” he added. “We can solve these much sooner in agtech than having the other kinds of autonomous technology in our lives. With ours, it allows all of us to eat good food.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/">Clockwise</a>, a time management and smart calendar tool, has raised $45 million in Series C funding led by Coatue, with participation from Atlassian Ventures and existing investors Accel, Greylock Partners and Bain Capital Ventures. This latest round brings the company&#8217;s total amount of funding raised to $76 million. Clockwise uses artificial intelligence to help teams free up their workdays and avoid the challenges associated with remote and hybrid workplaces, such as burnout.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2016 by Gary Lerhaupt, Matt Martin and Mike Grinolds. The trio met while working at RelateIQ, a company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/salesforce-buys-big-data-startup-relateiq-for-up-to-390m/">Salesforce bought for $390 million</a> in 2014. They found that they shared a common goal, which was to create a way to give people more time for focused work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clockwise is the solution to the modern workday,&#8221; Clockwise CEO Matt Martin told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;Clockwise optimizes your team&#8217;s schedules to create more time in everyone&#8217;s day — so we can feel present when we&#8217;re working together and focused when we&#8217;re working on our own. We enable a new way of working that genuinely respects people&#8217;s time and helps create a healthy, sustainable future of work.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since the platform&#8217;s launch in 2018, Clockwise has rescheduled 4,000,000 flexible meetings. It has also created more than 2,000,000 hours of uninterrupted &#8220;Focus Time&#8221; for teams. Focus Time is a feature that helps users visualize how much time they have for focused work by automatically creating a block in their calendars. Clockwise has optimized calendars for more than 10,000 organizations, including Netflix, Twitter, Coinbase, Atlassian, Asana and Airtable.</p>

<p>Clockwise currently competes with several other smart calendar and scheduling tools such as <a href="https://calendly.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=2074601018&amp;utm_term=calendly&amp;utm_content=80202694281&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA24SPBhB0EiwAjBgkhlAOFEvIYl9iCTbGdj33xBB_wo-25OHoh9hKrF5fzncDpiM6At6MdBoCIYEQAvD_BwE">Calendly</a>, <a href="https://doodle.com/en/">Doodle</a>, <a href="https://reclaim.ai/">Reclaim</a> and more. Martin says Clockwise differs from other smart calendar platforms because the company is creating a new category it calls &#8220;time orchestration,&#8221; a modern way to bring schedules together at the organizational level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re in the early days of this category, so we mainly compete with people who don’t realize that their attempts to optimize their individual workday can negatively impact their teammates&#8217; productivity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The magic of Clockwise is that we orchestrate companies&#8217; workdays, running up to one million calendar permutations for any given team to create the best possible schedule for everyone.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clockwise will use this latest investment to advance its AI technology and continue to bring its platform to more teams across the globe. The company is hiring across all of its departments, with 25 open positions and another 100 openings planned for this year.</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Martin says Clockwise will continue to grow and expand to find more ways to free up people&#8217;s workdays. He says although Clockwise is currently only designed to manage internal meetings, the platform could dramatically improve the broader scheduling experience in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re investing in advanced AI and ML models to both create Focus Time and power high-quality meetings,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;Clockwise has a lot of exciting new products and enhancements ahead, including bringing this new way of working to the hundreds of millions of people using Microsoft 365.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clockwise&#8217;s Series C investment follows its $18 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/clockwise-ceo-matt-martin-how-we-closed-an-18m-series-b-during-a-pandemic/">Series B</a> funding round announced in June 2020. The round was led by Bain Capital Ventures. The company announced its $11 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/clockwise-nabs-11m-series-a-to-make-your-calendar-smarter/">Series A</a> investment, which was co-led led by Greylock and Accel, in June 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> from his position in order to give his full attention to his other company Square,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/"> now called Block</a>, which had become increasingly invested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency &#8212; just like Dorsey himself. Now we&#8217;re starting to see the results of Block&#8217;s embrace of crypto, as this morning Cash App announced it&#8217;s integrated with the Lightning Network, allowing its U.S. users to send bitcoin for free to anyone worldwide.</p>
<p>The feature had been slowly rolling out to Cash App customers <a href="https://blockworks.co/cash-app-integrates-lightning-network-for-bitcoin-payments/">before</a> today, but Cash App had not yet made a formal announcement. The company says the rollout is expected to complete over the &#8220;coming weeks,&#8221; reaching all U.S. Cash App customers.</p>
<p>Once live, Cash App users will be able to send bitcoin internationally to any external compatible wallet, including those for family or friends or a self-managed wallet, like <span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-46ae0d90-7fff-4d8b-4c23-3298da80600c"><a href="https://chivowallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chivowallet.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642553699191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw028gej59uUBXZpEkhABwOj">Chivo Wallet</a>, </span><span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-c477eabe-7fff-aa05-f3e9-bf1907a1196e"><a href="https://bluewallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bluewallet.io/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642553699191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bD1DIO9cNU0VuEPpsLYVC">BlueWallet</a>, or </span><span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-09010419-7fff-df37-1418-b14ac92c6627"><a href="https://muun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://muun.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642553699191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3X7A3w8LQKj5qDL9-7RzZn">Muun Wallet</a>, for example. Users will also be able to send bitcoin to any merchant that accepts Lightning Network payments, with zero fees. While this isn&#8217;t yet a mainstream activity, a few merchants have begun to accept Lightning payments, allowing customers to do things like <a href="https://ln.pizza/">order a pizza over the Lightning Network</a> or <a href="https://www.bitrefill.com/buy">buy gift cards</a>. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258742" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span id="m_-2547697169449701502gmail-docs-internal-guid-09010419-7fff-df37-1418-b14ac92c6627">The Lightning Network&#8217;s integration into Cash App could also help to empower the growing creator economy, as fans could send bitcoin to show their support for an individual creator or cause if they accepted Lightning payments. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258750" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cash-App-Lightning-Network.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Cash App explains the advantages of this system, noting that typical Bitcoin network transactions can take some time to process and see higher fees, compared with Lightning Network &#8212; whose name is meant to convey its speedier capabilities. Its transactions also take place independently of the blockchain (off-chain), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-the-lightning-network-in-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work">which helps</a> to reduce the fees, time, and energy usage that would otherwise be involved. But the Lightning Network will still benefit from the blockchain&#8217;s technology and decentralization, as the transactions taking place on the network are later consolidated and recorded to the main Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>Dorsey himself had demonstrated interest in the Lightning Network, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1092892320842706944">tweeting</a> back in 2019 that it was a &#8220;cool example&#8221; of the experimentation taking place among #BitcoinTwitter users. More recently, Block&#8217;s bitcoin-focused company, Spiral, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jack-dorseys-spiral-announces-the-lightning-dev-kit">presented</a> its Lightning Development Kit (<a href="https://lightningdevkit.org/">LDK</a>) which offers a way to easily integrate bitcoin payments into any application. The new Lightning integration on Cash App is also powered by Spiral&#8217;s LDK &#8212; and Cash App is also the first and largest payments app to integrate with LDK at this time, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rollout of LDK is also an example of Block&#8217;s strategic vision in action, where one arm may build the tools that are adopted by other Block-owned businesses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rather than just sales teams using it, the company saw marketing and customer success teams adopt the technology, too.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After securing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/sales-experience-platform-walnut-raises-15m-to-improve-product-demonstrations/">$15 million Series A</a> in August, <a href="https://www.walnut.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walnut</a>, a company that creates sales and marketing demo experiences, is back to announce its new round of $35 million in Series B financing.</p>
<p>Walnut’s no-code platform enables teams to create customized product demonstrations quickly, be able to integrate them into their sales and marketing processes and then generate insights from the demos.</p>
<p>Since the Series A, the company grew a staggering 700% in annual recurring revenue, co-founder and CEO Yoav Vilner told TechCrunch. It is now working with nearly 100 SaaS customers, including Adobe, Dell, Medallia, NetApp, Treasure Data, Funnel, People AI and ContractBook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Right after we published the announcement, we got a lot of interest from investors,” Vilner added. “We had been trying to cope with the demand that we had, and so my original plan was to raise later on, but with the way we were continuing the pace, felt that this could be the right timing. Three months between rounds is unusual, but what we were building was definitely ready for more money.”</p>
<p>Felicis Ventures is leading the latest round that gives the company $56 million in total funding to date. Vilner says the firm’s name was one he kept hearing over and over, and he and co-founder Danni Friedland were interested in Felicis’ fund for SaaS and software, thinking it would be the right fit.</p>
<p>Joining Felicis are existing investors NFX, Eight Roads Ventures and A Capital and a group of strategic angel investors, including Salesforce president and CMO Sarah Franklin, Okta co-founder Frederic Kerrest, TripActions co-founder and CEO Ariel Cohen and Papaya Global co-founder and CEO Eynat Guez.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Walnut to grow its team in the U.S., Europe and Israel from 55 to closer to 100, Vilner said. In addition, the company will focus on technology and product development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We will finally be able to meet the demand and grow our manpower across countries and build a wider platform to help the sales funnel at different touchpoints,” he added. “We are building a new category that doesn’t really even have a name yet, but our goal is revolutionizing the sales space.”</p>
<p>Felicis general partner Viviana Faga and vice president Jake Storm are lead investors in the round and say they are calling what Walnut is doing “sales experience,” and that the company is helping go-to-market teams interact with customers. That became harder during the global pandemic when people weren’t as interested in speaking with sales people, Faga said.</p>
<p>She believes it was the right time for a tool, like Walnut’s, so that companies could ramp up their demos. And, rather than just sales teams using it, the company saw marketing and customer success teams adopt the technology. As a result, Storm sees Walnut riding two waves: a push for more efficient sales enablement and bottom-up growth.</p>
<p>“When we met Yoav and Danni, we knew that they were going to build a huge team, and after we saw the waitlist of users begging to use Walnut, we knew it was the solution needed in the world,” Faga added.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Gaming giant Activision Blizzard, under the gun from investors over sexual harassment controversies and ongoing executive turmoil, has pulled the escape cord: the company has agreed to be acquired by Microsoft in a $68.7 billion all-cash deal, inclusive of the company&#8217;s net cash.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/activision-blizzard-ceo-might-step-154146773.html">rumored to step down</a> amid ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/blizzard-sec-investigation/">SEC investigations</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680">sexual harassment scandals</a> in his company, which employs nearly 10,000 people. The Wall Street Journal reported that Kotick knew for years about sexual misconduct allegations at his company, but he did not act. Yet with this acquisition, Microsoft says that Kotick will keep his job. As a whole, Activision Blizzard will report to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>This deal will make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue, per their own <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/14/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/">press release</a>, falling behind Tencent and Sony. Activision Blizzard is home to mega-franchises like &#8220;World of Warcraft,&#8221; &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221; and &#8220;Candy Crush,&#8221; while Microsoft Gaming produces Xbox consoles. Microsoft says it will include Activision Blizzard games in its cloud gaming subscription Game Pass, which recently reached 25 million subscribers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258746" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This acquisition is expected to close in 2023, though the boards of both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have approved the transaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">User onboarding has been a longstanding and persistent challenge in the world of apps. Developers grapple with design and technical constraints; publishers and users might have different priorities when it comes to engaging with a service; the content of those services is changing all the time; and perhaps most of all, people are all different and so their experiences with an app will be, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.appcues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appcues</a> &#8212; one of the startups building technology both to identify onboarding issues and then provide low-code, non-technical solutions to fix them quickly &#8212; is today announcing a $32.1 million Series B round. The funding is a sign not just of the demand in the market for more tools to address all of this, but of Appcues&#8217; traction in doing so.</p>
<p>“Product experience matters more than ever. Yet it can still take weeks to get something live in your product,” said Jackson Noel, co-founder and CEO of Appcues, in a statement. The company claims that its tools can deliver insights and user onboarding fixes for customers in hours.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series B is being led by NewSpring, with new backer Columbia Partners and previous investors Sierra Ventures and Accomplice also participating. Boston-based Appcues plans to use the funding for product development and to expand internationally. It has raised just under $48 million to date. And while it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation (we&#8217;ll update if we learn what it is), the funding is coming alongside strong growth.</p>
<p>Appcues says that it now has some 1,500 customers &#8212; they include Freshworks, FullStory, Lyft, Zapier, Kaplan, Hopin, Pluralsight and Vidyard &#8212; and that its cloud-based platform to date has served almost 2 billion experiences to more than 200 million users.</p>
<p>Appcues has been around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/23/appcues-now-backed-by-1-2m-lets-anyone-personalize-a-product-experience-without-writing-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a>, when it got its start as a SaaS toolset for marketers to create quick prompts on sites without having to involve developers in the process, with a specific emphasis on user onboarding flows. The company&#8217;s product today also covers flows to improve feature adoption, to nudge people to take feedback surveys, and to get visitors to read announcements but is still built on the same premise: giving non-technical people the ability to create dialogues to improve how their digital interfaces work.</p>
<p>The process starts with an SDK that can either be installed as a line in an app&#8217;s codebase or integrated by way of Segment. This tracks events on the site, and that becomes the basis for how it works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Appcue users &#8212; they can be UX people, product managers, interactive marketers, or yes developers &#8212; can now access this data by way of a Chrome extension to see what&#8217;s working as intended, and what is not, on their apps or sites; and they can start to build new events or flows in response to these. Different flows and events can be created for different segments of users, depending on where they are coming from into an app; or how they are already using it. Users can then track how well these new flows and events are working, and tweak them, or add new flows, as needed.</p>
<p>User experience arguably is even more important today than it has ever been before: not only do people have shorter attention spans for things that work badly (we are all spoiled for choice when it comes to digital services); but companies are working with more and more complexity and putting a lot of eggs into their digital baskets, which are often the only platforms being used to engage with customers. Getting something wrong here can make or break a business in ways that didn&#8217;t exist before.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that there are a number of companies also building technology to address this, and that doing so can be very big business. Others include WalkMe (which is now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/insight-backed-walkme-falls-in-debut-after-287-million-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public</a>), <a href="https://www.pendo.io/news/pendo-raises-150-million-to-help-companies-deliver-software-that-meets-rising-user-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendo</a> (now also en route to an IPO), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/whatfix-nabs-90m-to-help-workers-onboard-and-get-the-most-out-of-their-it-stacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatfix</a> (which is more focused on organizations&#8217; internal user onboarding) and many more.</p>
<p>One notable part of Appcues&#8217; toolset is that it&#8217;s aimed at non-technical users; but the other is its focus on analytics: this both helps users of its app get a better picture of what issues there might be, and for whom; as well as to identify whether their attempts to fix it are working&#8230; or not.</p>
<p>And it seems that no matter how advanced or numerous the tools to fix user onboarding, the simple need for them in the first place is not going away, and is only getting more critical.</p>
<p>“Over the past five years, we’ve witnessed a shift where a software company’s product experience has become the number one lever to their business success,” said Marc Lederman, co-founder and general partner at NewSpring, in a statement. “We’re incredibly excited about the impact Appcues provides for its customers and look forward to supporting Jackson and the Appcues team on this next stage of growth.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fairplay provides a sales advance as funding in exchange for a flat fee and a steady revenue share of earnings until the capital is paid back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mexican revenue-based investment startup <a href="https://getfairplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairplay</a> secured $35 million in Series A funding to invest in the online marketing campaigns of direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands and marketplace sellers in Latin America.</p>
<p>The investment round consists of $15 million in equity, co-led by Dila Capital and Kayyak Ventures, and participation from SpeedInvest and Elevar Equity, and $20 million in debt led by Architect Capital. Existing investors in the round also included QED Investors, Nazca and several individual investors, including Kavak CEO Carlos García, Jüsto CEO Ricardo Weder and ZeBrands CEO Carlos Salinas. In total, the company has raised $40 million.</p>
<p>Fairplay co-founder and CEO Manolo Atala started the company with Andrew Devlyn in 2019. He told TechCrunch that small business owners often have to choose between putting money into their inventory, logistics or marketing campaigns, and a wrong choice could have significant impact on the company’s growth. Those who do invest in marketing usually put a majority of their spend into channels like Google or Facebook, he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Traditional loan options are often long and complex processes that could tie a business owner to aggressive guarantees, Atala said. Looking to make the choice easier for entrepreneurs reliably earning sales, Fairplay provides a sales advance as funding in exchange for a flat fee and a steady revenue share of earnings until the capital is paid back. Rather than give the money to the client, the company pays the client&#8217;s providers directly.</p>
<p>Aside from leveraging the debt, the new funding will go toward growing Fairplay’s headcount. Atala expected to double its 38 employees in the next few months.</p>
<p>The company is working with a wide range of clients &#8212; for example, small companies selling $15,000 per month up to large DTC companies selling $10 million per month. The average investment Fairplay makes is about $85,000, Atala said.</p>
<p>“Most of the money goes to inventory because the cycle from when you order to when you start selling a product is around 45 to 60 days,” he said. “By providing this capital, we are helping e-commerce companies shorten the cycle to avoid cash flow constraints.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/ecommerce/mexico#revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexican e-commerce market</a> is poised to reach $45 million in 2022, and Atala says Fairplay is also seeing that growth. The company’s third quarter of 2021 was the best in its history, growing 250% in originations over the second quarter and more than 200% in revenue. He was expecting two-digital growth in the fourth quarter and a five-fold growth in 2022.</p>
<p>QED Investors partner Mike Packer, who is on Fairplay’s board, says the company is in the middle of a “megatrend” that is affecting e-commerce infrastructure in Latin America. He saw Fairplay’s early traction two years ago and has been watching Atala and Devlyn build out their team with a talented pool of people, create the product and test their hypothesis.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a current explosion that has been pulled forward five-plus years into one year of growth,” Packer said. “All of the commerce and transactions moved online, while growth was happening, the infrastructure was lacking. We see massive opportunity to enable businesses to run more smoothly, and Fairplay is in the middle of that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic hasn&#8217;t been easy for anyone, but the food service industry has been hit <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2022/01/14/most-independent-restaurants-experienced-a-sales-decrease-of-more-than-50-in-december/?sh=6404cf885fa8">particularly hard</a>. More than <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/omicrons-affect-restaurant-industry-shows-dire-restaurant-relief/story?id=82248396">90,000 restaurants</a> and bars have closed, leaving workers unemployed in an already precarious industry. And those who kept their jobs faced the stressful demands of customer-facing work in a pandemic.</p>
<p>In response to the changed industry landscape, food service veterans are launching their own businesses, whether they&#8217;re delivering take-out meals in their neighborhood or mailing cans of kombucha around the country. &#8220;People tell them that they make great cakes, or that their sourdough is better than everybody else&#8217;s, or their hot sauce is amazing,&#8221; explained Castiron founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjosephson/">Mark Josephson</a>. &#8220;And they dream of selling and building a business, but they end up spending 75% of their time on things other than what they&#8217;re good at.&#8221; He&#8217;s talking about everything that isn&#8217;t cooking: building a website, keeping track of finances and other administrative tasks.</p>
<p>So, he created <a href="http://castiron.me">Castiron</a>, an e-commerce solution for independent chefs. Today, Castiron announced a $6 million seed funding round from Bowery Capital, Foundry Group and High Alpha. A veteran of the tech industry, Josephson is a three-time CEO &#8212; he previously helmed outside.in, which sold to AOL, later leading Bit.ly for seven years &#8212; but Castiron is the first company he&#8217;s founded.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Launched in October, Castiron provides its users (which it calls &#8220;food artisans&#8221;) with customizable e-commerce websites, which include dynamic inventory management, order fulfillment tools, newsletter and marketing tools and more. Castiron doesn&#8217;t start making money until the food artisan makes money &#8212; then, the platform takes 10%, plus a standard 2.9% + $0.30 payment processing fee.</p>

<p>&#8220;In deciding to start this company, it was important to me after having done five, six or seven different startups that with this one, we were truly aligned with our customers. So I only want to be successful if our customers are successful,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our customers are risk averse, so it&#8217;s important that we have a no-risk product for customers to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, Castiron only operates in the United States, where laws pertaining to home food businesses (cottage food laws) vary from state to state. But given the increasing rate of unemployment since the onset of the pandemic, many states have <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/10/29/pandemic-prompts-officials-to-relax-rules-on-home-businesses">made it easier</a> to legally run independent food businesses. Currently, Josephson estimates that about 40% of Castiron&#8217;s users run local delivery businesses, 40% sell products for pickup, and 20% ship their goods out. He said that &#8220;several hundred&#8221; users have set up shop on Castiron, but that this seed round will help fund a hiring push to scale the business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This push of entrepreneurs who are building small businesses is a huge part of our economy going forward,&#8221; Josephson noted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in media, digital media, software marketing, and there&#8217;s nothing like this. And like, honestly, I have boxes of chocolate chip cookies, and roasted coffee beans, and biscotti, and sourdough, and hot sauce showing up at my house. It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s what&#8217;s wrong with that? What could be better?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hot bowl of pad thai simmers in front of you. The taste and texture is exactly what you might expect from a quick takeout dinner, but it&#8217;s not just a meal – it’s medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hypothetical bowl of pad thai, would be part of a cancer-fighting regimen created by startup Faeth Therapeutics. The meal itself would be specifically tailored to “starve your tumor” (which has been genetically scrutinized by scientists already), and work in combination with established cancer drugs and therapies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This “precision nutrition” approach to cancer treatment is admittedly  new, but Faeth therapeutics, founded in 2019, is hoping to be the first to bring this approach into the clinic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What really led to the founding of the company is three independent groups of world class scientists, each realizing that we were basically ignoring a massive part of human biology and the treatment of cancer,” Anand Parikh, founder and CEO of Faeth Therapeutics tells TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I jokingly call this the Manhattan Project of cancer biology. They were each approaching this problem differently, but  landed on this idea that we have to change nutrition for cancer patients in order to not only potentiate existing therapeutics, but also to help develop new ones that target these nutrient vulnerabilities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.faeththerapeutics.com/">Faeth Therapeutics</a> announced a $20 million seed round on Tuesday</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This represents the 15-person company’s first round of external financing. The round was co-led by Khosla Ventures and Future Ventures. It also includes participation from S2G Ventures, Digitalis, KdT Ventures, Agfunder, Cantos and Unshackled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things to notice about Faeth Therapeutics is the scientific team behind it. Faeth’s cofounders include: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Emperor of All Maladies </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(winner of a <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/siddhartha-mukherjee">2011 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction</a>) and an oncologist at Columbia University; Lewis Cantley, director of Weill Cornell’s Meyer Cancer Center and discoverer of the PI3K signaling pathway, and Karen Vousden, Chief Scientist of Cancer Research UK, and Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute. Vousden is known for her work on the p53 tumor suppressor protein. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantley and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2715"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vousden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular, have been some of the first to deeply probe the connection between metabolism and cancer treatment. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrclinonc.2018.28"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PI3K</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cell signaling pathway that affects cell metabolism, growth, survival and proliferation, but is often dysregulated in cancer patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are drugs that look to target this pathway, however Cantley’s work suggests that some patients end up with hyperglycemia, which might end up triggering this dysregulated pathway anyway. Instead, he has shown that lowering insulin levels through </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6197057/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dietary interventions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help avoid that re-activation, and aid the drug&#8217;s performance. For example, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0343-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mouse study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that placing mice on a keto diet (low-carb, high fat) could reduce glycogen stores and prevent spikes that might be hampering the drug’s effectiveness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the preclinical research has been intermittently promising, but still requires a lot more work (as Mukherjee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/magazine/its-time-to-study-whether-eating-particular-diets-can-help-heal-us.html">notes</a> in his own op-ed describing Cantley’s work).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Parikh notes that there’s still a lot of room to improve this research, and approach nutrition based medicine in a more targeted way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what a lot of people have done is say: keto diet, glioblastoma, let’s go. But there’s a layer deeper than that,” he says. [Note: the keto diet has also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589986/">been deployed</a> in certain glioblastoma cases]. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a person has pancreatic cancer, we&#8217;ve figured out that the way that a pancreatic tumor works, you may have higher needs for certain nutrients. In this case, maybe amino acids. And what we do is we create diets that are depleted in those particular amino acids.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of Faeth’s mission, adds Parikh, is to use this funding to expand and deepen research in this area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition and health are clearly linked, and nutrition </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5181206/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Adherence%20to%20a%20high,overall%20mortality%20in%20this%20population."><span style="font-weight: 400;">does have an impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on cancer outcomes. But this is an area of research that can draw some well-deserved skepticism. When it comes to diet and health, it can be easy to fall from scientific fact, into myth territory pretty easily. Critically, this research isn’t touting a “miracle diet” or a “diet-based cure” for cancer. Rather the company is aiming to interrogate how nutrition can become a “fifth pillar” of cancer care through scientific study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith is already gearing up three trials that will look to interrogate the connection emerging from preclinical research.  </span><a href="http://v"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A metastatic pancreatic cancer trial combining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a reduced amino acid diet with a gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chemotherapy regimen is in development. The company also </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05183295?term=Faeth+Therapeutics&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has another trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at metastatic colorectal cancer. Finally, a trial on insulin-suppressing diets will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov in the coming weeks, per Parikh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the connection prove powerful enough to warrant a treatment, Parikh imagines a version of cancer care where high quality meals (like the aforementioned Pad Thai) and cancer drugs can work together to achieve better outcomes. A patient would still go through radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but go home and have doctor-prescribed meals delivered to their door (Parikh adds that the meals have been developed by “world-class chefs). Then, the patient would follow up with a nutritionist if concerns arise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for now, Parikh says the focus will be almost entirely on bringing this research into the clinical stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ve done as much work as they possibly can pre-clinically and so we&#8217;ve raised this round to move into the clinic. And we&#8217;re doing early stage trials to confirm safety, obviously, but also see whether there&#8217;s a signal of efficacy as well,” he says. </span></p>

Real is a therapy platform that aims to make mental healthcare more accessible by offering group sessions and curriculums a user can engage with any time. While in college, Ariela had her first encounter with the mental health care system and realized that people were only seeking help for their mental health when they were in crisis. She then spent years studying the ways people seek care and how therapy could be more accessible and effective. In this conversation as they dive into everything from the research that lead her to found Real to religion to the merits of Goop. CW: suicide and attempted suicide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">British autonomous vehicle startup Wayve has raised a $200 million Series B funding round from investors to scale its technology and expand its partnerships with commercial fleets. Wayve is aiming to be a major player in the arena of Robo-deliveries and logistics.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a total of $258 million to date, for its technology, which relies largely on commodity video cameras around the vehicle tied to on-vehicle AI-driven software, making it highly responsive to its surroundings as it relies less on being connected to 4 or 5G networks.</p>
<p>Eclipse Ventures, a previous investor, led the round. Other participating investors include D1 Capital Partners, Baillie Gifford, Moore Strategic Ventures and Linse Capital, as well as Microsoft and Virgin, and early-stage investors Compound and Balderton Capital. They join strategic investor Ocado Group and angel investors including Sir Richard Branson, Rosemary Leith, Linda Levinson, David Richter, Pieter Abbeel, and Yann LeCun.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wayve CEO Alex Kendall says Wayve’s test vehicles have managed to successfully negotiate not only London but also cities its vehicles have never been to previously. Given UK streets are typically medieval in layout, this is no mean feat.</p>
<p>Ocado, the UK online grocery technology company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/wayve-the-lidar-free-self-driving-startup-raises-13-6m-from-ocado/">previously invested</a> $13.6 million in Wayve and entered into an autonomous delivery trial with the startup, as has British supermarket chain Asda.</p>
<p>Wayve says its AV2.0 technology is designed specifically for fleet operators, combining a camera-first approach with an embedded AI that continually learns from driving data provided by Wayve&#8217;s other partner fleets. The startup&#8217;s view is that this makes it a more scalable AV platform than so-called “AV1,0” which requires lots of input from data outside the vehicle like traffic reports, street maps and a complex array of sensors.</p>
<p>Seth Winterroth, Partner, Eclipse Ventures said: “As the industry struggles to solve self-driving with traditional robotics, it is becoming increasingly clear that AV2.0 is the right pathway to build a scalable driving intelligence that can help commercial fleet operators deploy autonomy faster.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch Kendall added: “I think this funding round is a signal from the market that we are transitioning from proving out the core technology to now having earned the right to scale and be commercially deployed. When we started the business in 2017, that was the peak hype cycle point of autonomous vehicles, with billions of dollars already invested. Everyone thought it was a year away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to go and build a contrarian startup to compete against trillion dollar tech giants might have been a little bit crazy. But the proof points have allowed us to move to this next level of scale. This is our ability to test in multiple cities. The fact that we&#8217;ve trained a system in London, and gone UK wide in Manchester Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, all over the UK. Plus all these commercial partners and the incredible talent that we&#8217;ve been able to attract to our team,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months after its </span><a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/87907/pinwheel-raises-20m-series-a-for-payroll-connectivity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$20 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, payroll connectivity platform Pinwheel just announced that it has nabbed another $50 million in a round led by new investor GGV Capital. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinwheelapi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinwheel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves neobanks and fintechs like Block, Acorns, and Current by providing application programming interfaces (APIs) linked to payroll, income, and employment data. Historically, systems for providing such data are inefficient and clunky, a problem Pinwheel’s cofounders recognized when they were working on a startup that helped companies provide pre-tax benefits to their employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurt Lin, Anish Basu, and Curtis Lee, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/pinwheel-is-the-api-platform-for-income-verification-that-every-fintech-and-neobank-needs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who met through prior work experiences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ran into a roadblock in implementing their original solution because they found they had difficulty connecting to payroll systems. That’s when they decided to pivot into building an API to solve this problem at a large scale instead, Lin told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258581" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s APIs allow its customers to access more robust information about individuals’ payroll and employment, in part because they track “non-traditional” sources of income like payments made through gig platforms like Uber or apps like Venmo, Lin said. Its flagship products include direct-deposit switching, income and employment data, and paycheck-linked lending, and the data it aggregates spans nearly 80% of people employed in the United States, according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinwheel’s customers can use this information for a range of applications – from offering earned wage access to employees, which allows them to access money as soon as they’ve earned it rather than waiting for a paycheck to be deposited in their bank account, to enabling paycheck-linked loans, which are considered less risky than traditional unsecured loans that require borrowers to make a voluntary bank transfer to repay the funds.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite competition from other players in the somewhat-crowded payroll API space, Pinwheel has demonstrated significant traction in the market and hopes to differentiate itself by building an entire “income layer” of data for its customers that extends beyond just payroll information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform executes over 4.6 million processes per month, a 400x increase from last year, and the company leads its market in customer conversion rates, the company says. Pinwheel grew its annual recurring revenue by 177x in 2021, according to the company, though Lin declined to share any further detail on its historical or current revenue numbers.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin said its success can be attributed to three key factors – commercial traction, an experienced team, and a mission-driven approach focused on “improving financial outcomes for customers who don’t have access to affordable financial products.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our customers, for example, may be a teacher or a nurse who may be in the same job for five or six years, may have a FICO [credit score] of 550, and thus be declined from any affordable financial product. We can actually show that their income stability is totally there, they&#8217;ve been employed for a long time, and they&#8217;re actually going to perform much better [in repaying a loan],” Lin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinwheel has hired a number of its employees from $13.4 billion API company Plaid, known for enabling bank account connectivity for fintechs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re the only player that has actually been able to not just take one or two [hires from Plaid], but we actually have a number of former employees on our team. Our VP of engineering came from Plaid, our head of commercial came from Plaid, a lot of the core engineers were actually building the platform at Plaid as well. We have all this institutional knowledge of how to do this the right way, which has really allowed us to outperform our competition because of having those folks on the team,” Lin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinwheel is also the only company providing direct deposit switching and payroll data that is classified as a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, meaning that if consumers are adversely affected by Pinwheel’s data, the company would be legally accountable. While operating as a regulated CRA requires a “herculean amount of work,” it shows that Pinwheel is willing to “stand behind the integrity of [its] data,” Lin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of strategic investors also backed Pinwheel for the first time in the Series B round, including AMEX Ventures (American Express’s VC arm), Indeed, Kraken Ventures, Franklin Templeton. Existing investors Coatue, First Round Capital, and Upfront Ventures, participated as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinwheel plans to use the fresh funds to triple its 70-person employee base, two-thirds of whom are engineers. Although the team will stay engineering-heavy because of the technical nature of its API-focused business, Pinwheel also plans to make some hires to advance its go-to-market strategy, revenue expansion, and marketing presence, Lin said. It eventually plans to expand into areas like tax preparation by helping companies leverage its income data in new ways, Lin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just after Pinwheel first came out of stealth mode in June 2020, the company received over 130 inbound messages from big banks like Wells Fargo and Citi, as well as a number of major fintechs, Lin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was kind of this lightbulb moment for us because we realized that the platform that we&#8217;re building is basically like a growth engine for all of consumer finance,” Lin said. “Whether you are a new digital bank, whether you are a PFM [personal finance management company], whether you are a new tax product, or a bank, or a lender who just needs better data for underwriting, there is something in the building blocks of our platform that actually allows you to build not just what you want to do now, but the future of your roadmap for 5-10 years from now.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Permiso, a Palo Alto-based startup that provides cloud identity detection and response for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-infrastructure/">cloud infrastructures</a>, has launched from stealth with $10 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The company, founded by former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fireeye/">FireEye</a> executives Paul Nguyen and Jason Martin, joins an influx of cloud security startups that have emerged since the start of the pandemic, which saw organizations rush to digitize their operations to support employees working from home.</p>
<p>While arguably 18 months late to a now already-crowded market, Nguyen and Martin believe their detection response product is ready for the next wave of cloud security. The idea was inspired by conversations with Permiso’s angel investors, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>, who said that their number one problem in the cloud was identity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We started to realize that identity is the lynchpin that tells that story of what’s happening in your cloud, and it’s also the foundation for how you build detection in the cloud,” Nguyen tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Permiso provides organizations with visibility for identities in their cloud infrastructure to give real-time insights into who is in the environment and what they are doing. This, the startup claims, allows for simple and efficient attribution of access, activity, and changes occurring in monitored environments, helping organizations to spot malicious or anomalous behaviors that could indicate compromised credentials, policy violations, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/insider-threats-startups-protect/">insider threats</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re a little ahead of the market,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;No one, as far as we’re aware, other than the custom products that cloud-forward companies build for themselves, is focused on anchoring all activity around identity, the resources in that environment, and how they interact.”</p>
<p>Permiso is billed as “built by experts, usable by non-experts”, which the startup says is key given the growing skills shortage in the cloud security market. “When we looked at teams that were transitioning from on-prem[ise] to the cloud, it was like speaking English and trying to learn Farsi as a completely new language. It’s starting from zero” said Nguyen.</p>
<p>“We built for 1% of the market for years, but that gets you 1% of the market. Now we’re going after the 99%.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup’s $10 million seed round was led by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Point72+Ventures+techcrunch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Point72 Ventures</a> and included Foundation Capital, Work-Bench, 11.2 Capital, Rain Capital. It was also backed by a number of security industry leaders, including Jason Chan, former VP of Information Security at Netflix; Travis McPeak, head of Product Security at Databricks; and Tyler Shields, CMO at JupiterOne.</p>
<p>Permiso will use the funds to triple its current 15-person team and expand its current customer footprint.</p>
<p>“Our investors have all solved this identity problem at scale in cloud-native problems, but other companies won’t get to this point for another year or two,&#8221; said Martin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verana Health, a company focused on collecting and organizing troves of medical data, announced a $150 million Series E funding round on Friday. This round comes as the company sets its sights on new types of medical data, invests in organizing traditionally messy forms of information (like physician notes) and aims to extract more usable insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.veranahealth.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verana Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/verana-health-aims-to-organize-and-analyze-doctors-clinical-data-sets-whether-patients-like-it-or-not/"> organizes and analyzes</a> electronic health record systems run by three professional organizations: The American Academy of Ophthalmology, The American Academy of Neurology, and The American Urological Association. Then, it delivers insight back to practitioners, researchers, and life sciences companies. Since its founding in 2018, Verana has become an exclusive data management partner for these professional networks, CEO Sujay Jadhav tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This current round was led by Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, and Novo Growth. Existing investors GV (formerly Google Ventures), Casdin Capital, and Brook Byers joined the round. New investors include Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, THVC, and Breyer Capital. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257775" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, Verana focuses on three major disease areas: ophthalmology, neurology, and urology. From there, says Jadhav, Verana provides two pillar products. There’s VeraQ a </span><a href="https://www.veranahealth.com/verana-health-launches-veraq-qdata/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“population health engine”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encompassing 90 million patients and data spanning seven years and Qdata, which can link existing data with information from other sources (like insurance claims or medical imaging, more on that later), and provide data sets designed for specific, observational studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fair question to ask of any company looking to provide data-driven insights is: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What insights are you providing, exactly? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jadhav provides a few examples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the company recently worked with a startup looking to conduct a study on a rare disease not typically captured in ICD-10 billing codes. Verana used natural language processing and manual curation to scan through patient symptoms and procedure history to help identify clinics that might have enough patients with the condition to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the commercial side of things, another client has used Verana to monitor the post-approval safety and uptake of medical products. Verana helped by analyzing treatment patterns and the demographics of who used the product, looking for safety signals. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever health records are in the picture patient privacy is paramount. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jadhav notes that all patient information is de-identified. “We have a very clear delineation internally. So, 27 people have access to identifiable data, we then we de-identify it and whatever we provide to the pharma sector etc is always de-identified as well,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De-identified health records are already used to conduct research. EHR analysis, for instance, has facilitated </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(21)00237-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the real-world safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines extremely quickly. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, experts have also </span><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/de-identifying-medical-patient-data-doesnt-protect-our-privacy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that de-identified data could be “re-identified” through a combination of machine learning or combination with other datasets. For instance, a </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2719130"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA Health Policy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued that this was possible with physical activity data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jadhav says that patients can opt-out of data sharing at any point in the process. Though, the most straightforward approach seems to be at the doctor’s office level. For instance, </span><a href="https://www.aao.org/iris-registry/requirements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can ask your ophthalmologist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in writing, to not share EHR data with IRIS (the dataset provided by the American Academy of Ophthalmology), if you choose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, Verana&#8217;s dataset is largely centered around these patient registries. However, the company is already investing in both gleaning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from these records, and integrating other types of data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Verana is using natural language processing techniques to extract themes from physician notes that don’t fit into most data structures. (Keep in mind </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75544-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">de-identifying textual data in EHR records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an area of active reach in and of itself.) But for certain disease areas, Jadhav notes that these physician notes are a big untapped resource: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In certain therapeutic areas, such as urology, we are finding that there is some structured data there. [But] a lot of the value is around unstructured data. More specifically around physician notes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also integrated insurance claims data, and has developed a technique to integrate imaging data. For instance, the company </span><a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2775387"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published an abstract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an algorithm that was able to match IRIS EHRs and imaging data with 83 percent accuracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this current round Verana is aiming to “fuel current growth” using their current business model, per Jadhav. But it also has some specific plans laid out. The company aims to enhance the quality of analysis they can already provide, scale-up clinical trial insights, as well as fund natural language processing projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round brings the company’s total funding to $280 million. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yet more funding is finding its way to Istanbul&#8217;s gaming startups. Today, <a href="https://dreamgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Games</a> &#8212; the casual games developer behind the hit game Royal Match &#8212; is announcing a $255 million Series C that values the startup at $2.75 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This Series C is being led by Index Ventures, with Makers Fund, IVP, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Kora and Balderton Capital also participating. The funding will be used both to continue investing in and developing Royal Match, and to work on its next launch, which is expected later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The funding underscores a few important trends: we are seeing a very heated pace of competition in this space right now; games (and especially casual games) are really coming into their own when it comes to venture funding and adopting the growth and approach of startups; and maybe most importantly for this story: investors are very keen on getting in on the action. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258716" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Today&#8217;s news comes</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> just six months after Dream Games raised </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dream-games-raises-155m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-its-royal-match-puzzle-game-hits-a-royal-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 million at a $1 billion valuation</a> (that round was led by Index and Makers Fund)<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, and one day after another Istanbul games startup, Spyke, announced a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/turkeys-spyke-raises-55m-in-a-seed-round-to-bring-a-social-twist-to-casual-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$55 million seed round</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p>Dream and Spyke share some DNA: both are founded by people who were either founders or senior members of the team at Peak Games, another gaming startup that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Zynga in 2020 for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Royal Match is currently one of the highest grossing mobile games on the market. It will be worth watching to see how and if Dream Games follows it up. From what the company has said in the past, and today, those follow ups might not necessarily come in the form of more games in rapid succession, but in extending the franchises that are already successful and spacing out new developments over periods of years with less pressure to produce new titles over months.</p>
<p>“We believe in Pixar’s approach,” co-founder and CEO Soner Aydemir said in an interview in June. “When Pixar started, it was very low frequency, a movie every 2-3 years but eventually the rate increased. And it will be similar for us. This year we need to focus on Royal Match but if we can find a way to create other games, we will.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">As with Spyke&#8217;s view that its big competition might be the TikTok&#8217;s of the world, not just other games developers, so too does Dream eye up the entertainment industry as a bigger competitive threat. Indeed that&#8217;s not just because they too can publish games and build sticky brands, but they are after the same slice of leisure time as Dream among consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors are willing to bet here because of Dream Games&#8217; track record in gaining audience so far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The success and growth of Royal Match exceeded all of our expectations,” said Stephane Kurgan, the Index Ventures partner who led the investment, and former chief operating officer at King, in a statement. “In eight months, Royal Match has become one of the most played mobile games of 2021. Dream Games has assembled one of the best teams in the industry, with  a rare combination of creative talent, engineering expertise and relentless work ethic. They’ve already shifted the norms around what counts as excellence in mobile gaming, and we’re excited to see where they go next.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the fastest-growing apps in China right now, by installs, is the central bank&#8217;s digital yuan wallet. 261 million individual users (as opposed to enterprises), about one-fifth of the population, have set up e-CNY wallets so far, and 87.5 billion yuan ($13.78 billion) worth of transactions has been made using the digital fiat currency, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC), <a href="http://m.thepaper.cn/rss_newsDetail_16337430?from=sohu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at a <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/xwbfbh/wqfbh/47673/47730/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press event</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, China has been piloting the use of digital yuan in a number of major cities, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shenzhen</a>. People needed to enter a draw and apply to be early users in the beginning. Then at the start of 2022, in a clear sign of accelerating the trial, the PBOC made the e-CNY wallet available on the iOS and Android stores in China.</p>
<p>The digital yuan is by no means a manifestation of cryptocurrency, which is banned in China. The PBOC has <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deemed</a> bitcoin and the likes highly volatile, speculative, lacking intrinsic value, and pointed out that cryptocurrencies could be an instrument of money-laundering.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The e-CNY aspires to achieve different results. Issued by the central bank, it serves as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statutory, digital version of China&#8217;s cash in circulation</a>, or &#8220;M0&#8221;; indeed, the regulator intends to make e-yuan payments <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work even without the internet</a>, using NFC technology.</p>
<p>According to a research paper <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the Working Group on e-CNY Research and Development at the central bank last year, the digital yuan aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>diversify the forms of cash provided to the public by<br />
the central bank, satisfy the public’s demand for digital cash and support financial inclusion;</li>
<li>support fair competition, efficiency and safety of retail payment services; and</li>
<li>echo the international initiative and explore the improvement of cross-border payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though the e-CNY wallet is now downloadable in the Chinese app stores, only users in a list of pilot cities and at the upcoming Winter Olympics venue can actually sign up, top up their accounts, and spend the virtual currency at one of the 8 million &#8220;pilot scenarios,&#8221; such as making purchases on Alibaba and paying Didi rides.</p>
<p>To exchange cash into e-CNY, users will have to move money from one of the commercial banks authorized by the PBOC to operate and circulate the digital currency, including digital-only banks like Tencent-backed WeBank and Ant-backed MyBank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of its relationship with China&#8217;s popular payments services, the PBOC said in its report that e-CNY is supposed to &#8220;complement&#8221; rather than replace WeChat Pay and Alipay. For instance, it could support anonymity for small value transactions just like physical cash. In other cases, large amounts of funds sent from a provincial government to a town<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> could be paid in e-CNY</a> to prevent corruption using the digital currency&#8217;s traceable capabilities.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, e-CNY still needs to compete with the private payments giants on user experience, if it wants to achieve a meaningful active user base.</p>
