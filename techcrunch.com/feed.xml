										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To compete with the myriad venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, <a href="https://ifly.vc/">iFly.vc</a> has a unique vantage point.</p>
<p>Its founder Han Shen has straddled the United States and China for several decades. He was the first hire on the investment team of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/03/formation-8-500-million-fund/">Formation 8</a>, the VC firm co-founded by Palantir&#8217;s Joe Lonsdale. After iFly.vc backed Weee! in a Series A round in <a href="https://medium.com/ifly-vc/congratulations-on-weee-s-series-c-6f5554f28df6">2018</a>, Shen arranged for the grocery startup to meet with China&#8217;s produce delivery leaders &#8212; two of which<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/chinese-online-grocery-firms-dingdong-missfresh-have-a-tough-ipo.html"> recently went public in the U.S.</a> &#8212; to learn what was applicable to the American market.</p>
<p>Weee! has since become the go-to grocery app for America&#8217;s Asian communities and raised hundreds of millions of dollars from Lightspeed Venture Partners, DST Global, Blackstone, Tiger Global and other major institutions. IFly.vc is still Weee!&#8217;s second-largest shareholder, and its first fund recorded a 10x rate of return, Shen told TechCrunch during an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the back of its cross-continental experiences and portfolio performance, iFly.vc recently closed its second fund with over $46 million, boosting the firm&#8217;s assets under management to more than $95 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The limited partners in Fund II include family offices across the U.S. and Asia as well as high-profile entrepreneurs such as Zhang Tao, founder of China&#8217;s Yelp counterpart Dianping, Free Wu, a founding member of Tencent who now manages Welight Capital, Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir, and Aayush Phumbhra, co-founder of Chegg.</span></p>
<p>IFly.vc made another big move during the pandemic, relocating its office from San Francisco to Austin, joining a wave of Californians fleeing the expensive area.</p>
<p>When it comes to investment focus, Shen said he tries to seek out the underdogs in North America&#8217;s trillion-dollar consumer market.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, enterprise services are growing very quickly. But on the other hand, the rise of enterprise software is helping consumer tech to grow even more quickly and easily. The consumer market is very diverse and serves an array of minority groups, so there is always a new opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this premise in mind, iFly.vc recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/">invested in Cheese Financial</a>&#8216;s seed round, a digital bank that started out by serving the underbanked Asian American populations.</p>
<p>IFly.vc prefers backing startups early on and seeing them through by providing hands-on, post-investment support. Rather than spray and pray, iFly.vc has invested in just about a dozen companies five years after its founding.</p>
<p>Shen&#8217;s background of growing up in China and working in Silicon Valley, where he eventually became a partner at Formation 8, led him to appreciate entrepreneurs with a similarly international background because they can learn from mistakes and successes on both sides. They also know how to leverage the different fields of talent across the world.</p>
<p>Cheese Financial, for instance, is setting up an engineering force in the founder&#8217;s hometown, Shenzhen, to take advantage of the Chinese city&#8217;s large pool of engineers at costs much lower than those of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about hiring cheaper programmers, though. As Shen puts it: &#8220;In the past, American companies were simply outsourcing technical tasks to China. Now Chinese engineers actually have valuable lessons to bring to American companies because many have worked at large, successful Chinese tech companies themselves.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/pittsburghs-locomation-puts-a-convoy-twist-on-autonomous-trucking/Pittsburgh is known as the Steel City, but these days, the city is turning to startups rather than steel. Mayor Bill Peduto lead this charge since taking office in 2014. He recently spoke at TechCrunch&#8217;s City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event, where he outlined the opportunity and challenges for entrepreneurs considering founding and running their companies in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>This is a trend across the United States as cities once again turn to small businesses, such as tech startups, to reinvigorate and inspire. But, as Peduto points out, there&#8217;s a desperate need for more venture capital. The region also struggles to retain and recruit talent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/cmus-president-discusses-how-pittsburgh-is-building-and-retaining-high-tech-startups/">echoed by CMU&#8217;s President Farnam Jahanian</a>, who spoke at the same event.</p>
<p>Peduto is leaving office in January 2022 after losing to Ed Gainey in his party&#8217;s primary race.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>The following is a transcript of key topics discussed in the interview. The questions and responses have been lightly edited.</em></p>
<p><strong>What do you say to entrepreneurs looking to move to Pittsburgh?</strong></p>
<p>I would say this, first and foremost: Find a city that can provide you with the talent so that you have a pipeline.</p>
<p>Andrew Carnegie set up along the shores of the rivers of Pittsburgh because he knew he could get iron ore from Minnesota and coal from West Virginia and utilize the rails in the rivers as the way to export his business. So when you&#8217;re creating and looking for a city, look for where the talent already is so you don&#8217;t have to worry about bringing the talent to the location.</p>
<p>Those river banks are still here in Pittsburgh. But the true iron ore and coal today are called Carnegie Mellon University in the University of Pittsburgh. So as we&#8217;re producing all of these engineers and others, our goal is to create a city with the livability of a city where people would want to stay with a cost of living where people can own their own home. And a city where it&#8217;s small enough that you can get something done; where you don&#8217;t have to get caught up in the city bureaucracy, but it&#8217;s large enough that the world will take notice.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ll find is those cities exist throughout the country, but they&#8217;re not on the coasts. Instead, they&#8217;re cities like Nashville, Charlotte, Austin, and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>No one would deny that Pittsburgh has the talent and the livability. It&#8217;s a beautiful city. I&#8217;ve been there a few times myself, and I love it. But what&#8217;s missing?</strong></p>
<p>Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Part of it is a psychological belief that investors from the coast need to move a company to the coast to guarantee their success. What they&#8217;re doing is raising all the incremental costs that have nothing to do with its technology. They&#8217;re wasting funds on everything from rent to the cost of food. The belief that you physically have to be located in California or in New York drives many venture capitalists to look elsewhere when a great idea is being discussed.</p>
<p>Another part that&#8217;s missing is the critical second phase of funding. Pittsburgh has become reliant upon creating its economic development structure to be able to get a lot of these startups off the ground. And I&#8217;m not just talking about angel investors. There&#8217;s a number of different ways that companies are being funded that we didn&#8217;t have just a few years ago, for that critical second wave of funding. Entrepreneurs are missing out. And investors and VCs are missing out on being able to get into a early stage company in Pittsburgh after it has started. And without that second round of funding, a lot of these companies die on the vine instead of being able to make it to a critical juncture point.</p>
<p><strong>What do you say to entrepreneurs with a great idea and a good business but need to leave because there is no VC funding?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the hard part. Luis von Ahn from Duolingo had the opportunity, and probably a lot more money, to leave Pittsburgh than to stay in Pittsburgh and create his vision. He did it partly because of pride in being a part of this city. Part of the area we have to make up, when we&#8217;re not able to match dollar for dollar, with a different part of the country is going back to that quality of life. It goes much further than just being able to afford a house. It is the actual life that you are given by choosing to live in this area. It is a better lifestyle for many people than what they can find in saturated areas of the coasts.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m an outsider. And I&#8217;m not going to pretend I know Pittsburgh like a local journalist. I live just north of Detroit. And I see a lot of parallels between Detroit and Pittsburgh, Columbus and Austin, Nashville, and all these cities that are emerging as startup hubs, but sometimes this growth feels like it&#8217;s just surface level. What do you see in Pittsburgh that makes you hopeful that this growth will continue for years or decades to come?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that there is now an entire ecosystem around it. We didn&#8217;t have that ten years ago. So somebody who would be coming to Pittsburgh to work at Google wouldn&#8217;t have an opportunity to stay in Pittsburgh, to have a parallel advancement. And then to continue in a career path that would leave them to having a very successful career without having to leave Pittsburgh. There is a strong structure now around cleantech.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re around renewable energy, which people are surprised when I say that, but there are more jobs in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is in the renewable energy field, than coal, gas, and oil combined. The energy industry has shifted and in Pittsburgh &#8212; and with the Biden administration committed to investing in the areas that otherwise would be left behind &#8212; that opportunity is here to take off. Within each of those different sectors that I talked about earlier, advanced manufacturing, robotics and artificial intelligent life sciences, there is an expanded field instead of the focused field.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big difference that I have watched. And fortunately, I&#8217;ve had a part in over 30 years of seeing it expand. So what I would say to the people, and why it is different now, is that you are no longer coming to Pittsburgh to work one job and then leaving and going somewhere else. People are coming to Pittsburgh, and they&#8217;re staying. They&#8217;re starting their own companies, or they&#8217;re finding unlimited parallel advancement as they continue to go up the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s finish on Duolingo. They just filed to go public, and we were lucky enough to pre-record an interview with one of their directors before the quiet period. What&#8217;s your hope with Duolingo going public, and how is that going to change Pittsburgh?</strong></p>
<p>Well, first off, personally, as a friend of Luis and watching him and his team expand exponentially. I couldn&#8217;t be more proud for him and to see that expansion occur &#8212; with the idea of developing right here in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>I think the first part of it is the recognition that comes from within the tech industry itself &#8212; that a company of this magnitude, a billion-dollar company can be born, grow and continue to rise as a public corporation in Pittsburgh. Secondly, it brings top talent to the city. Third, it is a company that is committed to making the world a better place, not simply through their present technology of allowing us to learn a language, but the commitment of this company to invest in education across the board that will be equitable and available to anyone around the world, in where education can be utilized to create a better society. That&#8217;s something that makes every Pittsburgher proud.</p>

V, a special purpose acquisition company set up by Cantor Fitzgerald. Satellogic already has 17 satellites in orbit, and aims to scale its constellation to over 300 satellites to provide sub-meter resolution imaging of the Earth updated on a daily frequency.</p>
<p>The SPAC deal values the company at $850 million, and includes a PIPE worth $100 million with funds contributed by SoftBank&#8217;s SBLA Advisers Group and Cantor Fitzgerald. It assumes revenue of around $800 million for the combined company by 2025, and Satellogic expects to have a cash balance of around $274 million resulting from the deal at close.</p>
<p>Satellogic has raised a total of just under $124 million since its founding in 2010, from investors including Tencent, Pitanga Fund and others. The company claims its satellites are the only ones that can provide imaging at the resolution it offers with a price tag that remains relatively affordable for commercial clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much for the big E3 reveal. Weeks after the big gaming show, Nintendo has finally taking the wraps off the latest iteration of its wildly popular hybrid gaming console. The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/">Nintendo Switch (OLED model)</a> [parentheses theirs] will arrive on October 8, priced at $350. That is, the company&#8217;s quick to note, the same day it launches Metroid Dread, the long-awaited latest side scrolling entry in the long-standing franchise.<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2173903" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="578" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/joy-con-03.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The system sports a 7-inch OLED, improved audio and 64 GB of internal storage. The hybrid dock sports a wired LAN port, and the system ships with an adjustable port for playing in tabletop mode. There&#8217;s a sharp black and white color scheme, though the remainder of the materials looks to be similar to the earlier model, with most of that price bump going to the display. The company will also be offering a separate carrying case, because you don&#8217;t want to get the fancy screen on your new $350 system scratched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mHq6Y7JSmg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>From the sound of it, the two existing Switch models are sticking around, as lower cost alternatives. Those models run $299 and $199, respectively, though it seems reasonable to expect there may be some price drops as the new model arrives, ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>“The new Nintendo Switch (OLED model) is a great option for players who want to experience the new vibrant screen when playing in handheld and tabletop mode,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser said in a press release. “With the addition of this new model to the Nintendo Switch family of systems, people have an additional choice of a system that best fits the gaming experience they desire – whether it’s Nintendo Switch (OLED model), Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Lite.”</p>
<p>The system will arrive in two color configurations. Per Nintendo,</p>
<ul class="m_5132463387734383408bwlistdisc">
<li>
<blockquote><p><em>Nintendo Switch (OLED model) white set, which features white Joy-Con controllers, a black main unit and a white dock.</em></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p><em>Nintendo Switch (OLED model) neon red/neon blue set, which features neon red and neon blue Joy-Con controllers, a black main unit and a black dock.</em></p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An upgraded version of the four-year-old system has been rumored for some time, carrying the decidedly less clunky name, Switch Pro. With both Sony and Microsoft releasing next-gen versions of their consoles last year, the time certainly seemed right for big refresh from Nintendo. A refreshed version of the standard Switch arrived in July 2019, addressing the original&#8217;s poor battery life &#8212; far and away the largest complaint of an otherwise well-received system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173920" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173920" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173920" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg 10054w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NintendoSwitchFamily_MainVisual_16x9.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173920" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, in spite of growing a bit long in the tooth, the Switch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/video-game-spending-increased-27-in-2020/"> continued to dominate</a> the sales charts ahead of the arrival of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox One X. Nintendo utterly dominated sales during the pandemic, after some initial supply chain shortages. That success was due in no small part to the arrival of a new Animal Crossing title that provided some much-needed social gaming during the pandemic. Such success &#8212; coupled with potential supply chain shortage &#8212; led to suggestions that the company had opted to delay the system&#8217;s release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has always liked to motivate his employees by saying every day <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/">is Day 1</a>. Well, it is actually Day 1 for his successor Andy Jassy, who officially moves into the corner office at Amazon today.</p>
<p>Bezos announced that he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">would be stepping down as CEO</a> in February to focus on other interests including his charities Day 1 Fund and the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, the billionaire&#8217;s space company and The Washington Post, the newspaper he bought in 2013.</p>
<p>As he steps away, he will remain as executive chairman, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">it will be Jassy</a>, who up until now has spent most of his career at Amazon building the tremendously successful AWS cloud infrastructure arm, to keep a good thing going.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 and spent some time working as Bezos executive assistant and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/"> helped formulate the idea</a> that would become Amazon Web Services, a series of integrated web services. He has been at AWS since its earliest days, helping build it from the initial idea to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">a $50 billion juggernaut.</a> He was promoted to AWS CEO in 2016.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cRCj1eq3fR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-primed-andy-jassy-to-be-ceo-can-he-keep-what-jeff-bezos-built-11625218225">Wall Street journal reported</a> the other day that AWS would be ranked 69th on The Fortune 500 if it were a stand-alone company with the cloud unit currently on a $54 billion run rate. While that&#8217;s impressive he is taking over the full company, which itself ranks #2 on the same list, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/02/02/amazons-net-profit-soars-84-with-sales-hitting-386-billion/?sh=5af104ba1334">which generated $386 billion</a> in revenue last year as the pandemic pushed shopping online and Amazon was able to increase sales dramatically.</p>
<p>Jassy will face a number of challenges as he takes over including keeping that growth going as COVID slows down and people can begin to shop in person again. He also needs to deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-newly-tech-skeptical-ftc-will-reportedly-review-amazons-acquisition-of-mgm/">a federal government antitrust movement</a> in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/europe-lays-out-antitrust-case-against-amazons-use-of-big-data/">and the EU</a>, a push <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/teamsters-plan-aggressive-push-to-unionize-amazon-logistics-workers/">to unionize Amazon warehouses</a> and a general fear of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/american-consumers-are-worrying-more-about-amazon-cnbc-survey.html">Amazon&#8217;s growing market clout</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the executive musical chairs such a shift in leadership tends to force, former Tableau CEO Adam Selipsky, who spent over a decade with Jassy helping to build the unit before moving to run Tableau in 2016,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/"> will take over as AWS CEO</a> replacing Jassy.</p>
<p>In pre-market trading, Amazon stock was up 0.42% suggesting perhaps that Wall Street expects a smooth leadership transition at the company. Jassy has been a key member of the executive team for a number of years, and highly successful in his own right as he built AWS from humble beginnings to its current status, but now Amazon is his company to run and he will need to prove that he is up to the task.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Algorithmic management of gig workers has landed Glovo-owned on-demand delivery firm Foodinho in trouble in Italy where the country&#8217;s data protection authority issued a €2.6 million penalty (~$3M) <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677377">yesterday</a> after an investigation found a laundry list of problems.</p>
<p>The delivery company has been ordered to make a number of changes to how it operates in the market, with the Garante&#8217;s order giving it two months to correct the most serious violations found, and a further month (so three months total) to amend how its algorithms function &#8212; to ensure compliance with privacy legislation, Italy&#8217;s workers&#8217; statute and recent legislation protecting platform workers.</p>
<p>One of the issues of concern to the data watchdog is the risk of discrimination arising from a rider rating system operated by Foodinho &#8212; which had some 19,000 riders operating on its platform in Italy at the time of the Garante&#8217;s investigation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Likely of relevance here is a long running litigation brought by riders gigging for another food delivery brand in Italy, Foodora, which culminated in a ruling by the country&#8217;s Supreme Court <a href="https://www.wired.it/economia/lavoro/2020/01/24/rider-foodora-dipendenti-cassazione/?refresh_ce=">last year</a> that asserted riders should be treated as having workers rights, regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed &#8212; bolstering the case for challenges against delivery apps that apply algorithms to opaquely micromanage platform workers&#8217; labor.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9675440">injunction against Foodinho</a>, Italy&#8217;s DPA says it found numerous violations of EU privacy legislation &#8212; including GDPR principles of transparency, notification, lawfulness of processing, security, privacy by design and more [an <a href="https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677611">English extract of the injunction has now been published here</a>] &#8212; as well as a risk of discrimination against gig workers based on how Foodinho&#8217;s booking and assignments algorithms function, in addition to flagging concerns over how the system uses ratings and reputational mechanisms as further levers of labor control.</p>
<p>Article 22 of the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides protections for individuals against being solely subject to automated decision-making including profiling where such decisions produce a legal or similarly substantial effect (and access to paid work would meet that bar) &#8212; giving them the right to get information on a specific decision and object to it and/or ask for human review.</p>
<p>But it does not appear that Foodinho provided riders with such rights, per the Garante&#8217;s assessment.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677377">press release</a> about the injunction (which we&#8217;ve translated from Italian with Google Translate), the watchdog writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Authority found a series of serious offences, in particular with regard to the algorithms used for the management of workers. The company, for example, had not adequately informed the workers on the functioning of the system and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used for the evaluation of the riders. Nor did it guarantee procedures to protect the right to obtain human intervention, express one&#8217;s opinion and contest the decisions adopted through the use of the algorithms in question, including the exclusion of a part of the riders from job opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Guarantor has therefore required the company to identify measures to protect the rights and freedoms of riders in the face of automated decisions, including profiling.</p></blockquote>
<p>The watchdog also says it has asked Foodinho to verify the &#8220;accuracy and relevance&#8221; of data that feeds the algorithmic management system &#8212; listing a wide variety of signals that are factored in (such as chats, emails and phone calls between riders and customer care; geolocation data captured every 15 seconds and displayed on the app map; estimated and actual delivery times; details of the management of the order in progress and those already made; customer and partner feedback; remaining battery level of device etc).</p>
<p>&#8220;This is also in order to minimize the risk of errors and distortions which could, for example, lead to the limitation of the deliveries assigned to each rider or to the exclusion itself from the platform. These risks also arise from the rating system,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;The company will also need to identify measures that prevent improper or discriminatory use of reputational mechanisms based on customer and business partner feedback.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glovo, Foodinho&#8217;s parent entity &#8212; which is named as the owner of the platform in the Garante&#8217;s injunction &#8212; was contacted for comment on the injunction.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson told us they were discussing a response &#8212; so we&#8217;ll update this report if we get one.</p>
<p>Glovo acquired the Italian food delivery company Foodinho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/31/spains-glovo-acquires-italys-foodinho-to-expand-on-demand-delivery-service/">back in 2016</a>, making its first foray into international expansion. The Barcelona-based business went on to try to build out a business in the Middle East and LatAm &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/glovo-exits-the-middle-east-and-drops-two-latam-markets-in-latest-food-delivery-crunch/">before</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/">retrenching back</a> to largely focus on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/glovo-delivery-hero-brands-consolidation-chicken/">Southern and Eastern Europe</a>. (In <a href="https://www.ucima.it/uc-en/press-area/news/food-delivery-glovo-acquires-foodora-italia/">2018</a> Glovo also picked up the Foodora brand in Italy, which had been owned by German rival Delivery Hero.)</p>
<p>The Garante says it collaborated with Spain&#8217;s privacy watchdog, the AEDP &#8212; which is Glovo&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor under the GDPR &#8212; on the investigation into Foodinho and the platform tech provided to it by Glovo.</p>
<p>Its press release also notes that Glovo is the subject of &#8220;an independent procedure&#8221; carried out by the AEPD, which it says it&#8217;s also assisting with.</p>
<p>The Spanish watchdog confirmed to TechCrunch that joint working between the AEPD and the Garante had resulted in the resolution against the Glovo-owned company, Foodinho.</p>
<p>The AEPD also said it has undertaken its own procedures against Glovo &#8212; pointing to a <a href="https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00417-2019.pdf">2019 sanction</a> related to the latter not appointing a data protection officer, as is required by the GDPR. The watchdog later issued Glovo with a fined of €25,000 for that compliance failure.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s not clear why the AEDP has &#8212; seemingly &#8212; not taken a deep dive look at Glovo&#8217;s own compliance with the Article 22 of the GDPR. (We&#8217;ve asked it for more on this and will update if we get a response.)</p>
<p>It did point us to <a href="https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/la-proteccion-de-datos-en-las-relaciones-laborales.pdf">recently published guidance</a> on data protection and labor relations, which it worked on with Spain&#8217;s Ministry of Labor and the employers and trade union organizations, and which it said includes information on the right of a works council to be informed by a platform company of the parameters on which the algorithms or artificial intelligence systems are based &#8212; including &#8220;the elaboration of profiles, which may affect the conditions, access and maintenance of employment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Spanish government<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/"> agreed upon a labor reform</a> to expand the protections available to platform workers by recognizing platform couriers as employees.</p>
<p>The amendments to the Spanish Workers Statute Law were approved by Royal Decree in May &#8212; but aren&#8217;t due to start being applied until the middle of next month, per <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy_and_business/2021-05-12/spain-approves-landmark-law-recognizing-food-delivery-riders-as-employees.html">El Pais</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, the reform also contains a provision that requires workers’ legal representatives to be informed of the criteria powering any algorithms or AI systems that are used to manage them and which may affect their working conditions &#8212; such as those affecting access to employment or rating systems that monitor performance or profile workers. And that additional incoming algorithmic transparency provision has evidently been factored into the AEPD&#8217;s guidance.</p>
<p>So it may be that the watchdog is giving affected platforms like Glovo a few months&#8217; grace to allow them to get their systems in order for the new rules.</p>
<p>Spanish labor law also of course remains distinct to Italian law, so there will be ongoing differences of application related to elements that concern delivery apps, regardless of what appears to be a similar trajectory on the issue of expanding platform workers rights.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/italian-court-rules-against-discriminatory-deliveroo-rider-ranking-algorithm/">January</a>, for example, an Italian court found that a reputation-ranking algorithm that had been used by another on-demand delivery app, Deliveroo, had discriminated against riders because it had failed to distinguish between legally protected reasons for withholding labour (e.g., because a rider was sick; or exercising their protected right to strike) and other reasons for not being as productive as they’d indicated they would be.</p>
<p>In that case, Deliveroo said the judgement referred to a historic booking system that it said was no longer used in Italy or any other markets.</p>
<p>More recently a tribunal ruling in Bologna &#8212; found a Collective Bargaining Agreement signed by, AssoDelivery, a trade association that represents a number of delivery platforms in the market (including Deliveroo and Glovo), and a minority union with far right affiliations, the UGL trade union, to be unlawful.</p>
<p>Deliveroo told us it planned to appeal that ruling.</p>
<p>The agreement attracted controversy because it seeks to derogate unfavorably from Italian law that protects workers and the signing trade body is not representative enough in the sector.</p>

<p>Zooming out, EU lawmakers are also looking at the issue of platform workers rights &#8212; kicking off a consultation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">in February</a> on how to improve working conditions for gig workers, with the possibility that Brussels could propose legislation later this year.</p>
<p>However platform giants have seen the exercise as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">an opportunity to lobby for deregulation</a> &#8212; pushing to reduce employment standards for gig workers across the EU. The strategy looks intended to circumvent or at least try to limit momentum for beefed up rules coming a national level, such as Spain&#8217;s labor reform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not often that you hear DNA described as a wafer – but that’s the analogy that Grant Aarons, the founder of FabricNano, a cell-free biomanufacturing company uses to describe his company’s major product. That DNA, the company hopes, will make a dent in a growing global petrochemical industry that currently relies on fossil fuels and their byproducts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FabricNano is a London based company founded in 2018 through Entrepreneur First, a technology startup accelerator. FabricNano is invested in the creation of cell-free biomanufacturing. Biomanufacturing, simply, uses the enzymes within a cell or microbe to produce an end-product. FabricNano’s approach is to place those enzymes on the DNA wafer instead (that process is called enzyme immobilization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those enzymes, Aarons argues, can produce chemicals, like those used to make drugs or plastics, with higher efficiency compared to cell-based systems, and without the reliance on fossil fuels that are currently used to make those chemicals en masse.The heart of the company is the DNA scaffold, which can house enough enzymes to scale up those reactions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, FabricNano announced $12.5 million in Series A funding this week complete with a cadre of high profile angel investors. The round was led by Atomico, and included investment from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, actress, UN Sustainability Ambassador Emma Watson, and former Bayer CEO Alexander Moscho. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went out and actively tried to get the right angels for the company,” says Aarons. “We also looked at a few different technology angels. Because at the end of the day what we&#8217;re manufacturing is an enabling technology for manufacturers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not looking to manufacture bio-based plastics or bio-based monomers, at any sufficient scale,” he continues. “We&#8217;re looking to provide [manufacturers] with the technology that they can then use to manufacture at scale and at a low enough cost. It is a scalable and sustainable way to make low-value molecules, like bioplastics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of FabricNano’s identity hinges on creating a bio-based alternative within the growing petrochemical sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, about 14 percent of global oil demand goes towards making plastics. Petrochemicals, or chemicals obtained from oil and gas that can be used to make plastics or other materials, are expected to drive about half of the world’s oil demand by 2050, according to The International Energy Agency’s </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/petrochemicals-set-to-be-the-largest-driver-of-world-oil-demand-latest-iea-analysis-finds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plastics, a major end-product of the petrochemical industry, contribute to climate change at nearly every point in their life cycles – when they’re manufactured by heating up oil or ethane or when they’re burned as waste. If both plastic production and use continue at their current pace, emissions are projected to reach 1.34 gigatons by 2030 (the equivalent of 295 coal fired power plants), according to the </span><a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-Executive-Summary-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for International Environmental Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, making</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more plastic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no matter how it is made, will contribute to ecological catastrophe in its own way (</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/01/call-for-global-treaty-to-end-production-of-virgin-plastic-by-2040"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientists have called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for phase out of “virgin” plastic production by 2040). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the nebulous term “bioplastic” can refer to anything from a biodegradable plastic to a plastic created without the use of fossil fuels (even one that is not biodegradable), That makes the world of environmentally-friendly plastics highly susceptible to greenwashing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question that remains is how big an impact biomanufacturing can make on reducing petrochemicals’ contribution to climate change? At this point that’s unclear. Aarons argues that part of the appeal of cell-free manufacturing can pull the industry away from using petroleum (or in the US, ethanol) to make plastics or other commodity chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really talking about a new technology to take over a lot of the commodities sector, and pull a lot of those petroleum-based products away from petroleum and into the biological realm,” says Aarons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are also clear concerns with the production of plastics as-is, leaving room for alternatives to emerge if they prove to be scalable and cost-effective enough to supplant the existing petrochemical industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some evidence that cell-free manufacturing has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">already </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaled well. For instance, high fructose corn syrup is made when corn starch is broken down by enzymes into glucose. The final step requires one enzyme, glucose isomerase. Aarons calls high fructose corn syrup production “the largest implementation of cell-free in the world.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FabricNano is partially looking to build upon that concept to offer a greater suite of available chemicals. At the moment, FabricNano can already create chemicals like 1,3 propanediol, an ingredient that can be used to replace polyethylene glycol in toothpaste or shampoo. The input needed to create that product is glycerin, a major waste product of biodiesel manufacturing, which may help keep costs down and provide an alternative feedstock to fossil fuels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aarons says that FabricNano has proved capable of making four additional products, but didn’t disclose what kinds. He says FabricNano is “interested in the pharmaceutical space”, and in commodity chemicals. “There are a lot of commodity chemicals we can manufacture. 1,3 propanediol is just the tip of the iceberg,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, FabricNano’s distinguishing approach probably isn’t the commodity chemicals it has made so far, but the actual DNA scaffold. If the enzymes that stick to that DNA wafer and help produce chemicals are software, the DNA scaffold is FabricNano’s hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hardware is a major way the company hopes to bring cell-free into the world of commodity chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real missing piece, and why [cell-free manufacturing] has been a niche technology for a long time is that there has been no generalizable technology to immobilize all of these proteins,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the newest round of funding FabricNano plans to increase its employee workforce from 12 to thirty people, and move into a new London-based office. Total investment in the company stands at $16 million. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influential entrepreneurs like Paul Graham and Naval Ravikant always preach the need for startups to have founders-turned-investors on their cap table</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ravikant puts it, “founders want to know that the people they are taking money from have first-hand experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His platform AngelList has helped individual founders-cum-investors source and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in deals via collectives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some venture firms have taken this up a notch by bringing founders to create a fund and invest together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, one of such,</span><a href="https://www.magic.fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a global collective of founders, is announcing that it has raised a second fund of $30 million to continue backing early-stage startups across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the firm&#8217;s first fund launched in 2017, MAGIC has invested in 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across these emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/retool-nears-1-billion-valuation-with-funding-from-sequoia">Retool</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/">Novo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/payfazz-gets-53-million-to-give-more-indonesians-access-to-financial-services/">Payfazz</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">Mono</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund has 12 founders who act as general partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch caught up with managing partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adegokeolubusi">Adegoke Olubusi</a> and operating partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greenleafmatt">Matt Greenleaf</a> to learn more about the fund&#8217;s thesis and activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi, who had built and exited a couple of startups over the years, also dabbled with angel investing for some time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, Olubusi&#8217;s current startup Helium Health got accepted into Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there he met more founders like him who were angel investors with impressive portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The interesting bit? Each founder wanted to invest in other companies during YC&#8217;s Demo Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So about three years ago, I was at YC, and I was going to invest in my own batch. I was pitching on the day, but I was also listening to other pitches. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it wasn&#8217;t just me; there were many other founders as well,&#8221; Olubusi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After building and exiting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups, some founders turn into angel investing to support startups and their ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, most of them tend to go alone and are stuck with cutting checks in their local markets, which limits opportunities.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173820" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173820" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="228" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png 1442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=300,101 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=768,258 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=680,228 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-MAGIC-Portfolio-Companies.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173820" class="wp-caption-text">Some MAGIC portfolio companies</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a scenario. In 2016, when unicorns Flutterwave and Kavak raised their seed rounds in Nigeria and Mexico respectively, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an African biotech founder who knew about Kavak and a Latin American edtech founder interested in African fintech would not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have had the capacity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those deals even if they wanted; the reason being a lack of reach and experience in both the industry or geography</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi and the other founders knew this would be a limitation in the long run if they went solo. Thus, they decided to create MAGIC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to bring global founders together with diverse skillsets in diverse industries and geographies to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deals better and drive value for each other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hence, they can participate in two unicorns instead of one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instead of us investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have somewhat limited capacity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how much time we have as founders because of our respective companies, why don&#8217;t we collaborate on a strategy together and co-invest together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way we thought of MAGIC was a fund of micro funds built by founders for founders,&#8221; Greenleaf continued.</span></p>
<h2>Fund of micro funds but more than money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some of the personal conversations I&#8217;ve had with founders about their investors, a recurring theme has been that the most useful investors didn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sign the biggest checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a theme Olubusi also relates to all too well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was like every time we think about it, everyone who gave the most money rarely had time for us. It was so frequent that we all identified this as an actual thing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What actually drove value for us were other investors who were founders and operators, and other experienced people who were able to help us find product-market fit and fight regulators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These were actually the people in the trenches with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olubusi believes the early-stage part of investing, particularly in pre-seed and seed, is where VCs who are founder-operators find their sweet spot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are precious when startups are trying to figure out product-market fit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike traditional investors who are looking to get multiples on investments, Olubusi argues that for founders-investors, what matters is how much value they can drive for startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173821" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173821" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173821" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-Our-Reach.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173821" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MAGIC Fund</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC&#8217;s play is even more essential considering that it also plays in emerging markets where on-the-ground operational help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in industries with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unknowns and uncertainties</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is so much money in the market now and early-stage decision making at pre-seed and seed should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the hands of founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because think about it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make an evaluation of whether I should invest in a healthcare or fintech company in Africa, it makes sense to have those who&#8217;ve spent years battling through it in the trenches make those decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what we&#8217;re trying to do with the fund is publish as much information as possible and keep performing at the 100 percentile and say this is still the best strategy and is very scalable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million and Olubusi says the investments performed 5x over the period of three years. As some of these companies exited, their founders invested in MAGIC and came on board as Fund 2 partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAGIC has also enlisted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors who, according to Olubusi, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are respected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their investing abilities and ecosystem support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the African tech ecosystem as a founder who goes out of his way to help established and up-and-coming fintech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hendra Kwik of Payfazz has such a reputation in Southeast Asia as well. They, alongside other founders, join MAGIC as limited partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the firm&#8217;s statement, one-third of the entire fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was contributed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founder GPs. For its LPs, diversity play </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is considered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as 50% of them are black while 33% are women. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them include Michael Seibel, Tim Draper, Rappi&#8217;s Andres Bilbao, Paystack&#8217;s Shola Akinlade, Katie Lewis, and Octopus Ventures&#8217; Kirsten Connell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For its partners, MAGIC has brought on the likes of Stitchroom&#8217;s Tom Chen, Medumo&#8217;s Adeel Yang, Juice&#8217;s Michael Lisovetsky, and Troy Osinoff, and Evercare&#8217;s Temi Awogboro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages focusing on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women&#8217;s health, developer tools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does the fund look for in founders? Olubusi gives two answers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, MAGIC wants to back founders with incentives to stick through the hard times of a company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At pre-seed and seed, you don&#8217;t have enough data about a company to make an investment decision. Your bet is entirely on the founder and the founding team. What we know, having done this several times, is that things get harder. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when we&#8217;re looking at the founder, we&#8217;re evaluating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founder has the grit to stick through the toughest times which are going to come up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second indicator factors if the founder has the willingness, openness, the flexibility to learn and use that knowledge to succeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenleaf believes these strategies have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped the firm fund exceptional companies and maintain good relationships with founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of these founders don&#8217;t view us as their investors. They view us as fellow founders who are helping them along their journey. I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also ties into them keeping it real with us and allows us to see them as people, and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s one of the things that have worked in our favor,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fittingly, we don’t know a lot about Nothing. The young hardware startup has, however, done a stellar job building hype around precisely that fact. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555247/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-july-27th-launch-oneplus-carl-pei">the lead up to the July 27 launch</a> of the company’s first product, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/nothings-first-product-the-ear-1-earbud-launches-in-june/"> Ear (1)</a>, the Nothing marketing machine has released information in drabs and drabs.</p>
<p>Ahead of the event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothing-founder-carl-pei-on-ear-1-and-building-a-hardware-startup-from-scratch/">we sat down with founder Carl Pei</a> for a wide ranging interview about launching his latest hardware company. During the conversation, he revealed some additional information about the upcoming fully wireless earbuds.</p>
<p>“It’s going to have leading features like noise cancellation and great build quality,” Pei told TechCrunch. “Because we&#8217;re primarily going to be focused on online sales channels, we are going to be able to [make it] &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t say ‘affordable,’ but quite a fair price to consumers. With the Ear (1), it&#8217;s a much more costly design to realize than a standard, non-transparent design. I think it&#8217;s going to be a good price at $99 USD, €99 Euros and £99. Feature-wise, it’s similar to the AirPods Pro, but the AirPods Pro is $249.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2173564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173564" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg 6240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carl-Pei-Nothing_2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nothing</p></div></p>
<p>Pricing in the earbud market is all over the place at the moment, of course. Apple is holding up the high end of the mainstream with its AirPods Pro. Sony’s latest manage to edge that out into truly premium pricing at $280. At the other end of the spectrum, meanwhile, it’s easy to snag a pair of buds for well under $50, though at the low end of the market, your mileage will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173825" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173825" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202176-114620.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nothing</p></div></p>
<p>The Ear (1)s are aggressively priced at $99 – putting them in the same pricing category as the Samsung Galaxy Buds and the recently released Google Pixel Buds-A. Though Pei promises Nothing’s product will have the upper hand with an AirPods Pro-like feature set, including active noise cancelling. In an email to TechCrunch, the company says the ANC will arrive via three &#8220;high definition&#8221; mics. Pei added that the IP purchased from Essential won&#8217;t appear in this first product.</p>
<p>&#8220;[B]efore we were called Nothing, &#8216;Essential&#8217; was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,&#8221; said Pei. &#8220;So that’s why we&#8217;ve acquired the trademark. We don&#8217;t have any plans to do anything with Essential.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, he stresses that it’s not a features race for Nothing. “If you look at what kids want to become today, they want to be TikTokers, or YouTubers,” Pei tells TechCrunch. “Maybe it&#8217;s because technology isn&#8217;t as inspiring as before. We talked to consumers, and they don&#8217;t care as much as a couple of years ago, either. If you look at what brands are doing in their communication, it&#8217;s all about features and specs. There&#8217;s nobody in this space trying to like with a higher purpose.”</p>
<p>The ‘higher purpose’ here is Nothing’s broader ecosystem play, connectivity and making users’ “digital lives more seamless.” It’s also, as the name implies, an attempt to make tech that gets out of its own way. That’s, in part, is the job of the aesthetics. We do know that the buds will be transparent – a design decision that contributed to the delayed launch.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9w7HHB5PJlY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“It turns out, there&#8217;s a reason why there&#8217;s not a lot of transparent consumer tech products out there,” Pei said. “It’s really, really hard to make it high quality. You need to ensure that everything inside looks just as good as the outside. So that&#8217;s where the team has been iterating. You probably wouldn&#8217;t notice the differences between each iteration. It could be getting the right magnets &#8212; as magnets are usually designed to go inside of a product and not be seen by the consumer &#8212; to figuring out the best type of gluing. You never have to solved that problem if you have a non-transparent product, but what kind of glue will keep the industrial design intact?”</p>
<p>Nothing is relying on direct sales to drive down costs, with an initial focus on U.K., India, Europe and North America, followed by Japan, Korea and other countries. Pei says the company is still in process of negotiating additional markets. The Ear (1) are the first of three products the company currently has in its pipeline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["If we take a take a step back and think about it from a consumer perspective, we feel like, as a whole consumer, tech is quite, quite boring.">]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On July 27, hardware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothings-ear-1-earbuds-will-feature-noise-cancelling-and-run-99/">Nothing will debut its first product, wireless earbuds dubbed Ear (1)</a>. Despite releasing almost no tangible information about the product, the company has managed to generate substantial buzz around the launch — especially for an entry into the already-crowded wireless earbud market.</p>
<p>The hype, however, is real — and somewhat understandable. Nothing founder Carl Pei has a good track record in the industry — he was just 24 when he co-founded OnePlus in 2013. The company has done a canny job capitalizing on heightened expectations, meting out information about the product like pieces in a puzzle.</p>
<p>We spoke to Pei ahead of the upcoming launch to get some insight into Ear (1) and the story behind Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know there was a timing delay with the launch. Was that related to COVID-19 and supply chain issues?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CP:</strong> Actually, it was due to our design. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/carl-peis-nothing-shows-of-the-tobacco-pipe-inspired-concept-1/">concept image of this transparent design</a>. It turns out there&#8217;s a reason why there aren&#8217;t many transparent consumer tech products out there. It’s really, really hard to make it high quality. You need to ensure that everything inside looks just as good as the outside. So that&#8217;s where the team has been iterating, [but] you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice the differences between each iteration.</p>
<p>It could be getting the right magnets — as magnets are usually designed to go inside of a product and not be seen by the consumer — to figuring out the best type of gluing. You never have to solve that problem if you have a non-transparent product, but what kind of glue will keep the industrial design intact? I think the main issue has been getting the design ready. And we&#8217;re super, super close. Hopefully, it will be a product that people are really excited about when we launch.</p>
<p><strong>So, there were no major supply chain issues?</strong></p>
<p>Not for this product category. With true wireless earbuds, I think we&#8217;re pretty fine. No major issues. I mean, we had the issue that we started from zero — so no team and no partners. But step by step, we finally got here.</p>
<p><strong>That seems to imply that you&#8217;re at least thinking ahead towards the other products. Have you already started developing them?</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of products in the pipeline. Earlier this year, we did a community crowdfunding round where we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/want-to-invest-in-nothing-carl-pei-opens-investment-opportunity-to-community/">allocated $1.5 million</a> to our community. That got bought up really quickly. But as part of that funding round, we had a deck with some of the products in development. Our products are code-named as Pokemon, so there are a lot of Pokemon on that slide [Editor&#8217;s note: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-community-carl-pei-interview-1227393/">The Ear 1 was</a> <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Aipom_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">“Aipom.”</a>]. We have multiple categories that we&#8217;re looking at, but we haven&#8217;t really announced what those are.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9w7HHB5PJlY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why were earbuds the right first step?</strong></p>
<p>I think this market is really screaming for differentiation. If you look at true wireless today, I think after Apple came out with the AirPods, the entire market kind of followed. Everybody wears different clothes. This is something we wear for a large part of the day. Why wouldn&#8217;t people want different designs?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working with Teenage Engineering — they&#8217;re super, super strong designers. I think true wireless is a place where we can really leverage that strength. Also, from a more rational business perspective, wireless earbuds is a super-fast growing product category. I think we&#8217;re going to reach 300 million units shipped worldwide this year for this category. And your first product category should be one with good business potential.</p>
<p><strong>“Screaming for differentiation” is an interesting way to put it. When you look at AirPods and the rest of the industry, are aesthetics what the market primarily lacks? Is it features or is it purely stylistic?</strong></p>
<p>If we take a take a step back and think about it from a consumer perspective, we feel like, as a whole, consumer tech is quite, quite boring. Kids used to want to become engineers and astronauts and all that. But if you look at what kids want to become today, they want to be TikTokers or YouTubers. Maybe it&#8217;s because technology isn&#8217;t as inspiring as before. We talked to consumers, and they don&#8217;t care as much as a couple of years ago either. If you look at what what brands are doing in their communication, it&#8217;s all about features and specs. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The upside of the Open Banking regulations which have swept jurisdictions like the UK and the EU is that many more challenger banks have appeared. The headache for either incumbent banks or for upstart startups is the very proliferation of these new banks and financial tech products. But as we know, in gold rushes, the people selling the picks and shovels usually win. Thus, startups have turned their attention, not to launching full-stack banks, but to full-stack platforms that other people can launch their fintech startups and products upon.</p>
<p>The latest to join this brigade is <a href="https://toqio.co/">Toqio</a>, a fintech platform with a white label digital finance SaaS that allows anyone to launch a new fintech product.</p>
<p>The London-based startup has now secured an €8M / $9.4M seed round of funding led by Seaya Ventures and Speedinvest, with SIX FinTech Ventures participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Eduardo Martínez and Michael Galvin, the teams behind Toqio previously built a small business SaaS startup, Geniac, which was acquired by Grant Thornton.</p>
<p>Eduardo Martínez, co-Founder and CEO, of Toqio, said: “Businesses and banks are looking to innovate in the FinTech sector, but to date, they have had to create and maintain complex software solutions to do this. This has also kept smaller niche businesses out of the market. We don’t want FinTech to end up like banking just with a new set of big incumbents trying to take control of financial services. We want to level the playing field.”</p>
<p>Toqio says its customers get access to pre-built products to create applications that can go to market quickly. Products include digital banking, card, and financing solutions, and a marketplace, aimed at financial institutions, FinTech startups, banks, and corporate brands.</p>
<p>Headquartered in London and Madrid, Toqio says it already has customers across Europe, including new Spanish bank Crealsa, business banking service Wamo in Malta, and alternative business lender Just Cash Flow in the UK.</p>
<p>Aristotelis Xenofontos, Principal at Seaya Ventures, said: ”We have spent many years following the Embedded Finance space and finally found the missing piece, a seamless enabler that glues everything together. Toqio is a truly end-to-end platform that provides a complete plug-and-play bank and allows any organization to offer a full suite of digital financial services in a rapid, painless, future-proof, and low-cost way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stefan Klestil, General Partner at Speedinvest, added: “We’ve seen the rise of neo-banks, the change of regulations across multiple markets, and now we’re starting to see traditional businesses and big brands looking to embed financial products within their existing offerings. Financial services are going to change and expand at an unprecedented rate, and Toqio will be instrumental in enabling it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce in Europe is set to <a href="https://internetretailing.net/rxgeu/rxgeu/european-ecommerce-revenues-jump-30-to-us465bn-in-2021#:~:text=European%20eCommerce%20revenues%20jump%2030%25%20to%20US%24465bn%20in%202021,-Europe%20is%20experiencing&amp;text=The%20COVID%2D19%2Dled%20boom,and%20the%20number%20of%20users.&amp;text=Statistics%20show%20that%20European%20eCommerce,US%2471bn%20increase%20YoY." target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow 30% percent this year</a>, with the online shopping surge that started at the rise of Covid-19 showing little sign of abating. Today, a startup that&#8217;s building infrastructure in the region to help merchants fill and deliver those orders &#8212; and present an alternative to using Amazon for fulfillment &#8212; is announcing funding to expand its footprint to meet that demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://getbyrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd</a>, which builds software to manage warehouses and logistics operations, and also runs a service to help online merchants store, pick and deliver their orders, has picked up €16 million ($19 million), a Series B that it will be using to expand to five more markets in eastern, northern and southern Europe in addition to the five countries where it&#8217;s already active. Founded in Vienna, Austria in 2016, Byrd is also in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, where together it has some 15 fulfillment centers and 200 customers, including Durex, Freeletics, Scholl, Your Superfoods and other D2C brands in health and wellness, consumer packaged goods, cosmetics and fashion.</p>
<p>Mouro Capital &#8212; a strategic fintech/e-commerce VC that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/mouro-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out from banking giant Santander last year</a> &#8212; led the round, with Speedinvest, Verve Ventures, Rider Global and VentureFriends also participating. Byrd isn&#8217;t disclosing its valuation but has raised some €26 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The gap in the market that Byrd is going after is a growing one, not just in terms of size but in terms of retailers&#8217; demand, and what they are looking for in a fulfillment partner.</p>
<p>E-commerce is a deceptively complex business &#8212; deceptive, because as consumers all we ever really see or care about is the ability to find what we are looking for at a decent price, click on it, buy it without too much fuss and have it appear at our doors, ideally asap.</p>
<p>But the steps needed behind the scenes to make all of that possible are many, and mostly complex, and not usually in the core competency of a typical small retailer, who may have identified a product it thinks the world wants, but not how to get it to them. They include marketing, payments, user interface designs, personalization, manufacturing and other supply chain concerns, and yes, the logistics and fulfillment to get orders to customers. As e-commerce continues to become a bigger channel, all of these segments in the chain represent ever-growing opportunities.</p>
<p>Typically, retailers will look to third-party tech companies to provide these different services, and this is where Byrd comes in, as an outsourced partner to handle companies&#8217; logistics and fulfillment. The company has built a set of APIs that let retailers essentially plug in and shift the whole fulfillment operation to Byrd.</p>
<p>That includes integrating with Byrd&#8217;s warehouses to receive, store and pick items; and it also includes connecting with a company&#8217;s merchant network, which could include a merchant&#8217;s own online storefront, but also Amazon and other marketplaces where items are sold. When an order comes in and it is time to pick and ship an item, Byrd also uses its tech to taps into a network of different shipping companies &#8212; the list includes the likes of UPS, DHL, Amazon, postNL and others &#8212; to find the cheapest and easiest way of getting an item to the buyer.</p>
<p>To be totally clear, Byrd is not the only one doing this. But alongside other independent companies that compete with Byrd &#8212; one of the biggest, ShipBob, last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shipbob-nabs-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-help-e-commerce-companies-run-logistics-like-amazons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a big round of $200 million on a $1 billion valuation</a> &#8212; is a big elephant in the room in the form of Amazon. The e-commerce giant has positioned itself as something of a one-stop shop for merchants, providing not just fulfillment (via <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA</a>), but storefront visibility, marketing and much more.</p>
<p>The size of Amazon is such that it typically accounts for a large market share, and many merchants can&#8217;t <em>not</em> have a presence there even if it&#8217;s primarily as a customer acquisition channel, said Petra Dobrocka, co-founder and CCO of Byrd, in an interview.</p>
<p>But the problem is that the Amazon option, and some of the other third-party providers, don&#8217;t leave much to personalization. Indeed, as e-retailers continue to mature, and find themselves facing their own stiff competition, they are looking for more ways of getting an edge, and to stand out from the crowd. Byrd provides something here for them, too, giving them the option to customize packaging so that customers are essentially experiencing a direct service, even when it&#8217;s actually coming from Byrd, and to give them options to go for more sustainable delivery and more if they choose.</p>
<p>That has possibly meant a slower rate of scaling for the startup, but it comes as a quality option, and that counts for something in a world that is teetering on very poor quality control, and definitely lack of distinct identity, in some marketplaces particularly as they continue to scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could say we are an alternative to Amazon, but also quite different. Our sellers are very brand-focused and want to provide a total experience total to customers,&#8221; Dobrocka said. &#8220;We also have smaller customers who appreciate this.&#8221; Indeed, as is so often the case, smaller businesses get short-changed on service levels compared to bigger businesses, so having a fulfillment service that treats even smaller retailers like bigger ones is a plus.</p>
<p>This is also part of a bigger trend, where a wave of tech companies are emerging to help those retailers build more distinct online presence and personalization, too. (The online storefront design platform Shogun, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/shogun-a-front-end-e-commerce-page-builder-nabs-67-5m-as-retailers-look-for-alternatives-to-marketplaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also announced funding last week</a>, is another example of a startup playing into this trend.)</p>
<p>All of this has led to Byrd seeing some very strong growth &#8212; revenues are up 300% compared to a year ago &#8212; with &#8220;hundreds of thousands of parcels per month&#8221; being handled, the company said.</p>
<p>Although its primary business is in catering to the very big B2C opportunity one obvious adjacent area where Byrd could work is in B2B, and Dobrocka said that will also be coming online in the coming months. Alongside that, while the company hasn&#8217;t specified which countries it will build out its fulfillment in next, given Mouro&#8217;s involvement, I&#8217;m guessing that Spain might be one of the next countries on the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to be leading Byrd’s Series B funding round, particularly as the pandemic has brought the need for flexible, digital e-commerce fulfilment solutions into sharp relief,&#8221; said Manuel Silva Martínez, general partner at Mouro Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Byrd’s end-to-end capabilities, focus on sustainability, and household brand customers set it apart from its competitors, and we look forward to seeing the successes that the geographic expansion enabled by this investment will bring.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter no longer enjoys the liability protection against user-generated content in India, the government said in a court filing this week as tension escalates between the two over the South Asian nation&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>.</p>
<p>In a court filing on Monday, New Delhi said Twitter has lost its immunity in India after the American social network failed to comply with the new local IT rules, which were unveiled in February and went into effect in late May.</p>
<p>Experts have said in recent weeks that the Indian court &#8212; and not the Indian government &#8212; <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/limits-of-modis-power-to-control-twitter/">holds the power</a> to decide whether Twitter gets to keep its safe harbor protections in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Internet services enjoy what is broadly referred to as “safe harbor” protection that say that tech platforms won&#8217;t be held liable for the things their users post or share online. If you insult someone on Twitter, for example, the company may be asked to take down your post (if the person you have insulted has approached the court and a takedown order has been issued) but it likely won&#8217;t be held legally responsible for what you said or did.</p>
<p>Without the protection, Twitter &#8212; which according to mobile insight firm App Annie, has over 100 million users in India &#8212; is on paper responsible for everything those users say on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I state the immunity conferred on intermediaries under section 79(1) is a conditional immunity subject to the intermediary satisfying the conditions under sections 79(2) and 79(3). As provided in Rule 7, failure to observe the IT Rules 2021 results in provisions of Section 79(1) of the IT Act, 2000 not being applicable to such an intermediary,&#8221; N Samaya Balan of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>The move comes as tension escalates between the Indian government and Twitter. Google, Facebook, and several other firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/">partially or fully complied with the IT rules</a>, which among other things, requires any significant social media firm (any firm with over 5 million users in India) to appoint a chief compliant officer, a resident grievance officer, and a so-called nodal contact person to address on-ground concerns.</p>
<p>Twitter has not complied with any of these requirements, the court filing said. Twitter had no comment on Monday&#8217;s filing, but has said in the past that it intends to comply with the IT rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;All social media platforms are welcome to do business in India. They can criticize Ravi Shankar Prasad, my Prime Minister or anyone. The issue is of misuse of social media. Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you&#8217;ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable,&#8221; India&#8217;s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a conference last week.</p>
<p>With the liability protection stripped off, Twitter executives in India could face several criminal charges over content deemed objectionable on the platform. Indian police have already filed at least five cases against the company or its officials in the country over a range of issues.</p>
<p>A special squad of Delhi police <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter&#8217;s offices in late May</a> in what many perceived as an intimidation tactic. Twitter said at the time that it was “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">concerned by recent events</a> regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve” and requested the Indian government to grant it three additional months to comply with the new IT rules.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, too, hasn&#8217;t fully complied with the new IT rules. The IT rules also mandate operators of encrypted messaging apps to introduce a way for the law enforcement to be able to &#8220;trace&#8221; the originator of objectionable messages. WhatsApp, which has amassed over 530 million users in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government</a> in May over this requirement, saying making &#8220;traceability&#8221; possible would violate citizens’ constitutional right to privacy.</p>
<p>Signal has also <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/messaging-application-signal-not-in-compliance-with-new-rules-say-officials-101624508925464.html">reportedly not complied</a> with the traceability requirement. The messaging service didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. It&#8217;s unclear whether Apple, which has tens of millions of Messages / iMessage users in India, has complied with the traceability requirement. It declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business trip booking platform <a href="https://www.travelperk.com">TravelPerk</a> has bagged another rival &#8212; picking up UK-based <a href="https://www.clicktravel.com">Click Travel</a>. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed but we&#8217;re told it&#8217;s the third &#8212; and largest &#8212; acquisition for TravelPerk to date.</p>
<p>The Barcelona-based startup has been on a bit of a shopping spree since the pandemic crisis hit Europe last year, picking up risk management startup Albatross in summer 2020 to bolster resilience to COVID-19&#8217;s impacts, before going on to acquire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">US-based NexTravel</a> in January to expand its presence in the US market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The latest acquisition deepens TravelPerk&#8217;s UK and European business, adding Click Travel&#8217;s 2,000+ SME clients (which includes the likes of Five Guys, Red Bull and Talk Talk) to its customer base &#8212; which will total just over 5,000 post-acquisition.</p>
<p>The UK company handles some £300M in business <span class="il">travel</span> for its client base, which will bolster TravelPerk&#8217;s revenues going forward. The latter now bills itself as the &#8220;leading&#8221; travel management platform for the SME market globally and the UK as a whole.</p>
<p>“We are a global travel management platform but our core markets are the US and Europe and we expect both markets to be our primary growth areas this year,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Avi Meir. &#8220;At the current moment, the US is our largest market due to the covid restrictions in the EU &amp; UK.”</p>
<p>“Assuming <span class="il">travel</span> restrictions won’t be imposed again, we expect to grow by 200% in 2022 with strong growth in our core markets in the US &amp; EU,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Click Travel, which is based in Birmingham, was founded all the way back in 1999 &#8212; and appears to have raised relatively little venture capital over the years, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/click-travel">Crunchbase</a>. However, in 2018, the veteran player <a href="https://www.clicktravel.com/blog/joining-future-fifty-2018-tech-city-uk/">participated in the government-backed Future Fifty</a> scale-up program &#8212; and also took in a &#8220;<a href="https://www.clicktravel.com/blog/click-travel-receives-multi-million-pound-investment-from-the-bgf/">multi-million pound</a>&#8221; investment from the UK-based Business Growth Fund.</p>
<p>Whether there will be any domestic hang-wringing over a high growth UK business being sold to a European rival remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In a statement on its sale to TravelPerk, CEO James McLean omitted to mention the pandemic&#8217;s impact on the travel sector &#8212; choosing instead to highlight what he couched as the pair&#8217;s shared &#8220;mission&#8221; to reduce the cost and complexity of business travel.</p>
<p>“Those shared objectives, combined with the natural cultural fit between our two companies, means we are incredibly excited to bring our teams together. Combining TravelPerk’s industry-leading knowledge, technology, experience and first class customer support with our own is a powerful proposition and we can’t wait to get started,&#8221; McLean added.</p>
<p>While Click Travel has focused on serving the UK market, TravelPerk has had a global focus from the start.</p>
<p>It has also attracted a large amount of external investment (totalling just under $300M) over its shorter run (founded in 2015).</p>
<p>Back in April, for example, it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">raised a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/travelperk-raises-160m-in-equity-and-debt-after-a-year-of-derailed-business-trips/">$160M Series D round</a>. It had also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/">topped up its Series C round in July 2019</a> before the pandemic hit. So TravelPerk<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> hasn&#8217;t been short of funds to ride out the COVID-19 revenue crunch &#8212; and as well as shopping for competitors it has also been able to avoid making any layoffs over the travel crisis. </span></p>
<p>Per a press release, capital to fund the Click Travel acquisition was provided by Boston-based investment manager, The Baupost Group.</p>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s Meir remains bullish about the near-term prospects for growth in the business travel sector, despite ongoing concerns in Europe and the US about the more infectious &#8216;Delta&#8217; variant of the virus which is contributing to surging rates of COVID-19 in some markets (including the UK) &#8212; claiming it&#8217;s already seeing green shoots of recovery in &#8220;key markets&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;TravelPerk is outgrowing the market pace and is already at above 2019 revenue figures,&#8221; Meir told TechCrunch. “When it comes to the rest of the industry, the recovery of travel is well underway but moving at different speeds in different markets. For instance in the US, according to <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1625565110777000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcpOdkpHNnOKtACtKxfP4hXfIlog">TSA Checkpoint figures</a>, at the current rate of recovery the US travel market is expected to reach pre-pandemic volume at the end of August 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate the global market may take a little longer but are optimistic we will see close to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.”</p>
<p>“We’re one of the few players in the travel industry that continued scaling and growing since the beginning of the pandemic with a strategy that didn’t involve any layoffs,&#8221; he also told us. “Since March last year, our strategy has been not to sit back but to be aggressive and invest massively in our product offering and in our global reach, so that we are in the best position possible to capitalise when travel makes its full recovery. Today’s news is a major part of that plan.</p>
<p>“We will aim to continue being aggressive in our growth strategy and we are open to more acquisitions if they make strategic sense and are aligned with our vision and culture.”</p>
<p>Per Meir, Click Travel and TravelPerk will initially continue to run as two independent platforms but he confirmed that an &#8220;eventual full integration&#8221; is planned &#8212; with both set to operate under the TravelPerk brand in time.</p>
<p>The startup also says it will retain all Click Travel&#8217;s staff &#8212; denying it has plans to axe any jobs. It also intends to hold onto the company&#8217;s Birmingham base &#8212; having the city as another UK hub for its business (in addition to its existing London office).</p>
<p>“The 150 amazing people working for Click Travel were a big reason why we wanted to acquire the company, and were priced into the deal,&#8221; said Meir. &#8220;We have no plans of redundancies. We rather aim to integrate the entire team into the TravelPerk Group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if TravelPerk might consider expanding its focus to also target the enterprise segment, he noted that it&#8217;s seen interest from larger businesses &#8212; and said he&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; to the idea &#8212; but for now Meir said TravelPerk remains fully focused on the SME market: &#8220;where we think there is the biggest need, and the biggest growth potential&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why this acquisition is so exciting for us; it makes us undoubtedly the leading <span class="il">travel</span> management platform for SMEs globally,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Flexibility and sustainability</h2>
<p>Discussing how the pandemic has changed business travel, Meir highlighted two &#8220;important trends&#8221; he said TravelPerk will continue to invest it: Namely flexibility for bookings; and sustainability so environmental impact can be reduced.</p>
<p>TravelPerk plans to invest more than $100M in two key products in these areas (aka: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/travelperk-launches-flexible-refunds-to-help-businesses-save-on-cancelled-trips/">FlexiPerk</a> and GreenPerk), per Meir.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve noticed on our platform that travellers are booking closer to their departure date: Before the pandemic, trip searches were usually conducted between 7 and 30 days prior to the selected departure date,&#8221; he said, elaborating on the importance of flexibility for the sector. &#8220;Now we are seeing most trip searches are for trips less than 6 days away. Flexibility is therefore one of the most in-demand perks in business <span class="il">travel</span>. Travellers will rely on flexible fares to give them the peace of mind that they won’t lose money if they need to change or cancel a trip on short notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>On sustainability, Meir said businesses are already looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and general environmental impact, while consumers are also wanting to make conscientious decisions to reduce carbon emission &#8212; suggesting that train-based travel is set to gain ground (vs flights) as a result. (That might, ultimately, require some creative retooling of TravelPerk&#8217;s logo &#8212; which prominently features an airplane icon&#8230; )</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see significant interest in our carbon offsetting product, GreenPerk, as a result but we also expect to see changes in how people are choosing to <span class="il">travel</span>,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, rail is undoubtedly the more environmentally-friendly <span class="il">travel</span> option. In fact, taking a train over a domestic flight can reduce an individual’s carbon emissions by about 84%. We have been building out our rail inventory for a number of years now and we expect train <span class="il">travel</span> to be an increasingly popular business <span class="il">travel</span> option for customers this year and next.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the changing mix of business-related travel in a pandemic-reconfigured world of remote work, Meir continues to argue that more businesses providing employees with remote working options will sum to more business travel overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be bad news for the daily commute but it will result in more business <span class="il">travel,</span>&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Whether they are going fully remote and &#8216;working from anywhere&#8217;, or operating on a hybrid model, distributed teams will need (and want) to come together. We believe there will be a new type of business trip &#8212; one where team members will <span class="il">travel</span> from different working hubs to get together for teambuilding and brainstorming sessions, for meetings with clients and colleagues, and even for &#8216;bleisure&#8217; (business and leisure) trips.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pine Labs said on Tuesday it has closed a $600 million financing round as the Asian merchant commerce platform sets the goal to explore the public markets within two years.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, BlackRock, Ishana, as well as a fund advised by Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers, and IIFL and Kotak invested in the round, which values the startup at $3 billion. Pine Labs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">unveiled the new round</a>, a name of which it hasn&#8217;t disclosed, earlier this year.</p>
<p>Pine Labs, which counts Sequoia Capital India, Temasek, PayPal and Mastercard among its early backers, offers hundreds of thousands of merchants payments terminals, invoicing tools and working capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its payments terminal — also known as point-of-sale machines — are connected to the cloud, and offer a range of additional services such as working capital — to the merchants. Pine Labs’s payments terminal has integration with over two dozen banks and financial and technology partners.</p>
<p>This differentiates Pine Labs from the competition, whose terminals typically have integration with just one bank. Each time a rival firm strikes a new partnership with a bank, they need to deploy new machines into the market. This makes the whole deployment expensive for both the fintech and the bank. (This is why you also often see a restaurant has multiple terminals at the check out.) The startup says it processes tens of billions of payment transactions.</p>
<p>“Over the last year, Pine Labs has made significant progress in its offline-to-online strategy in India and the direct-to-consumer play in Southeast Asia. Our full-stack approach to payments and merchant commerce has allowed us to grow in-month merchant partnerships by nearly 100% over the last year,&#8221; said B. Amrish Rau, CEO, Pine Labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to bring on board a marquee set of new investors in this round and appreciate the confidence they have placed on the Pine Labs business model and our growth momentum,” said Amrish Rau, adding that he plans to take the startup public in 18 months.</p>
<p>In recent years, Pine Labs has made several acquisitions to broaden its business. In 2019, it acquired QwikCilver, which leads the market in gift cards category. Earlier this year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/pine-labs-acquires-southeast-asian-startup-fave-for-45-million/">acquired Southeast Asian startup Fave for $45 million</a> as it broadened its consume side of the business.</p>
<p>Over 6 million consumers across over 40,000 merchant establishments now have access to the Fave app, the startup said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through its acquisitions of QwikCilver and Fave, Pine Labs now has the market leading pre-paid platform in this region as well as the top consumer loyalty product in this market. With leadership across multiple categories, the company is very well positioned to help drive immense value to its merchant partners in India and across other SEA markets,” said Shailendra Singh, MD, Sequoia Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether you are part of the accounting department, or just any employee at an organization, managing expenses can be a time-consuming and error-filled, yet also quite mundane, part of your job. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.pleo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo</a> &#8212; which has built a platform that can help some of that work more smoothly, by way of a vertically integrated system that includes payment cards, expense management software, and integrated reimbursement and pay-out services &#8212; is announcing a big round of growth funding to expand its business after seeing strong traction.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen-based startup has raised $150 million &#8212; money that it will be using to continue building out more features for its users, and for business development. The round, which sets a record for being the largest Series C for a Danish startup, values Pleo at $1.7 billion, the startup has confirmed.</p>
<p>There are around 17,000 small and medium businesses now using Pleo, with companies at the medium end of that numbering around 1,000 employees. Now with Pleo moving into slightly larger customers (up to 5,000 employees, CEO Jeppe Rindom, said), the startup has set an ambitious target of reaching 1 million users by 2025, a very lucrative goal, considering that expenses management is estimated to be a $80 billion market in Europe (with the global opportunity, of course, even bigger).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It will also be using the funds simply to expand its business. Pleo has around 330 employees today spread across London, Stockholm, Berlin and Madrid, as well as in Copenhagen, and it will be using some of the investment to grow that team and its reach.</p>
<p>Bain Capital Ventures and Thrive Capital co-led this round, a Series C. Previous backers, including Creandum, Kinnevik, Founders, Stripes and Seedcamp, also participated. Stripes led the startup&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/pleo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B in 2019</a>. It looks like this round was oversubscribed: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/expenses-startup-pleo-preps-100m-series-c-funding-launches-new-bill-payments-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original intention</a> had been to raise just $100 million.</p>
<p>Like other business processes, managing expenses and handling company spending has come a long way in the last many years.</p>
<p>Gone are the days where expenses inevitably involved collecting paper receipts and inputting them manually into a system in order to be reimbursed; now, expense management software links up with company-issued cards and taps into a range of automation tools to cut out some of the steps in the process, integrating with a company&#8217;s internal accounting policies to shuffle the process along a little less painfully. And there are a number of companies in this space, from older players like SAP&#8217;s Concur through to startups on the cusp of going public like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expensify</a> as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/appzen-nabs-35m-for-ai-that-audits-expenses-in-real-time-for-non-compliance-and-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger entrants</a> bringing new technology into the process.</p>
<p>But, there is still lots more room for improvement. Rindom, Pleo&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Niccolo Perra, said the pair came up with the idea for Pleo on the back of years of working in fintech &#8212; both were early employees at the B2B supply chain startup Tradeshift &#8212; and seeing first-hand how short-changed, so to speak, small and medium businesses in particular were when it came to tools to handle their expenses.</p>
<p>Pleo&#8217;s approach has been to build, from the ground up, a system for those smaller businesses that integrate all the different stages of how an employee might spend money on behalf of the company.</p>
<p>Pleo starts with physical and virtual payment cards (which can be used in, for example, Apple Wallet) that are issued by Pleo (in partnership with MasterCard) to buy goods and services, which in turn are automatically itemized according to a company&#8217;s internal accounting systems, with the ability to work with e-receipts, but also let people use their phones to snap pictures of receipts when they are only on paper, if required. This is pretty much table stakes for expense software these days, but Pleo&#8217;s platform is going a couple of steps beyond that.</p>
<p>Users (or employers) can integrate a users&#8217; own banking details to make it easier to get reimbursed when they have had to pay for something out of their own pocket; or conversely to pay for something that shouldn&#8217;t have been charged on the card. And if there are invoices to be paid at a later date from the time of purchase, these too can be actioned and set up within Pleo rather than having to liaise separately with an accounts payable department to get those settled. Higher <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced tiers</a> (beyond the basic service for up to five users) also lets a company set spending limits for individual users. Pricing is based on number of users, per month.</p>
<p>Pleo also has built fraud protection services into the platform to detect, for example, cases when a card number might have been compromised and is being used for non-work purposes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s notable is that the startup has built all of the tech that it uses, including the payments feature, from the ground up, to have full control over the features and specifically to be able to add more of them more flexibly over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning we ran with a partner in services like payments, but it didn’t allow us to move fast enough,&#8221; Rindom said in an interview. &#8220;So we decided to take all of that in-house.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems like this opens the door to a lot of possibilities for how Pleo might evolve in the years ahead now that it&#8217;s focused on hyper-growth. However, Rindom added that whatever the next steps might be, they will remain focused on continuing to solve the expenses problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to our infrastructure we use it only for ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have no plans of selling [for example, payments] as a service, even if we do have a lot of other ideas for broadening our offerings.&#8221; Indeed, the ability to pay invoices was launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/expenses-startup-pleo-preps-100m-series-c-funding-launches-new-bill-payments-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in April of this year</a>. &#8220;We come up with things all the time, but will launch only those relevant to customers.&#8221; For now, at least.</p>
<p>That focus and perhaps even more than that the execution and customer traction are what have brought investors around to backing a fintech out of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of work empowers employees with the tools they need to be effective, productive, and successful,&#8221; said Keri Gohman, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Pleo understands this critical shift for modern companies toward employee centricity—providing workers with a fun-to-use spend management app that automatically tracks their corporate spending and generates expense reports, paired with the powerful tools businesses need to create full visibility and management of every penny spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bain has been a pretty active investor in European fintech, also backing GoCardless in its recent round. &#8220;BCV invests in founders who aren&#8217;t afraid to tackle big problems, and Jeppe and Nicco saw a big challenge that employers faced—tracking all corporate spending and reconciling expenses back to the general ledger—and solved it with elegant technology that both employers and employees love,&#8221; added Merritt Hummer, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>Thrive is also a notable backer here, and it will be interesting to see how and if Pleo links up with others in the VC&#8217;s portfolio, which include companies like Plaid, Gong and Trade Republic.</p>
<p>“Pleo has already transformed the way that over 17,000 companies think about managing their expenses, saving them time and lowering costs while increasing transparency,&#8221; noted Kareem Zaki, a general partner at Thrive Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner closely with the Pleo team to help drive their next phase of growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, a flood of ransomware hit hundreds of companies around the world. A grocery store chain, a public broadcaster, schools, and a national railway system were all hit by the file-encrypting malware, causing disruption and forcing hundreds of businesses to close.</p>
<p>The victims had something in common: a key piece of network management and remote control software developed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>. The Miami-headquartered company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/meet-5-cybersecurity-unicorns-that-could-ipo-in-2020/">makes software</a> used to remotely manage a company&#8217;s IT networks and devices. That software is sold to managed service providers — effectively outsourced IT departments — which they then use to manage the networks of their customers, often smaller companies.</p>
<p>But hackers associated with the Russia-linked REvil ransomware-as-a-service group are believed to have used a never-before-seen security vulnerability in the software&#8217;s update mechanism to push ransomware to Kaseya&#8217;s customers, which in turn spread downstream to their customers. Many of the companies who were ultimately victims of the attack may not have known that their networks were monitored by Kaseya&#8217;s software.</p>
<p>Kaseya warned customers on Friday to &#8220;IMMEDIATELY&#8221; shut down their on-premise servers, and its cloud service — though not believed to be affected — was pulled offline as a precaution.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[Kaseya] showed a genuine commitment to do the right thing. Unfortunately, we were beaten by REvil in the final sprint.&#8221; <cite>Security researcher Victor Gevers</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>John Hammond, senior security researcher at Huntress Labs, a threat detection firm that was one of the first to reveal the attack, said about 30 managed service providers were hit, allowing the ransomware to spread to &#8220;well over&#8221; 1,000 businesses.&#8221; Security firm ESET said it knows of victims in 17 countries, including the U.K., South Africa, Canada, New Zealand, Kenya, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Kaseya said <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/">in an update</a> that about 60 Kaseya customers were affected and put the downstream number of victims at fewer than 1,500 companies.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s becoming clearer just how the hackers pulled off one of the biggest ransomware attacks in recent history.</p>
<p>Dutch researchers said they found several zero-day vulnerabilities in Kaseya&#8217;s software as part of an investigation into the security of web-based administrator tools. (Zero-days are named as such since it gives companies zero days to fix the problem.) The bugs were reported to Kaseya and were in the process of being fixed when the hackers struck, said Victor Gevers, who heads the group of researchers, in <a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/04/Kaseya-Case-Update-2/">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Kaseya&#8217;s chief executive Fred Voccola told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-hackers-demand-70-million-to-unlock-computer-in-widespread-attack-11625524076">The Wall Street Journal</a> that its corporate systems were not compromised, lending greater credence to the working theory by security researchers that servers run by Kaseya&#8217;s customers were compromised individually using a common vulnerability.</p>
<p>The company said that all servers running the affected software should stay offline until the patch is ready. Voccola told the paper that it expects patches to be released by late Monday.</p>
<p>The attack began late Friday afternoon, just as millions of Americans were logging off into the long July 4 weekend. Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike&#8217;s senior vice president of intelligence, said the attack was carefully timed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake, the timing and target of this attack are no coincidence. It illustrates what we define as a Big Game Hunting attack, launched against a target to maximize impact and profit through a supply chain during a holiday weekend when business defenses are down,&#8221; said Meyers.</p>
<p>A notice posted over the weekend on a dark web site known to be run by REvil claimed responsibility for the attack, and that the ransomware group would publicly release a decryption tool if it is paid $70 million in bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than a million systems were infected,&#8221; the group claims in the post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Group, Daimler Truck and Volkswagon&#8217;s AG heavy-truck business the Traton Group <a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/news-and-media/news/2021/jul/news-4017125.html">announced</a> on Monday a non-binding agreement to build a network of high-performance public charging stations for electric heavy-duty long-haul trucks and buses around Europe. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/daimler-volvo-traton-plan-600-million-truck-charging-jv-2021-07-05/">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The three major European automakers will invest €500 million (~$593 million USD) to install and operate 1,700 charging points in strategic locations and close to highways. They intend to finalize the agreement by the end of this year and start operations next year, with the hopes of increasing the number of charge points significantly as the companies seek additional partners for the future joint venture.</p>
<p>The venture is meant to be a catalyst to prepare for the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en">European Union&#8217;s goals of carbon-neutral freight transportation by 2050</a>. One of the main deterrents for both individuals and freight companies for switching to EVs has historically been a lack of charging infrastructure. By building that infrastructure, Volvo, Daimler and Traton can also expect to boost their own sales of electric trucks and buses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It is the joint aim of Europe’s truck manufacturers to achieve climate neutrality by 2050,&#8221; Martin Daum, CEO Daimler Truck, said in a statement.  &#8220;However, it is vital that building up the right infrastructure goes hand in hand with putting CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral trucks on the road. Together with Volvo Group and the TRATON GROUP, we are therefore very excited to take this pioneering step to establish a high-performance charging network across Europe.”</p>
<p>The partnership between Volvo and Daimler isn&#8217;t unprecedented. In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/volvo-ag-and-daimler-trucks-team-up-in-hydrogen-fuel-cell-joint-venture/">the two competitors teamed up to produce hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks</a> to lower development costs and boost production volumes. This latest venture is another signal that major companies are banding together to solve climate-related issues in the industry.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-6">European car industry association ACEA has called for up to 50,000 high-performance charging points by 2030. Traton CEO Matthias Gruendler told Reuters that roughly 10 billion euros would be needed to build out Europe&#8217;s infrastructure to be fully electrified by 2050.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-6">According to a statement released by Volvo, this venture is also a call to action for others with a stake in the industry, like automakers or governments, to work together to ensure the rapid expansion needed to reach climate goals.</p>
<p>The charging stations will be brand-agnostic, and battery electric vehicle fleet operators will be able to use both the fast charging during the European 45 minute mandatory rest period for long-distance transport and also charge overnight.</p>
<p>The joint venture will operate under its own corporate identity out of Amsterdam. Volvo, Daimler and Traton will own equal shares in the venture but will continue to compete in all other areas.</p>
