										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sicepat.com/">SiCepat</a>, an end-to-end logistics startup in Indonesia, announced today it has raised a $170 million Series B funding round. Founded in 2014 to provide last-mile deliveries for small merchants, the company has since expanded to serve large e-commerce platforms, too. Its services now also cover warehousing and fulfillment, middle-mile logistics and online distribution.</p>
<p>Investors in SiCepat&#8217;s Series B include Falcon House Partners; Kejora Capital; DEG (the German Development Finance Institution); Telkom Indonesia’s investment arm MDI Ventures; Indies Capital; Temasek Holdings subsidiary Pavilion Capital; Tri Hill; and Daiwa Securities. The company’s last funding announcement was a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/indonesian-logistics-startup-raised-southeast-asias-largest-series-rounds-50m">$50 million Series A in April 2019</a>.</p>
<p>In a press statement, The Kim Hai, founder and chief executive officer of SiCepat&#8217;s parent company Onstar Express, said the funding will be used to &#8220;further fortify SiCepat&#8217;s position as the leading end-to-end logistics service provider in the Indonesian market and potentially to explore expansion to other markets in Southeast Asia.&#8221; SiCepat claims to be profitable already and that it was able to fulfill more than 1.4 million packages per day in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The logistics industry in Indonesia is <a href="http://www.gbgindonesia.com/en/services/article/2013/indonesia_s_logistics_sector.php">highly fragmented</a>, which means higher costs for businesses. At the same time, demand for deliveries is increasing thanks to the growth of e-commerce, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>SiCepat is one of several Indonesian startups that have raised funding recently to make the supply chain and logistics infrastructure more efficient. For example, earlier this week, supply chain SaaS provider Advotics announced a $2.75 million round. Other notable startups in the space include Kargo, founded by a former Uber Asia executive, and Waresix.</p>

<p>SiCepat focuses in particular on e-commerce and social commerce, or people who sell goods through their social media networks. In statement, Kejora Capital managing partner Sebastian Togelang, said the Indonesian e-commerce market is expected to grow at five-year compounded annual growth rate of 21%, reaching $82 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe SiCepat is ideally positioned to serve customers from e-commerce giants to uprising social commerce players which contribute an estimated 25% to the total digital commerce economy,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Insurance agents spend hours handling paperwork and grabbing client information over the phone. A new seed-stage startup, <a href="https://www.insurgrid.com/">InsurGrid</a>, has developed a software solution to help ease the process, and make it easier for agents to serve existing clients &#8212; and secure new ones.</p>
<p>InsurGrid gives agents a personalized platform to collect information from clients, such as date of birth, driver’s license information and policy declaration. This platform helps agents avoid sitting on long calls or managing back-to-back emails, and instead gives them one spot to understand how all their different clients function. It is starting with property and casualty management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup integrates with 85 insurance carriers, serving as the software layer instead of the provider. Using the InsurGrid platform, insurers can ask clients to upload information and within seconds be registered as a policyholder. This essentially turns into a living Rolodex that insurers can use to access information on the account, and offer quotes on a faster rate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121451" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121451" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121451 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png" alt="" width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png 4170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=1536,884 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=2048,1179 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/InsurGrid-TC-Main-Photo-no-logo.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121451" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: InsurGrid</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a monetary benefit in providing better service. Eden Insurance, a customer of InsurGrid, said that people who submit information through the platform converted at an 82% higher rate than those who don’t. Jeremy Eden, the agency owner of Eden Insurance, said they were able to show consumers that its plan was $300 cheaper than its existing rate.</p>
<p>At the heart of InsurGrid is a bet from the founding team that legacy insurance agents aren’t going anywhere. Co-founder/CEO Chase Beach pointed out that the majority of the $684 billion of annual property and casualty insurance premiums in the United States is distributed by approximately 800,000 agents working in 16,000 brokerages. So far, InsurGrid works with more than 150 of those agencies.</p>
<p>When asked if InsurGrid ever had plans to offer its own insurance, similar to insurtech giants Hippo, Lemonade and Root, Beach said that it is solely working on innovating around the sales process for now. He said that these big companies, which have either recently gone public or are planning to, still rely on agents to be successful.</p>
<p>“Instead of us replacing the insurance agent, what if we gave them that same level of technology of a Hippo or large carrier,” Beach said. “And provide them with the digital experiences so they can compete in 2021.”</p>
<p>As time goes on, he sees insurance agents taking the same role that financial advisors or real estate agents take: “very much involved in the process because they are that expert.”</p>
<p>Other startups that have popped up in this space include Gabi, Trellis and Canopy Connect. The differentiator, the team sees, is that Beach comes from a 144-year-old insurance legacy, giving him key insights on how to sell to agents in a successful and effective way. It is starting with sales, but expect InsurGrid to expand to other parts of the insurance process as well.</p>
<p>To help them compete with new and old startups, InsurGrid recently raised $1.3 million in pre-seed financing to help it fulfill its goal to be the “underdog for the underdogs,” Beach said. Investors include Engineering Capital, Hustle Fund, Vess Capital, Sahil Lavingia and Trevor Kienzle.</p>

<p>Backing the company is Blossom Capital, Creandum and Index Ventures, with Dija seemingly able to raise pre-launch. In fact, there are already rumours swirling around London&#8217;s venture capital community that the upstart may be out raising again already &#8212; a figure up to £100 million was mooted by one source &#8212; as the race to become the early European leader in the burgeoning &#8220;dark&#8221; grocery store space heats up.<div id="attachment_2121153" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121153" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121153 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delivery-Bag_DIJA.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dija</p></div></p>
<p>Over the last few months, a host of European startups have launched with the promise of delivering grocery and other convenience store items within 10-15 minutes of ordering. They do this by building out their own hyper-local, delivery-only fulfilment centres &#8212; so-called &#8220;dark stores&#8221; &#8212; and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt. The company didn&#8217;t break out the equity-debt split, though one source told me the equity component was roughly half and half.</p>
<p>Others in the space include Berlin’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, London’s Jiffy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a>, all of which also claim to focus on fresh food and groceries. There’s also the likes of <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which is still in stealth and more focused on a potentially higher-margin convenience store offering similar to U.S. unicorn goPuff. Related: goPuff itself is also looking to expand into Europe and is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">in talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>, which some have dubbed a mini goPuff.</p>

<p>However, let&#8217;s get back to Dija. Founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions, the company has opened up shop in central London and promises to let you order groceries and other convenience products within 10 minutes. It has hubs in South Kensington, Fulham and Hackney, and says it plans to open 20 further hubs, covering central London and Zone 2, by the summer. Each hub carries around 2,000 products, claiming to be sold at &#8220;recommended retail prices&#8221;. A flat delivery fee of £1.99 is charged per order.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only competitors that we are focused on are the large supermarket chains who dominate a global $12 trillion industry,&#8221; Dija&#8217;s Menolascina tells me when I ask about competitors. &#8220;What really sets us apart from them, besides our speed and technology, is our team, who all have a background in growing and disrupting this industry, including myself and Yusuf, who built and scaled Deliveroo from the ground up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Menolascina was previously director of Corporate Strategy and Development at the takeout delivery behemoth and held several positions before that. He also co-founded Everli (formerly Supermercato24), the Instacart-styled grocery delivery company in Italy, and also worked at Just Eat. Saban is the former chief of staff to CEO at Deliveroo and also worked at investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>During Dija&#8217;s soft-launch, Menolascina says that typical customers have been doing their weekly food shop using the app, and also fulfilling other needs, such as last-minute emergencies or late night cravings. &#8220;The pain points Dija is helping to solve are universal and we built Dija to be accessible to everyone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It’s why we offer products at retail prices, available in 10 minutes &#8212; combining value and convenience. Already, Dija is becoming a key service for parents who are pressed for time working from home and homeschooling, as one example&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite the millions of dollars being pumped into the space, a number of VCs I&#8217;ve spoken to privately are skeptical that fresh groceries with near instant delivery can be made to work. The thinking is that fresh food perishes, margins are lower and basket sizes won&#8217;t be large enough to cover the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be the case for other companies, but almost everyone at Dija comes from this industry and knows exactly what they are doing, from buying and merchandising to data and marketing,&#8221; Menolascina says, pushing back. &#8220;It’s also worth pointing out that we are a full-stack model, so we’re not sharing our margin with other parties. In terms of the average basket size, it varies depending on the customer&#8217;s need. On one hand, we have customers who do their entire grocery shop through Dija, while on the other hand, our customers depend on us for emergency purchases e.g. nappies, batteries etc.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Z9TqfKn72h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">Delivery company goPuff is in talks to acquire the UK&#8217;s Fancy</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On pricing, he says that, like any retail business, Dija buys products at wholesale prices and sells them at recommended retail prices. &#8220;Going forward, we have a clear roadmap on how we generate additional revenue, including strategic partnerships, supply chain optimisation and technology enhancements,&#8221; adds Menolascina.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that prior to launching its own app, Dija ran a number of experiments on takeout marketplace Deliveroo, including selling various convenience store items, such as potato chips and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. If you&#8217;ve ever ordered toiletry products from &#8220;Baby &amp; Me Pharmacy&#8221; or purchased chocolate sweets from &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Vows,&#8221; you have likely and unknowingly shopped at Dija. Those brands, and a number of others, all delivered from the same address in South Kensington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going direct to consumer without properly testing pick &amp; pack is a big risk,&#8221; Menolascina told me in a WhatsApp message a few weeks ago, confirming the Deliveroo tests. &#8220;We created disposable virtual brands purely to learn what to sell and how to replenish, pick &amp; pack, and deliver&#8221;.</p>

<p>Square announced this morning that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">purchased a majority stake in Tidal</a>, the music streaming service founded by Jay-Z. It sounds like an odd fit at first, which Square CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged in a tweet asking, &#8220;Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His answer: &#8220;It comes down to a simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work. New ideas are found at the intersections, and we believe there’s a compelling one between music and the economy. Making the economy work for artists is similar to what Square has done for sellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Square is paying $297 million in cash and stock for the deal, which will result in Jay-Z joining Square&#8217;s board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">it was acquiring Auth0</a> yesterday for $6.5 billion, the deal raised eyebrows. After all, it&#8217;s a substantial amount of money for one identity and access management (IAM) company to pay to buy another, similar entity. But the deal ultimately brings together two companies that come at identity from different sides of the market &#8212; and as such could be the beginning of a beautiful identity friendship.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The deal ultimately brings together two companies that come at identity from different sides of the market &#8212; and as such could be the beginning of a beautiful identity friendship.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On a simple level, Okta delivers identity and access management (IAM) to companies who use the service to provide single-sign-on access for employees to a variety of cloud services &#8212; think Gmail, Salesforce, Slack and Workday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://auth0.com">Auth0</a> is a developer tool providing coders with easy API access to single-sign-on functionality. With just a couple of lines of code, the developer can deliver IAM tooling without having to build it themselves. It’s a similar value proposition to what Twilio offers for communications or Stripe for payments.</p>
<p>The thing about IAM is that it’s not exciting, but it is essential. That could explain why such a large number of dollars are exchanging hands. As Auth0 co-founder and CEO Eugenio Pace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/">told TechCrunch’s Zack Whittacker</a> in 2019, “Nobody cares about authentication, but everybody needs it.”</p>
<p>Putting the two companies together generates a fairly comprehensive approach to IAM covering back end to front end. We’re going to look at why this deal matters from an identity market perspective, and if it was worth the substantial price Okta paid to get Auth0.</p>
<h2>Halt! Who goes there?</h2>
<p>When you think about identity and access management, it’s about making sure you are who you say you are, and that you have the right to enter and access a set of applications. That’s why it’s a key part of any company’s security strategy.</p>
<p>Gartner found that IAM was a $12 billion business last year with projected growth to over $13.5 billion in 2021. To give you a sense of where Okta and Auth0 fit, Okta just closed FY2021 with over $800 million in revenue. Meanwhile Auth0 is projected to close this year with $200 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>

<p>Among the top players in this market according to <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/access-management-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant/?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpLGH3w8bVX7Ef3yCO0qSXSiLhb4rVHEdcjcI93oRewG942kAAWxH0BoCEIMQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_campaign=search_google_amer_multiple_ao_it_nb-priority_bmm&amp;utm_content=482009063244&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_page={url}&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=%2Biam%20%2Bmagic%20%2Bquadrant">Gartner’s November 2020 Magic Quadrant</a> market analysis are Ping Identity, Microsoft and Okta in that order. Meanwhile Gartner listed Auth0 as a key challenger in their market grid.</p>
<p>Michael Kelly, a Gartner analyst, told TechCrunch that Okta and Auth0 are both gaining something from the deal.</p>
<p>“For Okta, while they have a very good product, they have marketing muscle and adoption rates that are not available to smaller vendors like Auth0. When having [IAM] conversations with clients, Okta is almost always on the short list. Auth0 will immediately benefit from being associated with the larger Okta brand, and Okta will likewise now have credibility in the deals that involve a heavy developer focused buyer,” Kelly told me.</p>
<p>Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon said he was enthusiastic about the deal precisely because of the complementary nature of the two companies’ approaches to identity. “How a developer interacts with the service, and the flexibility they need is different from how the CIO wants to work with [identity]. So by giving customers this choice and support, it&#8217;s really compelling,” McKinnon explained.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s no overstating it: 2020 was a hell of a year. When future generations learn about 2020, the pandemic, social tension and political unrest will take up most of the oxygen. But for those learning about the history of cybersecurity, 2020 and a midsize company from Austin, Texas — SolarWinds — will take center stage.</p>
<p>Malicious code in one update of a trusted software provider was the Trojan horse that enabled access to petabytes of private data across <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-russia-sanctions-solarwinds-hacks/2021/02/23/b77039d6-71fa-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html">18,000 organizations</a>, including Fortune 500s and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">government entities</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Every business leader must acknowledge what many in cybersecurity have been saying — cyber strategy is company strategy.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Why will SolarWinds be so generationally important, and why am I talking about it? Because the large (and growing) impact of the hack and the substantial (and mounting) losses mean that every business leader must acknowledge what many in cybersecurity have been saying — cyber strategy <em>is</em> company strategy. It is not an audit, but an important part of C-suite strategies and best practices ranging from employee onboarding to mundane everyday coding.</p>
<p>I believe generational startups will be created from this reckoning with cybersecurity, just as they’ve been created coming out of market disruptions in the past. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karanortman/2020/07/15/why-the-merging-of-the-devops-driven-cloud-and-cyber-security-will-create-dozens-of-new-category-leaders/?sh=7810663d347f">I’ve been thinking about this for a while</a>, but it is more clear than ever that we will see cyber go on a tear this next decade.</p>
<p>Forecasts suggest $100 billion of new market value by 2025 alone, putting total market size at close to $280 billion, but I think this figure is conservative. Cyber is — and will be — a massive business.</p>
<p>One key driver of growth in the cyber market is really easy to understand, but really hard to solve for: data. Cyber is often a second-order value proposition, after speed of development, managing IT assets or data. We’re familiar with the idea that “data is the new oil.” Since that phrase was coined by mathematician Clive Humby 15 years ago, the total amount of data in the world has increased 74x.</p>
<p>By 2025, IDC <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2018/11/27/175-zettabytes-by-2025/?sh=224587055459">forecasts</a> the data universe will consist of 175 zettabytes. In case you don’t know, one zettabyte is <em>1</em> <em>trillion</em> gigabytes. If you were to download 175 zettabytes of data on your computer, it would take you 1.8 billion years. Mind-boggling!</p>
<p>And it only increases exponentially from here. From likes, posts, profile views, follows and RTs for end consumers to time on site, conversion rate and bounce rate for websites to events, errors and anomaly tracking in IoT — all of this data is logged and tracked. We’ve seen billion-dollar companies built, taken public and acquired that ingest and visualize all of the data we capture.</p>
<p>The next generation of API startups is valuable proportionally to their ability to “talk” with apps in the ecosystem by sharing and ingesting data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For founder Najette Fellache, coming to the Bay Area a few years ago from Nantes, France was a way to grow a company she&#8217;d founded and which was already beginning to count major U.S. corporations like GE, Tesla, Amazon, and Medtronics as customers.</p>
<p>What that six-year-old outfit, <a href="https://speach.me/">Speach</a>, sells is essentially knowledge-sharing between colleagues via videos produced by the employees themselves, often to augment written instructions. The idea is to maximize learning, fast, and investors liked it enough to provide Speach with $14 million in funding.</p>
<p>But while the technology has only become more relevant in a world shut down by COVID-19, an internal project within the company began to interest Fellache even more after her children abruptly began attending school remotely from home. As she tells it, her aha moment came in the form of a drawing from her youngest son, who struggled to understand why his mother&#8217;s meetings kept taking precedent over him.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121261" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121261" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121261 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Weet.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121261" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit:</strong> Najette Fellache</p></div></p>
<p>Like many parents trying to figure out how to balance work and family over the last year, Fellache wasn&#8217;t immediately sure of how to parent around the clock while also leading a company. Unlike a lot of parents, she had access to engineers who could create a technology that enabled her, along with other members of Speach&#8217;s team, to make short videos that could quickly communicate important information and be viewed at the recipient&#8217;s convenience &#8212; as well as saved for future reference.</p>
<p>In fact, as sometimes happens with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/"> internal projects</a>, the technology worked so well for Speach that it has since taken on a life of its own. Indeed, using a bit of that earlier funding from Speach &#8212; its backers are Alven and Red River West, a fund co-managed by Artémis, the investment company of the Pinault family &#8212; Fellache and a team of 10 employees this week launched <a href="https://beeweet.com/">Weet</a>, a new asynchronous video startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y3ReoJo529"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/">The Slack origin story</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Slack origin story&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/embed/#?secret=y3ReoJo529" data-secret="y3ReoJo529" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s entering a crowded field. Fellache is hardly alone in recognizing the power of asynchronous meetings as an attractive alternative to phone calls, real-time meetings and even email, where tone is often lost and content can be misconstrued. <a href="https://www.loom.com/login">Loom</a>, for example, a six-year-old enterprise collaboration video messaging service that enables users to send short clips of themselves, has already raised at least $73 million from investors, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Coatue.</p>
<p>Another, newer entrant is <a href="https://supernormal.com/">SuperNormal</a>, a year-old, Stockholm, Sweden-based work communication platform that employs video and screen recording tools to help teams create and send asynchronous video updates throughout the day and which raised <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/supernormal-funding/">$2 million</a> in seed funding led by EQT Ventures in December.</p>
<p>Still, if you believe that the future of work is remote, it&#8217;s clear that the opportunity here is a big one. Further, Weet &#8212; which is accessible for free via a browser extension and whose integrations with both Slack and Microsoft Teams are scheduled to go live next month &#8212; is fast becoming a better product than some of what&#8217;s available in the market already, says Fellache.</p>
<p>Weet already features instant recording, screen sharing, virtual backgrounds, video filters, emoji reactions, commenting options and auto transcription. For a premium paid version in the works, it is also developing features that will make it easier to organize discussions for users. Imagine, for example, a salesperson looking for communications about a potential client and wanting notes from those auto-transcriptions that are presented together in one email to that individual.</p>
<p>As for privacy, Fellache points to the data management expertise that Speach has developed over time working with clients like Airbus and Colgate-Palmolive that are acutely mindful of privacy. Weet &#8212; which Fellache says is already being used by units inside Colgate-Palmolive &#8212; employs the same standards and practices.</p>
<p>Weet is seemingly taking a different approach on the marketing front, too. Fellache says while some rivals enable users to publish one video at a time, Weet is a more conversational tool where teammates and contacts can create sections of the same video for a back-and-forth, sending video feedback, audio feedback, sharing their screen or reacting with emoticons.</p>
<p>Put another way, Weet enables not only the exchange of more critical information but can invite more interaction broadly and, presumably, strengthen team relationships in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a discussion, not a transaction,&#8221; Fellache offers, and that&#8217;s important, she suggests. As she has seen firsthand, in a world where teams are increasingly scattered around the globe, open communication is more central than ever to a company&#8217;s success &#8212; and that of its employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not uncommon these days to hear of U.S.-based investors backing Latin American startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not every day that we hear of Latin American VCs investing in U.S.-based startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkeley-based fintech Flourish has raised $1.5 million in a funding round led by Brazilian venture capital firm Canary. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Pedro Moura and Jessica Eting, the startup offers an “engagement and financial wellness” solution for banks, fintechs and credit unions with the goal of helping them engage and retain clients.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also participating in the round were Xochi Ventures, First Check Ventures, Magma Capital and GV Angels as well as strategic angels including Rodrigo Xavier (former Bank of America CEO in Brazil), Beth Stelluto (formerly of Schwab), Gustavo Lasala (president and CEO of The People Fund) and Brian Requarth (founder of Viva Real). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With clients in the U.S., Bolivia and Brazil, Flourish has developed a solution that features three main modules: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rewards engine designed to incentivize users to save or invest money.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An intelligent and automated micro-savings feature where users can create personalized rules (such as transferring $15 into a rainy day fund every time their favorite sports team wins).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A financial knowledge module, where personal financial transactions and spending patterns are turned into a question and answer game. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., Flourish began by testing end-user mechanics with organizations such as CommonWealth and Opportunity Fund. In 2019, it released a B2C version of the Flourish app (c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alled the Flourish Savings App)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a pilot for its banking platform, which can integrate with banks through an SDK or an API. It is also now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">licensing its engagement technology to banks, retailers and fintechs across the Americas.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flourish has piloted or licensed its solution to U.S.-based credit unions, Sicoob (Brazil&#8217;s largest credit union) and BancoSol in Bolivia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup makes money through a partnership model that focuses on user activation and engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both immigrants, Moura and Eting met while in the MBA program at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. Moura came to the U.S. from Brazil as a teen, while Eting is the daughter of a Filiponio father and mother of Mexican descent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair bonded on their joint mission of building a business that empowered people to create positive money habits and understand their finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the 11-person team works out of the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. It plans to use its new capital to increase its number of customers in LatAm, do more hiring and develop new functionalities for the Flourish platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, it plans to next focus on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian market, and will scale in a few select countries in the Americas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are three things that make Latin America, and more specifically Brazil, attractive to us at this moment,” Moura said. “Currently, the B2B financial technology market is still in its nascency. This combined with open banking regulation and the need for more responsible products provides Flourish a unique opportunity in Brazil.”</span><b></b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining company culture when the majority of staff is working remotely is a challenge for every organization &#8212; big and small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an issue, even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID. But it’s become an even bigger problem with so many employees working from home. Employers have to be careful that workers don’t feel disconnected and isolated from the rest of the company and that morale stays high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="http://www.workvivo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workvivo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cork, Ireland-based employee experience startup that is backed by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoom founder Eric Yuan and Tiger Global that has steadily grown over 200% over the past year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company works with organizations ranging in size from 100 employees to over 100,000 and boasts more than 500,000 users. According to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO and co-founder John </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goulding, it’s had 100% retention since it launched. Customers include Telus International, Kentech, A+E Networks and Seneca Gaming Corp., among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Goulding and Joe Lennon in 2017, Workvivo launched its employee communication platform in mid-2018 with the goal of helping</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies create “an engaging virtual workplace” and replace the outdated intranet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not about real time, we’re more asynchronous communication,” Goulding explained. “We have a lot of transactional tools, and typically carry the bigger message about what’s going on in a company and what positive things are happening. We’re more focused on human connection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Workvivo, companies can provide information like CEO updates, recognition for employees via a social style &#8212; “more things that shape the culture so workers can get a real sense of what’s happening in an organization.” It launched podcasts in the second quarter and livestreaming in Q4.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Workvivo, a platform for employee culture, raises a $16M Series A from Tiger Global&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/workvivo-a-platform-for-employee-culture-raises-a-16m-series-a-from-tiger-global/embed/#?secret=zHcn6MTEbA" data-secret="zHcn6MTEbA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Workvivo showed its product to Zoom’s Yuan, who ended up becoming one of the company’s first investors. Then in May of 2020, the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/workvivo-a-platform-for-employee-culture-raises-a-16m-series-a-from-tiger-global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $16 million in a Series A funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Tiger Global, which is best known for large growth-oriented rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workvivo, which was built out long before the COVID-19 pandemic, found itself in an opportune place last year. And demand for its offering has reflected that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since COVID hit, growth has accelerated,” Goulding told TechCrunch. “We grew three times in size over where we were before the pandemic started, in terms of revenue, users, customers and employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SaaS operator’s deals range from $50,000 to close to $1 million a year, he said. Workvivo is Europe-based and operates in 82 countries. But the majority of its customers are located in the U.S. with 80% of its growth coming from the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup opened an office in San Francisco in early </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020, which it is expanding. Thirty percent of its 65-person team is currently U.S.-based, with some working remotely from other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Workvivo would not reveal hard revenue figures, Goulding only said it’s not seeking additional funding anytime soon considering the company is “in a very strong capital position.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the same problem, Microsoft last month </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched Viva, its new “employee experience platform,” or, in non-marketing terms, its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/microsoft-launches-viva-its-new-take-on-the-old-intranet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new take</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the intranet sites most large companies tend to offer their employees. With the move, Microsoft is taking on the likes of Facebook’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace platform and Jive in addition to Workvivo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the increasingly crowded space, Workvivo believes it has an advantage over competitors in that it integrates well with Slack and Zoom.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HAou9G7857"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/microsoft-launches-viva-its-new-take-on-the-old-intranet/">Microsoft launches Viva, its new take on the old intranet</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft launches Viva, its new take on the old intranet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/microsoft-launches-viva-its-new-take-on-the-old-intranet/embed/#?secret=HAou9G7857" data-secret="HAou9G7857" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re sitting alongside Slack and Zoom in the ecosystem,” Goulding said. “There’s Zoom, Slack and us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack is real-time messaging and what’s happening in the immediate future, and Zoom is real-time video and “about the moment,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Goulding, Microsoft’s new offering is unproven yet and a reactionary move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s obvious there’s a battle to be won for the center of the digital workplace,” he said. “We’re here to capture the heartbeat of an organization, not pulses.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With most of us locked into a square video box on platforms like Zoom, the desire to break away and perhaps wander around a virtual space is strong. These new ways of presenting people — as small circles of videos placed in a virtual space where they can move around — has appeared in various forms, like &#8220;virtual bars&#8221; for the last few months during global pandemic lockdowns. Hey, I even went to a few virtual bars myself! Although the drinks from my fridge could have been better.</p>
<p>The advantage of this spatial approach is it gives a lot more &#8220;agency&#8221; to the user. You feel, at least, a <em>bit</em> more in control, as you can make a &#8220;physical&#8221; choice as to where you go, even if it is only still a virtual experience.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://spatial.chat/">SpatialChat</a>, one of the first startups with that approach that launched on ProductHunt in April last year, is upping the game with a new design and the feature of persistent chats. The product debuted on ProductHunt on April 20, 2020, and rose to No. 3 app of the day. The web-based platform has been bootstrapped by the founders with their own resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpatialChat is now adding a special tier and features for teams running town hall meetings and virtual offices and says it currently has more than 3,000 organizations as paying customers, with more than 200,000 total monthly active users.</p>
<p>The startup is part of a virtual networking space being populating by products such as<a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com"> Teamflow</a>, <a href="https://gather.town">Gather</a> and <a href="https://remo.co">Remo</a>. Although it began as an online networking events service, it&#8217;s now trying to reposition as a forum for multigroup discussions, all the way up from simple stand-up meetings to online conferences.</p>
<p>SpatialChat uses a mix of &#8220;proximity&#8221; video chats, screen sharing and rooms for up to 50 people. It’s now putting in pricing plans for regular, weekly, and one-time use cases. It says it’s seen employees at Sony, Panasonic, Sega, LinkedIn, Salesforce and McKinsey, as well as educators and staff at 108 American universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Yale and MIT, use the platform.</p>
<p>Almas Abulkhairov, CEO and co-founder of SpatialChat says: “Slack, Zoom and Microsoft Teams represent a virtual office for many teams but most of our customers say these apps aren’t a good fit for that. They don’t provide the same serendipity of thought you get working shoulder to shoulder and &#8216;Zoom fatigue&#8217; became a term for a reason. We want to bring the best from offline work.”</p>
<p>Konstantin Krasov, CPO at Data Souls, who used the platform, said: “We had 2,500 people in attendance during a two-day event that we hosted for our community of 50,000 data scientists. SpatialChat enabled us to make a cool networking event, Q&amp;A and AMA with thought leaders in data science.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera, an online education platform that has seen its business grow amid the coronavirus pandemic, is planning to file paperwork tomorrow for its initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter say. The company has been talking to underwriters since last year, but tomorrow could mark its first legal step in the process to IPO.</p>
<p>The Mountain View-based business, founded in 2012, was last valued at $2.4 billion in the private markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/">during a Series F fundraising event in July 2020.</a> Bloomberg pegs Coursera’s latest valuation<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/online-education-firm-coursera-is-said-to-weigh-2021-ipo#:~:text=Coursera%20Inc.%20is%20considering%20an,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter.&amp;text=Get%20insights%20from%20reporters%20around%20the%20world%20in%20the%20Fully%20Charged%20newsletter."> at $5 billion. </a></p>
<p>The latest financing event brought its cash balance to $300 million, right around the money that Chegg had before it went public. Coursera CEO Jeff Maggioncalda did confirm then that the company is eyeing an eventual IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coursera has had a busy pandemic. Similar to Udemy, another massive open online course provider planning to go public, Coursera added an enterprise arm to its business. It launched Coursera for Campus to help colleges bring on online courses (credit optional) with built-in exams; more than 3,700 schools across the world are using the software. It is unclear how much money this operation has brought in, but we know that Udemy for Business is nearing $200 million in annual recurring revenue. In February, the company announced that it has received B Corp. certification, which means that it hits high standards for social and environmental performance. It also converted to a public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>GSV, a venture capital firm that exclusively backs edtech companies, had its largest position of its first fund in Coursera. GSV announced a $180 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/gsv-ventures-doubles-assets-managed-with-new-fund-focused-on-global-edtech/">million Fund II yesterday. </a></p>
<p>It makes sense that edtech companies want to go public while the markets remain hot and remote education continues to be a central way that instruction is delivered. Other companies from the sector that have gone public in recent weeks include Nerdy and Skillsoft, two companies that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> used a SPAC</a> to make their public debuts. Once &#8211; and if &#8211; Coursera does go public, it will join these newbies as well as the long-time edtech public companies including 2U, Chegg, and K12 Inc, and Zovio Solutions.</p>
<p>Coursera declined to comment.</p>
<p><em>Update: The previous version of this story stated that Skillshare has gone public. This is incorrect. Skillsoft has gone public. An update to reflect this change has been made.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I first wrote about <a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">February of last year</a>, they were just getting started. Aiming to be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/goat/">GOAT</a> of collectible toys, they were focusing first on being the go-to trusted spot for buying and selling authenticated Funko Pop figurines.</p>
<p>A few months later, as they expanded into categories like pins and Pokémon cards, the company started to build out a live shopping platform — think of something along the lines of a TV shopping network, but swap out the studios and camera crews for folks at home with iPhones selling to an audience of fellow collectors. The concept had already proven popular in China and was starting to gain traction amongst buyers of collectibles in the U.S. But a good chunk of those U.S. livestreams were happening on Instagram Live, which isn&#8217;t really built for things like bidding or handling payments after a sale occurs. Whatnot saw a gap in the market and wanted to fill it.</p>
<p>It seems that move is working out well for the team. At the end of 2020, Whatnot raised a $4 million seed round; just a few months later, building on the momentum of its live shopping platform and looking to expand into many more categories of collectibles, it has raised another $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company tells me that this Series A round was led by Connie Chan of Andreessen Horowitz, and backed by YC, Wonder Ventures, Operator Partners, Scribble Ventures, Steve Aoki and Chris Zarou.</p>
<p>Whatnot continues to offer a more traditional, nonlivestreamed selling platform — but co-founder Grant LaFontaine tells me about &#8220;95%&#8221; of the team&#8217;s focus is on the livestream side of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;People really come to us for the live, but then they&#8217;re like, &#8216;Eh, I don&#8217;t want to sell across 10 different platforms&#8217; so we give them the tools to be a one-stop shop,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>As I wrote back in December, one increasingly popular type of livestream on Whatnot is the &#8220;card break&#8221;, wherein:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users pool their money to buy an entire box of trading card packs — often boxes that are no longer being produced and can cost thousands of dollars to obtain. Each user gets a number, each number tied to a pack (or packs) within the box. Each pack is opened on the livestream, its contents sent to the (hopefully?) lucky owner tied to that pack’s number.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why raise more money? LaFontaine tells me it&#8217;s to help them expand into more categories, fast. The company currently focuses primarily on Pokémon cards, Funko Pops, FigPins and sports cards, but they mention things like comic books, video games and vintage hardware as natural fits. Diving into a new category means building up a community for it, convincing trusted sellers to hop on their platform and marketing to the right buyers to make it worthwhile. In time, LaFontaine tells me, the team expects to cover 100+ categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A lot of our communication these days with each other is digital, and today one of the companies enabling that &#8212; with APIs to build chat experiences into apps &#8212; is announcing a round of funding on the back of some very strong growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://getstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream</a>, which lets developers build chat and activity streams into apps and other services by way of a few lines of code, has raised $38 million, funding that it will be using to continue building out its existing business as well as to work on new features.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stream started out with APIs for activity feeds, and then it expanded to chat, which today can be integrated into apps built on a variety of platforms. Currently, its customers integrate third-party chatbots and use Dolby for video and audio within Stream, but over time, these are all areas where Stream itself would like to do more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;End-to-end encryption, chatbots: We want to take as many components as we can,&#8221; said Thierry Schellenbach, the CEO who co-founded the startup with the startup&#8217;s CTO Tommaso Barbugli in Amsterdam in 2015 (the startup still has a substantial team in Amsterdam headed by Barbugli, but its headquarters is now in Boulder, Colorado, where Schellenbach eventually moved).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2121181" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121181" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg 1929w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=768,567 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=680,502 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=1536,1134 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ThierryTommaso-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121181" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://getstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company already has amassed a list of notable customers, including Ikea-owned TaskRabbit, NBC Sports, Unilever, Delivery Hero, Gojek, eToro and Stanford University, as well as a number of others that it&#8217;s not disclosing across healthcare, education, finance, virtual events, dating, gaming and social. Together, the apps Stream powers cover more than 1 billion users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Series B round is being led by Felicis Ventures’ Aydin Senkut, with previous backers GGV Capital and 01 Advisors (the fund co-founded by Twitter’s former CEO and COO, Dick Costolo and Adam Bain) also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alongside them, a mix of previous and new individual and smaller investors also participated: Olivier Pomel, CEO of Datadog; Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Amsterdam-based Knight Capital; Johnny Boufarhat, founder and CEO of Hopin; and Selcuk Atli, co-founder and CEO of social gaming app Bunch (itself having raised a notable <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200917005244/en/Bunch-Closes-20-Million-Series-A-Financing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">round of $20 million led by General Catalyst</a> not long ago).</p>
<p dir="ltr">That list is a notable indicator of what kinds of startups are also quietly working with Stream.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is not disclosing its valuation but said c<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">hat revenue grew by 500% in 2020. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, the Series B speaks of a moment of opportunity: It is coming only about six months after the startup raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/stream-whose-apis-help-product-teams-build-chat-and-activity-feeds-fast-just-raised-a-15-million-series-a-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $15 million</a>, and in fact Stream wasn&#8217;t looking to raise right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We were not planning to raise funding until later this year but then Aydin reached out to us and made it hard to say no,&#8221; Schellenbach said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;More than anything else, they are building on the platforms in the tech that matters,&#8221; Senkut added in an interview, noting that its users were attesting to a strong return on investment. &#8220;It&#8217;s rare to see a product so critical to customers and scaling well. It&#8217;s just uncapped capability&#8230; and we want to be a part of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That moment of opportunity is not one that Stream is pursuing on its own.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the more significant of the many players in the world of API-based communications services like messaging, activity streams &#8212; those consolidated updates you get in apps that tell you when people have responded to a post of yours or new content has landed that is relevant to you, or that you have a message, and so on &#8212; and chat include SendBird, Agora, PubNub, Twilio and Sinch, all of which have variously raised substantial funding, found a lot of traction with customers, or are positioning themselves as consolidators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That may speak of competition, but it also points to the vast market there for the tapping.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, one of the reasons companies like Stream are doing so well right now is because of what they have built and the market demand for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Communications services like Stream&#8217;s might be best compared to what companies like Adyen (another major tech force out of Amsterdam), Stripe, Rapyd, Mambu and others are doing in the world of fintech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with something like payments, the mechanics of building, for example, chat functionality can be complex, usually requiring the knitting together of an array of services and platforms that do not naturally speak to each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, something like an activity feed or a messaging feature is central to how a lot of apps work, even if they are not the core feature of the product itself. One good example of how that works are food ordering and delivery apps: they are not by their nature &#8220;chat apps&#8221; but they need to have a chat option in them for when you do need to communicate with a driver or a restaurant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Putting those forces together, it&#8217;s pretty logical that we&#8217;d see the emergence of a range of tech companies that both have done the hard work of building the mechanics of, say, a chat service, and making that accessible by way of an API to those who want to use it, with APIs being one of the more central and standard building blocks in apps today; and a surge of developers keen to get their hands on those APIs to build that functionality into their apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What Stream is working on is not to be confused with the customer-service focused services that companies like Zendesk or Intercom are building when they talk about chat for apps. Those can be specialized features in themselves that link in with CRM systems and customer services teams and other products for marketing analytics and so on. Instead, Stream&#8217;s focus are services for consumers to talk to other consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is a trend worth watching is whether easy-to-integrate services like Stream&#8217;s might signal the proliferation of more social apps over time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There is already at least one key customer &#8212; which I am now allowed to name &#8212; that is a steadily growing, still young social app, which has built the core of its service on Stream&#8217;s API.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hepster.com/">Hepster</a>, an insurtech platform from Germany, has raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Element Ventures. Also participating was Seventure Partners, MBMV and GPS Ventures, as well as previous investors. The funds will be used to broaden the Hepster insurance ecosystem and scale up its network, with an emphasis on automation.</p>
<p>The German insurance market is famously slow at adopting new practices, and Hepster is part of a new wave of insurtech startups in the country taking advantage of this. It allows businesses to build insurance policies from scratch, matched specifically to the needs of their individual service or industry. E-commerce players, for instance, can then embed these insurance products into the e-commerce journey.</p>
<p>Its products are therefore better suited to the new sector of, for example, shared e-bike schemes and peer-to-peer rental platforms, which are rarely covered by traditional brokers in Germany. However, it also caters to traditional, established industries as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now has more than 700 partners, including European bike retailers and rental companies Greenstorm Mobility and Baron Mobility, as well as Berlin-based cargo bike provider Citkar and Munich e-bike startup SUSHI.</p>
<p>Christian Range, Hepster co-founder and CEO, said in a statement: “Hepster is now a key player within the European insurance market. Our state-of-the-art technology with our API-driven ecosystem, as well as our highly service-oriented approach, sets us apart.”</p>
<p>In an interview he told me: “Germany is the toughest market with the most regulations, the most laws. We have a saying in Germany, if you can make it in Germany, you can make it everywhere. Also, it&#8217;s a big market in terms of selling insurance products because Germans really like insurance in every regard. So there is huge market potential in Germany I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael McFadgen, partner at Element Ventures, said: “As new industries and business models emerge, companies need much more flexible insurance propositions than what is currently being offered by traditional brokers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html">announced</a> that its Chrome browser is moving to a faster release cycle by shipping a new milestone every four weeks instead of the current six-week cycle (with a bi-weekly security patch). That&#8217;s one way to hasten the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>, I guess, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Mozilla also moved to a four-week cycle for Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/moving-firefox-to-a-faster-4-week-release-cycle/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we have improved our testing and release processes for Chrome, and deployed bi-weekly security updates to improve our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/security-dev/c/fbiuFbW07vI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch gap</a>, it became clear that we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly,&#8221; the Chrome team explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Google, however, also acknowledges that not everybody wants to move this quickly &#8212; especially in the enterprise. For those users, Google is adding a new Extended Stable option with updates that come every eight weeks. This feature will be available to enterprise admins and Chromium embedders. They will still get security updates on a bi-weekly schedule, but Google notes that &#8220;those updates won’t contain new features or all security fixes that the 4 week option will receive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new four-week cycle will start with Chrome 94 in Q3 2021, and at this faster rate, we&#8217;ll see Chrome 100 launch into the stable channel by March 29, 2022. I expect there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/6ug6Bbc6diA?t=166">cake</a>.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been thinking about creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am one: I put out an e-book on Gumroad about cold emailing. That is actually the low point of creativity in my whole life, considering I think I have it in me to be a scriptwriter, a stand-up artist or at least a mediocre YouTuber. I created a piece of art about spamming. What a fall!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are successful creators, unlike me. But what makes them succeed, and how should brands work with them? Let’s get the definitions in place first.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators create and hence have an influence over their fans. Influencers exist. That’s the working definition we’ll go with.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Where brands go astray is when they expect creators to obtain products for their brands in the way that influencers do.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands work with influencers all the time. It doesn’t take a special skill to have a rotund posterior on which a wine glass can be balanced. Most of us don’t try such things. Yet some do, post it on Instagram and build multibillion-dollar fashion brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s art if an influencer does it. You and I have no business here, but brands embrace such influencers. Influencers monetize eyeballs directly (through brand partnerships) or through platform ad revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators are morally superior — they earnestly create good, mediocre or bad content/art/internet moments through their good, bad or mediocre skills. That builds a niche fan following. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They monetize through ads, brand partnerships or subscriptions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where brands go astray is when they expect creators to obtain products for their brands in the way that influencers do. Influencers influence. Creators endear themselves to their audience. Creators evolve and their audience base evolves along with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a framework for how brands can think about creator relationships and how to set goals for such relationships.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s call it FFS (Fan Follower Strength <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f926-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) Framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of a creator manifest their liking for the creator in one of these ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appreciate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adulate</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the scale of the audience base and their fan following strength, creators&#8217; alternative revenue streams could be anywhere between that of a guy who does the opening act at an obscure club&#8217;s stand-up night to that of a cult founder.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120963" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120963" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png" alt="fan following strength the fan following framework" width="750" height="520" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ashwin Ramasamy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much influence a creator has depends on the distribution of fans they have in these stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more adulation they get, the more they are ready to carry a brand or monetize on their own. While the number of fans decides the scale of an outcome (exposure, sales, etc.), at any scale a creator can monetize if they have more fans in the advocate or adulate stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brand has to choose its creators both on the scale and the goals they have for the relationship.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t4argOdQsk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">RIBS: The messaging framework for every company and product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RIBS: The messaging framework for every company and product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/embed/#?secret=t4argOdQsk" data-secret="t4argOdQsk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A creator with millions of merely appreciative followers could be good for brand exposure but not immediate sales, whereas a niche creator who receives great adulation from their audience could not just move products but move their audience to visit your store to buy a product they promote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such creators &#8212; if they are able to maintain a high proportion of advocates and adulatory followers as they hit scale &#8212; could launch their own brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship becomes troublesome when brands simply look at influencer marketing metrics (engagement, clicks, etc.) and ignore the FFS metrics (intensity of fan following as measured from comments, organic shares and engagement for those shares; the shelf life of the content measured by the longevity of comment interaction; fanfic creations around the creator’s content or about the creator, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the understanding of FFS metrics, brands end up partnering with creators at a life stage that could be incompatible with brand goals. A creator with a huge following does not automatically translate to sales if their fan following strength is skewed more toward appreciation than advocacy or adulation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/tiktoks-new-qa-feature-lets-creators-respond-to-fan-questions-using-text-or-video/">was spotted testing</a> a new Q&amp;A feature that would allow creators to more directly respond to their audience&#8217;s questions using either text or video. Today, the company has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-q-and-a">announced</a> the feature is now available to all users globally. With the release of TikTok Q&amp;A, as the feature is officially called, creators will be able to designate their comments as Q&amp;A questions, respond to questions with either text comments or video replies and add a Q&amp;A profile link to their bios, among other things. The feature also works with live videos.</p>
<p>TikTok Q&amp;A grew out of a way that creators were already using the video platform to interact with viewers. Often, after posting a video, viewers would have follow-up questions about the content. Creators would then either respond to those questions in the comments section or, if the response was more involved, they might post a second video instead.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A feature essentially formalizes this process by making it easier for creators &#8212; particularly those with a lot of fans &#8212; to identify and answer the most interesting questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>To use Q&amp;A, viewers will first designate their comment as a Q&amp;A question using a new commenting option. To do so, they&#8217;ll tap the Q&amp;A icon to the right side of the text entry field in comments. This will also label their comment with the icon and text that says &#8220;Asked by&#8221; followed by the username of the person asking the question. This makes it easier for creators to see when scanning through a long list of comments on their video.</p>
<p>The feature will also feed the question into the creator&#8217;s new Q&amp;A page where all questions and answers are aggregated. Users can browse this page to see all the earlier questions and answers that have already been posted or add a new question of their own.</p>
<p>Creators will respond to a Q&amp;A question with either text or video replies, just as they did before &#8212; so there isn&#8217;t much new to learn here, in terms of process.</p>
<p>They can also add Q&amp;A comments as stickers in their responses where the new video will link back to the original, where the question was first asked, similar to how they&#8217;re using comment stickers today.</p>
<p>The feature will also be available in TikTok LIVE, making it easier for creators to see the incoming questions in the stream&#8217;s chat from a separate panel.</p>

<p>As a part of this launch, a Q&amp;A profile link can be added to creators&#8217; Profile bios, which directs users to the Q&amp;A page where everything is organized.</p>
<p>During tests, the feature was only made available to creators with public accounts that had more than 10,000 followers and who opted in. Today, TikTok says it&#8217;s available to all users with Creator Accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, Microsoft announced that its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge browser</a> would get vertical tabs and here we are: Microsoft today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/customer-insights-research/articles/giving-users-an-edge-whats-new-with-microsofts-latest-browser-2/">announced</a> that vertical tabs in Edge are now generally available.</p>
<p>In addition, the Edge team also announced a few under-the-hood changes that will allow the browser to startup significantly faster (up to 41% faster according to Microsoft&#8217;s preliminary tests, to be precise). Since Microsoft can&#8217;t speed up your hard drive or significantly shrink Edge, though, the way the team achieves this is by loading the browser in the background when you sign in and then it&#8217;ll continue running when you close all browser windows. If that&#8217;s not to your liking, you can always turn this feature off.</p>
<p>While vertical tabs are available for you to play with now, though, the startup improvements will roll out over the course of this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121119" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121119" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121119" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png 2253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=1536,976 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121119" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Vertical tabs, of course, are nothing new. Other browsers have long supported them, either as a built-in feature or through extensions. But it&#8217;s nice to see them finally becoming a reality in Edge, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most websites follow a conventional grid that leaves plenty of whitespace on either end of the page,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcdanelmichele/">Michele McDanel</a> writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;As we began working with our users, we realized that this vertical real estate could be a better location for tabs, rather than the traditional horizontal list of tabs at the top. While vertical tabs may not be an entirely new concept, we saw an opportunity to improve the browser experience and tested several prototypes with our users.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121090" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical-Tabs_16x9_en-US.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121090" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical-Tabs_16x9_en-US.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>In its research, Microsoft discovered that users who like vertical tabs also like to switch between them and standard horizontal tabs, so it added an always-visible toggle to do so. And since users sometimes want to reclaim all of their screen estate, the team added the ability to collapse the sidebar, too.</p>
<p>For those of you who use Bing, Microsoft is also adding a few nifty new features to its search engine. There&#8217;s a new <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=fish+tacos+recipes&amp;form=MO12I1&amp;OCID=MO12I1">recipe view</a> for when you&#8217;re once again out of ideas for what to make for dinner, improved visual search results and the company has spruced up some of its rich sidebar snippets with a more <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=kenya&amp;form=MO12I6&amp;OCID=MO12I6">infographic-like feel</a>. But let&#8217;s face it: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">you&#8217;re not using Bing</a>. If perchance you do, you can find more details about the updates <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/03/04/amp-up-your-performance-with-startup-boost-and-find-information-blazingly-fast-with-microsoft-edge-and-bing/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare is one of the most complex industries out there, creating frustration on the consumer side but also the opportunity for huge improvements from, in a way, rather simple methods. <a href="https://www.halodx.com/">Halo Diagnostics</a> (or Dx for short) has raised a $19 million Series A to improve diagnosis of several serious illnesses by crossing the streams from multiple tests and making the improved process easily available to providers. They&#8217;ve also taken the unusual step of taking out an eight-figure line of credit to buy outright the medical facilities they&#8217;ll need to do it.</p>
<p>As anyone who&#8217;s had to deal with major health concerns can attest, the care you get differs widely from one provider to another depending on many factors, not least of which are what your insurance covers and what methods are already in use by the provider.</p>
<p>For men going in to get a prostate cancer screening, for instance, the common bloodwork and rectal exam haven&#8217;t changed in years, and really aren&#8217;t that great at predicting problems, leading to uncertainty and unnecessary procedures like biopsies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re lucky, your provider might offer multiparametric MRIs, which are much better at finding problems — and if you combine that MRI with a urine test that checks for genetic markers, the detection accuracy rises to practically foolproof levels.</p>
<p>But these tests are more expensive, take special facilities and personnel and may otherwise not fit into the provider&#8217;s existing infrastructure. Halo aims to provide that infrastructure by revamping the medical data stream to allow for this kind of multi-factor diagnosis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Basically doctors and imaging centers aren&#8217;t offering latest level of care. If you&#8217;re lucky you might get it, but in community medicine you&#8217;re not going to,&#8221; said Brian Axe, co-founder and chief product officer at Halo Dx. &#8220;As perverse as it sounds, what the healthcare industry needs to adopt the latest medical advancements is better financial alignment in addition to better outcomes. The challenge is the integrated diagnostic solution — how do you get these orders, go to market and talk with primary care providers?&#8221;</p>
<p>An added obstacle is that multi-modal testing isn&#8217;t really the kind of thing medical imaging or testing providers just decide to get into. An imaging center isn&#8217;t going to hear that a urine test improves reliability and think &#8220;well let&#8217;s buy the building next door and start doing that too!&#8221; It&#8217;s costly and complex to build out testing facilities, and getting the expertise to run them and combine the results is another hurdle.</p>
<p>So Halo Dx is parachuting in with tens of millions of dollars and purchasing the imaging and testing centers themselves (four so far), taking over their operations and combining them with other tests.</p>
<p>Assuming that much liability as a young company may seem like folly, but it helps that these imaging centers are strong businesses already — not derelict, half-paid-off MRI machines being operated at a loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;The imaging orders are coming in already; the centers are profitable. They&#8217;re coming on board because they see how technology is coming to disrupt them, and they want to help drive the change,&#8221; said Axe.</p>
<p>Prostate and breast cancers are the first target, but more and better data produce similarly improved diagnosis and treatment planning for more conditions, potentially (these are still being proven out), like Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson&#8217;s and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>With one company running multiple intake, imaging and testing facilities and integrating the results, it&#8217;s much more likely that providers will sign up. And Halo Dx is trying to bring some of the enterprise-grade software expertise to bear on the historically neglected field of medical data storage and communication.</p>
<p>Axe deferred to the company&#8217;s chief medical officer, Dr. John Feller, on the perils of that aspect of the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Feller describes this so well: &#8216;I have this state of the art MRI machine that can see inside your body, but because of the fragmented solutions that are out there, from intake to the storage centers, I feel like I&#8217;m living with pre-dot-com era tech and it&#8217;s crippling,&#8217; &#8221; Axe recalled. &#8220;If you want to look at records or recommend additional tests, software vendors don&#8217;t talk to each other or integrate. You have three providers that need to talk to each other and there&#8217;s a dozen systems between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Axe compared the company&#8217;s approach here to One Medical&#8217;s — increasing efficiency and using that to make the relationship with the consumer lighter and easier, leading to more interactions.</p>
<p>In some ways it seems like a risky move, taking on nearly a hundred million in obligations and jumping into a hugely complex and highly regulated space. But the team is accomplished, the backers are notable, the potential for growth is there, and the success of the likes of One Medical have likely emboldened all involved.</p>
<p>Zola Global Investors led the round, and a who&#8217;s-who in medical and tech participated: Anne Wojcicki, Fred Moll, Stephen Pomeranz, Bob Reed, Robert Ciardi, Jim Pallotta and, believe it or not, Ronnie Lott of 49ers fame.</p>
<p>These and others involved make for a strong statement of confidence in both the model and the specific approach Halo Dx is taking to expanding and advancing care. Here&#8217;s hoping, however, that you won&#8217;t have to make use of their services.</p>
