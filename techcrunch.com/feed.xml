										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D printing has come a long way over the course of the last decade, but questions about mainstream adoption still linger around the technology. Medical devices have been a pretty compelling use case &#8212; they’re not really mass produced and require a high level of personalization. Clear orthodontics are a great example of something that falls in that sweet spot &#8212; in fact, dental in general has been a big application.</p>
<p>Audio, too, holds a lot of potential. Imagine, for example, a set of headphones custom designed for your ears. The technology has been available on high-end models for a while, courtesy of molding, but 3D printing could unlock a more easily scalable version of that kind of luxury.</p>
<p>This week, Sennheiser announced a partnership that will utilize Formlabs technology to print custom earphones. Specifically, the headphone maker will be using the Form 3B, a printer design for use with biocompatible material that has largely been utilized for dental applications. Product specifics haven’t been revealed, but the audio company’s Ambeo division will be using the tech to create custom headphone eartips. Users would be able to scan their ears with a smartphone and send that to the company to get a tip printed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114663" style="width: 406px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114663" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114663" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png" alt="" width="396" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png?resize=119,150 119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png?resize=238,300 238w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114663" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sennheiser</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our technology collaboration with Sennheiser seeks to change the way customers interact with the brands they love by enabling a more customized, user-centric approach to product development,” Formlabs audio head Iain McLeod said in a release.. “Formlabs’ deep industry knowledge and broad expertise in developing scalable solutions enable us to deliver tangible innovations to our customers. In this case, we are working with Sennheiser’s Ambeo team to deliver a uniquely accessible, custom fit experience.”</p>
<p>The product is still very much in the prototype phase. And while such a partnership seems like a no-brainer for headphone makers going forward, there are some big questions here, including pricing and scalability. Clearly such a product would come at a premium over standard headphones, but not at so high a cost that supersedes such novelty.</p>
<p>The release calls it “an affordable and simple solution is now available to mass 3D print custom-fit earphones.” What, precisely, it means by affordable remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the U.S. has seen more renters than at any point since at least 1965, according </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to a Pew Research Center analysis of </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/housing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Census Bureau housing data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition for renters is fierce and property managers are turning to technology to get a leg up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet that demand, Seattle-based <a href="https://www.knockcrm.com/">Knock </a>– one startup that has developed tools to give property management companies a competitive edge – has raised $20 million in a growth funding round led by Fifth Wall Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Madrona Venture Group, Lead Edge Capital, Second Avenue Partners and Seven Peaks Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total capital raised to $47 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demetri Themelis and Tom Petry co-founded Knock in 2014 after renting “in super competitive markets” such as New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After meeting with property management companies, it was eye-opening to learn about the total gap across their tech stacks,” Themelis recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock’s goal is to provide CRM tools to modernize front office operations for these companies so they can do things like offer virtual tours and communicate with renters via text, email or social media from “a single conversation screen.” For renters, it offers an easier way to communicate and engage with landlords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Apartment buildings, like almost every customer-driven business, compete with each other by attracting, converting and retaining customers,” Themelis said. “For property management companies, these customers are renters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup &#8212; which operates as a SaaS business &#8212; has seen an uptick in growth, quadrupling its revenue over the past two years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its software is used by hundreds of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest property management companies across the United States and Canada and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has more than 1.5 million apartment units using the platform. Starwood Capital Group, ZRS, FPI and Cushman &amp; Wakefield (formerly Pinnacle) are among its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Petry explains it, Knock serves as the sales inbox (chat, SMS, phone, email), sales calendar and CRM systems, all in one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also automate certain sales tasks like outreach and appointment scheduling, while also surfacing which sales opportunities need the most attention at any given time, for both new leases as well as renewals,” he said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114161" style="width: 4096px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114161" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2114161 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png" alt="" width="4086" height="2860" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png 4086w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=2048,1433 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4086px) 100vw, 4086px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114161" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Knock</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, Themelis said, was well-prepared for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our software supports property management companies, which operate high-density apartment buildings that people live and work in,” he told TechCrunch. “You can’t just ‘shut them down,’ which has made multifamily resilient and even grow in comparison to retail and industrial real estate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when lockdowns went into effect, in-person property tours declined by an estimated 80% in a matter of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock did things like help property managers transition to a centralized and remote leasing model so remote agents could work across a large portfolio of properties rather than in a single on-site leasing office, noted Petry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helped them adopt self-guided, virtual and live video-based leasing tools, so prospective renters could tour properties in person on their own or virtually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This transformation and modernization became a huge tailwind for our business in 2020,” Petry said. “Not only did we have a record year in terms of new customers, revenue growth and revenue retention, but our customers outperformed market averages for occupancy and rent growth as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company says it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be using its new capital to (naturally!) hire across product, engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, finance and human resources divisions. It expects to grow headcount by 40% to 50% before year-end. It also plans to expand its product portfolio to include AI communications, fraud prevention, applicant screening and leasing, and intelligent forecasting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall partner Vik Chawla, who is joining Knock’s board of directors, pointed out that the macroeconomic environment is driving institutional capital into multifamily real estate at an accelerated pace. This makes Knock&#8217;s offering even more timely in its importance, in the firm&#8217;s view.</span></p>
<p>The startup, he believes, outshines its competitors in terms of quality of product, technical prowess and functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Knock team has accomplished so much in just a short period of time by attracting very high quality product design and engineering talent to ameliorate a nuanced pain point in the tenant acquisition process,&#8221; Chawla told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>In terms of fitting with its investment thesis, Chawla said companies like Knock can both benefit from Fifth Wall&#8217;s global corporate strategic partners &#8220;and simultaneously serve as a key offering which we can share with real estate industry leaders in different countries as a potential solution for their local markets.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Calendars. They are at the core of how we organize our workdays and meetings, but despite regular attempts to modernize the overall calendar experience, the calendar experience you see today in Outlook or <del>G Suite</del> Google Workspace hasn&#8217;t really changed at its core. And for the most part, the area that startups like Calendly or ReclaimAI have focused on in recent years is scheduling.</p>
<p><a href="https://magicalhq.com/">Magical</a> is a Tel Aviv-based startup that wants to reinvent the calendar experience from the ground up and turn it into more of a team collaboration tool than simply a personal time-management service. The company today announced that it has raised a $3.3 million seed round led by Resolute Ventures, with additional backing from Ibex Investors, Aviv Growth Partners, ORR Partners, Homeward Ventures and Fusion LA, as well as several angel investors in the productivity space.</p>
<p>The idea for the service came from discussions on <a href="https://www.supertools.ai/">Supertools</a>, a large workplace-productivity community, which was also founded by Magical founder and CEO Tommy Barav.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114524" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114524" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114524" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png 2891w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=2048,1022 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114524" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Magical</p></div></p>
<p>Based on the feedback from the community &#8212; and his own consulting work with large Fortune 500 multinationals &#8212; Barav realized that time management remains an unsolved business problem. &#8220;The time management space is so highly fragmented,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There are so many micro tools and frameworks to manage time, but they&#8217;re not built inside of your calendar, which is the main workflow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Traditional calendars are add-ons to bigger product bundles and find themselves trapped under those, he argues. &#8220;The calendar in Outlook is an email sidekick, but it&#8217;s actually the center of your day. So there is an unmet need to use the calendar as a time management hub,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Magical, which is still in private beta, aims to integrate many of the features we&#8217;re seeing from current scheduling and calendaring startups, including AI-scheduling and automation tools. But Magical&#8217;s ambition is larger than that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114527" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114527" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png 1439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114527" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Magical</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to redefine how you use a calendar in the first place,&#8221; Barav said. &#8220;Many of the innovations that we&#8217;ve seen are associated with scheduling: how you schedule your time, letting you streamline the way you schedule meetings, how you see your calendar. [&#8230;] But we&#8217;re talking about redefining time management by giving you a better calendar, by bringing these workflows &#8212; scheduling, coordinating and utilizing &#8212; into your calendar. We&#8217;re redefining the use of the calendar in the modern workspace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Magical is still in its early days, the team is still working out some of the details, but the general idea is to, for example, turn the calendar into the central repository for meeting notes &#8212; and Magical will feature tools to collaborate on these notes and share them. Team members will also be able to follow those meeting notes without having to participate in the actual meeting (or get copied on the emails about that meeting).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help teams reduce pointless meetings,&#8221; Barav noted. To do this, the team is also integrating other service into the calendar experience, including the usual suspects like Zoom and Slack, but also Salesforce and Notion, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s rare that you find an entrepreneur who has so clearly validated its market opportunity,&#8221; said Mike Hirshland, a founding partner of <span class="il">Magical</span> investor Resolute Ventures. &#8220;Tommy and his team have been talking to thousands of users for three years, they’ve validated the opportunity, and they’ve designed a product from the ground-up that meets the needs of the market. Now it&#8217;s &#8216;go time&#8217; and I&#8217;m thrilled to be part of the journey ahead.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marqeta is expanding into the consumer credit card space to help other brands launch credit card programs. </span></p>
<p>The move comes just days after the payment card issuing company reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering, making it the latest fintech to make a move to the public markets.</p>
<p>The value of the IPO is expected to be around $10 billion, according to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-marqeta-ipo/u-s-payments-startup-marqeta-files-with-regulators-for-ipo-source-idUSKBN2AG2JQ"> Reuters.</a> Marqeta &#8212; which is working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase on the offering &#8212; is reportedly hoping to complete the IPO by April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oakland, California-based <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/">Marqeta</a> raised $150 million last May at a $4.2 billion valuation, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/providing-card-services-to-fintech-companies-around-the-world-gives-marqeta-a-4-3-billion-valuation/">previously reported</a>. Then in October, Mastercard put <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-marqeta/mastercard-backs-card-issuing-start-up-marqeta-idUSKBN26T1WN">an undisclosed amount of money</a> in Marqeta.</p>
<p>The company, which provides the tools for financial services platforms of all stripes to provide cards, wallets and other payment mechanisms, counts Cash App, Affirm, DoorDash, and Instacart among its customers. At the end of 2020, Marqeta says it had issued 270 million cards through its platform, up from 140 million at the end of 2019. The company, which has over 550 employees, is live in 35 countries.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Providing card services to fintech companies around the world gives Marqeta a $4.3 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/providing-card-services-to-fintech-companies-around-the-world-gives-marqeta-a-4-3-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=ff8fJpugTN" data-secret="ff8fJpugTN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Marqeta is partnering with another startup, Deserve, on its new credit card initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Deserve CEO Kalpesh Kapadia explains it, his company’s technology and open API platform will power Marqeta’s program management services, including origination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, underwriting, bank and bureau Integration, customer service, compliance and risk management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marqeta founder and CEO Jason Gardner described Marqeta’s expansion into building new credit products as a “major milestone” for the company in building out a &#8220;</span>truly comprehensive card issuing platform, able to support any card type.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This technology is complex, and we saw that this barrier to market had created an opportunity for us to take what we’ve learned helping customers innovate in the prepaid and debit space and adapt that to credit,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<div>Marqeta is banking on the notion that any business currently issuing a card is looking, or currently working, on a credit card.</div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;These innovators want to launch modern card products but having to rely on legacy technology, which allows much less options for flexibility and personalization, has slowed down innovation,&#8221; Gardner added.</p>
<div>It&#8217;s also betting that consumers want more from credit cards than just paying for a purchase.</div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114525" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114525" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2114525 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/credit-section-1-image-e1613612706794.png?w=337" alt="" width="337" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/credit-section-1-image-e1613612706794.png 745w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/credit-section-1-image-e1613612706794.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/credit-section-1-image-e1613612706794.png?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/credit-section-1-image-e1613612706794.png?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/credit-section-1-image-e1613612706794.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114525" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Marqeta</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;They want seamless digital experiences, rewards that match their lifestyle, and personalized apps that track financial health, but there’s been little innovation that speaks to this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating touchless payments &#8212; as more people avoided in-person interaction and shopping &#8212; the demand for more digital financial offerings has exploded.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new initiative, Marqeta aims to be able to help its customers launch new customized credit card products “in a fraction of the time, with more flexible controls and features.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, they will have what Marqeta describes as a modern credit system of record that can adjust account parameters, such as rewards, APR and credit lines, in real time based on custom rules. Customers will have the ability to instantly activate cardholders upon approval and provision cards directly into digital wallets.</span></p>
<p>Gardner called <span style="font-weight: 400;">Menlo Park-based Deserve &#8220;an ideal first strategic partner&#8221; in its expansion into the credit card market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We plan to offer program management services for customers using our credit card issuing platform through an ecosystem of partners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are a good DNA fit for what we’re trying to accomplish &#8211; with a strong belief in the power of open APIs to increase speed to market, and also targeting innovators looking to build truly modern card products. They’re experienced in the credit card space, which has a unique set of requirements, and have a unique approach to underwriting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Deserve says its B2B business has been growing in recent years, with it currently adding one prospect every week and one new partner to its business every month. More than 1.5 million consumers have applied and interacted with its platform over the past three years and the company is currently serving hundreds of thousands of customers (directly and indirectly), with tens of millions of dollars transacting every month on its platform, according to Kapadia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deserves also manages the entire</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card infrastructure for companies like Sallie Mae in the cloud, whereby consumers applying for and using Sallie Mae credit cards are engaging with Deserve behind the scene. It also provides origination services to companies such as BankMobile. Other fintechs such as Opploans, BlockFi and Earnest use its entire credit card infrastructure to launch their credit products. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit market is dominated by legacy technologies, high cost of operations and lack of customization and speed,” Kapadia told TechCrunch. “Marqeta’s leading card-issuing platform paired with Deserve’s digital card expertise will enable further innovation in the credit industry and provide consumers with superior card experiences.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Application performance monitoring startup <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> announced today that it has reached unicorn status, raising a $60 million Series D with a post-funding valuation of $1 billion. The round was led by Accel and New Enterprise Associates, both returning investors, and Bond.</p>
<p>Accel led Sentry&#8217;s seed funding in 2015, and has invested in each of its rounds since then. The startup, which serves 68,000 organizations, has now raised a total of $127 million. Its clients include Disney, Cloudflare, Peloton, Slack, Eventbrite, Supercell and Rockstar Games.</p>
<p>Sentry&#8217;s software monitors apps for potential issues, helping developers catch bugs before they result in outages, downtime and frustrated users. Its Series D will be used on product development, like adding support for more languages and frameworks, and hiring for its offices in San Francisco, Toronto and Vienna.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Sentry&#8217;s products are used by a wide range of sectors, it is seeing continued growth in gaming and streaming media, and new demand in industries that are digitizing more of their infrastructure and services, including finance, commerce and healthcare.</p>

<p>In July, Sentry announced the launch of frontend monitoring software for Python and Javascript. At the time, Sentry&#8217;s chief executive officer Milin Desai told TechCrunch that its customers in all verticals were relying more heavily on the platform as the COVID-19 pandemic increased the usage of work, education and e-commerce apps.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Accel partner Dan Levine said, &#8220;With nearly all companies moving to digital-first ways of working and engaging with customers, application health has become a business-critical initiative, and as a result, Sentry is poised for explosive growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some more internal emails <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/">Facebook really doesn&#8217;t want you to see</a>: Turns out in 2017 COO Sheryl Sandberg had already known for years there were problems with a free ad planning tool the company offers to marketeers to display estimates of how many people campaigns running on its platform may reach, per newly unsealed court documents.</p>
<p>The filing also reveals that a Facebook product manager for the &#8216;potential reach&#8217; tool warned the company was making revenue it &#8220;should never have&#8221; off of &#8220;wrong data&#8221;.</p>
<p>The unsealed documents pertain to a US class action lawsuit, filed in 2018, which alleges that Facebook deceived advertisers by knowingly including fake and duplicate accounts in &#8216;potential reach&#8217; metric.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook denies the claim but has acknowledged accuracy issues with the &#8216;potential reach&#8217; metric as far back as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/facebook-corrects-more-metrics-affecting-ad-reach-streaming-reactions-plus-like-share-counts/">2016</a> &#8212; and also changed how it worked in 2019.</p>
<p>While the litigants have continued to accuse Facebook of continuing to misrepresent the ad reach estimate in updates to their 2018 complaint.</p>
<p>Redacted documents from the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-accused-in-amended-lawsuit-of-knowing-ad-audiences-were-inflated-11584745492">reported by the WSJ</a> last year, included the awkward detail that a Facebook employee had asked &#8220;how long can we get away with the reach overestimation?&#8221;</p>
<p>But sections of the filing pertaining to Sandberg and other Facebook executives were redacted.</p>
<p>Newly unsealed documents from the suit &#8212; which we&#8217;ve reviewed &#8212; now reveal that in fall 2017 Sandberg &#8220;acknowledged in an internal email she had known about problems with Potential Reach for years&#8221;.</p>

<p>They also show Facebook repeatedly rejected internal proposals to fix the issue of fake and duplicate accounts inflating the estimates its platform showed to advertisers of the number of people who could see their ads &#8212; citing impact on revenue as a reason not to act.</p>
<p>In early 2018 Facebook estimated that removing duplicate accounts would cause a 10% drop in potential reach, per the unsealed filing. While Facebook management rejected an employee&#8217;s suggestion to change the language the tool showed to advertisers, declining to swap out the words &#8220;people&#8221; and &#8220;reach&#8221; for the (more accurate) term &#8220;accounts&#8221; &#8212; on the grounds that &#8220;people-based marketing was core to Facebook&#8217;s value proposition&#8221;.</p>
<p>The filing also reveals that a product manager for &#8216;potential reach&#8217;, Yaron Fidler, proposed a fix for the tool that would have decreased its numbers. His proposal was rejected by Facebook&#8217;s metrics leadership on the grounds that it would have a &#8220;significant&#8221; impact on the company&#8217;s revenue &#8212; to which Fidler responded: &#8220;It&#8217;s revenue we should have never made given the fact it&#8217;s based on wrong data.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/facebook-corrects-more-metrics-affecting-ad-reach-streaming-reactions-plus-like-share-counts/">2016</a>, when Facebook published an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/11/an-update-on-metrics-and-reporting/">update on metrics</a> &#8212; a few weeks after publicly disclosing it had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/facebook-miscalculation-significantly-inflated-average-video-view-times-for-years/?_ga=2.140390259.118496112.1613376463-1757155993.1533833482">over-inflating average video view times</a>, as it sought to regain advertiser trust in its reporting tools &#8212; the tech giant also announced a new channel for &#8220;regular information on metrics enhancements&#8221;, called <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/category/measurement-fyi/">Metrics FYI</a>.</p>
<p>This is where it made the aforementioned fuzzy disclosure of accuracy issues with &#8216;potential reach&#8217; &#8212; writing then that it was &#8220;improving our methodology for sampling and extrapolating potential audience sizes&#8221; to &#8220;help to provide a more accurate estimate for a given target audience and to better account for audiences across multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network)&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In most cases, advertisers should expect to see less than a 10% change (increase or decrease) in the audience sizes shown in the tool,&#8221; it added at the time.</p>
<p>However the December 2016 <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/12/metrics-fyi-estimated-reach-streaming-reactions-and-graph-api/">blog post</a> did not go into any detail about the nature of the accuracy problems Facebook thought needed improving &#8212; reading more like another classic slice of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html">Facebook crisis PR</a>.</p>
<p>The class action suit, meanwhile, alleges that rather than accepting internal proposals to fix the accuracy problems of &#8216;potential reach&#8217;, Facebook instead &#8220;developed talking points to deflect from the truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tech giant did announce some changes to the ad tool in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/567031670465069">March 2019</a> &#8212; when it said an advertiser&#8217;s campaign&#8217;s estimated potential reach &#8220;is now based on how many people have been shown an ad on a Facebook Product in the past 30 days who match your desired audience and placement criteria&#8221; (vs the estimates being previously based on &#8220;people who were active users in the past 30 days&#8221;).</p>
<p>But the litigants argue that the changes to the tool which displays an estimate to advertisers as they are beginning to create a campaign &#8212; and therefore when they&#8217;re deciding/considering whether/how much money to spend with Facebook &#8212; do not fully fix the issue of the metric not corresponding to the potential audience of people who could see the ad on Facebook.</p>
<p>An analyst report back in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-claimed-reach-in-the-u-s-is-larger-than-census-figures-analyst-finds-1504711935">2017</a> showed that Facebook&#8217;s ad platform claimed to reach millions more users among specific age groups in the U.S. than official census data indicated reside in the country.</p>
<p>At the time the company said the audience reach estimates &#8220;are based on a number of factors, including Facebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices, and other factors&#8221;, per the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-claimed-reach-in-the-u-s-is-larger-than-census-figures-analyst-finds-1504711935">WSJ</a>, and claimed they are &#8220;not designed to match population or census estimates&#8221;. Facebook added then that it is &#8220;always working to improve our estimates&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked about the latest batch of unsealed court documents pertaining to the lawsuit &#8212; including the revelation that Facebook&#8217;s COO had told staff she knew about &#8220;problems&#8221; with the ad tool &#8220;for years&#8221; as far back as fall 2017 &#8212; Facebook sent us this statement, attributed to a spokesperson: “These allegations are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”</p>
<p>Problems with self-reporting ad metrics have been a recurring theme for Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/facebooks-latest-ad-tool-fail-puts-another-dent-in-its-reputation/">Last year</a> the tech giant disclosed yet another issue on this front &#8212; saying its &#8216;conversion lift&#8217; ad tool had a code error that meant it had miscalculated the number of sales derived from ad impressions for a number of advertisers.</p>
<p>That &#8216;technical problem&#8217; with Facebook&#8217;s internal calculation of the efficacy of third parties&#8217; ad campaigns meant advertisers saw skewed data which they may have used to determine how much to spend on its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.yext.com/products/answers">Yext Answers</a> allows businesses to provide a better search experience on their own websites — but as the name implies, the goal is really to make sure consumers get the answers they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we deliver a link [in response to a search query], we consider it a failure on our side,&#8221; Chief Strategy Officer Marc Ferrentino told me.</p>
<p>Ferrentino said the company will be able to do an even better job of that starting on March 17, with the launch of the &#8220;Orion&#8221; update to its search algorithm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yext will then be able to pull answers directly from unstructured pages on a business&#8217; website. The key, he said, is that Yext can &#8220;extract structured information&#8221; from an unstructured document — whether that&#8217;s a webpage, a blog post or a help document — rather than just searching for keywords. So instead of simply presenting a link or a &#8220;blob of text,&#8221; it will offer a &#8220;rich snippet&#8221; that actually answers your question.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114459" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114459" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Yext Answers" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg 3250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PressImages-EQA-1560x878-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yext</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;re familiar with something similar from Google&#8217;s consumer search experience, where the results often include a widget with questions and answers. Ferrentino welcomed the comparison, saying this will allow Yext customers to close the &#8220;experience gap&#8221; between Google&#8217;s search experience and their own.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the technology, Ferrentino showed me how Yext Answers could crawl pages about presidential history and then return the correct answer when asked, &#8220;Who was the only U.S. president to be impeached twice?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or for a more commercial (albeit slightly meta) example, he showed me how it could answer questions about Yext&#8217;s technology. As another example, Yext says it could search a bank&#8217;s website to answer a question about the difference between a 401(k) and Roth IRA.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: This change won&#8217;t just improve things for business and their customers, but also Yext&#8217;s non-profit clients, including the World Health Organization, which is <a href="https://www.yext.com/about/news-media/2020-05-world-health-organization-and-yext-collaborate-to-answer-covid-19-questions-online/">using Yext to provide pandemic-related answers online</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each year, millions of students in India rush to get an admission in universities abroad. Often they don’t know which program they should focus on, or the college that is right for their skillset and ambition.</p>
<p>Scores of legacy and newfound firms are attempting to offer counselling to these students. But despite India contributing more international students than any other country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/edtechs-newest-unicorn-applyboard-lands-1-4b-valuation-with-fresh-funding/">most firms</a> aiming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/crimson-education-a-platform-to-help-students-get-into-top-universities-nabs-5m-at-a-245m-valuation/">address this challenge</a> are not focused on India, and struggle to understand some unique problems students in the world’s second most populous country face.</p>
<p>An Indian startup that is bridging this gap on Thursday said it has raised $6.5 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its platform in the world’s second largest internet market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://leverageedu.com">Leverage Edu</a> said Tomorrow Capital led the Delhi-headquartered startup’s Series A financing round. Existing investors Blume Ventures and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and chief executive of Leverage Edu, told TechCrunch in an interview that he believes that eventually the firm that is going to serve the students best and emerge most successful will be the one that is physically closer to them, and not to the universities.</p>
<p>Chaturvedi, 30, began exploring this idea for this startup in 2015 and spent a little more than a year experimenting with different models. One of the earliest iterations of Leverage Edu offered mentorship to students and rewarded counselors with points.</p>
<p>Today, the startup offers a broad range of services in addition to offering personalized mentorship. Through its workshops, it helps students find the right college, guides them with complex applications and grade conversions, as well as assists with education loan, VISA, and accommodation. &#8220;It&#8217;s one digital dashboard. You get everything from flight tickets to local phone numbers, to education loan in one place,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“We believe it is inevitable that the next stellar brand in the global cross-border education space will be a home-grown one. We have a great belief in Akshay as a founder &#8211; he has a fantastic roadmap for scaling the business and the passion to build a truly global Indian edtech brand &#8211; and are excited about working with the Leverage Edu team on this journey,” said Rohini Prakash, chief executive of Tomorrow Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Leverage Edu helps students land admission in the most prestigious colleges, but also works with those that didn’t score the most marks.</p>
<p>“Students going to the top colleges is just 10% of the potential audience,” explained Chaturvedi, who spent his teen years attending talks from startup founders and also made money by bringing more people to those talks.  “There are many universities that don’t have the best branding. To connect them with students, we have our SaaS offering <a href="https://univalley.com">Univalley.com</a>,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to help students find colleges in more geographies including the UK and Australia, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to focus on a few things and do them really really well. There is also this myth around foreign education being expensive that we&#8217;ve been busting for last four years. 18 months from now, we want to be among the top study abroad companies in India, both by number of students and a roof-hitting NPS &#8211; because a happy student is why we are all really motivated everyday to do this!”, he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With offline events now firmly moved to online for the foreseeable future, startups in the networking space had to pivot fast in the face of the pandemic. One of those was <a href="https://grip.events/">Grip</a>, previously better known as a networking app for physical conferences (including TechCrunch Disrupt, at one point). Since last year, Grip moved into an ‘omnichannel’ experience, combining various event types across virtual, hybrid, and live. That strategy appears to have paid off as it has now raised a $13 million Series A funding round, taking its total amount raised to $14.5 million.</p>
<p>The round was led by London-based growth equity fund Kennet Partners. The raise is reflective of the boom in online events, which saw London-based startup Hopin raise a $40m Series A last year. Founded in 2016, Grip counts some large event organizers as clients including  Reed Exhibitions and Messe Frankfurt.</p>
<p>In a statement Tim Groot, CEO and founder of Grip, said: “Our mission is to empower organizers to bring professionals together to advance industries. This funding round is going to enable us to take the experience to a new level, leveraging our extensive  industry-leading platform, offering unique value for Virtual, Hybrid and In-Person events.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said they would now be investing heavily in the product and looking to global expansion.</p>
<p>Other competitors to Grip have, in the past, included <a href="https://www.brella.io/">Brella</a> which raised $1.5m, and <a href="https://www.swapcard.com/">Swapcard</a> which raised $6m to date.</p>
<p>So why is it that Grip seems to have pulled away from pack in this way?</p>
<p>Groot told me: “We took a slightly different approach in that we managed to work in a plug-and-play method alongside other platforms. So grip gets used as a standalone virtual event platform by lots of these organizers. So they might use Hopin for the conference but Grip for the networking. So maybe we managed to get more traction that way, over the course of 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, following the pivot to virtual events, Grip hosted over 100 events a month and was used by 1.5m people. As a result, the company says revenue grew almost 4x in 2020, and this year it expects to do over 10,000 events on its platform with over 5 million participants.</p>
<p>Grips AI-powered algorithms mean attendees get more personalized matchmaking recommendations based on their interests, including pre-event meeting scheduling. For exhibitors, the software captures business leads and provides post-event analytics.</p>
<p>People can be added to meetings to have group conversations and the startup is also working on a topic-based “speed networking” functionality to hold instant 3 minute conversations.</p>
<p>Grip integrates with various streaming platforms such as Vimeo, Youtube, Zoom, BlueJeans and others, unlike “full-service” platforms such as Hopin or Bizzabo.</p>
<p>Hillel Zidel, Partner at Kennet and Grip board member, added: “Grip’s ability to organize virtual events with a key focus on networking has meant that the company has seen tremendous growth over the last year. Event organizers and their clients have been able to remain connected with their customers despite the constraints on in-person events. As live events resume in the future, Grip is extremely well-positioned to continue to assist event organizers through the provision of software solutions supporting live, virtual and hybrid events.”</p>
<p>Brent Hoberman, co-founder of Founders Factory and a previous investor, said: “Grip was born out of a need we saw in running events at Founders Forum &#8211; how do you use smart technology to catalyze the most relevant and valuable connections between your guests?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/earlybird-digital-east-fund-i">Earlybird Digital East Fund</a> — a fund associated with Germany’s <a href="https://earlybird.com/">Earlybird</a> VC, but operating separately — has launched a €200m ($242m) successor fund. The fund’s focus will remain the same as before: a Seed and Series-A fund focusing on what’s known as ‘Emerging Europe’, in other words, countries stretching from the Baltics to Central and Eastern Europe, and Turkey. The firm has also promoted Mehmet Atici, who’s been with the firm for eight years, to Partner. The new fund has made four investments so far: FintechOS, Payhawk, Picus, and Binalyze.</p>
<p>The back-story to DEF is a fascinating tale of what happened to Europe in the last 15 years, as tech took off and Europeans returned from Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Following his exit from SelectMinds (where he was the Founder &amp; CEO) in 2005, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/csertoglu/">Cem Sertoglu</a> moved back to Turkey. Although he says he “accidentally became the first angel investor” there, he was clearly the right man, in the right place, at the right time. He told me: “I was very lucky and ended up writing the first checks in some of the first large outcomes in Turkey.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2013, Sertoglu partnered with Evren Ucok (the first angel in Peak Games and Trendyol), and Roland Manger (Earlybird). Dan Lupu, a Romanian investor who had covered the region for Intel Capital, joined them, and together they raised the ‘Earlybird Digital East Fund I’ set at $150m fund in 2014, focusing on CEE and Turkey. This was and is an area where there can be high-quality ventures to be found, but very little in the way of VC. </p>
<p>Thereafter, between 2014 and 2019, the fund invested in UiPath, Hazelcast, and Obilet. UiPath has become a global leader in the area known as ‘Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Hazelcast is a low latency data processing platform startup with Turkish roots. Obilet is a marketplace focused for the massive Turkish intercity bus travel market. DEF has also exited Vivense, Dolap, and EMbonds and in more recent times the fund has exited Vivense, the &#8220;Wayfair of Turkey&#8221; to Actera, the top local PE fund.</p>
<p>The team had spectacular early success. Peak Games, Trendyol, YemekSepeti and GittiGidiyor are the four largest Turkish tech exits to date. Digital East Fund was an investor in all of them. Peak games exited for $1.8 billion in cash to Zynga only last year.</p>
<p>As of Q4 2020, the fund’s metrics are:<br />
Investment Multiple: 24.9x<br />
Gross IRR: 104.4%<br />
Net IRR: 84.1%</p>
<p>So in VC terms, they have done pretty well.</p>
<p>I interviewed Sertoglu to unpack the story of Earlybird Digital East Fund.</p>
<p>He told me DEF has achieved a 17 times investment multiple on a $150 million fund. He thinks “this might be the biggest European VC fund performance in history, and it&#8217;s not coming from Berlin, it&#8217;s not coming from London, but it&#8217;s coming from Eastern Europe. We have been told by some of our LPs that they think we&#8217;re the top 2014 vintage VC fund in the world, nobody&#8217;s seen stronger numbers than this.”</p>
<p>“Peak Games turned out to be a phenomenal story. When you look at how tough it&#8217;s been for Turkey, macroeconomically. The fact that a single company with 100 people essentially sold for $1.8 billion in cash, was just… it was staggering for the local market here.”</p>
<p>DEF’s emergence from Turkey, together with its relationship with a fund in Berlin, was not the most obvious path for the VC fund.</p>
<p>“One thing we realized early one was that we could invest with our own capital and syndicating to our friends, but for follow-on funding, we&#8217;d always have to go global. And that made us feel vulnerable. It made us feel we were always dependent on others’ comprehension of the opportunity that we were facing. So that&#8217;s when the first fund idea came out this was,” said Sertoglu.</p>
<p>“We felt that there was this unusual dislocation between opportunity and capital in Eastern Europe. Our first fund was $150 million funds &#8211; I mean, a very quaint size compared to Western markets. But we became the largest fund in the region, and decided to focus on this series A gap where we felt that there was this big opportunity, because of the way we think series A is still very much a local play.”</p>
<p>“Being a local player that understands the region would be an advantage, so this was proven to be true. We could essentially see pretty much everything in Eastern Europe for the last eight years. And we caught the biggest one, fortunately, which was UiPath. I think very few funds around the world can say that they see the majority if not all of the opportunities that fall into their mandate,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have this dual strategy of backing local champions as well as contenders for global markets as well. 20 years ago you had to be in Silicon Valley. Now, Transferwise comes out of Estonia, UiPath comes out of Romania. And that was even before the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Sertoglu concluded: &#8220;So we now have fresh capital, coming on the heels of a very successful first fund, which we&#8217;re keen to deploy. We&#8217;re calling all the opportunities, seeing very ambitious, strong teams coming out of the region. And we have 200 million euros to focus on these types of opportunities in the region.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">There are over <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/03/the-global-unbanked-shoppers/">1.7 billion underbanked people globally</a>, the majority of which are from emerging markets. For them, accessing loans can be difficult, which is a problem fintechs try to solve. One way they do this is by promoting financial inclusion by underwriting credit via a proprietary algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One such company is <a href="https://www.fairmoney.ai/">FairMoney</a>, which describes itself as &#8220;the mobile banking revolution for emerging markets.&#8221; FairMoney, founded by <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurin-nabuko-hainy-03a5b862">Laurin Hainy</a>, <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-gendreau-22661a3a/en-us">Matthieu Gendreau</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasberthozat/">Nicolas Berthozat</a>, is a licensed online lender that provides instant loans and bill payments to underserved consumers in emerging markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Three years after launching <span style="font-weight: 400;">its mobile lending service in Nigeria</span>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the company</span><a href="https://fairmoney.ng/fairmoney-now-live-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set up shop in India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Asia&#8217;s second-most populous country in August 2020. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before expanding, FairMoney experienced exponential growth in Nigeria in terms of loans disbursement. La</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million, representing a 128% increase from 2019 and a staggering 3,189% growth rate from its first year of operation in 2018. As it stands, the company is projecting a $300 million loan disbursement volume by the end of 2021. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve been able to disburse 25-30% more than some of our competitors and I think we&#8217;re a market leader,&#8221; Hainy, the company&#8217;s CEO told TechCrunch. But compared with traditional banks, it was the seventh-largest digital financial services provider in that area.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kxNsgpSU89"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigerian digital bank Carbon hit $240M in payments processed last year, up 89% from 2019&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/embed/#?secret=kxNsgpSU89" data-secret="kxNsgpSU89" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">FairMoney has come a long way since its Nigeria launch in 2017. In its first year of operation, the company had little over 100,000 users. Now, it claims to have 1.3 million unique users who have made over 6.5 million loan applications. <span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney offers loans from ₦1,500 ($3.30) to ₦500,000 ($1,110.00) with its longest loan facility standing at 12 months. Annual percentage rates fall within 30% to 260% &#8212; the high APR, Hainy says, is due to higher default rates in Nigeria. That said, FairMoney also claims to have an NPL ratio lower than 10%. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, data-driven insights was behind the choice to expand to India. The Indian market is quite similar to Nigeria&#8217;s. In the Asian country, only 36% of adults have access to credit, leaving an untapped market of about 141 million people microfinance banks do not serve. But unlike Nigeria, India has better unit economics for the lending business and a more friendly regulatory environment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If our ambition is to build the leading mobile bank for emerging markets, we need to start with very large markets,&#8221; Hainy said. &#8220;We tested our products in 10 different markets checking out for things like what the yield economics is like, NPLs, cost of risk, customer acquisition cost, cost of infrastructure and India stood out to us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113955" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113955" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113955 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-Nigeria.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113955" class="wp-caption-text">FairMoney Nigeria team</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following its expansion six months ago, FairMoney claims to have processed more than half a million loan applications from over 100,000 unique users. This number trickles down to 5,000-6,000 loan applications per day with APR standing at 12-36%. Hainy says the company has achieved this with zero ad spend or marketing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the daunting logistics behind international expansions, it&#8217;s challenging for an African-based startup to expand outside the shores of the continent. Although a rarity, there are a couple of startups to have undertaken such a task. Last year, Nigerian fintech Paga with 15 million users and a network of over 24,000 agents acquired Ethiopian software company Apposit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/nigerias-paga-acquires-apposit-confirms-mexico-and-ethiopia-expansion/">fast-track its expansion</a> into Ethiopia and Mexico. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney is on a similar path, as well. And with over 100 staff spread across Nigeria, France, and Latvia, the company hopes to build an engineering and marketing team in India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, it hired the services of <a href="https://id.linkedin.com/in/rohankhara">Rohan Khara</a> to become its chief product officer (CPO) and facilitate the expansion. Khara was the former head of product for financial services for Indonesian super app Gojek and held senior roles at Microsoft, Quikr and MobiKwik. Hainy says with Khara&#8217;s wealth of experience building consumer products in large emerging markets &#8212; India and Indonesia &#8212; FairMoney is poised for massive growth in Nigeria and India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We both share the vision that financial services in emerging markets need fixing and for us, Rohan brings the expertise to see FairMoney scale from almost a million users to 10 or 20 million users.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113956" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113956" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113956 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Part-of-the-team-France-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113956" class="wp-caption-text">FairMoney French team</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Germany to a Nigerian father and German mother, Hainy began his entrepreneurial journey in 2015 by launching a food delivery company in Sweden. Seven months later, he founded Le Studio VC, a Paris-based startup studio and €15 million fund he ran as CEO for three years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After those three years, I realised that being an investor wasn&#8217;t for me yet. I felt I was too young and I wanted to build something myself,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks like Revolut in the UK and N26 in Germany were picking up across Europe. Hainy wanted to create such for Nigeria after noticing how much people lacked access to affordable financial services during a visit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite studying other neobank models, Hainy and his team couldn&#8217;t replicate them in a developing market like Nigeria. Credit was still significantly underserved by Nigerian banks because of the strict methodology employed in allocating loans. Sensing an opportunity, they launched FairMoney as a neobank by leveraging a credit-first model. Like Nubank in Brazil, FairMoney started off offering loans to solve the access to credit problem. But its broader vision is not to be just a digital bank but also a commercial bank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is working towards getting a microfinance bank license to operate as the former in Nigeria. However, according to the CEO, the commercial bank license will take longer maybe five to ten years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the next five to ten years, I&#8217;d like to think two out of the five largest commercial banks in Nigeria will be neobanks. We want FairMoney to be one of them,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lagos and Paris-based company raised $11 million Series A in 2019. Between now and the time it will get a commercial bank license, Hainy says the company would&#8217;ve raised its Series B round to position itself for that task.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After India, which emerging market will FairMoney expand to next? There&#8217;s none in sight at the moment, the CEO says.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The advance of short videos is reshaping how information is created, disseminated and consumed online. Snappy 15-second videos aren&#8217;t just for entertainment. On Chinese short-video apps Douyin and Kuaishou, people can get their daily dose of news, learn to cook, practice English, hunt for jobs, and seek practically any type of information from the platforms&#8217; quickly expanding content library.</p>
<p>While people are increasingly used to being fed by machine-recommended videos, many users still have the urge and need for active searching. Douyin understood that and incorporated a search function back in mid-2018. More than two years later, the feature reached 550 million monthly active users. There&#8217;s still room for Douyin&#8217;s search feature to grow, as the app last reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/tiktoks-chinese-rival-kuaishou-becomes-a-popular-online-bazaar/">600 million</a> <em>daily</em> users in September, so its monthly user base should be above that.</p>
<p>Kelly Zhang, the young product manager credited for the rise of Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version, <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/w/a6930056075249303552/">disclosed</a> Douyin&#8217;s search user figure for the first time this week on her microblogging account. Search is a territory that had long been dominated by Baidu in China. As of December, Baidu&#8217;s flagship app had 544 million monthly active users, so it&#8217;s safe to say as many people are searching on Douyin as on Baidu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s remark is telling of Douyin&#8217;s ambition in conquering the online video sector, and eventually how people receive information: &#8220;I have said this before: I hope Douyin could become the video encyclopedia for human civilization. Video search is, therefore, the index of the book, the gateway to finding answers and reaping new knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>She further added that Douyin&#8217;s search engine is hiring for research and development, product, and operational roles in the upcoming year (China has just observed the Lunar New Year) as the video app continues to ramp up investment in search capabilities.</p>
<p>Short video platforms are already the second-most popular method for Chinese users to search online, trailing only after general search engines like Baidu and coming ahead of social networks and e-commerce, data analytics firm Jiguang <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RUyiG2o7YfSYvJHEMWsCLw">said</a> in a report last December. Baidu&#8217;s command of search is increasingly limited by the walled gardens built up by Chinese tech titans who block one another from free access to its sites and data. The status quo harms user experience but bodes well for vertical search engines on apps like Douyin and Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao marketplace, and consequently revenues from ad sponsorships.</p>
<p>ByteDance cut its teeth on using machine learning algorithms to recommend content through services like Douyin, TikTok and news aggregator Toutiao. The model proved highly efficient and lucrative, prompting its predecessors from Baidu to Tencent to introduce similarly algorithm-powered content feeds. ByteDance&#8217;s move into search, a realm with a longer history, is an intriguing yet natural step. The firm is just completing the puzzle for its digital media empire, giving people another option to find information. Users can receive machine recommendations and subscribe to content creators if they want. They can as well put in a search keyword if they have one in mind, the good old way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite efforts from companies to create equitable environments, it&#8217;s clear that employees of a certain demographics, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Black</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">women</a>, sometimes have very different experiences from their counterparts. Glassdoor aims to better surface those experiences through a new feature that allows folks to filter ratings by demographics.</p>
<p>Up until now, Glassdoor only presented an overall ranking for a specific company, so there was no way to easily determine if, for example, Black women feel the same as white men, or if Latino men feel similarly to Asian men. In addition to race, Glassdoor now allows people to filter by gender identity, parental or caregiver status, disability, sexual orientation and veteran status.</p>
<p>Overall, Black employees are less satisfied at work in comparison to all employees, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/black-at-work-employee-satisfaction">according to new preliminary research from Glassdoor</a>. The research is based on the more than 187,000 employees across more than 3,300 companies who have provided demographic data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114170" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114170" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2114170" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="300" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=400,680 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114170" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Glassdoor</p></div></p>
<p>That same research showed Apple had the highest overall company rating among Black employees, with an average rating of 4.2 out of five. Apple&#8217;s overall company rating from that sample size is 3.9.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because these data are so new — having been collected within just the last four months — it’s important to resist the urge to make sweeping claims based on early data,&#8221; Glassdoor Data Scientist Amanda Stansell and Chief Economist Andrew Chamberlain said in the report. &#8220;The averages we’ve reported above are not derived from representative probability samples of company workforces — they represent data shared anonymously by Glassdoor users at this time. Readers should therefore take some caution in making conclusive, company-wide inferences about the state of race and employee satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever tried to hop on the bus in San Francisco and were bummed to find that Apple Pay wasn&#8217;t an option (unlike in New York, Beijing, and plenty of other major cities): good news! That&#8217;s changing. Apple has announced that support for Clipper (the payment system for BART, Muni, Caltrain, AC Transit, and a bunch of other Bay Area transit agencies) is officially on the way. You&#8217;ll soon be able to just tap your iPhone or Apple Watch to the card reader and be on your way.</p>
<p>Apple says that Apple Pay will work across all 24 agencies where Clipper is accepted, meaning it should play friendly with:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC Transit</li>
<li>BART</li>
<li>Caltrain</li>
<li>City Coach</li>
<li>County Connection</li>
<li>Dumbarton Express</li>
<li>FAST</li>
<li>Golden Gate Ferry</li>
<li>Golden Gate Transit</li>
<li>Marin Transit</li>
<li>Muni</li>
<li>Petaluma Transit</li>
<li>SamTrans</li>
<li>San Francisco Bay Ferry</li>
<li>Santa Rosa CityBus</li>
<li>SMART</li>
<li>SolTrans</li>
<li>Sonoma County Transit</li>
<li>Tri Delta Transit</li>
<li>Union City Transit</li>
<li>Vine</li>
<li>VTA</li>
<li>WestCAT</li>
<li>Wheels</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple does mention that it&#8217;ll work with the optional &#8220;Express Transit&#8221; feature built into Wallet, allowing you to make these relatively small transit transactions without requiring Face ID or Touch ID verification — a nice touch for when there&#8217;s 10 people waiting to get on behind you and you&#8217;d rather not have to deal with convincing your phone that you are, in fact, you.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So when will it officially roll out? Good question — and one that Apple isn&#8217;t answering yet. In an e-mail announcing the coming Clipper support, they say it&#8217;s &#8220;Coming soon,&#8221; but don&#8217;t get any more specific than that. A tweet from the @BayAreaClipper account, meanwhile, narrows it down to &#8220;this spring&#8221; and reiterates that Google Pay support is coming soon, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of the grant-making associated with the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program, the agency will for the first time carve out some of that program&#8217;s $889 million budget for projects addressing climate change and environmental justice.</p>
<p>The projects will be evaluated on whether they were planned as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change, or whether they support strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as deploying zero-emission-vehicle infrastructure or encouraging shifts in modes of transportation or vehicle miles traveled, <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOT/bulletins/2c222d8/">the agency said in an announcement</a>.</p>
<p>“As we work to recover and emerge from this devastating pandemic stronger than before, now is the time to make lasting investments in our nation’s infrastructure,” said Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a statement. “We are committed to not just rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, but building back in a way that positions American communities for success in the future—creating good paying jobs, boosting the economy, ensuring equity, and tackling our climate crisis. The INFRA grant program is a tremendous opportunity to help achieve these goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Racial equity will also be considered, according to the agency&#8217;s announcement. Requirements will include equity-focused community outreach and projects designed to benefit underserved communities, along with projects that are located in opportunity, empowerment or promise zones or choice neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The new programs show just how quickly federal dollars could be made available to startups that are looking at electrification and provide more strength to the tailwinds already propelling the electric vehicle industry &#8212; and its attendant charging networks moving forward.</p>
<p>Large infrastructure projects could receive grants of $25 million or more while small projects must have grant requirements that meet a minimum threshold of at least $5 million, according to the DOT.</p>
<p>Eligible project costs could include: reconstruction, rehabilitation, acquisition of property (including land related to the project and improvements to the land), environmental mitigation, construction contingencies, equipment acquisition and operational improvements directly related to system performance.</p>
<p>Opportunities <a href="http://www.transportation.gov/INFRA">for applications are going to be open through Friday, March 19</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Facebook cuts off news-sharing in Australia</strong></p>
<p>In response to a proposed law forcing internet platforms to pay news publishers directly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">Facebook announced today</a> that Australian users will not be able to share or view news links.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its post, Facebook drew a direct contrast with the other big company targeted by the law, with managing director for Facebook Australia and New Zealand William Easton writing, &#8220;Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.artie.com">Artie</a>, a startup looking to rethink the distribution of mobile games, announced today that it has raised $10 million in funding.</p>
<p>There are some big names backing the company — its latest investors include Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#8217;s Thirty Five Ventures, Scooter Braun&#8217;s Raised In Space, Shutterstock founder Jon Oringer, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Susquehanna International Group, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment + The Sixers Lab, Googler Manuel Bronstein and YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley.</p>
<p>This actually represents a pivot from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/06/vr-veterans-found-artie-augmented-reality-avatar-company/">Artie&#8217;s original vision of creating augmented reality avatars</a>. CEO Ryan Horrigan said that he and his co-founder/CTO Armando Kirwin ended up building distribution technology that they felt solved &#8220;a much bigger problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem, in part, is game developers &#8220;looking for ways outside of Apple&#8217;s App Stores rules and restrictions.&#8221; (That&#8217;s certainly something Fortnite-maker<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/"> Epic Games seems to be fighting for</a>.) So Artie&#8217;s platform allows users to play mobile games without installing an app, from the browser or wherever links can be shared online.</p>

<p>Artie isn&#8217;t the only startup focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/playco-launch-funding/">the idea of app-less mobile gaming</a>, but Horrigan said that while other companies are limited by JavaScript and HTML5, Artie supports Unity, meaning it can build casual (rather than hyper-casual) games, and eventually games that might even go deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similar to cloud games, we’re running Unity games on our cloud, but rather than rendering their graphics on the cloud and pushing the video to players, we&#8217;re not running graphics on the cloud,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re streaming assets and animations that are highly-optimized and rendered in real-time through the embedded web browser.&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, the goal is to get frictionless distribution outside of app stores, while avoiding some of the issues facing cloud gaming, namely <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/cloudmiles">significant infrastructure costs</a> and lag time.</p>
<p>The startup is developing and releasing games of its own, with an Alice in Wonderland game, a beer pong game and more on the schedule for later this year, then a massively multiplayer online game planned for 2022. But the company also plans to release an SDK allowing other developers to distribute through its platform as well.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VphxhvWSiMc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Horrigan said Artie&#8217;s initial games will be free-to-play, monetized through in-game purchases. They&#8217;ll use cookies to remember where players were in the game, but players will also be able to create logins.</p>
<p>Artie is also developing games with a major music star and a superhero IP-owner, and he argued that by combining no-code/low-code authoring tools with Artie&#8217;s distribution platform, this could become a bigger trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be working with the next generation of influencers to make games using these low-code or no-code solutions, then publish to their audiences directly on YouTube,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine what a branded game would look like from your favorite hip hop star. We think that&#8217;s coming, and we think Artie is the platform to make that happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a collector of audio gear (mostly effects pedals, old rim-drive tape machines and 1980s keyboards I’ve modified), I wish I could say my podcasting setup featured equipment that is extremely expensive and hard to come by. I would love to brag about using, say, hand-wired boutique preamps and a rare Soviet condenser microphone I bought at a military auction in Kazakhstan. Nothing would please me more than to share photographs of a massive reel-to-reel tape machine on which I record my ad reads (for “warmth”) before mixing them down on my laptop.</p>
<p>Alas, my podcasting setup is extremely normal. I have a Scarlett two-channel interface I bought at a chain store. I have a Rode microphone because I couldn’t afford a Shure SM7B. I record into GarageBand, which is the spiral-bound notebook of audio interfaces. The only slightly unusual thing about my podcasting setup is that on the rare occasion when I edit an episode I do so in Ableton Live, which I originally bought years ago when I was obsessed with making mashups.</p>

<p>The only analog affectation I can claim is a shameful one: My laptop is so old the USB ports seem to be going slack &#8212; I’m surprised they don’t have hair growing out of them like old men’s ears &#8212; so I have to fix the line from my Scarlett into place using electrical tape.</p>

The only time we’ve done field recordings was last spring, when Jon and I went on a nerd / comedy cruise in the Caribbean the week COVID hit. We recorded daily dispatches at sea using a Zoom H4N, then wandered around Santo Domingo until we found a university library whose Wi-Fi we could use to upload the files to our co-host and editor Starlee. My phone tells me I walked 24,000 steps that day.</p>

<p>Because my podcasting setup is so boring, I have spiced up the photos by including some of my other audio gear in the shots! When the world is ready for cassette-based podcasts saturated in analog delay, I will be more than happy to oblige!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has suspended the Trump 2020 campaign app from the Google Play Store for policy violations, the company confirmed, following <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/17/donald-trumps-official-app-has-been-suspended-from-the-google-play-store-no-longer-works/">a report from Android Police</a> which noted the app was unable to load any content and appeared to have been taken down. Both the Android version of the app and its iOS counterpart have been left online since the November 2020 elections, but hadn&#8217;t received recent updates &#8212; which likely contributed to the app&#8217;s stability issues.</p>
<p>The Play Store version hadn&#8217;t been updated since October 30, 2020, for example, says app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>According to Android Police&#8217;s report, the app was hanging and couldn&#8217;t load content, and it reported connectivity issues. We understand the issue was as they described &#8212; when users downloaded the app, it would either hang on the initial loading screen with a spinning &#8220;T&#8221; logo or it would immediately report a server error at startup. In either case, it would never load the app experience at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent user reviews on the Play Store noted these issues, saying things like &#8220;<em>will not open,&#8221; &#8220;the app doesn&#8217;t even work,&#8221; &#8220;absolutely terrible doesn&#8217;t even work,&#8221; &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t open keep saying check connections,&#8221;</em> and more. One user even asked the developer to respond to the numerous complaints, saying <em>&#8220;please reply to people commenting. It&#8217;s not loading.&#8221;</em> Another implied the issues were Google&#8217;s fault, noting <em>&#8220;worked great, until Google canceled it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Google, though, did not cancel it. The Trump 2020 Android app has actually been experiencing problems for some time before Google took this action.</p>
<p>For example, a tweet from around a month ago described a similar set of issues:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is the Trump2020 app down?<a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TrumpWarRoom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DanScavino</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JennaEllisEsq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JennaEllisEsq</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DonaldJTrumpJr</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EricTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EricTrump</a> <a href="https://t.co/YGTJrZB66h">pic.twitter.com/YGTJrZB66h</a></p>
<p>&mdash; TexanForTrump. God Bless Trump (@BlueWaterPalms) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueWaterPalms/status/1351137646207266823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google told TechCrunch the app has not been banned from the Play Store, only suspended for its non-functionality. It can be reinstated if the problems are addressed. The company also said it attempted to reach out to the app&#8217;s developer before taking down the app, but never received a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Trump 2020 campaign app recently stopped working and we reached out to the developer multiple times in an attempt to get them to address the issue,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said. &#8220;People expect that apps downloaded from Google Play provide a minimum level of functionality and our policy is to remove non-working apps from the store if they are not fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the issues on Android, we found the iOS version was still able to load upon first launch, and could send confirmation codes to a phone number at sign-up. But when you visited the app&#8217;s main screens, it also now presents an error message. This error doesn&#8217;t affect your ability to browse through the past content on iOS, however.</p>

<p>Sensor Tower tells us the Android version of the Trump 2020 app hadn&#8217;t seen any new installs since February 7, 2021. The firm also noted the Android app had around 840,000 installs compared with close to 1.5 million on iOS.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the Trump 2020 app&#8217;s issues have made headlines.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to last year&#8217;s presidential election in the U.S., a number of TikTok users decided to troll the app in its App Store user reviews. (For some reason, Gen Z users believe a lowly rated app will be automatically removed from the app stores. That&#8217;s not true.) But their efforts at the time were able to bring the app&#8217;s overall star rating down to just 1.2 stars, and eventually forced the Trump 2020 campaign <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/">to reset the app&#8217;s ratings</a>.</p>

<p>Though the election is long over, users have still been leaving bad reviews on the app along with their 1-star ratings. Sometimes, the trolls even attempt a bit of humor in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;App attempted a coup to overthrow my phone&#8217;s operating system,&#8221; said one Play Store reviewer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve suffered enough since 2016,&#8221; said another on iOS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Special purpose acquisition vehicles regained popularity in 2020 as an alternative way to take startups public, and now they are eyeing edtech companies.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spac-churchill-capital-to-merge-with-skillsoft-in-13-billion-deal-2020-10-13">Skillsoft</a> has gone public through Churchill Capital, and Nerdy, parent company of Varsity Tutors, did the same through a reverse merger with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">TPG Pace Tech Opportunities</a>. On the investor side, Edify and Adit EdTech Acquisition are both separate, $200 million <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/education-spac-edify-acquisition-files-for-a-%24200-million-ipo-2020-12-28">SPACs for education companies. </a></p>

<p>But is there anything specific to SPACs that makes them a better route for edtech companies than a traditional IPO or direct listing? To explore the question, I reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlescohn">Chuck Cohn</a>, CEO of Nerdy, which is currently in the process of being SPACed by TPG, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-wolford-37b7915">Susan Wolford</a>, chairperson of Edify Acquisition, a $200 million SPAC for edtech companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/">Nerdy&#8217;s business is growing</a>, but the company doesn&#8217;t expect to be profitable until 2023 and wants to drive revenues up 31% and 43% from its 2020 and 2021 expectations, respectively. Cohn said the balance sheet looks the way it does because they are heavily investing in product and engineering, and focusing on being well-capitalized.</p>
<p>The SPAC, he said, is an opportunity to accelerate Nerdy’s core business: “It’s less about going into the public markets, and more about that this transaction allows us to take an offensive position and lean into the big opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cohn said they pursued a SPAC because it is a faster route to going public. As vaccines roll out, growth in remote learning will slow, which could hurt growth expectations — especially ones as ambitious as Nerdy’s. For that reason, it&#8217;s clear why some edtech companies want to get out to the public markets as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Despite some naysayers, Cohn said SPACs are not being used to prop up companies that can&#8217;t go public through traditional means.</p>
<p>“I think that perception was fair a year ago,” he said. “But if you look at companies that have taken this route recently, including OpenDoor, they are very high quality. There’s a fundamental perception change.” He added that “SPACs have been reaching out over the years,” but the timing felt more fortuitous due to TPG’s interest and track record.</p>
<p>On the other side of the table, Wolford said she is currently searching for an edtech company to bring public on behalf of Edify, a $200 million SPAC she has raised. She noted that PIPE instruments, aka private investments in public entities, have helped de-risk SPACs for the general audience. These instruments have been around for decades, but Wolford said they recently became more mainstream to use in SPACs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
