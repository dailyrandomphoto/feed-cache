										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Round of applause for the <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2020-12-08/revealed-mark-zuckerberg-threatened-to-pull-uk-investment-in-secret-meeting-with-matt-hancock">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> &#8212; which fought for two years to obtain details of a closed door meeting between Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg and the UK secretary of state in charge of digital issues at the time, Matt Hancock (now health secretary).</p>
<p>Freedom of information requests for minutes of the 2018 closed-door meeting between Zuckerberg and Hancock, which took place amist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">Cambridge Analytica</a>-related tensions, were repeatedly refused by the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS).</p>
<p>An order by the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office finally forced the government to hand them over &#8212; with the ICO concluding that<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> transparency and openness are clearly in the public interest where Facebook&#8217;s business and CEO is concerned.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year the UK government set out an intent to regulate online platforms, publishing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">Online Harms White Paper</a> &#8212; which proposes to place a legal duty of care on social media platforms to protect users against a range of harms, from bullying to illegal content. Although there&#8217;s no sign of a draft law.</p>
<p>The government has only said it will lay one before parliament &#8216;as soon as possible&#8217;. (And <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53222665">this summer</a> refused to commit to doing so next year.)</p>
<p>Additional context specific to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/zuckerberg-again-snubs-uk-parliament-over-call-to-testify/">repeatedly refused</a> to appear before the UK parliament&#8217;s DCMS committee in 2018 to answer questions about online disinformation and the role of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/facebook-finally-hands-over-leave-campaign-brexit-ads/">Facebook&#8217;s ad-targeting tools in the UK&#8217;s Brexit referendum</a> &#8212; sending a variety of minions in his stead despite multiple requests for face-time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now clear that Zuckerberg took time to meet privately with Hancock, on the sidelines of the Paris VivaTech conference in late May 2018.</p>
<p>There, according to the minutes obtained by the Bureau, the Facebook CEO accused the UK of having an &#8220;anti-tech government&#8221; &#8212; and joked about making it one of two countries he would not visit. (The other is redacted from the documents but may have been a reference to China.)</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also threatened to pull Facebook&#8217;s investment from the UK &#8212; saying that while it was the &#8220;obvious&#8221; place for them to invest in Europe they were now &#8220;considering looking elsewhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tech giant employs thousands of staff at its London base, which is a major engineering hub for the company.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/facebook-hiring-1-000-more-staff-in-london-a4339666.html">start of this year</a> Facebook announced it would add another 1,000 jobs &#8212; bringing its total headcount up to 4,000+ in the city. A new HQ it&#8217;s preparing in London&#8217;s King&#8217;s Cross, to consolidate its existing London offices, is intended to house 6,000 staff in total when running at full capacity.</p>
<p>Per the minutes, Hancock responded to Zuckerberg by offering &#8220;a new beginning&#8221; for the government&#8217;s relationship with social media platforms &#8212; and offered to change its approach from &#8220;threatening regulation to encouraging collaborative working to ensure legislation is proportionate and innovation-friendly&#8221;.</p>
<p>He is also said to have sought &#8220;increased dialogue&#8221; with Zuckerberg &#8212; in order to &#8220;bring forward the message that he has support from Facebook at the highest level&#8221;.</p>
<p>While Zuckerberg is reported to have expressed support for UK policy and its intent to regulate the Internet &#8212; but said he was &#8220;worried about tone&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to DCMS for comment on the meeting and remarks made by its former digital secretary and to ask why it fought disclosure of the information for two years. We&#8217;ll update this report with any response.</p>
<p>Around the time Zuckerberg met Hancock Facebook employed around 2,300 staff in the UK. The tech giant signed the lease on the King&#8217;s Cross office space in July 2018 &#8212; a few months after Zuckerberg&#8217;s meeting with Hancock &#8212; generating headlines which couched it as a &#8216;<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/facebook-s-move-to-king-s-cross-is-a-major-vote-of-confidence-for-the-capital-a3893796.html">major vote of confidence in the UK capital</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the revelations that Zuckerberg branded the UK &#8220;anti-tech&#8221; and threatened to pull the plug on its local investments, Facebook sent us this statement &#8212; attributed to &#8216;a spokesperson&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook has long said we need new regulations to set high standards across the internet. In fact last year Mark Zuckerberg called on governments to establish new rules around harmful content, privacy, data portability, and election integrity. The UK is our largest engineering hub outside of the US and just this year we created 1,000 new roles in the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also responding to the Bureau&#8217;s story in a series of tweets today, Damian Collins, the former chair of the DMCS committee said the minutes show Facebook did not like the inquiry; and that Zuckerberg was &#8220;determined not to appear as a witness&#8221;.</p>
<p>Collins was highly critical of Zuckerberg&#8217;s refusal to testify to the UK parliament, issuing a summons for him to do so on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/uk-parliaments-call-for-zuckerberg-to-testify-goes-next-level/">May 1, 2018</a> should he ever deign to step onto UK soil, and publicly lambasting the company for displaying an evasive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/01/zuckerberg-must-face-public-scrutiny-over-latest-data-breach-say-uk-mps/">&#8220;pattern of behavior&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The context of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 2018 meeting with Matt Hancock was that it was two months after the Cambridge Analytica scandal had broken and MZ was refusing our requests for him to appear before [DCMS committee] to discuss it,&#8221; Collins tweeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The notes from this meeting clearly show that Mark Zuckerberg was running scared of the DCMS committee investigation on disinformation and fake news and was actively seeking to avoid being questioned by us about what he knew and when about the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cambridge-analytica">Cambridge Analytica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows how afraid Mark Zuckerberg is of scrutiny that Facebook saw questions about the safety of users data on their platform, and how they worked with Cambridge Analytica as an ‘anti-tech’ agenda,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Outstanding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/">questions</a> related to the Cambridge Analytica include how much and when Zuckerberg personally knew about the scandal. It has previously emerged that Facebook staff raised internal alerts about Cambridge Analytica&#8217;s activity as early as September 2015 &#8212; yet the company was not booted off its ad platform until 2018.</p>
<p>A Facebook-instigated post-scandal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/14/facebook-suspends-200-suspicious-apps-out-of-thousands-reviewed-so-far/">app audit</a> has also never fully reported findings.</p>
<p>Nor do we know why the tech giant hired the co-founder of the company that sold user data to Cambridge Analytica &#8212; around the same time it heard about the &#8216;sketchy&#8217; company.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg&#8217;s question dodging over his personal level of responsibility vis-a-vis the scandal has been highly successful, even as his business empire has faced increased scrutiny and lawmakers around the world have new appetite to regulate the Internet.</p>

<p>The UK&#8217;s ICO issue no final report on its own investigation into the data misuse scandal. But in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">letter to the DCMS committee</a> in October it confirmed Facebook user data had been transferred to Cambridge Analytica and incorporated into a pre-existing database containing “voter file, demographic and consumer data for US individuals” &#8212; with the aim of predicting partisanship to target US voters with political messaging.</p>
<p>The ICO’s investigation did not find any evidence that the Facebook data which was sold to Cambridge Analytica had been used to target voters in the UK’s Brexit Referendum vote.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/uk-parliament-calls-for-antitrust-data-abuse-probe-of-facebook/">final report</a> for the disinformation inquiry, the DCMS called for Facebook&#8217;s business to be investigated &#8212; citing competition and data protection concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The AirPods Max are joining the AirPods and AirPods Pro in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> audio accessory lineup. As you can see on the photo, Apple is releasing its first over-ear headphones under the AirPods brand.</p>
<p>The wireless headphones feature active noise cancellation and cost $549. With this product, Apple competes directly with Sony’s and Bose’s wireless headphones — the Sony WH-1000XM4 and Bose 700. Pre-orders start today and they&#8217;ll ship on December 15.</p>
<p>This isn’t the company’s first over-ear headphones as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/">Apple acquired Beats</a> back in 2014. Apple has released new Beats headphones over the past few years. For instance, last year, Apple released the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/beats-brings-noise-canceling-to-its-on-ear-solo-headphones/">Beats Solo Pro</a>, wireless headphones that feature Apple’s H1 chip and cost $300. They also have active noise cancellation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The AirPods Max come in multiple colors — silver, space gray, sky blue, pink and green. They are foldable and can be stored in a case — or, as Apple calls it, a Smart Case.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is all set to conduct a high-altitude test of its Starship rocket – a first for the spacecraft prototype design. The test will see Starship serial number 8 (SN8) fly from SpaceX&#8217;s development site in Cameron County, Texas, climb to a max height of around 41,000 feet, and then return to Earth during a controlled landing using its Raptor engines, if all goes exactly to plan. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has noted that things likely won&#8217;t go exactly to plan with this test, saying he anticipates they&#8217;ll achieve maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336141388379873282?s=20">1/3 of their goals</a> with this attempt.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Starship will be flying with three Raptor engines on board – prior short hop tests of earlier prototypes used just one. It&#8217;ll also involve a key maneuver that the Starship will ultimately be required to get right in order to achieve its reusability goal and return safely through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere when landing – a mid-air belly flop of sorts to orient it correctly to avoid burning up during re-entry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX has flown Starship prototypes to a height of just under 500 feet, and successfully landed both with a controlled descent. This attempt will also include an attempt to relight Starship&#8217;s engines and return it to Earth in a vertical orientation, but those are much less likely to be successful at this stage vs. the earlier stage goals just reaching that max altitude and then ideally completing that &#8216;belly flop&#8217; maneuver. Conducting tests like this with low likelihood of successful outcomes is absolutely par for the course for rocket development programs, but SpaceX is one of the few companies that conducts these out in the open – and perhaps the only that does so with live-streamed access for all.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Starship will prove the central component of a new generation of launch vehicle that SpaceX hopes to use to reach Mars – and to replace all of its current launch activities with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> vehicles, as well as to provide high-altitude point-to-point flights between destinations on Earth for hyper-fast travel. The production Starship will be paired with a Super Heavy rocket for additional thrust for high mass cargo missions and long-duration deep space trips.</p>
<p>The test launch today could happen anytime between roughly 9 AM EST (6 AM PST) and 6 PM EST (3 PM PST), and SpaceX says that it will begin the livestream shortly before the actual launch attempt, so stay tuned to the video above and our Twitter account for updates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies like Stripe and Twilio have changed the game for online businesses by making it easier to integrate payments and communications services into their customer interfaces without having to build those features from the ground up, or make costly investments to integrate them from elsewhere. Today, another startup is launching and announcing some funding in the hopes that it can do the same for financial features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit</a> has built a platform that lets third parties integrate banking services like payment cards, checking accounts, cash advances and money transfers into their own businesses by way of an API. And after quietly building the service (and a customer base) in stealth, the company today is announcing that it is open for business with $18.6 million in funding alongside that to continue growing &#8212; by adding in more features, hiring more people, and securing new users.</p>
<p>The capital is coming from a mix of investors that speak to the company&#8217;s Israeli roots and current San Francisco base. It includes Better Tomorrow Ventures, Aleph, Flourish Ventures, Operator Partners and TLV Partners, as well as 30 angels drawing on a pool of fintech experience among them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Itai Damti, who co-founded the company with Doron Somech (who is the CTO) said that the company&#8217;s mission is to make it easier for companies that have customers already doing some kind of transacting work with customers &#8212; for example, an on-demand transportation company interacting with its fleet of contract drivers; or an online bookkeeping platform providing services to users &#8212; to extend that into a wider and deeper and mor loyal relationship with more financial features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies in the freelancer economy are in the great position to bundle more banking services into their platforms for freelancers,&#8221; Damti said. Indeed many of these have dabbled in the past with providing other services such as payment cards as a way of paying out their commissions. Now, &#8220;it means they can help their freelancers track spending, as well as send payments to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>His belief is that by making it easier to incorporate these features, we will see a veritable explosion of businesses lining up to do so. &#8220;We have already seen a lot of pickup,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Large, incumbent banks have been relatively slow to bring their services up to speed with the pace of change in the world of tech, and that has opened the door to a number of challengers hoping to gain market share by providing more personalised services, more flexibility and better rates, all by way of efficient mobile apps rather than through queues in old buildings.</p>
<p>Unit&#8217;s bet is that there is an even bigger opportunity to provide banking services if you can identify places where people are doing work already. The global health pandemic, in its estimation, has increased that push simply because it&#8217;s bringing more people online than ever before, and they are looking towards the internet to get more work done than ever before.</p>
<p>The catch is that up to now, for companies that are not specifically in the business of fintech to provide those services, the costs &#8212; monetary, time, and labor &#8212; have been too high to make services viable. Unit says that its API-based solution solves that issue:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png 1158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Unit-I-cost-and-time-comparison.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>There are other companies that have identified the opportunity of &#8220;financial services as a service&#8221; and are growing at a fast pace tapping into that market.</p>
<p>One of the most notable, perhaps, is Rapyd, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/rapyd-which-offers-fintech-as-a-service-via-a-single-api-adds-20m-more-to-its-coffers-at-a-1-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last valued at $1.2 billion</a> about a year ago, with backers including the likes of Stripe alongside many other top investors.</p>
<p>Stripe, indeed, itself recently teamed up with banks to start an embedded business banking service of its own, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Treasury</a>, which underscores also the growing competition in this space.</p>
<p>But with ever-more business coming online, for now at least there remains an opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>“Tech and non-financial companies are embedding financial services with an eye towards deepening customer relationships and enhancing unit economics,&#8221; said Emmalyn Shaw of Flourish Ventures in a statement. &#8220;This is a precarious move if not done right. Financial services are carefully regulated, demanding best in class compliance available from Unit. Executives, including Amanda Swoverland, former Chief Risk Officer at Sunrise Bank, position Unit to offer the highest quality compliance and frictionless integration for enterprises of all sizes.”</p>
<p>&#8220;True innovation in financial services requires a technical partner that straddles the finance and the technology part of fintech, and none do it better than Unit. We’ve backed many fintech companies through the years and think many of the next generation of companies will be built on top of Unit,&#8221; added Sheel Mohnot of Better Tomorrow Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lettuce celebrate the rise of indoor agriculture.</p>
<p>In the past few months AppHarvest, a developer of greenhouse tomato farms went public through a special purpose acquisition vehicle, vertical farming giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/plenty-has-raised-over-500-million-to-grow-fruits-and-veggies-indoors/">Plenty raised $140 million</a>, and now Gotham Greens, which is developing its own network of greenhouses, is announcing the close of $87 million in new funding.</p>
<p>These new agriculture companies certainly have a green thumb when it comes to raising a cornucopia of capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gotham-greens" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gotham-greens">Gotham Greens <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest round takes the company to a whopping total of $130 million in funding since its launch. Investors in the round included Manna Tree and The Silverman Group.</p>
<p>While App Harvest has taken to tomatoes in its attempt to ketchup with the leading agricultural companies, Gotham <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/greens-2857" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="greens-2857">Greens <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has decided to let its hydroponically grown leafy greens lead the way to riches.</p>
<p>The company said it would use the latest funding to continue developing more greenhouse across the U.S. and bring new vegetables to market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given increasing challenges facing centralized food supply chains, combined with rapidly shifting consumer preferences, Gotham Greens is focused on expanding its regional growing operations and distribution capabilities at one of the most critical periods for America,” said Viraj Puri, the co-founder and chief executive of Gotham Greens, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>The company already sells its greens in over 40 states and operates greenhouses in<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chicago, Providence, R.I., Baltimore and Denver. From those greenhouses the company distributes to 2,000 retail locations including Whole Foods Markets, Albertsons stores, Meijer, Target, King Soopers, Harris Teeter, ShopRite and Sprouts. </span></p>
<p>And Gotham Greens has already begun to expand its product portfolio. The company now sells packaged salads, cooking sauces, and salad bowls in addition to its greens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.carsome.my/">Carsome</a>, which bills itself as Southeast Asia’s largest e-commerce platform for used cars, announced it has closed a $30 million Series D. The funding was led by Asia Partners, with participation from returning investors Burda Principal Investments and Ondine Capital.</p>
<p>The startup described this as one of the largest &#8220;all-equity financings to date in Southeast Asia’s online automotive industry.&#8221; Part of the Series D may be used for mergers and acquisitions to consolidate the company&#8217;s supply chain.</p>
<p>Founded five years ago in Malaysia, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/carsome" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="carsome">Carsome’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> platform serves both C2C and B2C segments, and ensures quality by conducting inspections before vehicles are listed on its platform. It now has 1,000 employees and claims to transact 70,000 cars on an annualized basis, totaling $600 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press statement, co-founder and group chief executive officer Eric Cheng said that the company, which now also operates in Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, doubled its monthly revenue over the past six months, compared to pre-pandemic levels. The company says that this is partly because more people and businesses are buying their own cars for safety reasons.</p>
<p>While sales of new vehicles have plummeted around the world, used car sales, especially through e-commerce platforms, are recovering more quickly, <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/weekly-updates-covid-19-impact-global-automotive-industry/">according to Counterpoint Research</a>. This largely because people want to avoid public transportation and ride-hailing, but also want cheaper options.</p>
<p>Other used car platforms in Southeast Asia include Carro, OLX Autos (formerly called BeliMobilGue) and Carmudi.</p>

<p>The instant messaging platform, where <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">business accounts already process messages from more than 175 million people, said it is adding carts to WhatsApp around the world ahead of the holiday shopping season.</span></p>
<p>Carts are aimed at making it easier for consumers to buy multiple items from a business, and for merchants to keep better track of order inquiries and manage requests. WhatsApp said it is adding the new feature after early positive response from some businesses who tested it recently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On WhatsApp, users will now see the option to add items to the cart. When done, users will be able to send the order request as a message to the business. WhatsApp said carts are going live for users across the globe today. (You can read the complete how-to flow <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-place-an-order-using-cart">here</a>.)</p>

It has unveiled QR codes, a dedicated shopping button, and the ability to share catalog links in chats. The platform is also offering free storage to merchants to host their business’s messages.</p>
<p>For WhatsApp, success with commerce is crucial. Despite its gigantic reach, it currently makes little to no money. The messaging app is available to users at no charge and also remains free of ads. But it stands to become a viable challenger to giants like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Walmart in at least emerging markets like India where e-commerce is still at a nascent phase.</p>
<p>In India, which happens to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/">WhatsApp’s biggest market by users</a>, several businesses have kickstarted their journey on the Facebook-owned app. On Tuesday, DealShare, an Indian e-commerce startup, said it had raised $21 million in a new financing round. DealShare <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dealshare-raises-21-million-to-expand-its-e-commerce-platform-to-100-indian-cities-and-towns/">began its life on WhatsApp</a>. But as commerce on WhatsApp gains traction, it might also pose a big challenge to emerging startups that are attempting to operate in the same space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Saw this feature recently and told my team that I am concerned for future of e-commerce startups in Africa. Whatsapp is a threat to anything you are building.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But one big element that remains missing from WhatsApp&#8217;s shopping experience is support for payments. As of today, when a user places an order with a business on WhatsApp, both parties are left on their own to figure out how money will exchange hands.</p>
<p>WhatsApp hasn&#8217;t had much luck with adding payments to its app so far. It was only recently that India permitted WhatsApp to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/">roll out payments on its app to a larger subset of users</a>. Brazil is the other market where WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/whatsapp-finally-launches-payments-starting-in-brazil/">rolled out payments this year</a>, though the South American nation took no time in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/brazil-orders-to-suspend-whatsapp-pay-week-after-rollout/">suspending the new service</a>. Perhaps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/facebooks-libra-could-launch-in-january/">Libra is the answer</a>?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Opendoor has opened the door, so to speak, for startups to apply their technical expertise in search, marketplaces and audience segmentation to rethink the very antiquated and analogue world of property. Today, a startup that is doing this in the specific area of distressed property is announcing a round of growth funding to ramp up its team and expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://sundae.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sundae</a> &#8212; which has built a marketplace for homeowners to list and sell dated or damaged homes, or homes that they may need to shift faster for financial reasons; for property investors/developers seeking to buy, fix up and then sell or rent out those properties; and for itself potentially to buy in a property and do the same &#8212; is today announcing that it has raised a Series B of $36 million.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by QED Investors; Founders Fund, Susa Ventures, Navitas Capital, and Prudence Holdings also participated. All are previous investors from the startup&#8217;s last round, a $16.55 million Series A also led by QED.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview, CEO and co-founder Josh Stech, who describes the business he is in as the &#8220;homes that need love segment&#8221;, declined to talk about the company&#8217;s valuation, and he also declined to give specifics on a number of other points: Sundae is not disclosing how many homeowners and developers have used its service (&#8220;thousands&#8221;); the average selling price for a property; the number of properties it&#8217;s shifted; and how many of those it&#8217;s bought it versus sold to a third party (the &#8220;vast majority&#8221;, more than 50% but less than 100%, are purchased by investors, not Sundae itself, he said).</p>
<p>He did note that in the four markets where the company has gone live since launching its business in January 2019 &#8212; San Diego, Los Angeles, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inland Empire</a>, and Sacramento &#8212; has yielded an annualized revenue run rate of over $400 million in gross merchandise value (the total value of home sales transacted on its platform). That also speaks to the vast and interesting quantity of data that the startup is amassing on home sales, and how it can use that to power its platform in the future.</p>
<p>And as another measure of its momentum, that this latest round comes less than six months after its Series A.</p>
<p>With those two funding rounds all equity-based, to buy up property itself and provide $10,000 cash advances to all sellers, Sundae previously also raised a debt fund from high net worth individuals, and it has a &#8220;very large&#8221; debt facility from Goldman Sachs that it also non-dilutive, Stech said.</p>
<p>The opportunity that Sundae is tackling is one that has been a persistent cornerstone of the housing market, but one that might have become an even more keen factor in the last year.</p>
<p>In the US, there has long been a relentless push, both in newer cities with more room for geographical expansion and older cities where you have legacy buildings that get demolished, a drive for new-build homes. Interestingly, that demand has grown a lot during the pandemic, with demand for new homes <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as much as four times higher</a> than demand for buying &#8220;existing&#8221; homes.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there has been a quickly dwindling supply of any housing stock, going down to as low as one month in terms of sales pace. As Stech puts it, that means that &#8220;In 30 days, if no homes get listed, there are no homes for sale.&#8221; That subsequently has put more of an emphasis on the sale of older homes to meet demand.</p>
<p>The issue with distressed property is that typically these days, people are not as interested in buying fixer-uppers as they may have been in the past. Those selling property want to present ready-to-inhabit homes for a quicker turnaround and to lower the barrier to sales. This means that usually distressed homes, where the owner either doesn&#8217;t want to or can&#8217;t make improvements before listing, are rejected for sale.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s presented an opportunity for developers (or as they are more commonly called in the US, property investors) who buy up those properties and put in the work themselves to make them more sales-friendly. They operate on the principle of five F&#8217;s: &#8220;find, finance, fix, fill or flip&#8221; as Stech puts it.</p>
<p>Sundae basically removes the friction both for the homeowners and the developers: those who want to sell their homes only have to deal with one entity, Sundae itself, which comes in to photograph (using Matterport) the property, provide some guidance on how to sell it and at what price, offer an advance on the sale in case the owner needs the money even faster, and ultimately bring in a number of interested prospects, including itself.</p>
<p>Those who are looking for investment properties can use the service to widen the funnel of homes that they can discover, buy and work on.</p>
<p>Stech said he had a brainwave about the opportunity when he finished graduate school at Stanford and moved to Las Vegas, which at the time was at the epicenter of the housing market crash of 2009. He bought a one-bedroom condo that sold for $267,000 in 2007 for $19,000 in cash and realized that the market was ripe for the taking.</p>
<p>It was a brainwave that came in part because of his experience. Stech has spent his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshstech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole professional life</a> in property. Before Sundae, he and co-founder Andrew Swain were executives at LendingHome, providing loans to property investors; and before that Stech built a property business in Vegas.</p>
<p>There is admittedly something a little unsettling about any kind of business that focuses on distress: the implication is that those building services for people who are in difficult circumstances can take advantage of them and essentially operate in a predatory way.</p>
<p>Stech said that his intention is in fact to prevent that very situation, by creating a more transparent process where sellers are given the option of considering offers from multiple developers rather than just one that is not going to be operating with the seller&#8217;s interests in mind, but his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shameful what property developers have become,&#8221; Stech said. &#8220;The idea has become glamorized, and they make a ridiculous amount of money. Everyone forgets who lost in the process: the homeowner who is probably being forced to sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that selling on a marketplace will remove that self-interest but it creates the option for more balanced dynamics where a seller might at least have more competition to consider. If especially tight markets like London&#8217;s are any example, in the best case scenarios sellers sitting in a property might even make an excellent turnaround on their homes, compared to the sums they initially paid to buy them, even if the home might still need a lot of &#8220;love&#8221; to become habitable by gentrified comparisons.</p>
<p>All of this is especially interesting in light of the bigger forces at play, which have brought us all closer to staying put in one place more than being nomadic, heightening the bigger urge to buy property rather than rent if we can manage it financially.</p>
<p>“The concept of homeownership is fundamentally changing. This is particularly true given COVID-19 which has caused more uncertainty and forced people to rethink their real estate decisions. Homeowners are looking for solutions that make the selling process more efficient, transparent, and reliable, particularly for the distressed property segment,” said Frank Rotman, founding partner at QED Investors, in a statement. “Sundae’s rapid growth is a testament to their differentiated offering and the trusted brand they’ve created through a customer-centric approach to the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Engineers at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Apple say they&#8217;ve developed a new internet protocol that will shore up one of the biggest holes in internet privacy that many don&#8217;t know even exists. Dubbed Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS, or ODoH for short, the new protocol makes it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/24/thai-billions-internet-records-leak/">far more difficult for internet providers</a> to know which websites you visit.</p>
<p>But first, a little bit about how the internet works.</p>
<p>Every time you go to visit a website, your browser uses a DNS resolver to convert web addresses to machine-readable IP addresses to locate where a web page is located on the internet. But this process is not encrypted, meaning that every time you load a website the DNS query is sent in the clear. That means the DNS resolver — which might be your internet provider unless you&#8217;ve changed it — knows which websites you visit. That&#8217;s not great for your privacy, especially since your internet provider can also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/">sell your browsing history</a> to advertisers.</p>
<p>Recent developments like DNS-over-HTTPS (or DoH) have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/isp-group-mozilla-internet-villain-dns-privacy/">added encryption to DNS queries</a>, making it harder for attackers to hijack DNS queries and point victims to malicious websites instead of the real website you wanted to visit. But that still doesn&#8217;t stop the DNS resolvers from seeing which website you&#8217;re trying to visit.</p>
<p>Enter ODoH, which decouples DNS queries from the internet user, preventing the DNS resolver from knowing which sites you visit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: ODoH wraps a layer of encryption around the DNS query and passes it through a proxy server, which acts as a go-between the internet user and the website they want to visit. Because the DNS query is encrypted, the proxy can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s inside, but acts as a shield to prevent the DNS resolver from seeing who sent the query to begin with.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ODoH is meant to do is separate the information about who is making the query and what the query is,&#8221; said Nick Sullivan, Cloudflare&#8217;s head of research.</p>
<p>In other words, ODoH ensures that only the proxy knows the identity of the internet user and that the DNS resolver only knows the website being requested. Sullivan said that page loading times on ODoH are &#8220;practically indistinguishable&#8221; from DoH and shouldn&#8217;t cause any significant changes to browsing speed.</p>
<p>A key component of ODoH working properly is ensuring that the proxy and the DNS resolver never &#8220;collude,&#8221; in that the two are never controlled by the same entity, otherwise the &#8220;separation of knowledge is broken,&#8221; Sullivan said. That means having to rely on companies offering to run proxies.</p>
<p>Sullivan said a few partner organizations are already running proxies, allowing for early adopters to begin using the technology through <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">Cloudflare&#8217;s existing 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver</a>. But most will have to wait until ODoH is baked into browsers and operating systems before it can be used. That could take months or years, depending on how long it takes for ODoH to be certified as a standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With nearly half a million customers across Mexico already and a network of 30,000 retail locations where representatives can take deposits, the challenger bank <a href="https://www.albo.mx/">albo</a> is already on its way to becoming a dominant player in Mexico&#8217;s emerging fintech industry.</p>
<p>And the company has recently raised another $45 million to consolidate its position.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your mission is to build the biggest bank in Mexico, you will need a ton of money,&#8221; said albo founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/angel-912d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="angel-912d">Angel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sahagún.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company received its license to operate as a full depository bank in Mexico, and is slowly working toward being the premiere internet-based financial services provider for Mexico&#8217;s large and growing middle class, Sahagún said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are targeting a similar target market to Chime,&#8221; the albo founder and chief executive said. &#8220;We are targeting people who are underbanked and don’t have access to all the financial products in the market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sahagún said the money will be used to expand the range of services albo offers into lending and insurance products. That&#8217;s a path which has already produced one multi-billion dollar business in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nubank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nubank">Nubank, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Brazil&#8217;s wildly successful fintech company, which planted a flag for a new generation of Latin American startups.</p>
<p>While many challenger banks in the region pursued a strategy targeting upper class and upper middle class consumers, Sahagún said his service had chosen a different path.</p>
<p>The company is trying to bring the middle and low income Mexican consumers into the banking system by making it easy for them to move from a cash-based world to a digital one. &#8220;Where 90% of transactions are cash-based you need a value proposition that fits very well on that cash-based society,&#8221; Sahagún said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why the company set up a network of 30,000 locations including convenience stores and drug stores so that it can accept deposits at the places where its customers frequent.</p>
<p>That growth, and the company&#8217;s 40% share of the digital banking market in Mexico, according to data from Apptopia cited by the company, is why investors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/valar-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="valar-ventures">Valar Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/greyhound-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="greyhound-capital">Greyhound Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Mountain Nazca and Flourish Ventures were willing to invest as part of the $45 million round.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“albo has proven its ability to drive sustainable growth and is leading the market. This is the team that is going to transform banking in the region and we are proud to be supporting them in that”, said James Fitzgerald of Valar Ventures, in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reliance’s Jio Platforms, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/reliance-jio-tops-400m-subscribers-abu-dhabi-authority-pif-fibre-business-investment/">largest telecom operator in India</a>, plans to roll out a 5G network in the country in the second half of 2021, top executive Mukesh Ambani announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“India is today among the best digitally connected nations in the world. In order to maintain this lead, policy steps are needed to accelerate early rollout of 5G, and to make it affordable and available everywhere. I assure you that Jio will pioneer the 5G revolution in India in the second half of 2021,” said Ambani, who controls Jio Platforms’ parent firm Reliance Industries, at a trade conference.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as a surprise as India has yet to grant spectrum for 5G network to telecom networks in the country. At this moment, it is also unclear when India will begin auctioning the 5G spectrum.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ambani, who is India’s richest man, said he was hopeful that the rollout of 5G network in India will enable the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to lead what he termed as the fourth industrial revolution. “Jio Platforms, with its family of over 20 start-up partners, has built world-class capabilities in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, internet of things, blockchain, etc,” he said.</p>
<p>The telecom operator, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">raised over $20 billion this year</a> from a roster of high-profile investors including Facebook and Google, said the company is also hopeful that its bouquet of services in education, healthcare, financial services and new commerce categories “once proven in India, will be offered to the rest of the world to address global challenges.”</p>
<p>Gopal Vittal, the chief executive of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bharti-airtel-ltd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bharti-airtel-ltd">Airtel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (India’s second largest telecom operator), said the company was hopeful that India would have established a nation-wide 5G network in two to three years. He, however, did not share a timeline for when the rollout of 5G on his network would begin. (In a recent earnings call, Vittal had warned that the proposed price of the spectrum of 5G was “very, very expensive” &#8212; something that won’t support any kind of business model.)</p>
<p>During his speech, Ambani also urged industry players to rely on locally produced hardware and components. “As the digitalisation of the Indian economy and Indian society picks up speed, the demand for digital hardware will grow enormously. We cannot rely on large-scale imports in this area of critical national need.”</p>
<p>Airtel has previously said that it is open to the idea of collaborating with global firms for components. “Huawei, over the last 10 or 12 years, has become extremely good with their products to a point where I can safely today say their products at least in 3G, 4G that we have experienced is significantly superior to Ericsson and Nokia without a doubt. And I use all three of them,&#8221; said Sunil Mittal, the founder of Airtel, at a conference earlier this year. In the same panel, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross had urged India and other allies of the US to avoid Huawei.</p>
<p>Vittal today also urged that India should adopt the global 5G standard. “There is sometimes talks that India must have its own 5G standard. This is an existential thread which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation. We could let down our citizens if you allow that to happen.”</p>
<p>On today’s panel, which was attended by Mittal as well as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ambani said stakeholders also need to think about ways to serve nearly 300 million people who are still on 2G networks in India. “Urgent policy steps are needed to ensure that these underprivileged people have an affordable smartphone, So that they too can benefit from Direct Benefit Transfer into their bank accounts, and actively participate in the Digital Economy,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Seattle-based startup <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.recurrentauto.com"><span>Recurrent</span></a><span> said today it has closed on $3.5 million in financing as it looks to become the Carfax for electric vehicle batteries. </span></p>
<p>The battery system is arguably the most important part of any electric vehicle and as the market for used electric vehicles expands, independent verification on battery life and range can help car buyers with their purchasing decision, the company said.</p>
<p>Investors including Wireframe Ventures, PSL Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vulcan-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vulcan-capital">Vulcan Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Prelude Ventures, Powerhouse Ventures, Ascend.VC and the American Automobile Association&#8217;s (AAA) Washington chapter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Used car sales are at least double new car sales every year. With the third anniversary of Tesla’s Model 3 and the rapid introduction of new electric models across all vehicle makers, used EV sales are about to grow substantially,” said Paul Straub, Managing Director of Wireframe Ventures, said in a statement. “The timing is right for a first mover with a strong data and technology advantage to bring confidence and transparency to these transactions.”</span></p>
<p>The company said it will use the money to invest in continued product development as it refines its third-party condition reports for used electric vehicle shoppers and battery analytics stats for current electric vehicle owners.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/recurrent" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="recurrent">Recurrent <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> collects its data from 2,500 volunteer electric vehicle drivers who currently use the Recurrent service for monthly battery reports on their own vehicles</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While there’s clearly a market-driven opportunity here, we’re particularly excited about the potential impact of Biden administration’s policies on EV adoption,” said Emily Kirsch, Founder and Managing Partner of Powerhouse Ventures, said in a statement. “We’ve seen the huge impact that favorable policies are having in the EU and think there’s a lot of upside potential in a similar acceleration in the U.S.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German e2e encrypted email provider <a href="https://tutanota.com">Tutanota</a> has been ordered by a regional court to develop a function that allows it to monitor an individual account.</p>
<p>The encrypted email service provider has been fighting a number of such orders in its home country.</p>
<p>The ruling, which was reported in the German press<a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Gericht-zwingt-Mailprovider-Tutanota-zu-Ueberwachungsfunktion-4972460.html"> late last month</a>, contradicts an earlier <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">Hanover court finding</a> that Tutanota, a provider of web-based email, is not a telecommunications service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The order by the Cologne court comes under a German law (known as &#8220;TKG&#8221;) which requires telecommunications service providers to disclose data to law enforcement/intelligence agencies if they receive a lawful intercept request.</p>
<p>The Cologne court ruling also runs counter to a <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=214944&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=9098754">2019 decision</a> by Europe&#8217;s top court, the CJEU, which found that another web-based email service, Gmail, is not an &#8216;electronic communications service&#8217; as defined in EU law &#8212; meaning it can&#8217;t be subject to common EU rules for telcos.</p>
<p>Tutanota co-founder Matthias Pfau described the Cologne ruling as &#8220;absurd&#8221; &#8212; and confirmed it&#8217;s appealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The argumentation is as follows: Although we are no longer a provider of telecommunications services, we would be involved in providing telecommunications services and must therefore still enable telecommunications and traffic data collection,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;From our point of view &#8212; and law German law experts agree with us &#8212; this is absurd. Neither does the court state what telecommunications service we are involved in nor do they name the actual provider of the telecommunications service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telecommunications service cannot be email, because we provide it completely ourselves. And if we were to participate, we would have to have a business relationship with the actual provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the absurdity of a regional court treating an email provider as an ISP &#8212; in apparent contradiction of earlier CJEU guidance &#8212; Tutanota is nonetheless required to comply with the order, and develop a surveillance function for the specific inbox, while its appeal continues.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Tutanota confirmed it has told the court it will develop the function by the end of this year &#8212; whereas she suggested its appeals process is likely to take &#8220;months&#8221; more to run its course.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to the higher court in parallel. We are already preparing an appeal to the Bundesgerichtshof [Germany&#8217;s Federal Court of Justice],&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The Cologne court order is for a surveillance function to be implemented on a single Tutanota account that had been used for an extortion attempt. The Tutanota spokeswoman said the monitoring function will only apply to future emails this account receives &#8212; it will not affect emails previously received.</p>
<p>She added that the account in question appears to no longer be in use.</p>
<p>While after-the-fact monitoring seems unlikely to make any difference to the specific case the suspicion is that court wants to create a precedence &#8212; raising the hackles of security watchers who are worried about the risk of digital service providers being compelled to bake backdoors into their services in the region.</p>
<p>Last month a <a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">draft resolution</a> of the Council of the European Union triggered substantial concern that EU lawmakers are considering a ban on e2e encryption as part of an anti-terrorism security push. However the draft document discussed only &#8220;lawful and targeted access&#8221; &#8212; while expressing support for &#8220;strong encryption&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9hLEVSWVYi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">What&#8217;s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/embed/#?secret=9hLEVSWVYi" data-secret="9hLEVSWVYi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Returning to the Tutanote surveillance order, it can only be made to apply to unencrypted emails linked to the specific account.</p>
<p>This is because the email service provider applies e2e encryption to its own users&#8217; content &#8212; meaning it does not hold decryption keys so is unable to decrypt the data &#8212; though it also allows users to receive emails from email services that do not apply e2e encryption (hence it can be compelled to provide that data in plain text).</p>
<p>However, if the EU were to legislate to compel e2e encryption service providers to provide decrypted data in response to lawful intercept requests, it would effectively outlaw the use of e2e encryption.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the scenario of most concern &#8212; though no such law has yet been proposed by any EU institutions. (And would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/european-meps-want-to-ban-states-from-backdooring-encryption/">very likely face fierce opposition in the European parliament</a>, as well as more broadly, from academia, civil society, consumer protection, and privacy and digital rights groups, among others.)</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to the ruling of the Cologne Regional Court, we were obliged to release unencrypted incoming and outgoing emails from one mailbox. Emails that are encrypted end-to-end in Tutanota cannot be decrypted by us, not even after the court order,&#8221; noted Pfau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Tutanota is one of the few mail providers that encrypts the entire mailbox, also calendar and contacts. The encrypted data cannot be decrypted by us, because only the user has the key to decrypt it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This decision shows again why end-to-end encryption is so important,&#8221; he added. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nielsen" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nielsen">Nielsen <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is updating its TV ratings to reflect a world which audiences are watching TV both live and on-demand, across a variety of different streaming services and devices.</p>
<p>While the firm has long provided the standard measure for TV audiences, things are more fragmented when it comes to digital viewing. So the upcoming Nielsen One platform isn&#8217;t just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/nielsen-digital-methodology/">another digital measurement product</a> — it&#8217;s an update to Nielsen&#8217;s core metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main objective is, we want measurement to be no longer be a barrier to cross-media [ad] buying,&#8221; said Scott Brown, Nielsen&#8217;s general manager of audience measurement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So when Nielsen One launches in fall 2022, the numbers that Nielsen reports about a TV program&#8217;s viewership should reflect the true size of the audience, not just the number of people watching on traditionally.</p>
<p>And given the online world&#8217;s programmatic ad-buying, as well as similar tools beginning to expand into linear traditional TV, Brown said it&#8217;s also time to abandon the idea that &#8220;everybody sees the same ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means the platform will be &#8220;moving away from&#8221; Nielsen&#8217;s C3 and C7 ratings, which are supposed to measure how many people saw a TV program&#8217;s ads within three and seven days of airing, respectively. Brown said Nielsen One will be much more granular, measuring how many people saw each ad across different platforms: &#8220;Each individual advertisement will get an audience estimate number,&#8221; with the goal of fully abandoning the older metrics by fall 2024.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083949" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083949" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2083949" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg?w=680" alt="Nielsen One" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nielsen_One.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083949" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nielsen</p></div></p>
<p>The Nielsen One launch will also include what Brown called a &#8220;new data backbone,&#8221; allowing the firm&#8217;s clients to get more direct access to the data that Nielsen uses to report these numbers.</p>
<p>To offer this data, Nielsen will continue relying on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/about-us/panels/">the panels</a> that it uses to create its existing TV ratings, except Brown said the data will now be &#8220;truly cross-platform.&#8221; The firm will be drawing additional data from its partners, who already include Amazon, Hulu, Roku, Vizio and Google/YouTube.</p>
<p>Brown suggested that with many networks and media companies launching or acquiring streaming services of their own, all of them should want to work with Nielsen to validate their viewership and ads — though some, like Netflix and Disney+, have less of an incentive since their business models rely on subscriptions, not ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone will be measured,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ones that lean in and do an integration with us will get more granular measurement and more comprehensive coverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also brought up one of the big debates in the online world: With Facebook counting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/743427195703387">three seconds of viewing time</a> as a video play, while Netflix focuses on viewers who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/netflix-q4-earnings-3/">&#8220;chose to watch&#8221; at least two minutes of a show</a>, what actually constitutes an impression?</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a final answer in terms of, this is what we&#8217;re rolling out,&#8221; Brown said. Instead, Nielsen plans to create a working group to hash this out next year. And in the meantime, it&#8217;s building technology that will &#8220;measure on a second-by-second level of granularity,&#8221; allowing the platform to support whatever the final rule might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s fragmented measurement landscape makes planning, implementing, and validating cross-platform campaigns overly complex and increasingly less predictable,&#8221; said Adam Gerber, chief media officer at the agency Essence, in a statement. &#8220;As we shift to addressable models, prioritize reach, and optimize to outcomes, it&#8217;s critical that we develop and adopt consistent, single-source measurement solutions. <span class="il">Nielsen</span>’s new cross-media approach is an important step in delivering the confidence and transparency that advertisers require to support holistic campaigns.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The old saw about finding a place where companies still use spreadsheets, and then building a startup to solve the problem, was a good way to dream up new software as a service (SaaS) companies. But the next generation of that idea may be to instead find a place where data is locked, fragmented or both, and build an API to unleash the information.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thesis behind companies that TechCrunch has covered like <a href="https://www.noyo.com/">Noyo</a>, which wants to free health insurance data and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/noyo-raises-12-5m-series-a-to-keep-building-its-health-insurance-api-business/">raised $12.5 million in September</a>. And it&#8217;s the apparent concept behind <a href="https://tryfinch.com/">Finch</a>, a recent Y Combinator graduate that is looking to liberate HR and payroll data.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/general-catalyst-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="general-catalyst-partners">General Catalyst <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the round, which saw participation from a number of industry executives, including the founders from Ramp and Brex, two competing startups, and Digits. The company&#8217;s round comes after the startup had targeted a smaller, $1.5 million sum but wound up taking more capital aboard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/trio-4ceb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="trio-4ceb">Finch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/jerzzhang">Jeremy Zhang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansel-parikh/">Ansel Parikh</a>. Zhang moved from robot R&amp;D for a big tech company to <a href="https://smartcar.com/">SmartCar</a>, which is building an API for what it self-describes as &#8220;mobility applications.&#8221; Parikh, Zhang told TechCrunch, worked in venture on API-related deals. So, the pair had experience with startup products that were delivered through a developer endpoint, not by an application coupled to a contract.</p>
<p>Zhang and Parik initially worked on a product that would have allowed other companies to embed consumer lending into their own service. But, in Zhang&#8217;s telling, the pair ran into the pandemic, the early period of which was anathema to interest in extending more credit to regular folks. (Notably <a href="https://www.upstart.com/">Upstart</a>, a fintech focused on facilitating consumer lending, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/inside-fintech-startup-upstarts-ipo-filing/">in the process of going public</a>; how rapidly 2020 has spun industries around.)</p>
<p>However, a design partner wanted to offer PPP loans to SMBs on its platform, so the pair wound up looking into what was required for the project on the data side of the ask; Finch was born out of those learnings.</p>
<p>Finch connects customers to payroll and HR data via an API, offering both a free version of its product to entice developers, and a paid version of the product that is priced either as a pay-as-you-go service, or with a SaaS-like pricing provision.</p>
<p>Something notable about Finch is its age. Even for a startup, it&#8217;s young. The founding group put up a landing page for the company in April, and wrote the first code for the project in July. That&#8217;s rapid scaling from zero to in-market traction. Today Finch is growing 50% month-over-month in terms of both revenue and &#8220;employers connected,&#8221; giving it the sort of growth that investors flock to.</p>
<p>What might one be able to build with Finch&#8217;s API? Past a few basic ideas, my brain was bereft, so I asked Zhang to dole out the future to me. In the co-founder&#8217;s estimation, there are three core buckets where Finch can have a role: financial software, inside the lending and insurances spaces, and supporting the burgeoning HR and benefits software market.</p>
<p>In each area, having access to what Zhang called a &#8220;source of truth,&#8221; namely HR and payroll data about employees and their employment, would allow other companies to better make decisions; tenure at a job could help one determine creditworthiness, HR services need to know who works where, and in the realm of finance apps that are working to help or supplant CFOs need to understand current headcount.</p>
<p>Still, Finch&#8217;s path won&#8217;t be an easy one. Part of the problem that its founders discovered is that there are myriad payroll and HR systems. Building out an API to support as many as its market requires will take time and investment. Raising more capital than it initially intended will help, we&#8217;re sure, but even with deeper coffers, the scale of the challenge in front of the young company will require yeoman&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that it can support the systems of 1.4 million employers today, though it intends to &#8220;10x&#8221; that number in the next year. Finch&#8217;s capital event is similar to the round raised recently by fellow YC graduate <a href="https://www.buildbuddy.io/">BuildBuddy</a>, a SaaS play, in which both startups took aboard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">more than $3 million</a> in funding after initially targeting a raise in the $1 million range.</p>
<p>The startup has six staff today, with Zhang expecting the the company to scale to 15 or 20 by the end of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dragos" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dragos">Dragos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $110 million in its Series C, almost triple the amount that it raised two years ago in its last round.</p>
<p>Dragos was founded in 2016 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dragos-premium-people-profits/">detect and respond to threats</a> facing industrial control systems (ICS), the devices critical to the continued operations of power plants, water and energy supplies, and other critical infrastructure. The company&#8217;s threat detection platform — its moneymaker — helps companies with industrial control systems defend against hackers trying to get into important operational systems. Its platform kicks out hackers that could shut down manufacturing lines or control energy supply systems, while its research arm keeps tabs on the hackers that can break into these highly complex and segmented industrial networks in the first place.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s latest round was led by National Grid Partners and Koch Disruptive Technologies, with both firms adding a member each to Dragos&#8217; board. The round also saw participation from Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as well as return investors Allegis Cyber, Canaan Partners, DataTribe, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/energy-impact-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="energy-impact-partners">Energy Impact Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Schweitzer Engineering Labs.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding will help the company with its go-to-market efforts, as well as growing its customer support team with 30 staff and building up its sales and marketing team. Lee said the company&#8217;s priority had been to work on its threat platform, and less selling it.</p>
<p>About one-third of the company&#8217;s employees work in software engineering to build its threat platform.</p>
<p>Dragos founder and chief executive Robert Lee said the pandemic, which forced vast swathes of the world to work remotely from home under lockdown restrictions, served as a wake-up call for companies with critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re talking about critical infrastructure sites and people&#8217;s utilities, you need to put your best foot forward on the tech first,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many companies were already trying to adapt with the digital age, but Lee said many companies realized they had underinvested in ICS security.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083403" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083403" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2083403 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg" alt="Dragos team picture" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dragos-team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083403" class="wp-caption-text">A team photo of Dragos employees. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dragos</p></div></p>
<p>Based just outside Washington D.C., Dragos now has over 220 employees and will be adding more, close to doubling its headcount since last year, and adding new offices in Melbourne, Dubai and in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lee said the U.K.&#8217;s transition out of the European Union would all but ensure that the new U.K. office could not serve as an EU hub for the company, but that it was necessary to &#8220;to go where the problems are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another one of those places is Saudi Arabia, one of the world&#8217;s largest oil and gas producers, where Dragos <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/dragos-saudi-arabia-office/">has an office</a> and now draws an investment. Saudi oil and gas manufacturing plants have been the target of several cyberattacks, including the Trisis malware in 2017 that shut down one of the kingdom&#8217;s biggest petrochemical plants. But the country has faced extensive criticism for its human rights record by international rights groups. Lee said the company works to protect infrastructure that serves civilians and has actively rejected military contracts that would fall afoul of those values. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to put asterisks on that mission,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lee told TechCrunch that the company has grown at a rapid pace since it was founded four years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal was never to get acquired,&#8221; he said. Echoing remarks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dragos-premium-people-profits/">he made</a> last year, Lee said that the company&#8217;s plan was to continue growing and investing in the problems that Dragos sees — with an eventual goal to take the company public. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not rushed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hallmark of Dragos being successful won&#8217;t be a successful IPO,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;The hallmark will be having validated and built the market large enough that there can be other companies that come behind us serving the other more niche aspects of the ICS market and building out the community, and making sure our infrastructure is safer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.klarna.com">Klarna</a> — the Swedish fintech “buy now, pay later” sensation that is currently Europe’s most valuable private tech company — is dismissive of the suggestion that non U.S. companies should relocate to Silicon Valley if they really want to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did hear that and I think it&#8217;s very poor advice,&#8221; he says. An overheated market for tech talent and the fickle nature of employees that are constantly job-hopping, he argues, make it harder to build a company for the long term.</p>
<p>Then he goes further.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I went to San Francisco for the first time about 10 years ago, [it] was a magical place. It was the early days of Facebook, there was an amazing vibe. When I go to San Francisco today, it&#8217;s changed to become, in my opinion, fairly cold.”</p>
<p>Siemiatkowski, a Swedish national and the son of two immigrants from Poland, is also sceptical of the “American dream.” In contrast to America, he points out how Sweden is among the most successful societies in the world from a social mobility perspective &#8212; referencing its free education and free health care, which sets up as many people as possible for success. But there is one caveat: he doesn&#8217;t think first-generation immigrants in Sweden do nearly as well as their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a lot of money,” he tells me. “My father was driving a cab, he was unemployed for many years, even though he had basically a doctorate in agronomy. That&#8217;s kind of the unfortunate part of this, but that has obviously created a massive amount of hunger with me.”</p>
<p>As second generation success stories go, the rise of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/klarna" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="klarna">Klarna <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is up there with the best, even if it has already been 15 years in the making.</p>
<p>Backed by the likes of Sequoia, Silverlake, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/atomico" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="atomico">Atomico, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/klarna-raises-650-million-at-a-10-6-billion-valuation/">$650 million funding round in September</a> gave the company a whopping $10.65 billion valuation &#8212; almost double the price achieved a year earlier, cementing its status as a poster child for Europe’s ability to build tech companies valued far above $1 billion. Siemiatkowski still owns an 8.1 percent stake.</p>
<p>Klarna is also, perhaps, even more mythical than a unicorn: a fintech that has been profitable nearly from the get-go. That only changed in 2019, when it decided to incur losses in favor of investing millions trying to conquer the U.S. market, choosing New York and L.A. over San Francisco for its American offices.</p>
<p>The company has been built on the concept of giving consumers a way to buy things online without having to pay for them upfront, and without resorting to a credit card. It does this both by offering online retailer integrations where Klarna appears as an option at check out, and through its own “shopping mall” app, where users can browse all the stores that let you pay with Klarna. On the back of this, the company hopes to foster a bigger financial relationship with its users as a fully-fledged bank.</p>
<p>If a bank is partly about corralling enough users on to your platform to pay money in and out, Klarna is well on its way. Today, the company boasts a registered customer base of 90 million, 11 million of which are in the U.S. In the last year alone, 21 million users were added globally. Klarna&#8217;s direct to consumer app, which sits alongside its 200,000 strong merchant point of sale integrations, has 14 million active users globally. Combined, Klarna is processing over 1 million transactions per day through its platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083610" style="width: 3610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083610" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2083610 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg" alt="" width="3600" height="2401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Klarna_HQ_entrance.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083610" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klarna</p></div></p>
<p>This growth has continued apace as Klarna rides one macro trend and bucks another: Prompted by the pandemic, e-commerce has gone gangbusters, while, conversely, consumer credit as a whole <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-06/u-s-household-debt-falls-in-lockdown-for-first-time-in-6-years#:~:text=U.S.%20Household%20Debt%20Falls%20for%20First%20Time%20in%206%20Years,-By&amp;text=Total%20debt%20declined%200.2%25%20to,in%20a%20report%20published%20Thursday.&amp;text=Meanwhile%2C%20mortgage%20borrowing%20rose%20by,the%20quarter%20to%20%249.78%20trillion.">has been in decline</a> as people are paying down longer-term debt in record numbers. Even before COVID-19, Klarna and other buy now, pay later providers had been successfully picking up the slack created by a credit card market that, in some countries, has been steadily contracting.</p>
<p>Yet with a business model that generates the majority of its revenue by offering consumers short-term credit &#8212; and against a backdrop where the idea of easy credit and infinite consumption is increasingly criticised &#8212; the fintech giant is not without detractors.</p>
<p>When I mention Klarna to people who work in the European tech industry, the reaction tends to fall into one of three camps: those who reference the company’s &#8220;weird&#8221; above the line advertising and social media campaigns; those who use the service regularly and talk in terms of guilty pleasures; and those who are outright scornful of the impact on society they perceive Klarna to be making. And it&#8217;s true: You can’t help but be suspicious of something that gives consumers the feeling that they can spend money they might not have. And those “Smoooth” ads (below) certainly don’t offer much reassurance.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZKvgN2l3N8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Delve a little deeper, however, and it becomes clear that the company&#8217;s business model can be misunderstood and that the arguments playing out in the media for and against buy now, pay later is only one part of the Klarna story.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview, Siemiatkowski confronts criticisms head on, including that Klarna makes it too easy to get into debt, and that buy now, pay later needs to be regulated. We also discuss Klarna&#8217;s business model and the balancing act required to win over consumers and keep merchants onside.</p>
<p>We also learn how, under his watch and as the company began to scale, Klarna missed the next big opportunity in fintech, instead being usurped by Adyen and Stripe. Siemiatkowski also shares what&#8217;s next for the company as it ventures further into the world of retail banking after gaining a bank license in 2017.</p>
<p>And, told publicly for the first time, Siemiatkowski reveals how he once sought out PayPal co-founder Max Levchin as an advisor, only to learn a little later that he had started Affirm, one of Klarna&#8217;s most direct U.S. competitors and sometimes described by Europeans as a Klarna clone.</p>
<p>But first, let’s go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>Klarna&#8217;s first ever transaction took place at 11:06:40 am on April 10, 2005 at a Swedish bookshop called Pocketklubben, according to the abbreviated history published on the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/klarna-15/">website</a>. However, what is made less explicit is that there was likely very little technology involved. The real innovation was a business one, with Klarna&#8217;s young and non-technical founders, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsso, taking an old idea and reconfiguring it for the burgeoning e-commerce industry.</p>
<p>By enabling customers that shopped online to be mailed an invoice with 30 days to pay, online shopping could be made easier and safer for consumers, which in turn helped increase sales for retailers.</p>

<p>“When they started, they didn&#8217;t position themselves so much as a startup or as a tech company,” recalls Skype founder Niklas Zennström, whose venture capital firm Atomico would eventually become a Klarna investor in 2012. “People referred to them as the invoicing company.”</p>
<p>Today, Klarna is most certainly a tech company, employing 1,300 software engineers out of a staff of over 3,500. The company is now entirely cloud based and with various fully automated processes, from credit risk processing to algorithms in the Klarna shopping app to personalize content for individual consumers to AI/machine learning for 24 hour customer service.</p>
<p>Crucially, however, even this early and rudimentary version of what would become ‘buy now, pay later’ ticked two important boxes. Consumers, especially those who were distrusting of e-commerce, could be sure they’d receive goods before being charged, and if for any reason a product needed to be returned, customers wouldn’t have to wait weeks to be reimbursed as they hadn’t outlaid cash in the first place. Arguably both problems were already solved by credit cards, but in countries like Sweden, credit card take up was low, while the humble debit card doesn’t carry the same consumer protections as a credit card.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason that we were able to launch it and be successful was because we were in a market where debit cards were much more prevalent than credit cards,&#8221; says Siemiatkowski. &#8220;And most people who have credit cards don&#8217;t reflect on the fact that if you have a debit card and you shop online, you face a number of struggles that a credit card holder does not.”</p>
<p>Those &#8220;struggles&#8221; include tying up your own money for the time it takes to return an item and process a refund. In contrast, when you spend on a credit card, the merchant is effectively holding your credit card company&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am buying some items and feel a bit unsafe about the merchant I&#8217;m using, if there&#8217;s a credit card, I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m risking my money. If it&#8217;s my salary money you&#8217;re actually holding as a merchant for three weeks while you&#8217;re processing the return, that&#8217;s a problem,&#8221; Siemiatkowski argues.</p>
<p>Instead, Klarna would step in and offer to pay the merchant up front while providing customers 30 days to settle their invoice. Later this would be extended to include installments as an option. In return for taking on all of the risk and promising to increase conversions, merchants would give the Swedish upstart a percentage cut of the transactions.</p>
<p>“They wanted to make it really simple by just putting in your name, your Social Security number, and then you can instantaneously get an option to get an invoice sent to you later on. So what it did was remove a lot of friction from buying,” says Zennström.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the more retailers sold, the more revenue Klarna would generate, all without consumers having to be charged interest on what might otherwise be described as a short-term loan. Pitch perfect, you might think. However, in early 2005 and before the company was incorporated, the concept was stress-tested at a &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221;-style event held at the Stockholm School of Economics and attended by the King of Sweden. The judging panel, made up of prominent Swedish financiers, were not convinced and Klarna’s invoicing idea came last in the competition. Despite the loss, Siemiatkowski held on to feedback from an unknown member of the audience, who surmised that banks would never launch something similar. Siemiatkowski left undeterred.</p>
<p>Angel investment from a former Erlang Systems sales manager, Jane Walerud, followed and she put Klarna&#8217;s founders in contact with a team of developers who helped build the first version of the platform. However, it soon surfaced that there was a misunderstanding in relation to the equity promised and how it should be linked to a longer commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Reflects Siemiatkowski: &#8220;One of the drawbacks that we had at the company was that none of the three co-founders had any engineering background; we couldn&#8217;t code. We were connected to five engineers that by themselves were amazing engineers, but we had a slight misunderstanding. Their idea was that they were going to come in, build a prototype, ship it, and then leave for 37% of the equity. Our understanding was that they were going to come in, ship it, and if it started scaling they would stay with us and work for a longer period of time. This is the classic mistake that you do as a startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, the original five engineers quit, leaving Siemiatkowski to manage something he didn&#8217;t understand. &#8220;We obviously hired a CTO, but I also needed to be able to evaluate his decision making and all of these things in order to be able to assess whether we had the right setup to achieve what we want to achieve,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2008, Klarna continued to grow as more people started shopping online. The company expanded beyond Sweden to neighboring Nordic countries Norway, Finland and Denmark, with a headcount that had reached 120 employees. Even though there were signs of growth, Siemiatkowski says it still took a long time to realise that if Klarna was ever going to be really successful, it needed to fully transform into a tech company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really good at sales, we were okay at marketing, [and] we were service oriented: we really delivered to our customers. But it wasn&#8217;t really that technology driven,” he concedes.</p>
<p>To attract the kind of tech talent required, Siemiatkowski decided he needed to woo a renowned tech investor. Further backing had come in 2007 from Swedish investment firm Investment AB Öresund, but by 2010 the Klarna CEO had two new targets in his sights: Niklas Zennström, the Swedish entrepreneur who had already achieved legend status back home after building and selling Skype, and Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm that had invested in Apple, Google and PayPal.</p>
<p>“Part of our thinking about how we make Klarna attractive for people with engineering backgrounds was to get an investor that really had the brand and could kind of put their mark on us and say, ‘this is a tech company,’&#8221; says Siemiatkowski.</p>
<p>There is every likelihood that Zennström’s Atomico would have joined Klarna’s cap table in 2010 if it weren’t for a single line of text published on the VC firm&#8217;s website, which read something like, &#8220;don&#8217;t contact us, we&#8217;ll contact you.&#8221; Europe&#8217;s startup ecosystem was still immature and what now seems like aloofness was probably nothing more than a crude way to deter cold pitches from non-venture type businesses. But whatever the intent, it would be another two years before the firm eventually had the opportunity to invest in Klarna at what was almost certainly a much higher valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was our loss for being too arrogant,&#8221; says Zennström. &#8220;Clearly we didn&#8217;t pursue them, we didn&#8217;t discover them because we didn&#8217;t have them on our radar. When we got to know them [two years later], what we liked a lot as a firm was the pain point that they were addressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;E-commerce was a relatively low single digit penetration of all retail, but of course growing, and we have always believed that e-commerce is going to continue to grow and become bigger than physical retailers. We thought that if you can remove that friction of the payment, and offer people different payment methods, that&#8217;s a really big proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always tease Niklas about it,&#8221; admits Siemiatkowski. &#8220;They wanted to, you know, keep it exclusive and I get it. So we were like, ‘okay, we can&#8217;t get hold of them, so let&#8217;s talk to Sequoia instead.’&#8221;</p>
<p>However, cold calling Sequoia wasn&#8217;t going to cut it either, not only because the firm didn&#8217;t generally invest in Europe, but also by Siemiatkowski&#8217;s own admission, Klarna didn&#8217;t look much like a tech company at the time. Luckily, a mutual contact got wind that Sequoia was on the lookout for interesting companies in the region and Klarna&#8217;s name was promptly thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>“Chris [Olsen], who was working at Sequoia at the time, called me, [but] I had this idea that I needed to be hard to catch. So I decided to not call back for three days, which was a very nervous time where I was just sitting on my hands not doing anything,” he said. “It was like, I don&#8217;t want to look like I&#8217;m too interested in this. Eventually, after three days, I call back and we did an exclusive deal with them, which I don&#8217;t recommend companies do.”</p>
<p>In hindsight, the Klarna CEO advises that it&#8217;s always smarter to foster competition in a round. As the only show in town, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/klarna-series-b--8714c8d6">Sequoia invested</a> at a $100 million valuation. &#8220;They bought 25 percent of the company and that was kind of it,” he says.</p>
<hr />
<p>Siemiatkowski believes a company is made up of three things.</p>
<p>The first he calls internal momentum: &#8220;How fast are we moving as an organisation? How good are the decisions we are taking? How much are we avoiding [company] politics? How much of a true meritocracy are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>The second is profit and loss.</p>
<p>And the third is valuation. In a small company these three things are closely correlated in time, he says, &#8220;so if you have great internal momentum, you will instantly see it in your P&amp;L, and then you will instantly see that hopefully in your company valuation as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in a large company, because of its size, the challenge is that they start to become disconnected. &#8220;They&#8217;re obviously in the long term always 100% correlated, but in the short term, they can vary a lot,&#8221; cautions Siemiatkowski.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, fueled by Sequoia&#8217;s cash, Klarna continued to grow in 2010, ending the year with $54 million in annual revenue, an increase of 80%. In December 2011, General Atlantic and DST <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/10/moritz-klarna/">would invest $155 million</a> in a round that gave Klarna the coveted status of a unicorn.</p>
<p>Siemiatkowski says, compared to the company&#8217;s subsequent $5.5 billion and $10.65 billion valuations, this is the one that put him under the most self-scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just one and a half years, we went from $100 million to a $1 billion. And then I felt the pressure,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;I felt like we made it such a competitive round because we wanted to compensate for what we saw partially as a mistake with Sequoia that we kind of went too far the other way.”</p>
<p>Klarna finally took Atomico&#8217;s money in 2012, and within two years had grown to over 1,000 employees. Along with multiple offices around the globe, the company moved to bigger headquarters in Stockholm and expanded to the U.K. with an office in central London. Yet, somewhere along the way, Siemiatkowski says Klarna had lost internal momentum.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the company scaled and we started adding more markets and growing fast, for me as CEO and co-founder, I found that very difficult,&#8221; he admits. &#8220;As long as we were up to 100 people, I found it easier, I understood how to talk to people, how to get things done, how to develop new products or features and so forth. It was all much less complex, and then we started approaching a couple of hundred people and I felt more and more lost in all of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was difficult, and at the same point of time, we still had a lot of success because we had built this product that worked really well and there was a lot of momentum coming solely from the product itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siemiatkowski says that most startups don&#8217;t recognize that &#8220;once you get the snowball rolling, you can actually do quite a lot of stupid things, and the snowball will continue rolling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Klarna CEO doesn&#8217;t say it, but one of those &#8220;stupid things&#8221; came in 2012 when the startup faced a backlash in its home country. Instead of sending payment instructions in the post, the company had switched to email without considering that messages might go to spam or simply remain unread. This saw customers unintentionally defaulting and then being chased for payment, leading to accusations in the media that Klarna was tricking people so it could generate more revenue through late fees.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DealShare, a startup in India that has built an e-commerce platform for middle and lower income groups of consumers, said on Tuesday it has raised $21 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its footprint in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/westbridge-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="westbridge-capital">WestBridge Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the Series C round of the three-year-old startup, which is based in Bangalore. Alpha Wave Incubation, a venture fund managed by Falcon Edge Capital, Z3Partners and existing investors Matrix Partners India and Omidyar Network India also participated in the round, bringing DealShare’s to-date raise to $34 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dealshare.in/">DealShare</a> kickstarted its journey the day <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">Walmart acquired Flipkart</a>, the startup’s founder and chief executive Vineet Rao said at a recent virtual conference. Rao said that even as Amazon and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had been able to create a market for themselves in the urban Indian cities, much of the nation was still underserved. There was an opportunity for someone to jump in, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup began as an e-commerce platform on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> where it offered hundreds of products to consumers. It didn&#8217;t take long before a major consumer spending pattern was visible, Rao said. People were only interested in buying items that were selling at discounted rates, said Rao.</p>
<p>Over time, that idea has become part of DealShare’s core offering. Today it incentivizes consumers &#8212; by offering them discounts and cashbacks &#8212; to share deals on products with their friends. The startup, which has since launched its own app and website, now operates in over two dozen cities in India.</p>
<p>Consumers wanted products that were relevant to them and they wanted to buy these items at a price that instilled the most value for their bucks, said Rao. “We focused on locally produced items instead of national brands. Even today, 80% to 90% of items we sell are locally produced,” he said.</p>
<p>“We started building a network of these suppliers. It was very tough because none of these guys fancied joining modern retail like e-commerce. Some of them had tried to work with e-commerce firms before but the experience left a lot to be desired,” he said.</p>
<p>Sandeep Singhal, Co-founder and Managing Director of WestBridge, said in a statement, “Majority of Indian population is currently residing in the non-metros and there is a huge business opportunity in these regions. The buying pattern of low and middle-income group is different especially in smaller markets and DealShare seems to have understood the nuances very well. We are very impressed with how the team has scaled up in the last 2 years, while retaining a sharp focus on low cost, high impact model,” said</p>
<p>The startup says it spent the last 18 months to improve its finances and is nearing profitability. Now it plans to invest in its technology stack and expand its platform to 100 cities and towns in five states of India in the next one year. It did not disclose how many customers it serves today, but said it is working to reach 10 million customers and clock $339 million in annual GMV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.out.fund/">Outfund</a>, the revenue-based finance startup that wants to help online businesses fund growth without giving away equity, has raised £37 million in a &#8220;late seed&#8221; investment. A mixture of debt and equity, the round is led by Fuel Ventures, alongside TMT Investment and Force over Mass.</p>
<p>Outfund says it will use the funds to offer larger financing to more businesses, and to invest in new finance products and grow the team. It is also committing to lending £100 million to e-commerce and subscription-based businesses in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Daniel Lipinski, who previously founded and sold logistics platform ParcelBright, says existing financing solutions for online businesses are far from optimum. &#8220;[There’s] organic growth which is slow and cumbersome; bank loans which force directors to give personal guarantees and put their home on the line; or venture capital, where you have to give up control of the business and dilute your shareholding. Sadly, none of these are aligned with company goals of revenue generation and equity retention,&#8221; he argues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To remedy this, Outfund has set out to create a fairer &#8212; and better aligned &#8212; way for online businesses to grow fast. Based solely on revenues and performance, and targeting businesses that take online payments, Outfund offers between £10,000 and £2 million of funding. Companies must have a minimum of £10,000 monthly turnover and to have been trading for at least six months. Outfund then charges a share of revenue, starting from 5 percent and factoring in projected payback time, although the fee is fixed even if it takes longer to pay back the loan.</p>
<p>To assess risk before deploying funding, the fintech&#8217;s algorithm pulls information from multiple data sources to determine how a company is performing. &#8220;Outfund uses live data as the backbone of our lending decisions, making us non-biased and fast,&#8221; adds the Outfund CEO. &#8220;This allows us to provide funding of up to £2 million within 24 hours. And, as we use unfiltered data sources, this helps reduce risk on our side meaning we can provide the cheapest possible fees over the longest possible repayment period&#8221;.</p>
<p>On direct competitors, Lipinski cites Canada’s Clearbanc, which recently launched in the U.K. “They are based in Canada, [so] it&#8217;s a real challenge for them to provide the speed and responsiveness that a U.K.-based company like Outfund can provide,” he claims. Another relatively new local player is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/uncapped-picks-up-another-26m-to-offer-revenue-based-finance-to-european-entrepreneurs/">Uncapped</a>.</p>
<p>“Outfund is very different in the market in that we provide one fixed fee from 5% regardless of how you spend the funds. For example, other providers in the space charge an increased fee if you use the funding for stock as opposed to marketing. We are focused on technology to make the best lending decisions and means we can advance the cheapest fixed rates on the market regardless of how you spend it”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people know <a href="https://www.wish.com/">Wish</a> as a site that sells throwaway doodads from China, but in anticipation of its impending IPO, the ten-year-old, San Francisco-based company has begun portraying itself as a kind of Amazon for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Judging by what we&#8217;ve read and heard from sources in recent months, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wish" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wish">Wish <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to paint itself as a patriotic alternative to the trillion-dollar juggernaut and is positioning itself as the better option for the estimated 60% of families in the U.S. without enough liquid savings to get through three months of expenses. Such cost-conscious customers can&#8217;t afford Amazon Prime and are &#8212; at least in Wish&#8217;s telling &#8212; willing to wait an extra week or three for a product if it means paying considerably less for it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know soon enough if public market investors buy the pitch. Wish registered plans this morning to sell 46 million shares at between $22 an $24 per share in an offering that&#8217;s expected to take place next week. The current range would value Wish at up to $14 billion, up from the $11.2 billion valuation it was last assigned by its private investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wish has a lot of reasons to feel optimistic about its story heading into the offering. For one thing, people are clearly still discovering its business. According to Sensor Tower, Wish&#8217;s mobile shopping app was downloaded 9 million times last month, compared with the 6 million downloads that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shopping app saw and the 2 million downloads seen by Walmart. In 2019, across all types of apps, Wish was the 16th most downloaded app.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to discover once potential customers do check out Wish. According to the company&#8217;s prospectus, its more than 100 million monthly active users across more than 100 countries are now shopping from 500,000 merchants that are selling approximately 150 million items on the platform.</p>
<p>While many of these are the nonessential tchotchkes that Wish has long been identified with, from tattoo kits to pet nail trimmers, a growing percentage of the mix also includes essential goods like paper towels and disinfectants &#8212; the kinds of items that keep customers coming back in reliable fashion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of an evolution for the company, whose early focus was almost exclusively on cheap items that didn&#8217;t weigh much. From the start, Wish has worked with unbranded merchants, mostly in China, who don&#8217;t have marketing costs built into their products and like the platform because it enables them to reach new customers for free without cannibalizing their existing market.</p>
<p>Until recently, Wish &#8212; which takes 15% of each transaction &#8212;  had also relied heavily on a partnership with the USPS and China called ePacket that enabled it to send items overseas to the U.S. for $1 to $2 as long as the items weren&#8217;t unusually large or heavy. That changed on <a href="https://blog.stamps.com/2020/06/19/july-1-2020-rate-increase-important-news-for-international-shippers-using-consolidators/">July 1</a>, with a new USPS pricing structure that now requires companies like Wish to pay more to ship their goods or else move to more costly commercial networks.</p>
<p>It could have been a deadly blow, but Wish had back-up plans. One of these has involved packing together multiple orders in China based on customers&#8217; locations, then sending them in bulk to the U.S. to a designated location where they can be picked up.</p>
<p>Relatedly, dating back to early 2019, Wish began partnering with what are now tens of thousands of small businesses in the U.S. and Europe that stock its products, trading their storage space for access to Wish&#8217;s customers along with a small financial bonus for every in-store pickup. (Wish will pay store owners even more if they can deliver orders directly to customers&#8217; homes.) According to Forbes, these partnerships provided Wish with an &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2020/07/30/wish-ecommerce-shipping-rate-increase-china-brick-and-mortar-stores-partnership/">inexpensive distribution network practically overnight</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It happens to fit neatly into a larger anti-Amazon narrative wherein the Goliath (Amazon), unable to disrupt convenience stores, is now trying to supplant them with its own <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/">branded convenience shops</a>, while Wish may be helping them prosper. Wish also boasts a very asset-lite model compared with Amazon. Wish doesn&#8217;t hold inventory; it also doesn&#8217;t have to buy or maintain a fleet of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/amazon-air-adds-12-new-aircraft-to-its-cargo-fleet-expands-its-ground-operations">cargo planes</a> or trucks or warehouses.</p>
<p>None of these developments completely counter the challenges that unprofitable Wish is still facing, beginning with its scale, which remains tiny compared with the towering giants it faces.</p>
<p>While the company is showing moderate revenue growth, its filings also show <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393425-wish-wants-1-billion-ipo-stellar-valuation">steady losses</a> owing in part to its marketing spend. (In 2019, Wish reported revenue of $1.9 billion, up 10% year over year, but it saw a net loss of $136 million.)</p>
<p>The company has been making inroads into new geographies around the world, but it is still heavily dependent on China-based merchants. To address this, it has reportedly begun partnering increasingly with more U.S.- and Europe-based retailers, including those with overstocked or returned items that big retailers are looking to offload, along with those looking to sell refurbished electronics. “We’d love to diversify,” Szulczewski told Forbes this summer.</p>
<p>Wish has always been plagued by quality control issues, too, which it has yet to resolve. In fact, there are YouTube channels &#8212; some very funny &#8212;  focused entirely around what Wish products look like in reality versus how they are presented to shoppers online. (See below.)</p>
<p>Largely, it&#8217;s a cultural issue. For example, at a 2016 <a href="https://strictlyvcinsiderseries4.splashthat.com/">event </a>hosted by this editor, cofounder and CEO Peter Szulczewski talked about having to educate Chinese merchants about American customers&#8217; expectations. “It’s true that consumer expectations in China are very different,&#8221; Szulczewski explained at the time. &#8220;Like, if you order a red sweater and you get a blue one, [shoppers are] like, ‘Eh, next time.’ So we have a lot of merchants that have only sold to Chinese consumers and we have to educate them that it’s not okay to ship a blue sweater because you don’t have any red sweaters in stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wish has been working to close the gap, as well as to tackle outright fraud on the platform. Just one of many moves has involved hiring a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conchang/">former community manager</a> at Facebook as its own director of community engagement, a task that reportedly involves organizing Wish users to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2019/03/13/meet-the-billionaire-who-defied-amazon-and-built-wish-the-worlds-most-downloaded-e-commerce-app">weed out bad apples</a>. But Wish has surely lost plenty of shoppers burned by shopping experiences along the way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, plenty of public market investors will be watching and waiting. So will the venture capitalists who have provided the company with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wish">$2.1 billion</a> in funding over the years, including Formation 8, Third Point Ventures, GGV Capital, Raptor Group, Legend Capital, IDG Capital, DST Global, 8VC, 137 Ventures and Vika Ventures.</p>
<p>For her part, Anna Palmer of Boston-based Flybridge Capital Partners &#8212; who does not have a stake in Wish but who is focused very much on so-called commerce 3.0 &#8212; thinks that Wish &#8220;serves a different use case and a different customer need&#8221; than the Amazon shopper.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the strong retail performance of the off-price and discount market &#8212;  think of retailers like Dollar General and Dollar Tree &#8212; it bodes well for the continued growth of Wish,&#8221; she says, &#8220;especially since the discount market has been a tough one to bring online because of the additional logistics costs involved.&#8221;</p>
