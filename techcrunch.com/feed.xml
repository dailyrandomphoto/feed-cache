</div><p id="speakable-summary">Congress is making its biggest push ever to stop drunk driving with President Biden&#8217;s huge infrastructure bill. As we previously reported, one of the provisions included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/infrastructure-bill-drunk-driving-technology-173739727.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">a mandate for anti-drunk driving technology</a> in new cars. Now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-faces-fresh-challenges-infrastructure-050328752.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed Congress</a> with the measure intact, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/10/drunk-driving-car-technology-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Autoblog (AP) reports</em></a>, and it&#8217;s expected to be signed by the President soon. As part of the legislation, carmakers will have to include technology to detect and stop drunk drivers by as early as 2026.</p>
<p>First, though, the Department of Transportation will have to determine the best solution to curtail intoxicated drunk driving. Specifically, the bill requires something that will “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.” That sounds similar to infrared camera solutions already used today by GM, Nissan and others, Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/insight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Insights</a>, tells the <em>AP</em>. It goes without saying that we&#8217;d need something more advanced than breathalyzers, which are already used as a punishment for convicted drunken drivers.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 people die every year in the US from drunk driving accidents, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving#:~:text=Driving%20after%20drinking%20is%20deadly.&amp;text=In%20fact%2C%20on%20average%20over,the%20United%20States%20in%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">NHTSA says</a>. Now that we have smarter sensors and plenty of camera technology to monitor driver behavior, it makes sense to explore solutions that could help prevent those sorts of accidents. Within a decade, it should feel as commonplace as seatbelts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232388" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The infrastructure bill also includes other safety measures, like rear seat reminders that could notify parents about children left in carseats. Additionally, Congress will also require automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings, features that many new cars already offer. It&#8217;s unclear when true self-driving cars will be a reality, but until then, at least human drivers can look forward to more ways to prevent accidents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Department of Justice is suing ride-hailing giant Uber over claims that the company discriminates against passengers with disabilities, in violation of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Wednesday, alleged that Uber’s practice of imposing “wait time” fees on passengers with disabilities constituted discrimination, as those passengers may need more time to board the vehicle due to that disability. Uber launched its wait time policy in April 2016, charging fees from two minutes after the Uber vehicle arrives at the designated pickup location.</p>
<p>Uber does not give discretion to drivers to waive or otherwise alter wait time fees, which are calculated automatically in the app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The DOJ said Uber failed to give those passengers adequate boarding time or provide equitable fares, in violation of the ADA. Mobility aids that need to be broken down, like wheelchairs and walkers, or myriad other reasons, could mean that a disabled passenger requires more than two minutes to board a vehicle, the suit says.</p>
<p>The complaint described the experiences of two specific passengers, referred to only as, “Passenger A” and “Passenger B.” Passenger A, a 52-year-old woman who has quadriplegia and uses a manual wheelchair, took at least five minutes on average to board vehicles she booked using Uber. She was charged a wait time fee for each ride she took, but due to limited other transportation options, she continued using Uber each day. She attempted to request a refund and was denied.</p>
<p>Passenger B, a 34-year-old man with cerebral palsy, also uses a manual wheelchair and was also charged a wait time fee for nearly every ride through the app. Uber initially refunded the fees, but later told him that he had reached “the maximum amount of refunds.”</p>
<p>“Similar to Passengers A and B, other individuals with disabilities throughout the country have likewise been discriminated against by Uber by being charged wait time fees because of their disabilities,” the suit says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ADA is a landmark piece of legislation enacted by Congress in 1990. While Uber is a private company, the DOJ says the ADA has authority to address discrimination in transportation services provided by private entities.</p>
<p>“As Uber and other similar providers have gained popularity over traditional taxi services as the primary option for on-demand transportation, Uber plays an important role in ensuring independence for countless people with disabilities who choose to – or simply must – rely on its services to travel,” the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Uber for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>
<p>The case number is 3:21-cv-08735.</p>

<p>Just two days after SpaceX safely returned four astronauts from the International Space Station, it’s sending another quartet to orbit. Check out the launch live on the video above – SpaceX will start providing coverage from 4:45 PM EDT, with liftoff scheduled for 9:03 PM EDT. You can also watch a livestream of the launch on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&amp;ab_channel=NASA">NASA TV Youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The launch, called Crew-3, was originally scheduled to take-off on the auspicious date of Halloween, but it encountered a series of delays, first due to adverse weather and then a “minor medical issue” involving one of the crew members. (NASA did not provide any further details on the issue, only specifying that it was not not an emergency nor related to COVID-19.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But now the launch is back on track. The foursome – NASA’s Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agency’s Matthias Maurer – will be ferried to the ISS in a SpaceX Dragon capsule they&#8217;ve dubbed &#8220;Endurance,&#8221; aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. It will be the first time in space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari, and the third mission for Maurer. They’re scheduled to spend the next six months on the station, where they’ll join just one NASA astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.</p>
<p>Crew-3 is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a partnership between the agency and private industry to develop and use human space transportation vehicles. SpaceX began providing transportation services to and from the ISS under the CCP in 2020, under a $3.1 billion contract for six missions. Boeing was awarded a $4.8 billion contract under the program for its Starliner capsule, which has faced a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">technical snafus</a> that will likely keep it grounded until the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Liftoff will take place from launchpad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the astronauts scheduled to arrive on the ISS by Thursday evening. Should weather conditions prove unfavorable for launch, SpaceX will have another opportunity 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Following stage separation, the Falcon 9 booster is anticipated to land autonomously on the “A Shortfall of Gravitas” barge stationed off the Florida coast.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It takes such a galactic amount of time, effort and expense to build a successful space startup, that you might find it difficult to justify carving out two days to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> on December 14 – 15.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. This event places you and your startup in the orbital path of the most influential people in the space ecosystem. The check-writers, the potential partners and customers that are essential for your ultimate success — all of them focused on pushing the boundaries of the space economy.</p>
<p>We can lather-rinse-and-repeat that fact from here to Alpha Centauri and back, but it might be more helpful to hear a testimonial from one of your own.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>But first:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=TRUE">Buy your pass today</a>, and you’ll save $100 with the general admission price.</p>
<p>Now, let’s hear more about why one space CEO says attending TC Sessions: Space 2021 is an excellent use of your time, energy and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brian-manning-d115">Brian Manning</a>, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xona-space-systems">Xona Space Systems</a>, an early-stage startup focused on precision LEO satellite navigation services, attended TC Sessions: Space 2020, our inaugural space conference. Here’s what he had to say about the overall experience.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why did you decide to attend and exhibit at TC Sessions: Space 2020?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Our company was very new at that point, and our main goal was to gain exposure and to make connections. We also believed the event speakers and presentations would bring a great crowd of both potential investors and customers. We were excited about exhibiting and pitching.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did that pitching opportunity come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> We were one of 10 startups chosen by Starburst Aerospace — a global space accelerator — to participate in a pitch-off called Pitch Me to the Moon. It was a great opportunity to pitch live to a panel of high-profile judges from across the industry. We won the pitch-off and, along with terrific exposure, we received a strategy session with Starburst, free tickets to Disrupt 2021 and a podcast interview.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you talk a bit about your networking experience? </strong></p>
<p><strong>BM: </strong>Last year everything went into virtual mode, which made 2020 interesting for events. The conference went well, and TechCrunch handled the setup and all the networking breaks cleanly. Networking virtually is always a challenge, but we did have several useful, spontaneous conversations.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What, if anything, came as a result of attending TC Sessions: Space 2020?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> The event directly led to conversations with several potential high-value customers. A few of them came from unexpected areas, which pleasantly surprised us. In the past year, we’ve run into quite a few people who mentioned they remembered us from the TechCrunch event. Overall, we received great exposure that was very relevant to our company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=TRUE">Buy your pass</a> (or passes) and expose your startup to an astronomic dose of out-of-this-world opportunity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember when Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/">dropped NFTs</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">enabled Bitcoin tips</a>? Given that founder and CEO Jack Dorsey&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">Twitter bio</a> is literally just &#8220;#bitcoin,&#8221; it&#8217;s not surprising that Twitter is interested in cryptocurrency and other decentralized technologies. Today, Twitter said that it&#8217;s formally launching a crypto team, which will aim to be &#8220;a center of excellence for all things blockchain and web3,&#8221; the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>To start, this team will explore crypto payments (Bitcoin tips, crypto payments for Ticketed Spaces), opportunities for creator monetization (NFT tooling), and decentralizing social media (part of the general movement toward web3). According to a Twitter thread from Tess Rinearson, the engineer tapped to lead the team, Twitter Crypto wants to &#8220;help push the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible with identity, community, ownership and more.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I build out the team, we’ll be working to figure out what crypto can do for Twitter, as well as what Twitter can do for crypto. Twitter truly “gets” crypto (hello bitcoin tipping &amp; NFTs!) but there’s so much more to explore here.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Tess Rinearson (@_tessr) <a href="https://twitter.com/_tessr/status/1458466778871472134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Though crypto payments and <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanSutin/status/1453815677345689602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1453815677345689602%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.socialmediatoday.com%2Fnews%2Ftwitter-previews-coming-nft-display-options-for-profile-images%2F609123%2F">NFT galleries</a> are the lowest hanging fruit in the short term, this move marks a broader push by Twitter toward decentralizing social media, which would allow networks to run on independently on the blockchain, rather than on servers hosted by businesses, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The idea is that these decentralized networks will give individual users more say over their data and privacy. Still, some researchers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">worry about</a> how these decentralized systems would reckon with questions of content moderation, especially as it pertains to extremist political content.</p>
<p>Twitter Crypto will work closely with a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called <a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">bluesky</a>, which aims to build an “open decentralized standard for social media.&#8221; In the same way that no one bank controls cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, there would be no one social network that would control the bluesky protocol, even though its development is driven by Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t the only major social platform exploring blockchain technology. Just this week, Discord&#8217;s founder and CEO Jason Citron implied in a Tweet that Discord is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">working on an integration</a> with MetaMask, a popular crypto wallet service. Meanwhile, Reddit is <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/3454478">hiring engineers</a> for an NFT platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today the company has begun testing a new feature this week called &#8220;Take a Break,&#8221; which will allow users to remind themselves to take a break from using the app after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes, depending on their preferences. As an opt-in feature, however, the reminders may have a limited impact, as users would have to be motivated to set up the new control for themselves.</p>
<p>The company had previously said it was looking into &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders. Mosseri, for instance, mentioned the coming addition when <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461241289555977" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commenting</a> on Instagram&#8217;s plans to pause its plans to build a version of its service for younger users, Instagram for Kids. He referenced Instagram&#8217;s plans to build in &#8220;nudges&#8221; and &#8220;reminders,&#8221; like &#8220;Take a Break,&#8221; as an example of how Instagram was addressing issues related to its product&#8217;s impact on users&#8217; mental health.</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s (previously, Facebook&#8217;s) Global Head of Security Antigone Davis also referenced Instagram&#8217;s  &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">the company was grilled in a Senate hearing</a> over teen mental health back in September. He said the idea with the feature was to encourage users to stop looking at the app after they had been browsing for too long, and cited it as one of the many ways the company was working to improve the experiences of young people using its platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232240" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But similar to Instagram&#8217;s experiment with removing Like counts from posts, which it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">ultimately decided to make an opt-in feature</a>, these new &#8220;break&#8221; reminders won&#8217;t likely impact platform usage, as they&#8217;re not being made the default experience. In addition, it&#8217;s unclear if users will adopt the feature, given that iOS and Android&#8217;s built-in screen time controls already allow device owners to set limits on the time spent in mobile apps either on an individual basis or by category, like &#8220;social.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instagram, in other words, appears to want credit for building mental health features without actually going so far as to make any universal changes that would impact its app usage.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This is not the first time Instagram has pulled such a stunt. In 2018, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">rolled out</a> a &#8220;You&#8217;re All Caught Up&#8221; notice that appeared when you reached the end of all the new content from the past two days on your Instagram Feed. But last year, Instagram regressed and decided to use the space below the &#8220;You&#8217;re All Caught Up&#8221; notice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/">to push suggested posts and ads</a> in an attempt to keep users engaged even after they had reached a stopping point.</p>
<p>If Instagram was serious about addressing mental health, it could designate a time to show users a reminder within its app, and <em>then</em> offer controls that would allow users to turn it off or adjust the duration. Its competitor TikTok already does this by inserting videos into users&#8217; For You feeds that suggest it&#8217;s time to take a break after the user has been scrolling for too long. TikTok <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/features/tiktok-tips-telling-users-log-off-get-outdoors-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also leverages influencers</a> with millions of followers to issue these warnings, which can be more effective than just a pop-up notification.</p>
<p>Mosseri says the new &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders are launching this week as a test with a limited number of users, for the time being, but the company expects to roll out the feature publicly in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The euphoria around Rivian kicked into overdrive Wednesday as it debuted as a publicly traded company, with an opening share price of $106.75.</p>
<p>If that sticks, it would give Rivian an implied valuation of $90 billion. The opening trade was nearly 37% higher than its listed IPO price of $78. That absolute eye-popping number makes Rivian one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history and puts its market cap above GM as well as one of its backers, Ford (GM&#8217;s market cap is $86.31 billion; Ford&#8217;s is $78.2 billion).</p>
<p>That share price continued to rise after it began trading around 1 pm ET, hitting as high as $119 a share before falling to about $112.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232202" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The historic size of the Rivian IPO is not lost on founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. However, and perhaps as expected, he is bullish on the future of EVs, noting in a recent interview that the 90 to 100 million vehicles sold each year will transition to electric in the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, the way investors look at the space is really valuing what the future looks like,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;In not too much time, 100% of the business will be electric.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Rivian is very early in terms of its vehicles and launch, Scaringe said investors see and are valuing the company based on its future potential as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re evaluating us purely on our P&amp;L (profit/loss) today, I think they&#8217;d be missing the point of the company; they&#8217;re, of course looking at what they think the company is capable of achieving over time,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What Rivian is capable of achieving has yet to be proven; investors, customers and industry observers will learn that soon enough. However, its future plans are certainly ambitious and extend far beyond the first two consumer vehicles — the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV — and its partnership with Amazon to produce 100,000 electric commercial delivery vans by 2024. Patent documents as well as Scaringe&#8217;s own comments to TechCrunch show that Rivian plans to launch a range of consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p>Investors may also be betting that Rivian&#8217;s push to become vertically integrated — in the long term it even plans to develop its own battery cell — will make the company a technology leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really critical to control and vertically integrate what we would think of as the core technology stack — so all the electronics in the vehicle, the full software stack, the propulsion layer in the vehicle,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;I would say among all those things, the most important is actually software and electronics.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Wild IPO ride</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s been a wild ride since Rivian made its IPO filing public last month (it filed confidentially for the IPO in August). That filing &#8212; a detailed snapshot of Rivian&#8217;s financial standing, risks and opportunities &#8212; shows a company burning through cash as it takes on the capital-intensive task of designing, developing, producing and then selling electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The company planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares.</p>
<p>To say that investor demand has been frenetic is perhaps the understatement of 2021. Rivian not only upped its targeted share price twice, finally listing its initial public offering at $78 a share, it also added more and offered 153 million shares of common stock, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a> was posted late Tuesday evening. Rivian also gave underwriters an option to buy another 22.95 million shares, a higher number than previously expected.</p>
<p>The size of the IPO also benefits some of its biggest backers. Amazon holds a 20% stake and Ford has a 12% stake in Rivian.</p>
<p>The run up in Rivian&#8217;s stock is notable for a number of reasons. For instance, it is now valued more than established automakers that produce and sell millions of vehicles every year.</p>
<p>In contrast, the revenues are light and the expenses are high over at Rivian.</p>
<p>The company has hired thousands of employees over several facilities, including its factory in Normal, Illinois. The company now employs more than 9,000 people, Scaringe told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Scaringe&#8217;s obsession with vertical integration has also pushed up R&amp;D costs. (The company spent $766 million on R&amp;D in 2020. In the first half of 2021, the company spent $683 million on R&amp;D.)</p>
<p>As a result, net losses have expanded as it prepared for production of the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The company posted a net loss of $994 million in the first half of 2021 alone, far more than double its $377 million net loss the company posted in the same period of 2020.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenues are trickling in as deliveries of its R1T to customers, which began last month, begin to ramp up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is hoping to advance its reusability program one step forward tonight, when it will attempt to recover the booster from its Electron rocket for the third time.</p>
<p>The “Love at First Insight” mission is set to take off at 11:25 PM EST from the company’s launch facility on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/live-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can watch the launch live on Rocket Lab’s website here</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice before, the only other company besides SpaceX to do so. The first recovery took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">November 2020</a> and then again in May 2021, though that latter mission resulted in a complete loss of payload (more on that below). Both boosters made a splashdown via parachute, and if all goes to plan, the booster tonight will too. But this recovery attempt has an added twist: this time, a helicopter will be hovering nearby to track and observe the booster as it makes its descent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The addition of the helicopter is significant; it means Rocket Lab is getting closer to attempting its ultimate plan for reusability: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster enough that the helicopter can capture it in mid-air. While the helicopter won’t be attempting a mid-air capture tonight, it will be performing requisite tests to ensure the concept of operations is viable in the future.</p>
<p>“We’ve perfected Electron’s controlled descent, demonstrated flawless parachute deployment, and successfully plucked stages from the ocean. Now we’re gearing up for the next stage – preparing to use a helicopter to catch a rocket as it descends to Earth from space,” CEO Peter Beck said in a statement. “It’s ambitious, but with each recovery mission we’ve iterated and refined the hardware and processes to make the impossible ordinary.”</p>
<p>The primary goal of the mission will be to send two BlackSky Earth imaging satellites to orbit, part of a rapid five-launch agreement for BlackSky between Rocket Lab and launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. The satellites were originally scheduled to go up in August, part of a launch schedule that included two other dedicated missions, but those were delayed due to lockdown restrictions caused by a small outbreak of coronavirus in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Operations have experienced disruptions due to some of the most restrictive COVID-19 measures globally, including current stay-at-home orders which prevent launch operations from taking place,” CEO Peter Beck told investors during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/rocket-labs-order-backlog-tops-141m-as-the-company-inks-five-launch-deal-with-kineis/">a third-quarter earnings call</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two BlackSky satellites will join seven others already in orbit, part of the geospatial intelligence company’s larger plans to grow its constellation to 14 satellites by the end of this year. Earlier this year, two BlackSky satellites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">were lost due to a significant anomaly</a> that occurred shortly after the Electron’s second-stage ignited.</p>
<p>This is Rocket Lab’s twenty-second Electron launch and the fifth mission this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People subscribe to music, so why wouldn’t they subscribe to carbon offsetting to alleviate their conscience about the climate crisis? That’s partly the thinking behind U.K. startup <a href="https://ecologi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecologi</a>, which uses the funds to plant 1 million trees every 10 days in places like Africa and Latin America, as well as doing things like protecting peatlands in Indonesia. By doing this it reduces your carbon footprint by buying carbon offsets tailored to what you consume.</p>
<p>In April, Ecologi closed a seed investment round of $5.75 million (£4.05 million) at a pre-money valuation of £16.5 million from lead investor General Catalyst, with and Entrée Capital.</p>
<p>The subscription service &#8212; used by 35,000 individuals and businesses &#8212; allows members to “<a href="https://ecologi.com/elliot?treeId=60bcf53a4dd2669e3bd5750f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow their own forest</a>” with at least 12 trees a month and offset their carbon footprint by funding a wide range of the carbon-reducing projects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232195" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Launching in 2019 and bootstrapped until now, the company also puts all receipts, certificates, board minutes and financial statements all up on their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dACvzjE5nBE1cKZBAhYzsUa7rIiLJqCWXVgY4bNS8_Q/edit#gid=1742437033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public ledger</a>.</p>
<p>It’s now hit a pre-money valuation of £75 million after exceeding its £2 million crowdfunding target on the U.K.’s Crowdcube platform. The money will be used for product development, growing its team and expanding in the U.S. and EU. It&#8217;s also now awaiting B-Corp certification.</p>
<p>In early 2022 the company also plans to launch <a href="https://ecologi.com/business/ecologi-zero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecologi Zero</a>, its real-time carbon footprinting software for businesses.</p>
<p>This would compete with other carbon footprinting SaaS startups such as Normative, Spherics, Plan A and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ecologi claims to have grown by more than 650% in nine months, and increased its impact through carbon reductions by 330% in the last year. In January 2021, turnover was at £3.0 million ARR (annual recurring revenue), but the company projects it will end the year with £8.5 million ARR.</p>
<p>In total, the company claims to have planted over 25 million trees and offset 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The majority of these trees were planted across Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Kenya. Projects the company supported in the quarter included protecting peatlands in Indonesia and producing energy from landfill gas in Turkey and from waste rice husks in India.</p>
<p>Elliot Coad, CEO and co-founder, commented: “Community ownership is at the heart of what we do, and has been the driving force behind our growth over the last two years, so we felt it was only fitting that we offered our loyal subscribers the chance to own a stake in Ecologi. Since GC’s investment in April this year, we have spent the last three months turning down VC money in favour of a community based crowdfund.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Toronto Transit Commission has confirmed that the personal information of tens of thousands of employees may have been compromised as a result of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack on its systems last month.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The TTC, which operates Toronto&#8217;s bus, subway, streetcar and paratransit systems, said <a href="https://www.ttc.ca/news/2021/November/TTC-provides-update-on-cyber-security-incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement</a> that the compromised data includes the names, addresses and Social Insurance Numbers of 25,000 past and present employees. The agency said it&#8217;s continuing to investigate whether a &#8220;small number&#8221; of customers and vendors have also been affected.</p>
<p>The agency added that while there is “no evidence” that any of the information has been misused, it is notifying those individuals affected and will provide them with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/credit-monitoring/">credit monitoring</a> and identity theft protection. The TCC has also advised employees to call their banks and alert them of the security breach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ransomware attack on October 29 resulted in problems with vehicle tracking and &#8220;next bus&#8221; systems, and the loss of the online Wheel-Trans booking system, said TTC chief executive Rick Leary. He added that the incident resulted in &#8220;a number of the TTC’s servers being encrypted and locked,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While most customer-facing systems have been restored already, the TTC’s internal email system remains offline.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the entire organization, I want to express my deep regret that this has occurred to everyone who may be impacted,” said Leary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“It is not lost on me that organizations like ours are entrusted with significant amounts of personal information and it is essential that we do our best to protect it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the coming weeks, we will continue rebuilding the remaining impacted servers and internal services, like re-establishing external e-mail capabilities. But in truth, and based on the experiences of other organizations, this could take some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leary added the fact there have been nearly 700 similar cybersecurity attacks involving public and private sectors groups in Canada. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On October 30, the day before TCC&#8217;s ransomware attack, a separate cyberattack <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/health-services-it-outage-update-nov-1-1.6232426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck</a> Newfoundland and Labrador&#8217;s health system data centres. In <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2021/exec/1109n07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> released this week, the provincial government said “it has been determined that some personal information and personal health information was accessed from the systems.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today announced its decision to make the &#8220;dislike&#8221; count on videos private across its platform. The decision is likely to be controversial given the extent that it impacts the public&#8217;s visibility into a video&#8217;s reception. But YouTube believes the change will better protect its creators from harassment and reduce the threat of what it calls &#8220;dislike attacks&#8221; &#8212; essentially, when a group teams up to drive up the number of dislikes a video receives.</p>
<p>The company says that while dislike counts won&#8217;t be visible to the public, it&#8217;s not removing the dislike button itself. Users can still click the thumbs down button on videos to signal their dislike to creators privately. Meanwhile, creators will be able to track their dislikes in YouTube Studio alongside other analytics about their video&#8217;s performance, if they choose.</p>
<p>The change follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/youtube-tests-hiding-dislike-counts-on-videos/">an experiment YouTube ran earlier this year</a> whose goal was to determine if these sorts of changes would reduce dislike attacks and creator harassment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the time, YouTube explained that public dislike counts can affect creators&#8217; well-being and may motivate targeted campaigns to add dislikes to videos. While that&#8217;s true, dislikes can also serve as a signal to others when videos are clickbait, spam or misleading, which can be useful.</p>
<p>YouTube said it had also heard from smaller creators and others who were just getting started on the platform that they felt they were being unfairly targeted by dislike attacks. The experiment confirmed this was true &#8212; creators with smaller channels were targeted with dislike attacks more than larger creators were.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to share the specific details or the data collected through those experiments when TechCrunch asked, however. But it said it ran its tests for &#8220;multiple months&#8221; and conducted &#8220;in-depth analysis of the impact&#8221; as to how the changes affected both users and creators alike.</p>
<p>The company had experimented with different designs for removing the dislike counts, including one where the word &#8220;Dislike&#8221; appeared underneath the thumbs down button instead of the number of dislikes. This is the design the company has now settled on, which is less of a disruptive change to the row of engagement buttons beneath a video.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2232172" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232172" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2232172" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232172" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</em></p></div></p>
<p>The company would not be the first major platform to experiment with the idea of reducing the public visibility of signals that convey user sentiment. For similar mental health-related reasons, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/">a couple of years ago</a> began tests to hide its Like counts globally. It believed the focus on achieving Likes could be detrimental to its community and may make creators less comfortable expressing themselves on the platform. Ultimately, though, neither Facebook nor Instagram could fully commit to a decision and instead put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">the power to hide Likes back under users&#8217; control</a> &#8212; a move that effectively kept the status quo intact.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s changes to the &#8220;dislike&#8221; count are being introduced at a time when there&#8217;s been a public reckoning over big tech and its impact on mental health, particularly when it comes to minors. Companies have been rethinking how their systems are designed to target and influence their user base, as well as what sort of changes they can make ahead of coming regulations. In a number of markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">lawmakers</a> have been dragging in tech execs to hearings &#8212; YouTube included &#8212; and are crafting legislation aimed at reigning in some of tech&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/why-facebooks-angry-emoji-should-interest-the-us-sec/">more</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/the-fda-should-regulate-instagrams-algorithm-as-a-drug/">problematic elements</a>. Mental health is only one area of regulatory interest, though, along with ad targeting, privacy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/leak-shows-facebooks-business-model-needs-regulating-says-mep/">algorithmic boosting</a> of misinformation and more.</p>
<p>In YouTube&#8217;s case, the company has attempted to get ahead of some of the required changes by implementing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">increased protections and privacy features</a> for users ages 13 to 17 while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/youtube-warns-creators-it-will-start-to-demonetize-low-quality-kids-videos-next-month/">decreasing the monetization potential</a> for &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; kids&#8217; content. But the larger shift in the market is also pushing companies to consider the other areas of their platforms that are potentially toxic to broad groups of people.</p>
<p>That said, YouTube told TechCrunch today&#8217;s removal of the dislike count is not being guided by any regulatory changes, but rather its support for creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proactively making this change because YouTube has a responsibility to protect creators, especially smaller creators, from harassment and dislike attacks,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The company, of course, is also rolling this out when the battle for creator talent is becoming hugely competitive among tech giants. Today&#8217;s social platforms are establishing funds to retain their top creators amid increased competition, particularly from the growing threat of TikTok. YouTube this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">announced a $100 million creator fund</a> to jumpstart its short-form video platform, for example. And, over the past year or so, it&#8217;s introduced several new <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636565624705000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3628II0au1cO-CTWEfIMN7">features</a> and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636565624705000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1l6b58XGAH7ZhyGkzzxhB7">policies</a> aimed at improving the creator experience.</p>
<p>The changes to the dislike count will roll out globally across YouTube&#8217;s platform starting today, including all devices and the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sales process can be chaotic, with data flowing in from a variety of sources and a number of people involved. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce bought Slack</a> for more than $27 billion last year because it recognized it could be the glue that holds this together. <a href="https://momentum.io/">Momentum</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to build on that relationship by being the automated collaboration layer between sales and the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5 million seed round led by Basis Set Ventures with participation from Inovia Capital, Leadout Capital, South Park Commons and a group of industry angels.</p>
<p>Momentum CEO and co-founder Santiago Suarez Ordoñez said the company originally wanted to build a deal room on top of Slack, but when Salesforce took that route in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/">its first round of Slack integrations</a> in August, the company decided to attack a different problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232111" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting, and I think this is what ultimately differentiates us from what Salesforce could put together, is as we went down that path of deal rooms and collaboration and we delivered value there, we started realizing that collaboration and sales can be so much more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the founders recognized that salespeople need to connect not only to Slack and Salesforce &#8212; they need to connect with tools like Google Calendar, Asana and Jira, and automate follow-ups from a single place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momentum ended up turning into a platform that allowed those people to streamline that process. Instead of going into Jira and knowing [how to] file a ticket for my security team, I just go to Momentum and raise my hand and I say &#8216;I need a security review,&#8217; and Momentum has codified the process of finding where to go, creating the ticket, sharing all the context about the deal in that ticket for the rep, and the rep doesn&#8217;t have to do anything at that point,&#8221; Suarez Ordoñez explained.</p>
<p>He said that while they still have the deal-room functionality along with this task-driven capability, the plan is to build on that to create a complete platform of similar automated workflows inside Slack, such as getting approval for a discount rate or asking for engineering support for a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company just hired its 14th employee since closing the seed round in August. The company has a diverse founding team that includes Suarez Ordoñez&#8217;s wife &#8212; COO Ashley Wilson &#8212; and CTO Moiz Virani. The company said it takes building a diverse team extremely seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually have a mandate from the top to drive diversity and inclusion,&#8221; Suarez Ordoñez said. &#8220;In fact, one of our investors made it a term in their investment and it ended up being what made us go in with them and make room for them in our round as an investor.&#8221; He added that half the board is female at this early stage and that two of the three investor partners in the round are women.</p>
<p>They launched the company last year amid the heart of the pandemic. &#8220;One of the craziest things about it is that we already had half a dozen employees and customers and we had raised millions of dollars and 99% of that work had happened sitting at the kitchen table in my house, which was quite a wild realization of what happened,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is now operating at least part of the time out of shared spaces, but he said that being together makes it feel more real to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that it wasn&#8217;t real half a year ago, [but the fact that] we couldn&#8217;t be together was just just a weird artifact of how the world was working,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My company wants to send one of its employees to India to open an office there. He came to the United States from India as a child on a visa, but he now has DACA status. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can he take on this project and still be able to return to the United States? Will this impact his ability to renew DACA? Are there any other potential repercussions that we should keep in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Devoted to Dreamers</strong></p>
<p>Dear Devoted,</p>
<p>I appreciate that you and your company are supporting Dreamers and providing peace of mind for your employee. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I have worked with many Dreamers to help them obtain and renew DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) so they can attend university and work. Like other immigrants, Dreamers have to work harder to live the American dream, particularly since the DACA program has faced so many challenges in recent years, which Anita and I chatted about on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/096-daca-in-tech/">podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>Traveling abroad with Advance Parole</h2>
<p>To answer your first question, your employee can travel to India to set up your office there only if he gets what’s called an “Advance Parole” document from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
<p>Since the U.S. ended its COVID-related travel restrictions from India this week, your employee could probably return to the United States with an approved Advance Parole document, complete COVID-19 vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test. You and your employee should know this comes with some risk.</p>
<p>For Advance Parole, your employee (who already has DACA) would have to file <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-131">Form I-131</a> (Application for Travel Document) to USCIS and receive approval <em>before </em>he leaves for India. USCIS usually takes eight months or more these days to process travel document applications due to pandemic-related backlogs. Advance Parole is basically a travel document that allows DACA recipients living inside the United States to travel abroad temporarily for up to a year and seek to reenter the United States.</p>
<p>At its discretion, USCIS may grant Advance Parole for one of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational purposes, such as academic research or a semester-long study abroad program.</li>
<li>Employment purposes, such as overseas projects, conferences, training, interviews or meeting with clients.</li>
<li>Humanitarian purposes, such as to receive medical treatment, visit an ailing relative or attend the funeral of a family member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our experience, DACA recipients requesting Advance Parole based on employment purposes tends to be more difficult to obtain. USCIS adjudicators seem to be more willing to approve Advance Parole based on humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind: Your employee should not leave the U.S. before USCIS issues the Advance Parole document, otherwise his departure from the U.S. will automatically terminate his DACA status, his application for Advance Parole will be considered abandoned and he will not be able to reenter the U.S. In addition, he must have a valid passport from his country of citizenship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://evergrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evergrow</a>, a stealth climate fintech startup, just landed over $7 million in seed funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a two-pronged approach, Evergrow aims to be the world’s first dedicated carbon offtake company &#8212; rapidly funding climate developer projects and initiating long-term offtake agreements for these projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the larger seed rounds of 2021 in the industry, the raise was led by XYZ Venture Capital and Congruent Ventures with participation from First Round Capital, Garuda Ventures, MCJ Collective, Skyview Ventures and numerous other individual investors. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232035" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The problem with climate project financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are core issues in launching and scaling a successful climate project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Banks require an offtake contract &#8211; guarantee purchase of carbon credits created by the project &#8211; to underwrite any financing; securing an offtake contract is difficult when a company is young.  </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/key-takeaways-from-the-sosv-climate-tech-summit/?cx_testId=6&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VC’s expectation on ROI often clashes with industry standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Multiple stakeholders &#8212; insurance, investors, offtakers, debt investors and the project developer themselves &#8212; create long financing timelines, intensive negotiation and extremely complex underwriting processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, climate risk underwriters and insurers have lacked data to create efficient underwriting processes. Each time a project turns up, there is an entirely new underwriting model developed. Finally, securing an offtake contract is done one-to-one. This means projects without an offtake agreement from the onset will have to pander to buyers after the fact.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232043" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232043" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2232043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ulysses Ortega</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow founders James Richards and Luke Whiting aim to streamline and standardize this process. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have set the goal internally of supporting the avoidance, reduction or removal of one gigaton of CO2e by 2030; scaling to a billion tons a year shortly there after,&#8221; Richards states.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With CEO Richards’ background as a former Wall Street lawyer, serial entrepreneur and early-stage investor, and Whiting’s data and software experience as former founding COO of Clearbit, Evergrow shows promise in tackling this enormous challenge. The growth of the carbon markets over the past two years suggests the endeavor could be lucrative as the long-term offtake carbon purchase price is set. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Evergrow] can reduce the complexity two ways,&#8221; Richards said. “One, we can do the work upfront to make a programmatic underwriting and funding model for each project type. And second, we can use data and technology to underwrite or do the majority of the heavy lifting and underwriting versus humans. And so our goal internally is to be almost an order of magnitude faster in terms of time to close than a traditional project financial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked for details on the underwriting structure itself and the capital partners who back them, Richards said, “We aren&#8217;t ready to describe this in detail yet, but we&#8217;re exploring a range of structures with our capital partners to meet their needs. &#8230; We&#8217;re actively building up a base of multiple financial partners.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232041" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232041" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2232041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png 2760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=2048,1116 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evergrow</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Richards did provide insight on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they will be judging risk. Evergrow will utilize historical data points to predict which sets of projects can be underwritten and how. Standardizing the underwriting process is only possible now because the industry has hit a critical mass of data points and success metrics for carbon projects.</span></p>
<h2>Why long-term offtake contracts matter and how they’ll make money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial institutions won’t consider financing climate projects unless they have a dedicated offtake contract. The risk is considered too great. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By bringing long-term offtake contracts to the carbon markets, we provide price certainty and unlock capital for these projects,” Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/15/2297338/0/en/Voluntary-Carbon-Markets-Rocket-in-2021-On-Track-to-Break-1B-for-First-Time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosystem Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the voluntary carbon market has “posted a near-60% increase in value from last year … [with] markets on track to hit $1B in transactions by the end of this year.” Judging by the growth rate, long-term offtake contracts could generate a significant amount of returns for Evergrow’s capital partners.</span></p>
<h2>Fragmented competition and market validations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple players across the different parts Evergrow aims to streamline. Long-term offtake contracts are not new to commodities, though newer in the carbon markets. There is a growing trend among corporations to create long-term offtake contracts with climate projects. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow believes that these companies are signals for market readiness, not necessarily direct competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were really pleased to see what Swiss Re did with Climeworks because we think it&#8217;s great validation of the market,” Richards said. “When a balance sheet as large as Swiss Re thinks that it&#8217;s worthwhile to enter this market and provide what we&#8217;re providing, that&#8217;s really great validation. The opportunity has to be measured in the billions in order for Swiss Re to even think about it or care about it. That was great validation for us.”</span></p>
<h2>It’s not a marketplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step after underwriting, funding and signing the offtake agreement is the eventual return to the capital partners. One competitor, Puro.earth, created a carbon removal marketplace simplifying developers’ access to offtakers. When asked about creating one-to-one marketplace similar to this, Richards was quick to clarify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Evergrow does not match offtake contracts to investors on a deal-by-deal basis,” Richards said. “When you borrow money from Brex, whether on a credit card or working capital line, it&#8217;s not like Brex matches you with an investor on the backend who gets to set the price and you know, say yes or no. Instead, Brex has arranged warehouse financing and more, so Brex can give you that financing immediately. It all gets pooled and then the investors take the pool of return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analogy is especially relevant because Brex CFO Michael Tannenbaum is an investor in Evergrow, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re hoping to emulate that kind of a structure, where we raise one or more facilities from the capital markets into which all of our offtake contracts get pooled,” Richards said. “Investors get the benefit of aggregation and pooling and also levered exposure to the underlying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The set price of a long-term offtake agreement allows stability for the developer and financing partners with understandable risk growth. The silver bullet lies in Evergrow’s ability to efficiently underwrite the right products, though without the specifics on the exact underwriting model, it’s tough to fully predict their success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow has a handful of notable individuals investing in the startup &#8212; Bridgewater Associates Sustainability investor Karen Karniol-Tambour, Plaid CEO Zach Perret and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, among others. Evergrow will start in California and expand to the U.S. with hopes of international expansion depending on the climate project type. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Christopher Male’s son was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in 2018, the long-time investor found himself in unfamiliar territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the time, I literally knew the word ‘autism,’ and that was about it,” he recalls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to help his son, Male immersed himself in the topic and found what he described as an “incredibly fragmented and polarized community and marketplace, inadequate, antiquated solutions with hefty price tags and long wait lines.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231310" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He determined there was “no scientific understanding of what was happening in the marketplace.” In part driven by capitalism but mostly driven by an eagerness to help his child and others like him, Male dove in and, earlier this year, teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian O&#8217;Callaghan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span><a href="https://autismimpact.fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Autism Impact Fund (AIF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fund’s mission is to &#8220;revolutionize the status quo for diagnosing treating and living with autism through a venture-capital model.”  So far, AIF has invested in seven early-stage companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF brought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Sarrazin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to serve as its chief investment officer and managing partner. Male and Sarrazin manage the fund’s day-to-day operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need is there. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%2054%20children%20has%20been%20identified,occur%20in%20all%20racial%2C%20ethnic%2C%20and%20socioeconomic%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts 1 in 54 children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and millions of families around the world, according to the CDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We created the Autism Impact Fund with the ambition of becoming the investment and innovation arm of the autism community,” said Male. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just a massive societal issue with a system that is very, very broken, and our goal is to change that system.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a decade, Male operated his family’s investment office. He then launched his own venture fund. But he admits there has been no role in his life more important than his current one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF has enlisted a high-profile group of advisors, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who has</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">twin boys with autism; Jennifer Frist of the Frist Center for Autism &amp; Innovation at Vanderbilt University; and Bob Nelsen, co-founder and managing director of ARCH Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Male declined to reveal AIF’s LPs, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said they include high net worth institutions and family offices. The fund is actively fundraising so Male could not comment on those plans, other than to say things were going well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market for us has been quite positive and on track, so we’re further ahead than we thought we would be,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF makes direct investments across a variety of sectors, such as biology, environment and behavior, and stages of financing. It is intentionally focused on for-profit companies so that its work doesn’t overlap with nonprofits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not just a group of individuals. We&#8217;re professional investors,” Male said. “We&#8217;re also bringing together the community through academics, government institutions, nonprofits and foundations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portfolio companies include Axial, which is developing gut-restricted small molecule agents intended for the treatment of core autism symptoms; BioROSA, which is developing a biomarker for autism; Floreo, which provides a range of therapies through an AI-driven virtual reality platform; and Joshin, a digital care platform for people with special needs whose funding TechCrunch </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/minnesota-twins-raise-3m-to-increase-accessibility-to-disability-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Slattery and Marie Causey founded Boston area startup </span><a href="http://www.biorosa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BioROSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is developing a biomarker that aims to detect ASD in children as young as 18 months, in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would bring down the average age of diagnosis, which is currently four plus years and is very skewed with minority and less affluent populations not doing well with that,” Male told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BioROSA has raised just north of $3 million, including a round in which AIF participated in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is strong academic research that supports the thesis that this company is built on,” Slattery said. “Our goal is to allow for early detection, and transform the diagnostic standard of care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For families with autism, the investments made by AIF could be life-changing &#8212; and you can’t get much more meaningful than that.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getcacheflow.com/">Cacheflow</a> this morning announced its exit from stealth and a seed round worth $6 million.</p>
<p>The startup is a wager that the software buying experience of today is antiquated &#8212; and a rising source of frustration. So, Cacheflow is building a hybrid buying service and financing solution to make it simpler.</p>
<p>On the money side of things, <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/team/glenn-solomon/">GGV&#8217;s Glenn Solomon</a> led the company&#8217;s seed round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://pelionvp.com/">Pelion Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.neythrifuturesfund.com/">Neythri Futures Fund</a>, a collective of South Asian women looking to change the ratio in venture capital investing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232021" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cacheflow CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sarikagarg">Sarika Garg</a> emphasized to TechCrunch the importance of having a diverse cap table in the round, and at her company more broadly. Per Neythri Futures Fund, a slim quarter of a percent of U.S. venture partners are South Asian women, meaning that getting the group onto the Cacheflow ownership docket early could provide material upside to the investor demographic if the company succeeds.</p>
<p>Thematically, Cacheflow&#8217;s market wager makes sense. According to Garg, companies are no longer buying software in long procurement cycles that involve golf and dinners. Correct. And modern corporations are buying more discrete pieces of software than ever before. Also correct. But, almost oddly, although companies need more software, the selling process is still somewhat manual, with myriad phone calls and documents and e-signatures. Anyone who has friends working in SaaS sales can confirm this.</p>
<p>With most companies wanting to sell yearly contracts with upfront payments for cash flow reasons, SaaS sales can prove oddly rigid in the modern era, when you&#8217;d expect more flexibility. To attack that issue, Cacheflow wants to offer buyers a number of payment options while also providing upfront cash to software companies.</p>
<p>Cacheflow will let customers choose to pay for their software contract monthly, quarterly or even on a deferred basis. This may help customers buy software even when they have exhausted a particular budget cycle, Garg said. And that means that software concerns can sell more consistently without having to wait for yearly budgets to reset late in the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the risk that Cacheflow will take on regarding non-payment of a contract &#8212; if the company allows a software customer to defer payment on a yearly contract while also paying the provider upfront, there&#8217;s risk inherent &#8212; Garg said that her company can peer into a customer firm&#8217;s SaaS metrics and properly take into account the chance of customer infidelity.</p>
<p>I presume that the startup will get better at that work as it grows its customer base. Today Cacheflow has a few pilot customers, with intentions to bolster its roster in the coming months. It&#8217;s just coming out of stealth, mind, so it&#8217;s still early days on an operating basis.</p>
<p>Checkout technologies in general have had a big few quarters, with names <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">like Checkout.com,</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/"> Fast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/bolt-adds-75m-to-its-series-c-as-the-battle-to-rule-online-checkout-continues/">Bolt raising oodles of boodle</a>. And we&#8217;ve seen SaaS financing services also scale rapidly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">like Pipe</a>. Cacheflow is a little bit of both.</p>
<p>Cacheflow thinks that it can make the SaaS buying process more flexible &#8212; and faster. That could mean better sales results for software companies and simpler procurement for software customers. Given the growing bulk of the software market more generally, the goals make sense. From here, it&#8217;s up to Cacheflow to prove that it can embed its software into a great number of SaaS checkout processes and generate material top line from its labors.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today we spoke about the revolution within agriculture otherwise known as <strong>vertical farming</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> spoke to hardware editor <a href="http://twitter.com/bheater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Heater</a>, who recently wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">TC-1 about Bowery Farming </a>spanning over 11,000 words and topics such as the taste of sustainable turnips and produce sections at grocery stores. The core of his multi-part exploration, though, was built around a question: Can Bowery Farms bring the newest and most innovative technologies to bear on civilization’s oldest and most optimized industry?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a result, our episode went down a lot of tasty rabbit holes. We spoke about the current state of vertical farming, the challenges that come with commercialization and our struggling climate, and if your local dairy farm is actually thinking about adding a robot to their staff.</p>
<p>There was more to chew on, including the balance between sustainability and profit, how to think about carbon footprints, the commercialization of vertical farming today, and how some folks are spending $30 on a strawberry. We had a lovely time and will have Brian back on the pod.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the TC-1 if you&#8217;re interested:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture </a>(3,500 words/14 minutes) — explores the evolution of vertical farming, its expansion in Japan and how Bowery Farming was started to bring indoor farming to the masses in the United States.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a> (2,500 words/10 minutes) — evaluates how Bowery collects data from its farms in order to optimize flavor while also potentially expanding its produce line into new categories like strawberries and turnips.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-technology/">Can LEDs ultimately replace the sun?</a> (2,100 words/8 minutes) — investigates two of the most important questions about Bowery Farming: Can it develop a competitive moat with its technology (which it dubs BoweryOS) and just how much environmental benefit can the company derive from its farms?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-competition/">The voracious fight for your salad bowl </a>(3,000 words/12 minutes) — looks at the extremely competitive nature of the produce section at the grocery store and how Bowery intends to build a brand with consumers while finding a route to profitability.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/a-chat-with-the-author-of-the-vertical-farm/">An interview with the author of The Vertical Farm</a> — a bonus conversation with Dickson Despommier, frequently credited as the creator vertical farming in its modern context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Equity team will be back Friday morning with our weekly roundup. Our hearts go out to Mary Ann who will return to us in due time, and our general ire is reserved for Danny. Because we are still smarting from his divorcing of us for Lux.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and ViacomCBS today announced a sizable global deal that will see the social media platform streaming digital content from across the ViacomCBS portfolio of news, sports and entertainment brands &#8212; including content from live events, TV shows and other franchises. In addition, ViacomCBS-owned streaming service Paramount+ will host three &#8220;Twitter Watch Parties&#8221; designed to capitalize on Twitter&#8217;s ability to serve as a second screen and a home to fan communities and conversations.</p>
<p>The companies did not specify which Paramount+ shows would be hosted as Watch Parties, only noting that they would be original series.</p>
<p>The content partnership represents a significant expansion of Twitter&#8217;s prior deal with the media giant. Before, Twitter&#8217;s deal had been a U.S.-only partnership with just Viacom, ahead of the ViacomCBS merger. The renewed agreement is now a multi-year, global deal and expands to include the entire ViacomCBS portfolio. That means it also now includes news and sports, instead of only entertainment properties, as before. The companies declined to detail the financial terms, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232046" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ViacomCBS umbrella today covers a wide range of brands, such as BET, CBS Television Network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Channel 5, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Network 10, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network and Telefe.</p>
<p>In recent months, Twitter and ViacomCBS have partnered on select live events, including the 2021 MTV Music Video Awards, which aired its live pre-show on Twitter, and the BET Awards, which livestreamed from the red carpet to Twitter. It&#8217;s likely that under the new agreement, Twitter users will gain continued access to these types of events. As for which other properties and programs will be featured on Twitter in the months ahead, ViacomCBS would not say.</p>
<p>While the new agreement is focused on hosting digital content, it will also involve Twitter&#8217;s marketing support. The ViacomCBS programs will be eligible for both marketing support and brand sponsorship sales through Twitter&#8217;s Amplify program, which connects ViacomCBS&#8217; video with Twitter&#8217;s paid reach and targeting, the company said. ViacomCBS will also leverage other marketing features around live video, real-time highlights and Twitter Moments.</p>
<p>Twitter in previous years had heavily focused on its ability to serve live video content to its users, by doing things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/twitter-now-puts-live-broadcasts-at-the-top-of-your-timeline/">pinning live video to the top of the Timeline</a>, offering livestreamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/twitter-announces-new-live-shows-from-the-wnba-buzzfeed-live-nation-and-more/">events</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/twitter-stream-concerts/">concerts</a>, and more. But over time, news of those types of partnerships dwindled. Twitter even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">shut down</a> its own livestreaming app Periscope to focus more on its new set of social features, like Fleets, Spaces, Communities, Super Follows and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Twitter is again doing deals to make digital content a part of its core offering. In early 2021, for example,<a href="https://together.nbcuni.com/news/nbcu-twitter-expand-digital-content-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NBCUniversal and Twitter announced</a> their own global, multi-year partnership, similar to this with ViacomCBS.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re thrilled to extend our long-standing relationship with Twitter in this expansive global deal that brings together the full ViacomCBS portfolio and magnifies the scale and scope of our valued partnership,&#8221; said Andrea Wolinetz, SVP, Distribution &amp; Business Development-Streaming at ViacomCBS, in a statement. &#8220;Twitter is the digital water cooler for trending topics and fandom worldwide, and we’re excited to provide front-row access to innovative digital content experiences and culture-defining moments across the best of entertainment, news and sports for Twitter users everywhere.&#8221;</p>
