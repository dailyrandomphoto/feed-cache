					<description><![CDATA[The company touts this new round of funding as “the largest Series B round ever raised in Latin America.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to investment in e-commerce aggregators in Latin America lately, when it rains, it pours.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merama.io/">Merama</a>, which acquires or launches Latin American digital brands, hit a $1.2 billion valuation — just 12 months after incorporation — following a new $60 million follow-on investment led by Series B investors Advent International and Softbank. It also comes a day after fellow LatAm e-commerce aggregator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/quinio-jumps-into-world-of-e-commerce-aggregators-with-20m-seed/">Quinio announced $20 million in initial funding</a> to acquire some 30 companies.</p>
<p>The investment follows a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928005398/en/E-Commerce-Brand-Builder-Merama-Closes-US225-Million-Series-B-Financing-Co-Led-by-Advent-International-and-SoftBank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$225 million Series B investment</a>, announced in September, that put the Mexico- and Brazil based-company at an $850 million valuation. At the time, the company touted it as “the largest Series B round ever raised in Latin America.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245137" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We first profiled Merama back in April when it burst onto the e-commerce aggregator scene with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/merama-lands-160m-to-grow-e-commerce-product-business-in-latin-america/">$160 million in a combined debt-and-equity seed and Series A round</a>. In total, the company has raised $445 million, of which $345 million is equity and $100 million is debt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ygbZdkLaru"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/merama-lands-160m-to-grow-e-commerce-product-business-in-latin-america/">Armed with $160M in funding, LatAm&#8217;s Merama enters the e-commerce land grab</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Armed with $160M in funding, LatAm&#8217;s Merama enters the e-commerce land grab&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/merama-lands-160m-to-grow-e-commerce-product-business-in-latin-america/embed/#?secret=ygbZdkLaru" data-secret="ygbZdkLaru" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company was co-founded by CEO Sujay Tyle, co-founder and former CEO of Frontier Car Group; Felipe Delgado, previously CEO of Beetmann Energy; Olivier Scialom, co-founder and former COO of Petsy; Renato Andrade, previously associate partner at McKinsey; and Guilherme Nosralla, former head of growth at Wildlife Studios.</p>
<p>“Latin America is the fastest growing e-commerce region in the world yet brands are extremely nascent or non-existent,” Tyle told TechCrunch via email. “Merama believes several multi-billion dollar brands will be created in LatAm over the next five years.”</p>
<p>Today, Merama has more than 180 employees and a portfolio of 20 brands across Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. It is poised to sell over $250 million of product merchandise this year, and will be “significantly cash flow positive,” Tyle said.</p>
<p>Its prominent brands include Mexican consumer electronics company Redlemon and Bebesit, a baby products seller in Chile. Overall, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly, with projections of it <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aside from acquiring digital brands, the company launches its own as well as developing automation and scalability tools to help them grow across Latin America. It also plans to monetize the underlying technology it is building that automates brand management and supply chain.</p>
<p>The latest funding will enable the company to expand into Argentina and the United States. Merama also rounded out its executive team with the hires of former Mandae CTO Danilo Ferreira as Merama’s CTO, and former MercadoLibre director of marketplace Ignacio Nart, to be senior vice president of private label.</p>
<p>Overall, e-commerce aggregators have gained traction across the world in the past few years, with successful companies securing billions of venture-backed capital in recent years. In addition to Quinio, Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a> this week.</p>
<p>Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Different from Thrasio and Perch, Tyle explained that “Latin America is a growth story and thus Merama focuses on significantly fewer brands and is focused on scale and expansion. The goal is to have a single category leader in each major e-commerce category rather than consolidate hundreds of brands.”</p>
<p>The funding also helps the company to launch Merama Labs, touting it as “the first-of-its-kind Latin American incubator for direct-to-consumer brands.” The internal incubator will create new D2C brands in categories like fashion, cosmetics, supplements and beverages. It is a new growth channel that incubates and launches digital D2C brands in multiple categories in-house.</p>
<p>“We will create brands alongside influencers,” Tyle added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company offers a data-driven approach to streamlining the retailer procurement process with brands while connecting consumers to a wider variety of products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://podfoods.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pod Foods</a> is keeping grocery shelves full of the emerging food brands that consumers are asking for and announced today $10 million in Series A funding to continue developing its digital wholesale business-to-business marketplace.</p>
<p>We profiled the Austin-based company’s founders Larissa Russell and Fiona Lee back in 2019 when they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/pod-foods/">raised $3 million</a> in a round led by Moment Ventures that also included M12. The company’s technology offers a data-driven approach to streamlining the retailer procurement process with brands while connecting consumers to a wider variety of products, including those from up-and-coming brands.</p>
<p>Following the seed round, Pod Foods launched in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, and also launched a mobile app for more easy inventory management to match the right products to the right retailers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245004" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Then the global pandemic hit. In efforts to keep store shelves stocked, the company noticed emerging brands, the niche it focuses on, were displaced from the shelves in favor of established brands. So the company leaned in on creating brand awareness.</p>
<p>“That created acceleration and amplified all of the things we set out to change,” Russell told TechCrunch. “We took 2020 to lean into the challenges, as a result of the pandemic, and work on the business.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jTe4o7J7gJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/pod-foods/">Pod Foods gets VC backing to reinvent grocery distribution</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pod Foods gets VC backing to reinvent grocery distribution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/pod-foods/embed/#?secret=jTe4o7J7gJ" data-secret="jTe4o7J7gJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both M12 and Moment Ventures returned for the Series A, which was led by Industrious Ventures, and now gives the company $13 million in total funding. Additional investors participating in the round include Unshackled Ventures, Barrel Ventures, Relish Works, X Factor Ventures, XRC Labs, K2 Global and Graphene Ventures.</p>
<p>The latest investment is in line with Pod Foods’ growth trajectory, Russell said. The company is already in seven cities and will expand to 10 as it sees a 20% increase in repeat brand purchases today compared to pre-pandemic data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series A also enabled the company to do more hiring, growing to 58 employees from 33 last December. Pod Foods secured a chief technology officer, Timothy Wee, who has a background from Google, Amazon and Walmart, and will also invest in data to build out new services and products, Lee said.</p>
<p>Delivery services rapidly grew over the past two years, driven by consumer expectations of getting items delivered faster, causing retailers to struggle to keep up with demand. As a result, Pod Foods saw both its revenue and customer base triple year-over-year since 2019, while helping retailers adapt faster to resetting products faster based on what sells and what doesn’t, Russell said.</p>
<p>“We’ve had to adapt,” Lee added. “What used to sell would be things like grab-and-go products, but when the pandemic hit, products selling more were like frozen items and beverages. We have to pivot quickly, but because we are small and nimble, we could quickly say what they wanted and get brands on board and keep retailers’ shelves stocked.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/497691544?h=8b3999effb" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<p>Next up, Pod Foods’ expansion plans include the Pacific Northwest and a greater footprint surrounding its New York and Chicago locations, the company’s largest market, and in Florida.</p>
<p>Christian Gammill, partner at Industrious Ventures, said Pod Foods’ approach “is the first to provide the logistics infrastructure needed to completely overhaul the grocery supply chain for the better, creating a true end-to-end system that enables both retailers and brands to thrive.”</p>
<p>With commerce setting the tone for the supply chain, the company put digital at the forefront, built a data-intelligent operation and is now leveraging an impending inflection point. If companies like Pod Foods can get the data play right, it will help customers and brands, he said.</p>
<p>“Larissa and Fiona are amazing and have a compatible skill set,” Gammill added. “I didn&#8217;t see a lot of attention on this space, but a ton in other supply chains, so it made sense and why we dug in.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://resolvepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which specializes in “buy now, pay later” capabilities for B2B transactions, announced today that it has raised $25 million in equity funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment comes just months after the company secured a combined $60 million asset and equity financing. Insight Partners led its latest round, which also included participation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from existing backers Initialized Capital, KSD Capital, Haystack VC, Commerce Ventures and Clocktower Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching as a spinout from Affirm in 2019, </span><a href="https://resolvepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says it has seen “overwhelming” demand for its B2B buy now, pay later (BNPL) billing offering for business purchases. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245235" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Affirm — which is more focused on the consumer — Resolve is exclusively focused on business-to-business billing by automating the process of billing and purchasing on credit. What it’s doing is basically allowing businesses to defer payments digitally and on better terms than what they’ve seen historically via an automated underwriting process, the company claims. This, it says, can lead to faster invoice payment and thus, improved cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also claims it can offer extended payment terms with buyers not having to pay any interest or fees if accounts are repaid within the agreed-upon terms. Meanwhile, merchants receive full payment (minus any fees) as soon as an order is placed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market for simplifying net terms payments and embedding BNPL payment options is exploding as companies work to mitigate the pain of payments caused by overextended and snarled supply chains,” said Chris Tsai, Resolve’s CEO and co-founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup in particular is seeing an increasing number of small business service providers as of late embrace BNPL as a less risky way to offer net terms to customers who expect to pay later.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2245242" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245242" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245242 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg 1003w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=768,598 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Resolve-Product-Images.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245242" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Resolve</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve, ahem, resolves to make net terms simple and easily embeddable. Historically, noted Tsai, a manufacturer, distributor or B2B marketplace that wanted to give their customers 30, 60 or 90 days to pay an invoice would have had to take on the obligations and characteristics of a bank, such as credit checks, onboarding and accounting reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was laborious and took a lot of time and money. In contrast, we offer ‘net terms-as-a-service’ so that companies can provide the professional net terms their customers expect with all the benefits and none of the hassle or risk,” Tsai told TechCrunch. “We make sure the merchant gets paid upfront without having to actually wait for the end of the payment term while facilitating the complex end to end process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolve stands out from others in the space, according to Tsai, in that it both simplifies the net terms process and makes credit embeddable anywhere a business might want to accept B2B payments. Its ability to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrate into existing ERP/accounting tools that businesses already use is appealing to many users, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, believes Resolve is using automation and a “delightful” digital experience to address an age-old problem &#8212; business’ access to working capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The company’s innovative product creates a win-win for B2B buyers and sellers that is analogous to buy now, pay later offerings that have changed the game for consumers,” she wrote via email. “We believe B2B BNPL remains a massive, untapped market, and early movers like Resolve are well-positioned to take advantage.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/vercel-raises-150m-series-d-as-it-looks-to-build-an-end-to-end-front-end-development-platform/">well-funded</a> front-end development platform from the team behind Next.js, today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://turborepo.com/">Turborepo</a>, a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos, an increasingly popular way for organizing source code into a single repository that includes all of the necessary packages to build an application.</p>
<p>As part of this acquisition, Vercel is open-sourcing the Turborepo command-line interface and giving Turborepo users a path for migrating their caching infrastructure to Vercel. Turborepo founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredlpalmer/">Jared Palmer</a> will join Vercel to lead its build performance team. He will also continue to work on the Turborepo project.</p>
<p>When I last talked to Vercel co-founder and CEO Guillermo Rauch, he noted that &#8220;strategic acquisitions are always on the table&#8221; for the company. He noted that for a lot of companies, scaling their front-ends often becomes a major hassle, with increasingly long build times and teams that can reach hundreds of people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244497" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Turborepo is a build system that sits atop of Next.js. It allows you to diversify your investment in different front-end projects and solutions. You can combine Next.js, Svelte, Vu.js and so on, while giving the team this organizational primitive, as well as really fast builds because the system can intelligently decide what to build and what to reuse across our teams. I&#8217;ve sometimes likened it to the Tesla self-driving fleet, where one car learns &#8212; and the whole fleet learns. In the case of this build system, when one team builds, those artifacts that are produced are shared by the entire organization. This way, everyone becomes faster and learns and gets helped by the efforts of the other teams.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="twAOF9X9o2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/vercel-raises-150m-series-d-as-it-looks-to-build-an-end-to-end-front-end-development-platform/">Vercel raises $150M Series D as it looks to build an end-to-end front-end development platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vercel raises $150M Series D as it looks to build an end-to-end front-end development platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/vercel-raises-150m-series-d-as-it-looks-to-build-an-end-to-end-front-end-development-platform/embed/#?secret=twAOF9X9o2" data-secret="twAOF9X9o2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition, but Vercel does have a nice war chest to make these moves now that it has raised a total of $313 million, with the last round valuing it at $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw an incredible amount of complexity in the way most frontend development teams build, test, and deploy their code and set out to create the best way to scale and build a frontend codebase. Turborepo gives developers the ability to manage this complexity without the maintenance burden that comes with traditional monorepo architectures,&#8221; said Palmer in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The combination of Turborepo with Vercel&#8217;s build time and build infrastructure bridges the gap between what every developer needs and what, until now, only the hyperscalers have had. It’s somewhat magical, and also really, really, really ridiculously fast. This is the platform for the future of business on the web.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turborepo had not raised any external funding before this acquisition, but it was looking to raise its first round, which Vercel effectively pre-empted with this acquisition, as Rauch told me. The companies are not disclosing the terms of the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Italy’s competition authority <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/12/A528-chiusura">announced</a> that it had fined Amazon €1.129 billion, or roughly $1.3 billion at today’s exchange rate. According to the antitrust watchdog, Amazon has abused its dominant market position and pushed third-party sellers to use the company’s logistics service ‘Fulfillment by Amazon’ (FBA).</p>
<p>The Italian authority, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), details its thinking in a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/12/A528-chiusura">statement</a> and a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/allegati-news/A528_chiusura%20istruttoria.pdf">250-page report</a>. According to them, third-party sellers don’t get the same treatment if they’re leveraging FBA or using their own logistics stack.</p>
<p>Sellers who take advantage of FBA can participate in the company’s paid loyalty program Amazon Prime. Subscribers get free deliveries on some products. In addition to Amazon’s own inventory, products from third-party sellers that come from Amazon’s warehouses thanks to FBA also get a Prime label.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245357" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This leads to far-reaching consequences as Prime products are then included in Amazon’s events, such as Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In other words, you have a better chance of getting featured in Amazon’s events if you use ‘Fulfillment by Amazon’.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. On Amazon’s product page, the company automatically selects a seller for the buy box. On a computer, the buy box is the box on the right side of the screen that lets you add a product to your cart or buy directly with the ‘Buy Now’ button.</p>
<p>You can see other sellers in a tiny box below the buy box. According to Italy’s competition authority, sellers who use FBA have a higher chance of getting featured in the buy box compared to other third-party sellers.</p>
<p>I tried to find a good example on Amazon.it and here’s what I found on this <a href="https://www.amazon.it/WOLTU-Copriwater-Universale-Ammortizzata-Antibatterico/dp/B00H40PQ4O/">toilet seat</a>. Amazon itself doesn’t sell the product directly. You can only get it from third-party sellers. By default, Amazon features WOLTU GmbH in the buy box. The item is shipped by Amazon as WOLTU GmbH uses FBA. And you can get free expedited shipping with Amazon Prime.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="855" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2245361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png 2998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=768,641 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=1536,1282 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=2048,1709 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.03-PM.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Below that buy box, there’s a tiny box that says you can get it from another seller. This time, we can see WOLTU GmbH once again (and a used product from &#8216;Amazon Warehouse&#8217;). It’s the same seller, but they ship it directly to you and you also get free shipping.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="526" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2245362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png 2998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=2048,1053 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-09-at-1.45.27-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Why does WOLTU GmbH list the same toilet seat twice? FBA isn’t a free logistics service. Amazon gets a larger cut from items that are sold through FBA. And it seems like WOLTU GmbH would get more revenue from a direct sale. But it&#8217;s unlikely that customers will choose to get the toilet seat from the seller directly because it&#8217;s hidden in a submenu.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ilsr.org/amazons-toll-road/">recent study</a> from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance has highlighted that Amazon is generating more and more revenue from third-party sellers, highlighting that FBA is a vicious circle and that third-party sellers have become a captive audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a similar fashion, Amazon has compelled sellers to buy its warehousing and shipping service, Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA). Amazon’s algorithms heavily favor sellers who do so, making FBA all but required in order to generate sales on the site. As a result, the share of sellers who have left other carriers and signed on to FBA has soared in recent years. By compelling this captive base of businesses to use its shipping service, Amazon has grown into a major logistics provider almost overnight. Its parcel delivery operation now rivals that of the U.S. Postal Service in scale. And, over the last few years, Amazon has steadily raised its storage and shipping fees, using FBA as yet another way to squeeze revenue from sellers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Italian authority has asked Amazon to create a new set of standards that would be fair to third-party sellers whether they are using FBA or not. The company will also have to implement behavioral measures. A monitoring trustee will review the changes.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/italy-fines-amazon-for-abuse-of-dominant-position-085244332-085736675.html">has shared a statement with Engadget</a>. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate,” the company said.</p>

<p>The fridge-sized satellite has three telescopes that can track and measure the direction, arrival time, energy, and polarization of light. When data from all those telescopes is combined, NASA can form images that could give us more insight into how mysterious celestial objects — those that emit X-ray — work. For instance, they&#8217;re hoping it can give us a more thorough look at the structure of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant with a neutron star rapidly spinning in its center.</p>
<p>By observing black holes, the IXPE will help scientists gain more insight and broaden humanity&#8217;s knowledge on the regions of space we still barely know. It could provide clues on why they spin and how they gobble up cosmic materials, though it could also lead to new discoveries. Martin Weisskopf, the mission&#8217;s principal investigator, said during a briefing: &#8220;IXPE will help us test and refine our current theories of how the universe works. We may even discover more exciting theories about these exotic objects than what we&#8217;ve hypothesized.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245351" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Covid-19 pandemic ushered in a new chapter for virtual learning, giving a boost of attention to existing tools and spurring the creation of new services and use cases as students of all ages were ordered to stay home and stay out of classrooms. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s been a strong benefactor of that trend is announcing some funding to continue its growth. <a href="https://atomlearning.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom Learning</a> &#8212; a London startup that builds AI-based online education materials aimed at primary aged (7-11 years) children, their teachers, and their parents &#8212; has raised $25 million, money that it will use to continue its growth in the UK market, to start to look at plans to expand internationally, and to continue building out the data science and content that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>Specifically, Atom&#8217;s unique selling point is that it builds education materials that use machine learning and other AI tools to adapt to a users&#8217; specific levels of knowledge; it also applies data science to build analytics and other tools for educators and parents to also work in more targeted ways to encourage more learning. All of these will also be getting more investment.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single backer, SoftBank, via its Vision Fund 2, and Atom claims that this sum is the largest-ever for Series A round for a UK edtech startup.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It is also notable for being Atom&#8217;s first outside funding. The company, founded in 2018, had been profitable and bootstrapped up to now, and it&#8217;s grown quite impressively in the last three years. Currently, Atom is used by 500 primary (elementary) schools in the UK, totaling some 100,000 students. (Given that there are some 22,000 primary schools in the country, it has a lot of growing left to do here.)</p>
<p>Co-founded by Jake O&#8217;Keeffe and Alexander Hatvany, O&#8217;Keeffe tells me that the two had their first taste of online learning when they worked as online tutors when still at university &#8212; very much a common side-gig for undergrads in the UK, where pre-university students face a battery of standardized tests as they go through their years in school, with each set narrowing the field for students and where they will end up for university, what they ultimately study, and essentially do with their lives.</p>
<p>(And, as an expat parent raising UK students, I can tell you it&#8217;s a super stressful system that is very far from perfect in all kinds of ways.)</p>
<p>Covering all ages and all subjects, the pair quickly saw the shortcomings in the model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We could see that no two private tutors were the same, even if the costs were always high,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We thought there was an opportunity to build a fully-automated platform to help standardize the quality and the price.&#8221;</p>
<p>They chose to focus on primary-aged children, he said, not only because there were already a number of online tutoring services out in the market for secondary-school students (aged 12-18), but also because they believed that the fundamentals of learning needed to be addressed at a younger age.</p>
<p>&#8220;If kids don’t learn those skills by the time they are 11, it’s hard to recover from that when you are older,&#8221; O&#8217;Keeffe said.</p>
<p>The obvious place for Atom was to start was online learning aimed at students. Specifically, it has built a <a href="https://atomlearning.co.uk/tutors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-tier model</a> aimed first at teaching students the basics according to the national core curriculum (priced at £9.99/month); and then two subsequent tiers (£49.99/ and £59.99/month) aimed at students who are preparing for senior school entry exams &#8212; a system here in the UK for students going to private schools or for certain upper-level grammar schools and other places requiring a test to get in that&#8217;s called the 11+).</p>
<p>Atom naturally evolved that into content for teachers, with &#8220;question banks&#8221; for them to create better learning materials for students online and in the classroom, and then tools for parents to better track how everything progressed. The adaptive element means that the platform &#8220;reads&#8221; how students work to provide subsequent work tailored to each person&#8217;s individual level, but it also means that Atom can continually amass feedback on how those students are doing, useful for Atom&#8217;s own content library evolution as well as to create ways to track student progress.</p>
<p>These days, there are really a lot of online learning materials for all ages both across proprietary, branded platforms that you pay to use, or are free to use, as well as across more open-ended and general platforms like YouTube. It&#8217;s a giant content trove made even bigger in the last two years with so many schools shuttering their doors and turning to remote learning. That means not only competition for Atom, but also a plethora of pedagogical approaches around what might work best in terms of acquiring knowledge, keeping it, keeping children engaged and so on.</p>
<p>Kahoot, for example, (another SoftBank-backed company) has borrowed heavily from the worlds of gaming, user-generated/creator content, and on-demand entertainment to create what it has been described at times as a &#8220;Netflix for learning&#8221;: a huge library of short educational modules, many of which have been created by Kahoot&#8217;s user community, which are built around the dynamics of gamification to motivate and engage pupils in a subject. Others, such as Microsoft&#8217;s tailoring of Teams for education or Zoom, are simply tools to make it easier for good old-fashioned humans to connect over remote distances and work together on white-board style interfaces to teach and learn.</p>
<p>For now, O&#8217;Keeffe said that Atom is focused on continuing to build out more content to bolster the approach it has taken: more adaptive content that complements the work that a school teacher puts in, with the bigger aim being to make sure that kids are, at the most simple level, learning according to the national curriculum (as set out by the government), and hopefully, exceeding that and developing an appetite to learn more.</p>
<p>That means: maybe some gamification somewhere down the line, but not for now. But it also means: Atom is bringing private tutors into the mix soon, too (right now there is a <a href="https://atomlearning.co.uk/tutors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration page</a> for early access).</p>
<p>“The utilization of edtech and adaptive learning within established curricula has accelerated rapidly both in school and the home”, said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Atom’s proprietary technology enables each child to progress at their optimal learning pace, and provides parents and teachers with real-time feedback on areas of strength and development. We’re excited to partner with the team in its vision to improve learning outcomes for every student.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Petra emerged from stealth this week, announcing a $30 million Series A. The round, led by DCVC, brings the robotics company’s funding up to $33 million, with additional participation from ACME Capital Congruent Ventures, 8VC, Real Ventures, Elementum Ventures and Mac Venture Capital.</p>
<p>“We’ve invented a completely new way to excavate rock and this will have profound implications on the future of tunneling,” co-founder and CEO Kim Abrams said in release tied to the news. “By delivering a boring solution that affordably undergrounds utilities through high-grade rock, we can finally protect communities from exposure to wildfires and ensure the safety of critical infrastructure in disaster-prone areas, especially in places like the Sierra Nevada mountains, Rocky Mountains, and coastal regions.”</p>
<p>The news arrives as the company is announcing a successful pilot of its robot, Swifty. According to the firm, the robot successfully bored a 20-foot tunnel through Sioux Quartzite at a rate of one inch-per-minute. The metamorphic rock is notoriously hard, making it a popular choice for buildings in the upper Midwest region in which it is found. That strength, however, also makes it a formidable challenge from infrastructure and other projects that require tunneling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244474" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244494" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244494" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244494" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Recording-2021-12-07-at-4.23.01-PM.2021-12-07-16_24_45.gif" alt="" width="600" height="509" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244494" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Petra</p></div></p>
<p>“No tunneling method has been able to tunnel through this kind of hard rock until now. Petra’s achievement is due to Swifty’s thermal drilling method, which efficiently bores through rock without touching it,” said Tesla co-founder, Ian Wright, who has signed on as the company’s CTO. “Boring 20 feet through impossibly hard Sioux Quartzite proves our unique capability to affordably bury utility sized tunnels through high-grade hard rock.”</p>
<p>The robotic system utilizes machine vision, microtunneling through difficult materials with the use of thermal drilling, rather than making direct contact with the rock. The company notes in a release, “Switfy provides a number of novel advantages over conventional microtunneling methods. Conventional microtunneling machines are purpose-built for a single diameter. However, Swifty is the first robot capable of boring a range of diameters between 20-60 inches, dramatically reducing the cost of tunneling.”</p>
<p>The company cites a wide range of potential uses for such boring technologies, including construction, maintenance and the creation of tunnels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many edtech companies benefited from the disruption of the pandemic, attracting wads of cash from investors globally, it did feel like African startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out. Well, not anymore: Two-year-old startup <a href="https://ulesson.com/">uLesson</a> announced today that it closed a $15 million Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, which comes 11 months after uLesson raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/african-edtech-startup-ulesson-lands-a-7-5-million-series-a/">a $7.5 million Series A</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was completed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five investors: Tencent, Nielsen Ventures, and existing investors Owl Ventures, TLcom Capital and Founder Collective. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the largest disclosed investment in an African edtech startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Nigerian serial founder <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/simdul">Sim Shagaya</a> in 2019, uLesson came into the market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the pandemic hit last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young company, it has had to switch business models a couple of times to see what sticks in a very tough African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup first launched by </span>providing a product pack of SD cards and dongles with pre-recorded videos for K-12 students. They can either access lessons via streaming or use the SD cards to download and store the content.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But uLesson has introduced new features for an all-encompassing edtech play for this demographic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It added quizzes and a homework help feature to connect students with tutors from universities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup also launched a one-to-many live class feature with polls and leaderboards and a one-to-one live experience for DevKids, a coding class independent of the core uLesson platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevKids has since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been rolled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back, though. Shagaya said uLesson is making efforts to introduce the feature &#8212; which started as an experiment in teaching kids how to code and at some point made 30% of the company’s revenues  &#8212; into the uLesson platform by January next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we want </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is different strata of free users that can use the app and can pay for a premium experience to attend live classes or get the homework helper,” said the CEO, who also founded e-commerce platforms DealDey and Konga.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And because parents </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do want to invest in the best for their kids, one of the ways you can do that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is personalized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one-to-one instruction for their children, whether in coding through DevKids or math or science or English.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These features show that uLesson is now in the online home tutoring business; it is a market where most African edtech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made significant headway despite an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But uLesson is taking a distinct approach by building around that single proposition as a feature, while other platforms have instead sought to sell home tutoring services as a product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variety of uLesson’s services provides a stickiness (students spend an average of 57 minutes on the app) that has led to parents investing in smartphones for their kids’ schooling either</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">independently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or via uLesson’s “device+plan” bundle, which is only available in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents also allow their kids to learn on their phones (roughly 50% of uLesson’s learners do that). The p</span>rices on uLesson range from a monthly fee of ₦7500 (about $18) to a two-year “<span style="font-weight: 400;">device+plan” </span>of ₦137,000 ($334).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the uLesson app has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 million downloads, the company said. Over 12.3 million videos have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been watched,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 25.6 million questions answered on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, uLesson kept growing despite K-12 students going back to school. Contrary to public perception of the product as a second option for K-12 students, Shagaya said uLesson has become ingrained in everyday schooling activities for its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, uLesson adopts a diversified method of charging schools and their stakeholders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While some schools, especially high-end ones, take up the cost for their students to access uLesson, others pass on the cost to parents via tuition fees or recommend the product to parents, who proceed to pay for it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Schools have become a big channel for us, and half of our subscribers are using us in schools,” he said. “We see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all kinds of interesting applications for we build, and these are some of the leading schools in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we’re not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">supplemental from that point of view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our vision is to create these feedback loops between teacher and learner and parent and school that embraces virtuous cycles and feed themselves to the betterment of the educational system.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses 180 field sales agents to onboard schools and individual users across Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the countries receiving the most marketing attention from uLesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is available in other markets, such as South Africa, Sierra Leone, the UK, Liberia, Gambia and the US, but Shagaya said uLesson has spread in these countries via word of mouth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria remains uLesson’s largest market by far, said Shagaya. The country is responsible for 85% of uLesson’s paying users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding similar metrics, uLesson said its paying users grew 600% this past year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its monthly average users also increased 700%, while average daily users surged 430% within the same time frame</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said its live lesson demand grew by 222% since its introduction in September. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding learners’ performance, the Abuja-based startup claims that some learners have moved from the 50th percentile to the 90th percentile in their classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, uLesson introduced <a href="https://blog.ulesson.com/the-ulesson-learning-centre/">offline centers</a>. While these spaces were destinations for learning, going forward, they will be places to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> educate the public on uLesson’s importance and sign them up, said Shagaya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to be rolling out a lot of these things next year because we’ve seen that this is [how] people use them,” Shagaya remarked, adding that “2021 for us was a year of testing what works and we know what works now. So there’s a lot of experimentation in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And 2022, it will be executing on what works</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidafrankel1">David Frankel</a>, the managing partner at Founder Collective, compared what uLesson is doing with education in Africa to how Uber changed transportation and Coupang altered e-commerce in the U.S. and South Korea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that he is an “enthusiastic supporter of Shagaya and his vision for more accessible and affordable educational opportunities for millions of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early this year, uLesson brought on Owl Ventures as a strategic investor in its second round of funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has included another in the form of Chinese tech multinational Tencent in its third round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech giant and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owl Ventures back Byju, the world’s most valuable edtech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too early to say, but with both companies in each other’s radars (as a result of sharing similar investors) and given the Indian company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/daily-crunch-101/">acquisition spree</a> in the past three or more quarters, uLesson might likely become an acquisition target should the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-valued-at-18-billion-in-new-funding/">$18 billion behemoth</a> be interested in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shagaya offered no comment on that speculation. Instead, he’s particularly excited about getting Tencent onboard as the tech giant’s first edtech investment in Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent has made a couple of fintech investments in Africa, most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paystack, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently completed two new investments in South Africa: payment gateway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/south-african-payments-gateway-ozow-raises-48m-series-b-led-by-tencent/">Ozow</a> and challenger bank <a href="https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/banks/tymebank-international-arm-raises-over-r11bn-from-tencent-and-uk-financier-20211207">TymeBank</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tencent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prolific investor in edtech. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have a lot of learnings and that’s evident when you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">talk to them and the investments they’ve made not only in China but in India and across the world,” Shagaya commented.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In them, we saw the partner that was willing to kind of get in here, work with us, and then give us the fuel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double down on what works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will allow uLesson to continue to invest in product development, strengthen its core technology and add cohort-based learning features, said the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also wants to expand its science and mathematics content to include “social sciences and financial accounting to the secondary level content library and qualitative and quantitative reasoning to the primary level.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; where companies tap into APIs to integrate banking and other financial tools without having to build everything themselves from the ground up &#8212; has been one of the major trends in fintech in the last decade. Today, one of the biggest startups building those APIs and the backend technology behind them is announcing a major round of funding to double down on the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mambu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mambu</a>, which has built a set of APIs to power lending, deposit, and other banking products, along with a wide plethora of analytics and other tools to build financial services, has raised €235 million, a Series E that values the company at €4.9 billion (in today&#8217;s exchange rates that&#8217;s about $266 million at a $5.5 billion valuation).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by EQT Growth, the European private equity firm, and Amsterdam/London-based Mambu is not disclosing other investors. (Its last round, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised  $135 million in January</a>, was led by TCV, with participation from Tiger Global, Arena Holdings, Bessemer Venture Partners, Runa Capital and Acton Capital Partners. Its valuation has more than doubled since then.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245310" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company today has over 200 customers that collectively work with some 53 million users in some 65 countries. They include big neobanks like N26, but also incumbent banks like Raiffeisen Bank, BancoEstado and ABN Amro.</p>
<p>More widely, Mambu is also working with newer entrants to financial services like telcos and e-commerce companies that might not be equipped or interested in building financial services from scratch but can see an business or operational opportunity to provide their customers with some of these tools more directly, and to invest in building more tailored financial services tapping into building blocks provided by another company (that is, Mambu) &#8212; a model that opens the door to a much wider set of customers for Mambu down the line.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eugene Danilkis, Mambu&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, has big ambitions for where he believes Mambu can sit in the wider world of financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to create in financial services and banking what Salesforce did in CRM,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On that note, Salesforce&#8217;s own ambitions are pretty big, too. Still, these days, it is not a competitor but a strong partner, Danilkis said: part of Mambu&#8217;s power lies not just in the financial services APIs that it provides, but in the webbing it also has built so that those services &#8220;play nice&#8221; with all of the rest of the IT infrastructure and apps that a company might use. Alongside Salesforce, Mambu integrates with a number of other third-parties like AWS, Google, Marqeta, Comply Advantage, Deloitte and many others. The number of API calls that Mambu handles daily now number at about 130 million.</p>
<p>Mambu still had a lot of money in the bank prior to this raise, so the plan for this latest round will be to use the funds to double down on expanding its business to more markets and to start considering what other adjacent areas the company would like to tackle next. Areas like insurance, Danilkis said, are definitely on its radar, although he declined to say when it might launch services, and what those services might be. One logical area, for example, could be property insurance, since it already offers mortgage APIs and works with those already active in property finance.</p>
<p>More immediately, he sees a lot of opportunity still in the area of simply improving on the financial services and the building blocks for creating them that it already offers. He actually bristles a little when you mention &#8220;embedded finance.&#8221; The company&#8217;s preferred term for what it does is &#8220;SaaS banking platform,&#8221; which speaks, he says, to the more fundamental role that Mambu is playing in helping its customers build tailored financial services for themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we step back in industry what most banks and fintechs are focused on are high volume products that need to be very digital but still need to feel customized for the individual,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It goes beyond lending and deposits.&#8221; Longer term, he said, Mambu wants to help them build &#8220;more complex commercial products where you might have lower volumes but higher values, too.&#8221; He notes that there remain challenges also with integrations and middleware in financial services, which is another area Mambu will be providing better tech to the market. The focus, he said, is &#8220;how to integrate better in the ecosystem,&#8221; which will include creating more pre-built integrations for third-party solutions. &#8220;We&#8217;re investing in bringing a lot of that ecosystem together,&#8221; he added. (That&#8217;s the Salesforce ethos right there.)</p>
<p>There may also be acquisitions, something which Mambu has yet to do, having grown only organically up to now. The space it&#8217;s working in is ripe for consolidation, though. There are for starters a number of direct competitors to Mambu itself, such as Thought Machine, Rapyd, and Airwallex (among many others). All three of these are also very well capitalized, with the first <a href="https://thoughtmachine.net/newsroom/thought-machine-raises-200m-in-series-c-funding-to-bring-worlds-banks-to-the-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $200 million</a> just at the end of November; Rapyd now with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $800 million</a> raised to date; and Airwallex coming out of Asia now at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/airwallex-raises-200m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-double-down-on-business-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 billion valuation</a>. There are also a number of smaller regional players and many &#8220;point solutions&#8221; handling different aspects of financial services and financial infrastructure in the cloud.</p>
<p>EQT was actually talking to Mambu ahead of the previous round but is only just investing for the first time in this Series E.</p>
<p>“We have been following Mambu’s journey and stellar execution for several years now,&#8221; said Carolina Brochado, a partner within EQT Growth’s Advisory Team. &#8220;We feel a strong connection to the vision of Mambu as an organization, given the close alignment on values of responsibility and sustainability, and believe that Mambu’s solution is making the financial system more accessible and affordable for millions around the world. We are excited to partner with one of the leading fintech companies and management teams in Europe, which offers an industry-unique and leading modern cloud platform to address the massive €100 billion market serviced by traditional banking software vendors and in-house solutions.” She will be joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) offerings have existed for a long time, but increased in popularity as the pandemic made more people shop online and conserve cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though BNPL has taken off in most parts of the world, it’s yet to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pick up steam in Africa. But in countries such as South Africa and Egypt, there is a newfound surge in demand for such services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest development, <a href="https://sympl.ai/">Sympl</a>, an Egyptian fintech founded only five months ago, announced today that it has picked up $6 million in seed funding following a soft launch in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beco Capital led the five-month-old startup’s seed round, while A15 and Global Ventures participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-shabrawy-el-feky-4071739">Mohamed El-Feky</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/yasmine-mohamed-henna-9ab474113">Yasmine Henna</a>, and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/karim-tawfik-a8a3aa45">Karim Tawfik</a> started Sympl in August this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all joined forces to establish Sympl because we all share the vision that there is a huge opportunity for the buy now, pay later here in Egypt, given its very populous market,” founder and CEO El-Feky told TechCrunch on a call.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a consumer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven market where we have a lot of accessibility to consumer products and services, online or offline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a little twist to Sympl’s offerings which the founders made in a bid to localize its product for the Egyptian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the CEO’s words, Sympl operates a save your money, pay later model rather than the normal buy now, pay later model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl says it targets over 50 million debit and credit cardholders in the country. And like any BNPL service, the company wants to incentivize a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of this demographic at checkout, in-store or online.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no pre-registration required and payment plans approved at checkout, Sympl allows merchants to sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consumers on short-term, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interest-free (zero-interest) payment plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical BNPL model involves a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> split into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equal payments. The first payment, usually 25% of the total </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at checkout, while the rest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in three installments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl operates a different method the company says will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help its customers save better while making purchases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The platform is an evolution of customers’ checkout experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than promoting purchasing, it gives customers more choices at the checkout and promotes customer saving, flexible cash flow management, and a better matching of income and expenditure, without compromising their lifestyle,” the company said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When customers check out from one of Sympl’s merchants, the company acknowledges the funds in the customers’ bank accounts and charges them an upfront fixed fee of 100 Egyptian pounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fee covers the future collection of repayments and remains the same irrespective of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Sympl offers customers the option to use a zero-interest pay later plan. The rest of the payments can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between three to five installments. The company said that the plans</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cater to different segments of customers’ employment status &#8212; gig workers, freelancers, self-employed and regular employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the saving that we do to the customer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead of spending all your money right now on a single transaction, you can walk out of the store having the product and having your money in your pocket while paying it on three to five equal payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can be on a monthly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bi-weekly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or weekly basis,” said the CEO. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl’s launch in October was strategic. For a week, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnered with Tradeline, the largest reseller of the iPhone 13 in Egypt, so customers could only buy the phone online or offline via Sympl</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During our launch, we were lucky enough because Mohamed and I had a lot of partners who worked with us at valU (the consumer fintech where both worked before Sympl). And because of our success back then, they came to us as merchants and wanted to partner with us at Sympl,” said CCO Henna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They like the platform because they think it’s unique because, for the first time in Egypt, we’re offering debit or pay later options for the debit card population in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl has onboarded up to 240 merchants with products in electronics, fashion, appliances, furniture, travel, healthcare, jewellery and education, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It plans to reach 1,000 stores by mid next year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henna also mentioned that Sympl is growing 25% week-on-week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the number of transactions made on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sympl will use the investment to e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">xpand its merchant network, build technical upgrades and enhancements, hire more talent and expand its footprint across Egypt to cover all 27 governorates in the country (it’s currently in two)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Feky said when the company raises its next round of investment, expansion outside Egypt will be on the cards. The most likely destination? Saudi Arabia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is one of the most vibrant markets and populous markets and has similar demographics and consumer behaviour. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this would be our first regional step out of Egypt.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.collective.work">Collective</a>, a French startup that wants to redefine what it means to work as a freelancer in development, product design, digital marketing, data strategy and more. The company has built a platform so that multiple freelancers can team up and work together on the same project.</p>
<p>The trick is that those teams remain independent freelancers. They’re not working for the same company, they’re just working on the same project. Everyone then gets their cut of the invoice when the job is done.</p>
<p>Originally backed by startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>, Collective has raised an $8 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.blossomcap.com">Blossom Capital</a>. Many business angels are also investing in the startup. Some freelancers who use Collective for their freelancing jobs have also invested in Collective — they’re putting their money where their mouth is.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244249" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Platforms for freelancers aren’t new. Many developers based in France are probably already familiar with <a href="https://www.malt.fr">Malt</a> or <a href="https://www.comet.co">Comet</a>. But Collective doesn’t want to go head to head with these marketplaces. Instead, Collective only accepts teams of freelancers — it can be a squad, a studio, a flash team, a community…</p>
<p>“We are creating the first SaaS platform dedicated to independent collectives,” co-founder and CEO Jean de Rauglaudre told me. He listed the advantages of a collective versus a more traditional development agency company.</p>
<p>According to him, a team of freelancers is usually cheaper than an agency because there are some fixed costs with the agency. While this is true, freelancers still have to pay for health insurance, pension contributions, etc. Essentially, it’s a more individualistic way of thinking about a group of colleagues as collectives don’t share the same benefits.</p>
<p>But if you’re okay with that, there are some more obvious advantages with collectives. For instance, participating in a collective is a more flexible way of working as you can still work on your own projects on the side. You can also choose to participate in multiple collectives at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup offers you some much needed tools. For instance, if you choose to manage your collective on the platform, you can create a single invoice and send it to your customer. The customer only has to pay the invoice once. Collective takes care of splitting payments and topping up individual accounts.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Collective uses a special status called ‘portage administratif’. With this trick, Collective can legally issue invoices and represent teams. On the other side, freelancers can choose their own incorporation status.</p>
<p>In addition to administrative stuff, Collective also wants to provide some marketing tools. For instance, the company wants to develop a lightweight content platform so that each Collective can create their own branding, showcase their portfolio of work and more.</p>
<p>The startup takes a small cut on bills. If clients come from Collective directly, the company then asks for a bigger cut. And it seems to be working well as hundreds of companies have worked with a collective already.</p>
<p>Figuring out the governance system of those collectives is also going to be interesting. Unlike traditional private companies, nobody “owns” the collective, which means that everybody has a say when it comes to choosing the next job or the remuneration system.</p>
<p>Many DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) rely on tokens on a blockchain to make important decisions. With Collective, there’s no blockchain involved. And the startup proves that you don’t always need a blockchain to reach a consensus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Razorpay is making it more convenient for users to pay businesses with a faster checkout option as the leading Indian payments infrastructure giant pushes to win a bigger slice of the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new feature, called Magic Checkout, saves shopper’s information &#8212; password, card details, addresses &#8212; during their first purchase and prefills those when they transact with the same business or any other that also uses Razorpay to process its payments, the startup said.</p>
<p>Magic Checkout &#8212; which is similar to offerings provided by Bolt and Fast in the U.S. &#8212; is Razorpay’s attempt to help merchants ward off the 70% drop off they typically see during the last step of the transaction process, the startup said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The feature supports all payment methods including cash on delivery and requires minimal integration on the business’s end, the startup said. “With this unique checkout experience, shoppers can now checkout 50% faster while retailers can expect a 20% increase in conversions which means 20% more revenue for a business,” it said.</p>
<p>Magic Checkout is one of a series of announcements Razorpay, which counts Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator and Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/salesforce-backs-indian-payments-startup-razorpay/">among its backers</a>, made at its annual event called FTX on Thursday. The startup, founded nearly seven years ago by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar, said it has registered over 300% growth for the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>As of early December, the startup had processed over $60 billion in transactions for its customers, up from the $50 billion goal it had set out for itself last December, it said. The startup, which has amassed over 8 million clients, said it is now aiming to process $90 billion in transactions by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Razorpay has established itself as the dominant payments infrastructure firm in India, where it competes with PayU and Cashfree. Stripe, the global payments giant, has also been operational in India for several years, though it has yet to make inroads in the country. Two of its key executives, including the head of Stripe in India, left earlier this year to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/stripe-backs-india-cleartax-in-75-million-funding/">start their own cross-border payments startup</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Of the 42 Indian startups that have become unicorns this year, 33 of them use Razorpay,” said Mathur in an interview with TechCrunch. “We keep saying, our growth happens with the growth of the ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Razorpay additionally introduced a new feature called RazorpayX Tax Payment Suite for its neobanking customers today that will serve as a single portal for tax disbursements. The feature allows businesses to import all their filings from other sources to help them save time. “Tax and Compliance are two of the most feared words for any business in India,” said Kumar.</p>
<p>“It is a one-stop platform for all tax payments needs of small businesses, be it TDS, GST, TCS or Advance Tax. Further, the RazorpayX dashboard provides businesses a single, transparent view of all disbursals for seamless collaboration between finance teams, external accountants, and business owners,” he said.</p>
<p>And last, Razorpay said it is also giving back to the community. It’s launched RIZE, a launchpad for the first-time entrepreneurs to help them with scores of crucial early-stage startup problems such as incorporating the firm and filing the first payroll, and guidance on securing loan and equity investments, Kumar said.</p>
<p>Razorpay is not taking any equity or charging any fee for the incubation program, which is attempting to create a community to help early-stage founders connect and engage with late-stage founders and other mentors.</p>
<p>For Rize, the startup said it has partnered with over 50 product companies including AWS, Freshworks, WeWork, Zoho, Shiprocket, WebEngage and others to create the comprehensive toolkit, along with benefits worth $500,000 on Razorpay and its partner products at no charge.</p>
<p>“India is not like the U.S. You don’t get funding based on an idea. For funding, you need traction and that part is complicated. So we want to help startups solve that,” said Mathur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.klarna.com">Klarna</a> is launching a desktop browser extension that provides many of the features that you can find in the company’s mobile app — but on your computer. In addition to the ability to manage your Klarna payments, the extension automatically applies coupon codes when you’re on a checkout page.</p>
<p>Klarna has acquired <a href="https://www.joinpiggy.com">Piggy</a> for the automatic couponing feature. Piggy originally built a browser extension that surfaces coupons and cashback offers when you purchase something — FinanceFWD first <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/klarna-kauft-piggy/">reported</a> the acquisition and Klarna isn’t disclosing the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>This is an interesting move from Klarna as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">PayPal acquired Honey</a> for $4 billion. Honey has also built a browser extension that helps you apply coupon codes on the checkout page. In other words, PayPal and Klarna are competing to build the dominant shopping browser extension.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242351" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Existing Piggy users will migrate to the new Klarna extension. They can choose to migrate their existing Piggy data or start from scratch with a new Klarna account. Overall, 70 employees were working for Piggy and the startup had 1.2 million users before the acquisition. They are joining Klarna and are now working on integrating Piggy’s couponing features with the rest of Klarna’s product offering.</p>
<p>In addition to the coupon aggregation feature, users can also accumulate cashback or gift cards depending on the country. Users in the U.S. and Germany will be able to get rewards in the form of cashback while users in the U.K. and France will receive gift cards.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242368" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242368" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2242368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg 2055w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Klarna-Web-Browser-Extension-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klarna</p>
<p>But Klarna’s new extension isn’t just a Honey-like extension. It’s also a way to buy now and pay later (BNPL) with Klarna — the startup is better known for its installment payment product after all. Right now, there are different ways to take advantage of Klarna’s ability to spread the cost of an expensive purchase.</p>
<p>If you’re on an online store with a Klarna button on the checkout page, you can log in with your Klarna account and choose to pay later — users can also use their Klarna account to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">pay now</a>.</p>
<p>Klarna also offers BNPL options for in-store purchases. In some markets, Klarna also offers a card that lets you pay up to 30 days later. It works both online and in-store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But what if you want to buy now and pay later on an online store that doesn’t natively support Klarna? You can open Klarna’s mobile app and generate a one-time card on the checkout page. It works like a regular Visa card, but it’ll charge your card over multiple installments.</p>
<p>Klarna’s new extension lets you generate one-time cards from your desktop browser. You can then copy and paste the card details in the payment field when you’re ready to pay.</p>
<p>The mobile app and browser extension should remain in sync. For instance, you can save an item from your computer and track it from the Klarna mobile app. Right now, the extension works in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch an extension for Firefox and Safari as well. Users in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and France can download the extension. It’ll be rolled out in more countries later.</p>
<p>With this new product, Klarna shows once again that it wants to build a consumer product and not just a B2B payment business. PayPal has been the clear leader in the digital wallet space. So it’s going to be interesting to see whether Klarna can challenge PayPal and become a habit for consumers when they’re paying online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Danish startup <a href="https://www.pleo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo</a>, a developer of expense management tools aimed at SMBs to let them issue company cards and better manage how employees spend money, has picked up a large tranche of funding to help it double down on its business at a time of strong growth.</p>
<p>The company has raised $200 million, money that Jeppe Rindom, Pleo&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said it will be using in areas like M&amp;A, picking up the pace on expanding to new countries, bringing more functionality into its core product, and generally expanding its presence as a key enabler of &#8220;the future of work&#8221; &#8212; a massive theme at the moment in the world of business, given the changes so many were compelled to make in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>(The news, in fact, is coinciding with Pleo holding &#8220;Forward,&#8221; a virtual conference on that very topic.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245181" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, while some areas of company spend like business travel and entertainment (eg, business lunches) have all but stopped for many, the actual need for companies to better manage how and where money is spent by employees is in reality greater than ever before, given the distributed way that many of us are working today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The relevance of tooling to allow workforces to work in smooth ways while being distributed is very high right now,&#8221; Rindom said in an interview. &#8220;You may not be going out as much, but distributed workers need access to funds for a piece of software, or a subscription, or something else. Previously it’s been easy to, say, borrow a card from manager or the finance team to handle this. But you can’t do that anymore. Our product has become increasingly relevant for that reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>New investor Coatue Management is leading this funding, with strong participation from Alkeon Capital. Previous backers Bain Capital Ventures, Thrive Capital, Creandum, Kinnevik, Founders, Stripes and Seedcamp also participated.</p>
<p>Notably, the cash injection is coming just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pleo raised $150 million</a>.  At the time, that round in July was the largest-ever Series C for a Danish startup. This latest funding is actually an extension of that round, bringing the total for the Series C to $350 million. The valuation in the mean time has also shot up: six months ago, Pleo was valued at $1.7 billion; now it is $4.7 billion, making it one of the more valuable fintech startups in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason for the fast funding &#8212; which started as an unsolicited offer, Rindom said &#8212; is due to a few different reasons.</p>
<p>First, there is Pleo&#8217;s growth. The company now has over 20,000 customers &#8212; up by more than 3,000 in the last six months, and currently averaging 1,000 new customers per month &#8212; in the six countries where it is now live: Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Spain, Ireland and the UK. The plan is next to open up for business in 14 more countries, starting with Austria, and followed by Finland, the Netherlands, France and Portugal up next; and to ramp up hiring beyond the 400 that currently work for Pleo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already had very ambitious plans, to bring Pleo to all of Europe in the next one and a half years,&#8221; Rindom said. The company aims to have 1 million users by 2025.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The second reason is the company&#8217;s relevance to how people are working today, and the fact that the businesses that Pleo is targeting &#8212; as small as just a few employees, and most recently up to about 5,000, still &#8220;medium&#8221; in the world of enterprise &#8212; have never really had great products to address expenses needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Indeed many companies building products like these have mainly focused on large enterprises as customers. (That is changing fast, though: another big player in the same space as Pleo, Soldo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $180 million</a> this year, too.) Pleo&#8217;s tools today include card issuing, invoice payments, and out of pocket expenses, integrating all of this with existing accounting packages to help money management run more smoothly. <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pricing</a> starts at a free and limited tier for the smallest customers up to five users, working up to £10 per person per month for bigger customers, as well packages designed for the largest users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The third reason for Pleo&#8217;s raise right now is one of venture money at the moment. VCs, working hard to deploy massive funds, are continuing to hunt very aggressively for the best opportunities in the market. Their focus is not just to fund companies just as activity is picking up, but to back those that have demonstrated good growth during even the leaner periods. </span></p>
<p>“We were impressed by how Pleo has already redefined the way that over 20,000 companies think about managing their expenses, saving them time and lowering costs while increasing transparency,&#8221; said Michael B. Gilroy, general partner of Coatue Management, in a statement. &#8220;We are proud to partner closely with Jeppe and the rest of the team to help drive their next phase of growth – as they continue to extend across Europe and work to transform how spend management works within businesses.”</p>
<p>“Europe is emerging as an important technology hub in both the public and private markets, as evidenced by the increase in venture capital activity across the continent,&#8221; added Deepak Ravichandran, general partner of Alkeon Capital. &#8220;Pleo is building the leading B2B spend management platform in Europe, driven by a best-in-class user experience and rapid product innovation. We look forward to working with Jeppe and the team as the business continues to accelerate and grow.”</p>
<p>&#8220;In July, we recognized that the future of work must empower employees with the tools they need to be effective, productive, and successful. Pleo understands this critical shift for modern companies toward employee centricity—providing workers with a fun-to-use spend management app that automatically tracks their corporate spending and generates expense reports, paired with the powerful tools businesses need to create full visibility and management of every penny spent,&#8221; added Bain partner Keri Gohman.&#8221;With this extension to the Series C, Pleo is in an even stronger position &#8211; they’re undeniably the dominant player in small business spend management, an $80B+ opportunity in Europe alone, and will only grow more essential to businesses as the company expands into bill payments in the near future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Robotic Research, a self-driving technology company that has spent the last two decades developing on and off-road autonomous vehicles for the Department of Defense, raised a $228 million Series A round. The company will use the investment, which was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Enlightenment Capital, to build out the commercial side of its  business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crescent Cove Advisors, Henry Crown and Company and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/luminar-volvo-subsidiary-partner-to-sell-automated-driving-systems-to-automakers/">Luminar</a>, a lidar company, also participated in the investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RR.AI, as the company has branded its commercial arm, currently has its vehicle-agnostic autonomy kits, called AutoDrive, in about 150 heavy-duty transit buses, Class 8 trucks and yard trucks operating on roads across the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and Saudi Arabia, according to Alberto Lacaze, CEO of Robotic Research. Now, it&#8217;s just a matter of scaling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Robotic Research has historically automated trucks for the U.S. army and navy, operating in areas that aren&#8217;t mapped and don&#8217;t have GPS, good communications or lined roads. The company&#8217;s autonomy stack also adds on sensors that commercial autonomous vehicles usually don&#8217;t use, such as stereo and structure for motion, a range imaging technique for estimating 3D structures from 2D image sequences, says Lacaze. As a result, RR thinks it has a leg up on competition that&#8217;s still afraid to operate self-driving trucks on roads with inclement weather.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Most people think robotics is some magic piece of software,&#8221; Lacaze told TechCrunch. &#8220;The reality is that robotics is more like a stamp collection. You have to collect all these different edge cases where you need to be able to run on slippery roads and with dust and without being able to see the lines and so forth. We have collected lots and lots of stamps. To a certain degree, a common day for a military application is the edge case for a commercial application.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">RR.AI has already deployed its technology broadly, so this funding is specifically geared towards expanding and industrializing commercial applications, says Lacaze.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.roboticresearch.com/rr-to-make-transportation-history-ctfastrak/">Robotic Research won a contract with the Connecticut Department of Transportation</a> that would see three 40-foot electric buses automated and running on the CTfastrak corridor. The plan would be to scale that to an automated bus rapid transit line, bus platooning and precision docking. The buses operate at Level 4 capabilities, says Lacaze, but they will have human operators on board for safety. (<a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles">SAE</a> defines Level 4 autonomy as a system that does not require a human to intervene but can only operate under specific conditions.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">On the trucking side, RR.AI is working with sawmills in Canada to move logs, and says it will have a big U.S.-related announcement coming soon. The company will also be announcing an agriculture partnership in the coming months.</p>
<p>RR.AI&#8217;s go-to-market strategy is to focus on the &#8220;low hanging fruits,&#8221; says Lacaze, or the areas where there are few regulations or easy regulations to work around.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very interested in working in areas where we can produce with the sensors at the cost they are now, and where we can generate profit,&#8221; said Lacaze, noting that sensors needed for self-driving operations like cameras, lidar and radar are still very expensive, so it makes sense to put them on larger, heavy-duty, longer-lasting vehicles so the cost of the sensors can amortize over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are probably the only company in autonomy that has been profitable since inception. And the reason we were able to do that is we have concentrated on smaller markets but in the meantime, they have provided revenue right now. We don&#8217;t have to wait until 2025 to deploy trucks, and that allows us to grow faster and collect miles faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Operating in robotaxis in the future is not out of the question for RR.AI, says Lacaze. The company&#8217;s strategy is to wait for the regulatory environment to improve and the cost of sensors to decrease before pivoting into new verticals. But as RR.AI attempts to scale in its comfort industries, it might find that there simply aren&#8217;t enough vehicles on the market to work with.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are kind of dependent on the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s to produce since we don&#8217;t produce our own vehicles,&#8221; said Lacaze. &#8220;We are very carefully turning every stone over to find vehicles that are available in areas where it makes sense from a regulatory standpoint to deploy right now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Andrew Chen has long been a student, and teacher, of how startups engage their users while managing to amass a slew of new ones.</p>
<p>Today, he espouses his learnings &#8212; as a founder and a former Uber exec who led the company&#8217;s &#8220;rider growth&#8221; product teams for several years &#8212; to his portfolio companies as a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Among these is All Day Kitchens, Clubhouse, Substack and Snackpass.</p>
<p>But to share those lessons more broadly, Chen, who has always been a <a href="https://andrewchen.com/">prolific</a> writer, has also published a brand-new book by HarperCollins titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen/dp/0062969749#customerReviews"><em>The Cold Start: How to Start and Scale Network Effects</em></a>, in which he walks readers through interviews with 30 world-class teams and founders, including from Twitch, Airbnb, and Slack, to paint a picture of what it takes to turn a startup into a massive brand &#8212; then keep people coming back for more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We talked with Chen earlier today about the book, including how web3 projects fit, or don&#8217;t, into the mold of earlier startups. Excerpts from our chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><strong>You surface a lot of anecdotes about overcoming so-called cold starts, including during the earliest days of Tinder. I wasn&#8217;t aware of that story beforehand. Can you walk us through what happened?</strong></p>
<p>The [first version] of the app was very good. It had swiping, it had profile photos, it had all the features that you&#8217;d want. But [after] [Tinder&#8217;s founders] invited a bunch of their friends just manually, these friends were just not sticking. There just weren&#8217;t enough profiles. So how do you get hundreds of people that are all desirable to want to use the app at the same time?</p>
<p>The way they did it was they went to the USC campus, which was nearby, they decided that they were going to sponsor a birthday party for one of the folks in the sorority system there. [The idea was to] throw this big party, invite hundreds of people. And they had bouncers in front of the party, so that you had to download Tinder in order to [gain entry]. And people went and it was a cool party, and the next day, they opened up the app, and they were like, &#8216;Wow, these are all these people that I did not get a chance to talk to.&#8217;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sean [Rad] really attributes those 500 people with helping him take over the USC campus [a formula that Tinder then used to make inroads at other schools].</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">You talk in the book about the importance of these &#8216;atomic networks.&#8217; In the case of Tinder, it sounds like it was 500 people. How does a founder figure out what size this needs to be? Is there a formula?</strong></p>
<p>I think one part of [the answer] is just reasoning conceptually and thinking about: is this a 2-person thing, a 10-person thing or a 100-plus-person thing that you need to build? You tend to be able to do this a lot more easily once you have a lot of data. When you read about these threshold points, like Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;7 friends in 10 days&#8221; or the idea that Airbnb thought they needed 300 listings of which 100 were reviewed, what [both were] really doing is picking that point on the curve where there&#8217;s a little kink that tells you that &#8216;Okay, at this point, this is when the product is starting to get really valuable.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>Are there best practices for building that core audience?</strong></p>
<p>The thing we&#8217;re seeing across every single new category of products s that you need to be creative and inventive and not just replicate what&#8217;s already been done in the past. Otherwise, it gets it gets old. The first click-through rates on banner ads were actually over 70%, and these days, they&#8217;re well under 1%.</p>
<p>You also need to do something that matches with the value proposition and the type of product you&#8217;re building. If you are building something for social networks, then colleges and high schools are a great place to go. If you&#8217;re building something for workplace collaboration, you probably go to startups and small teams instead of larger companies. If you&#8217;re building something in web3, you have to go to the Discord servers and subreddits and talk to the the Twitter influencers who are at the heart of web3 in order to get it off the ground.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/embed/#?secret=fY8yMxlEZA" data-secret="fY8yMxlEZA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Clubhouse specifically, it did not depend in any way on college students discovering the platform to thrive, at least initially. Is that correct?</strong></p>
<p>I think I was user 104, and when we led the Series A investment and I joined the board, the company actually only had 500 daily active users, so it was very small. The early atomic network of Clubhouse was really [founder] Paul [Davison] and Paul&#8217;s friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we started to see amazing retention. The amount of time that [these individuals] spent listening in the app was over an hour-and-a-half per session, which is just incredible.</p>
<p>In some of the later rounds, where we actually doubled down and tripled down on the company, some of the analyses [tied to] [Clubhouse-provided] data, not just for the U.S. but data specifically for Sweden and specifically for Nigeria and some other smaller countries. What we were looking for is the networks built in some of these other countries and whether the retention rates and engagement were as good as in some of the more mature markets. What we saw was that the data was fantastic. It showed that you could take the Clubhouse network, decompose it into a network of smaller networks, and these looked like multiple atomic networks. That helped us really build the conviction to continue to support the company and continue to invest more.</p>
<p><strong>How do you advise founders when it comes to adding features that keep people coming back and could you speak specifically to Clubhouse&#8217;s plans?</strong></p>
<p>Going back to the college audience, I remember when Facebook first came out, and everyone was like, Why do I need a Facebook account? Or people think, Why do I need a Twitter account? It&#8217;s only when the network around someone &#8212; their friends, their family, the content creators they&#8217;re interested in &#8212; actually arrives that platforms become really sticky. And I think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to see with products like Clubhouse and like Substack.</p>
<p>Right now, if you&#8217;re in the media industry, if you&#8217;re in politics, if you&#8217;re in tech, you&#8217;re very excited about what Substack does, but if you&#8217;re outside those interest areas, you don&#8217;t get it yet. But they&#8217;re doing so much around chefs and cooking. They&#8217;re doing a ton around comics right now and graphic novels. And they&#8217;re going to light up, vertical by vertical, all these different categories. And it&#8217;s going to become way more interesting as you go. Clubhouse is doing very much the same thing. I think they&#8217;re very interested in sports right now. They&#8217;re very interested in, and always have been, news and politics. As each of these verticals are built out, [both platforms] will become more powerful and more compelling to a wider number of people.</p>
<p><strong>What impact do you think web3 will have on building networks?</strong></p>
<p>Web3 has network effects built into its core, so I think it&#8217;s going to educate a whole new generation of founders about what it takes to start a network effect. What do I mean by that? Bitcoin is valuable because other folks think that Bitcoin is valuable. And even if you were to fork the source code and you were to fork the blockchain and you were to run your own version of a Bitcoin, it just wouldn&#8217;t have the same dynamics or value. You need more people to believe in it. The same is true of Bored Ape and CryptoPunks; they&#8217;re valuable because other people think they&#8217;re valuable.</p>
<p>Because there are network effects built at the core [of web3], it also means you also have a cold start problem, because if you create a whole new drop of 10,000 NFTs, you need to figure out: are you going to go to the right Discord servers and getting the right community excited about these? If you don&#8217;t, you can push the NFTs out there and no one&#8217;s going to buy them. So there is a cold start problem at the heart of many of the web3 ideas out there, and I certainly look forward to the update that&#8217;ll have to write in five years that replaces all the case studies like Tinder and Dropbox and Slack with all their web3 versions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Kenyan fintech <a href="https://kwara.com/products">Kwara</a> was launched in 2019 to help credit unions (savings and credit cooperatives societies, SACCOs) in the East African country shift to digital platforms by providing them with its proprietary Back-end-as-a-service (BaaS) software.</p>
<p>The startup’s trajectory has been steep, as its clientele shot up from two to 50 in just over two years. This is as it became clearer to the country’s cooperative credit-unions that they needed more technology to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Kwara is now moving a step further to build the next-generation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/neobank-hatch-series-b/">neobank</a> that will give credit-union members access to instant loans and third-party services such as insurance, as the start-up moves to offer end-to-end solutions to its clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has raised $4 million in a seed round to build a neobank app that will enable individuals to sign-up with their preferred credit unions to access various financial services.</p>
<p>“We want to make credit unions as efficient as they can be by giving their members the kind of neobank experiences they wish to have,” Kwara co-founder and CEO, Cynthia Wandia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This is expected to open up new borderless avenues for the lending institutions to sign up new members and help credit-unions shift away from tedious paper-based systems and the need for elaborate brick-and-mortar branches. Members using the app, which is set for launch mid next year, will be able to track their personal financial flows from the app too.</p>
<p>The beta version of the app has been tested for feasibility, with an uptake of between 60% and 90%, Kwara co-founder and COO, David Hwan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The app gives power to the members, who have the ability to view and download their financial statements, apply for loans and make repayments. By giving power to the members, we are extending the freedom that credit unions need to focus on their core business or more value-added tasks,” said Hwan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245287" style="width: 1743px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245287" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245287 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png" alt="" width="1733" height="976" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png 1733w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kwara-Neobank.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1733px) 100vw, 1733px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245287" class="wp-caption-text">Kwara is building a neobank for credit unions.</p></div></p>
<p>Kwara said that its existing clients have experienced a membership growth of over 19% year on year, three times the global average, as the loan base of credit unions using its technologies went up 46%, about five times the national average. On its platform, Kwara supported $40 million in transactions between credit unions and their members.</p>
<p>Credit unions leveraging technology also boast member confidence and trust, which, in turn, yield new sign-ups. Wandia said that Kwara is helping them to run a modern banking business since with the right support they are banks waiting to happen.</p>
<p>“Right from the start, we decided to give our clients something that they could use to become a bank.”</p>
<p>“I think that&#8217;s made a big difference in a short amount of time in terms of building up the credibility on the product side because we were able to come to the table with a product that just out of the gate could run a bank, which is unusual, because normally that type of stuff is completely out of their price range,” she said.</p>
<p>Kwara has over the last year entered South Africa and Philippines, as the demand for its services grew beyond Kenya. It hopes to triple the number of credit unions using its software to 150 by the end of 2022. The startup currently serves 60,000 Sacco members but is also looking to cross the 100,000 mark by the end of next year. The startup’s goal is to serve 1 billion people by 2030.</p>
<p>Wandia said that from the onset, it was clear that Kwara would expand beyond Kenya as they quickly discovered that most credit unions, especially those in emerging markets, had not caught the wave of technology.</p>
<p>Kwara has also started forging alliances with companies, to offer third party services on its app. The startup recently partnered with Lami Technologies, a Kenyan-based digital insurance company, to make accessible a wide range of insurance products including health, property, business and life covers on the app. This is as the startup continues to perfect its app in readiness for a full launch next year.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Breega VC firm, with participation of SoftBank Vision Fund Emerge, Finca Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest and Do Good Invest. Other investors include Rabacap, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity and fintech angels.</p>
<p>“Over the years, we’ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking. Kwara’s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions,” said Breega’s founding partner, Ben Marrel.</p>
<p>Credit unions are usually formed by people with a common interest or members of an industry, like farmers or teachers, who buy shares in the institution, save money and take loans. They are popular in Kenya owing to their low-interest rate loans and ease in accessing credit when compared to conventional banks. About 175 credit unions are licensed in Kenya to serve nearly 4.1 million members countrywide &#8212; a vast majority remain unlicensed.</p>
<p>According to Kenya’s monetary authority, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), the total assets of licensed credit unions grew 13.5% last year to reach $5.6 billion. Member deposits and the appetite for loans also continued to grow but they also became vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their weak technology. The regulator recommended that they shift to better technologies to protect member deposits, solutions that Kwara is now providing.</p>
<p>“We are building the infrastructure and rails for the credit unions and their members to connect to everything that&#8217;s already out there,” Hwan said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/upmesh-wants-to-build-a-community-driven-discovery-app-for-southeast-asian-live-commerce/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">seed round</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announcement, Singapore-based startup <a href="https://upmesh.io/sg">Upmesh</a> has raised a $7.5 million pre-Series A round led by Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures. The new funding brings its total raised so far to $10.5 million.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh will use the pre-Series A funding to expand its regional presence in Southeast Asia and launch its first Instagram live selling app and backend automation features like logistics automation. It also plans to double down on its live commerce products. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since its seed round, Upmesh has nearly doubled its online merchants in less than three months with a growing merchant base by 30% month on month. In October, Upmesh was used by almost 300 live commerce merchants in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, with an annualized gross merchandise value of $40 million.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh’s tool helps merchants grow sales through analytics to identify their best-selling product items and patterns in buying behaviors. Its tool also provides e-commerce functions that automatically capture orders made in livestream comments and send a checkout link to buyers. At the same time, sellers go live on social media platforms like Facebook Live and Instagram Live.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh competes with e-Commerce platforms like Shopee and Lazada and SaaS tools, including Shopline, but the company offers live commerce on social media that attract more buyers and audience and provide automation to help customers grow their business, said Wong Zi Yang, CEO and co-founder of Upmesh.</span></p>

<p>Upmesh also tailors its order capturing tools to meet the expectations of sellers and buyers in different Southeast Asia countries unlike other companies that provide order-capturing tools for live commerce like CommentSold and Dibsly, Wong said in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh users range from mom-and-pop street shops selling on live streams to supplement foot traffic to specialized live commerce sellers moving thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Live commerce is transforming eCommerce and shaping the buying behavior of the digital consumer in Southeast Asia. While Upmesh provides a full technology and service stack to enable live commerce, it is even more critical to enabling small and medium sellers at scale. Small and medium sellers from the fastest-growing segment in eCommerce and their needs are largely unmet. Upmesh is focused on meeting their needs,” said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner of Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are glad to join forces with Monk’s Hill Ventures in our mission to transform eCommerce. We are united in our shared belief that community is the next frontier for eCommerce, and live commerce is the ideal medium for bringing community and commerce together,” said Wong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian ride-hailing giant Ola has raised $139 million at a valuation of about $7.3 billion, it said in a filing, ahead of its plans to file for an initial public offering early next year.</p>
<p>Mumbai-headquartered financial giant Edelweiss led the new investment tranche. IIFL, Siddhant Partners, Tejal Merchantile, Hero Enterprise also poured money, Bangalore-headquartered Ola said in the filing, which was <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/12/ola-valuation-crosses-7-3-bn-completes-geospoc-acquisition-for-3-5-mn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> by Indian news outlet Entrackr.</p>
<p>The new investment comes five months after SoftBank-backed Ola <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/">raised $500 million in a round</a>, one of the largest in the internet consumer segment in India, led by Temasek and Warburg Pincus. Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal had also invested in that round, the firm said at the time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ola &#8212; which operates in India as well as Australia, the U.K. and New Zealand and has over a million drivers on its platform &#8212; said at the time that its ride-hailing business had rebounded after New Delhi eased restrictions in the country.</p>
<p>Separately, Ola Electric has raised $52.7 million in a round led by Temasek, the firm said in a filing. This investment comes two months after Ola Electric, which spun out of Ola in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised $200 million at a $3 billion valuation</a> in a round led by Alpha Wave Global (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/">formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital</a>). Aggarwal also spearheads Ola Electric.</p>
<p>The firm, which unveiled its electric scooters in August, has delayed the delivery of the vehicle several times citing chip shortage. Furthermore, Bangalore-headquartered mobility startup Bounce this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">launched its own electric scooter</a> that is more affordable than Ola Electric’s offerings.</p>
<p>But the issues don’t stop there. Both Ola and Ola Electric have seen several key executive departures in recent months as a result of what Indian outlet Morning Context reported as <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic work culture and distrustful chief executive</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
