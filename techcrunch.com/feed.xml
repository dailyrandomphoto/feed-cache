										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austinites, watch out; another tech company is headed into town.</p>
<p>Just days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed during an interview that he has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-to-discuss-teslas-banner-year-despite-pandemic-silicon-valleys-future-11607449988">moved to Texas</a>, and less than two weeks after HP Enterprise, a spin-out of the iconic Silicon Valley company Hewlett-Packard, announced that it is separately <a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-california-greg-abbott-texas-1ce5ef41c6e20e84b5954de11fa3c8a7">moving to Texas</a>, yet another of the Bay Area&#8217;s best-known brands &#8212; Oracle &#8212;  is pulling up stakes and headed east to Texas, too.</p>
<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/oracle-moves-headquarters-to-texas-joins-exodus-from-california?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Bloomberg</a>. Oracle confirmed the move in a statement sent to TechCrunch, saying that along with a &#8220;more flexible employee work location policy,&#8221; the company has changed its corporate headquarters from Redwood Shores, California, to Austin. &#8220;We believe these moves best position <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oracle">Oracle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for growth and provide our personnel with more flexibility about where and how they work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokeswoman declined to answer more questions related to the move, but Oracle says that &#8220;many&#8221; of its employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home part time or full time.</p>
<p>HPE and Oracle aren&#8217;t the first major tech companies to plot such moves in recent times. Late last year, the brokerage giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/charles-schwab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="charles-schwab">Charles Schwab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it was <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2019/11/30/schwab-is-the-latest-company-leaving-california-for-texas-and-it-wont-be-the-last-expert-says/">leaving the Bay Area for Texas </a>as it was announcing its $26 billion merger with TD Ameritrade, though it chose Dallas, about 200 miles away from Austin.</p>

<p>Tech giants <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Google have also been expanding their presence in the state. Apple announced in 2018 that it was building a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/business/apple-austin-campus.html">$1 billion campus</a> in Austin. Meanwhile, Google, which opened its first Austin office 13 years ago, said last year that it was beginning to lease <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20190614/google-says-it-plans-significant-expansion-in-austin">far more space</a> in the city.</p>
<p>Taxes, a more affordable cost of living for employees, a lower cost of doing business and less competition for talent are among the top drivers for the companies&#8217; moves, though there is also a growing sense that culture is a factor, as well.</p>
<p>While California is led by Democrats, Texas is led by Republicans, and as the divide between the two parties grows, so does the divide between their respective supporters, with even self-described centrists saying they feel alienated.</p>
<p>Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison has notably been one of few top tech execs to openly support President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of the venture firm 8VC and Palantir Technologies (which itself recently headed to Denver from Palo Alto), recently explained his own move this year to Texas from California <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-love-it-and-leave-it-11605472619">in the WSJ</a>, writing: &#8220;Politics in the state is in many ways closed off to different ideas. We grew weary of California’s intolerant far left, which would rather demonize opponents than discuss honest differences of opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fall, in conversation with reporter Kara Swisher, Musk suggested he was also outside of Democratic circles, describing his political views as &#8220;socially very liberal and then economically right of center, maybe, or center? I don&#8217;t know. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-elon-musk.html">Obviously I&#8217;m not a communist.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>While Austin is becoming a go-to spot for many of California&#8217;s wealthiest contrarians, others are headed to Florida. Coincidentally or not, Florida is another Republican-controlled state that, like Texas, does not collect state tax.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/keith-rabois" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="keith-rabois">Keith Rabois, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Founders Fund investor who recently left the Bay Area for Miami, contributed to the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/contrib_all.php?cmte=C00610907&amp;type=A&amp;cycle=2016">NeverTrump PAC</a> in 2016 and said his first choice for U.S. president this year was Democratic contender Pete Buttigieg. But he has also worried openly about democratic socialism, of which the GOP has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/25/905895428/republicans-blast-democrats-as-socialists-heres-what-socialism-is">long accused</a> Democrats of promoting.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/david-blumberg" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="david-blumberg">David Blumberg, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Trump supporter, is also headed to Miami, he announced recently. Blumberg said he had it with &#8220;poor governance at the local level in San Francisco and statewide in California.&#8221; Yet he seemed to have grown frustrated with the Bay Area some time ago.</p>
<p>As Blumberg <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/17/20869679/donald-trump-silicon-valley-fundraiser-2020">told Vox last year, </a>he believes that tech platforms are biased against conservatives. He also told the outlet that the Valley was home to many more Trump supporters than might be imagined, and that &#8220;we generally keep our heads down” because “people who go out publicly for Republicans and for Trump can get business banned or get blackballed.”</p>
<p>Impetus notwithstanding, a longer-term question is whether these moves &#8212; particular for those individuals and smaller outfits that are relocating &#8212; will prove permanent.</p>
<p>At least one tech exec, Twitter and Medium co-founder Ev Williams, has returned to the Bay Area after moving away &#8212; in his case, to New York. Williams, who was largely &#8220;looking for a change,&#8221; made the move with his family late last year after spending 20 years in the Bay Area, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/talking-techs-exodus-twitters-new-labels-and-mediums-future-with-founder-ev-williams/">recently told</a> TechCrunch. Then COVID struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never lived in New York and thought, ‘Why not go? Now seems like a good time.’ Turns out I was wrong. [Laughs.] It was a very bad time to move to New York.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You don&#8217;t have to buy into 5G conspiracy theories to think that you could do with a little less radiation in your life. One way of blocking radiation is a Faraday cage, but this is usually a metal mesh of some kind, making everyday use difficult. Researchers at Drexel University have managed to create a Faraday fabric by infusing ordinary cotton with a compound called MXene — meaning your tinfoil hat is about to get a lot comfier.</p>
<p>Faraday cages work because radiation in radio frequencies is blocked by certain metals, but because of its wavelength, the metal doesn&#8217;t even have to be solid — it can be a solid cage or flexible mesh. Many facilities are lined with materials like this to prevent outside radiation from interfering with sensitive measurements, but recently companies like <a href="https://silent-pocket.com/">Silent Pocket</a> have integrated meshes into bags and cases that totally isolate devices from incoming signals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be frank here and say that this is definitely paranoia-adjacent. RF radiation is not harmful in the doses and frequencies we get it, and the FCC makes sure no device exceeds certain thresholds. But there&#8217;s also the possibility that your phone or laptop is naively connecting to public Wi-Fi, getting its MAC number skimmed by other devices, and otherwise interacting with the environment in a way you might not like. And honestly&#8230; with the amount of devices emitting radiation right now, who wouldn&#8217;t mind lowering their dose a little, just to be extra sure?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That may be much easier to do in the near future, as Yury Gogotsi and his team at the Drexel Nanomaterials Institute, of which he is director, have come up with a way to coat ordinary textile fibers in a metallic compound that makes them effective Faraday cages — but also flexible, durable and washable.</p>
<p>The material, which they call MXene and is more of a category than a single compound, is useful in lots of ways, and <a href="https://nano.materials.drexel.edu/publications/">the subject of dozens of papers by the team</a> — this is just the most recent application.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have known for some time that MXene has the ability to block electromagnetic interference better than other materials, but this discovery shows that it can effectively adhere to fabrics and maintain its unique shielding capabilities,&#8221; <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/du-ff121120.php">said Gogotsi in a news release</a>. You can <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/251432.php">see the fabric in action on video here</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086223" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg 2438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=1536,994 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=2048,1326 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mxene-2.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Drexel University</p></div></p>
<p>MXenes are conductive metal-carbon compounds that can be fabricated into all sorts of forms: solid, liquid, even sprays. In this case it&#8217;s a liquid — a solution of tiny MXene flakes that adhere to the fabric quite easily and produce a Faraday effect, blocking 99.9% of RF radiation in tests. After sitting around for a couple years (perhaps forgotten in a lab cupboard) it kept 90% of their effectiveness, and the treated fabric can also be washed and worn safely.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t necessarily want to wear a whole suit of the stuff, but this would make it easier for clothing to include an RF-blocking pocket in a jacket, jeans or laptop bag that doesn&#8217;t feel out of place with the other materials. A hat (or underwear) with a layer of this fabric would be a popular item among conspiracy theorists, of course.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a ways from showing up on the rack, but Gogotsi was optimistic about its prospects for commercialization, noting that Drexel has multiple patents on the material and its uses. Other ways of infusing fabric with MXenes could lead to clothes that generate and store energy as well.</p>
<p>You can read more about this particular application of MXenes <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0008622320311982?via%3Dihub#!">in the journal Carbon</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are definitely people who are working at companies that we start engaging before they even have an idea. So it's never too early]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/general-catalyst-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="general-catalyst-partners">General Catalyst <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has made early bets on some of the biggest companies in tech today, including Airbnb, Lemonade and Warby Parker.</p>
<p>We sat down with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/katherine-boyle" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="katherine-boyle">Katherine Boyle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Peter Boyce, who co-lead the firm&#8217;s seed-stage investments, to discuss what they look for in founders, which sectors they&#8217;re most excited about and how business has changed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>This conversation is part of our broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/">Extra Crunch Live series</a>, where we sit down with VCs and founders to discuss startup core competencies and get advice. We&#8217;ve spoken to folks like Aileen Lee, Mark Cuban, Roelof Botha, Charles Hudson and many, others. You can browse the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">full library of episodes here</a>.</p>
<p>Check out our full conversation with Boyce and Boyle in the YouTube video below, or skim the text for the highlights.</p>
<h2>Which personality traits are most important in founders</h2>
<p><strong>Katherine Boyle:</strong> I look for what I would call this obsessive trait, where they are learning more about the regulatory complications, where they are constantly trying to figure out how to solve a problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that the common theme among the founders that I support are that they have this sort of obsessive gene or personality, where they will go deeper and deeper and deeper. When we invest in these companies, it becomes very clear that they often have sort of a contrarian view of the industry. Maybe they are not industry-native. They come at it from a different perspective of problem solving. They&#8217;ve had to defend that thesis for a very, very long time in front of a variety of different customers and different people. In some ways, that makes them much stronger in terms of the way they approach problems.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Boyce:</strong> I think the first would be being magnetic for talent. It ends up influencing the speed of learning and development. Really incredible founding teams that can be magnetic for talent and learning just kind of spirals out of control in really good ways over time. I really look for the speed and the sources of learning. And can folks be really intentional? Can they get the right set of advisors and teammates around them?</p>
<p>The second would be the personal connection to the problem space. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s this kind of deep-seated source of energy and fuel that actually isn&#8217;t going to run out. Catherine and I&#8217;ve been lucky to work across a number of different particular thematic areas, but the thing they have in common is just this personal connection to how and why their business needs to exist. Because I just think that that fuel doesn&#8217;t run out, you know what I mean? Like, that&#8217;s renewable.</p>
<h2>On fundraising and building trust remotely</h2>
<p><strong>Boyle:</strong> If you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s comfortable presenting on Zoom, making connections on Zoom, or using Signal and using Twitter and being very online, then I 100% think that you can make investments, build community and build connections through digital worlds and digital platforms. If you really like that in-person connectivity, then you might consider staying in a tech hub, or you might consider sort of these distanced walks until things go back to normal. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">At the end of 2019, no one would have predicted what an unpredictable and difficult year it has been for both startups and VCs in the fundraising world. Now we are staring down the end of 2020 and looking toward what we all hope is a better, safer 2021. What will this new year bring? With an end-of-year sprint to close deals, the anticipation of a new presidential administration and the hope of a COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon, startups and VCs know that change is on the horizon — but how much of that change will be positive?</p>
<p>As 2020 proved, no one can say for sure what 2021 will bring, but I’d like to put a few predictions on the table based on DocSend’s data and research, including the <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/2020-docsend-startup-index/">DocSend Startup Index</a>, as well as some trends I’ve seen and my own experiences. These predictions center around how we’ll fundraise post-pandemic, how the funding divide may widen for some, what fundraising activity could look like into 2021, a few sectors we think will fare well and will incorporate some tips on how to succeed in the new year, no matter what comes our way.</p>
<h2>We’ll interact through a mix of the old and the new</h2>
<p>The pandemic forced all of us to drastically change how we work and interact with colleagues and clients. When the pandemic subsides and vaccines are widely available, in-person meetings and gathering back at the office will definitely resume, but it’s safe to say the old ways of networking and fundraising won’t shift back 100%. Founders and VCs alike have navigated the ups and downs of remote networking and fundraising interactions and will stick to what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Is traveling to a conference the best way for a founder to have a chance at meeting the VC who is right to support their business? Will a VC want to drive an hour through Bay Area traffic for an in-person status update meeting on their latest investment? Zoom fatigue aside, video conference calls do have some benefits — efficiency, no travel time — although not all meetings are best conducted virtually.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			No matter what 2021 has in store, founders can still take proactive steps to help them succeed in their fundraising efforts.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The extent to which businesses go in-person or stick to virtual meetings could depend directly on what round of fundraising they are working toward or have completed. Businesses in the <a href="https://try.docsend.com/fundraising-report">pre-seed round</a> might stick with more Zoom meetings in order to conserve resources.</p>
<p>Founders in the seed round will likely split between video and in-person meetings as they are under pressure to show traction in this round, as we found in <a href="https://try.docsend.com/seed-report-webinar">our report on seed fundraising</a>, yet will also need to conserve resources and time. For <a href="https://try.docsend.com/series-a-fundraising-report-webinar">Series A</a>, they might have to meet less in person because they have established relationships with their investors. Series B might see more in-person meetings as their business has reached a level of complexity that is difficult to communicate via a deck or video conference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/benchmark" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="benchmark">Benchmark, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the storied venture firm, has brought aboard a fifth general partner: 29-year-old Miles Grimshaw, a Yale graduate who joins the outfit from Thrive Capital, where he similarly joined a team of four other partners back in 2013, helping them raise the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/miles-grimshaw/?sh=3622f9f3612c">fourth and fifth funds</a> (per Forbes).</p>
<p>From his post as a general partner with New York-based Thrive, Grimshaw had sourced deals in some of today&#8217;s buzziest startups and served on their boards, including Lattice, Mapbox, Benchling and Airtable, getting to know fellow investors at Benchmark in the process.</p>
<p>He represented Thrive on the board of <a href="https://www.benchling.com/">Benchling</a> &#8212; whose software helps lab scientists manage their biotech research &#8212; with Eric Vishria, a former entrepreneur and operator who joined Benchmark as a general partner in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/eric-vishria-benchmark/">2014</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grimshaw also represented Thrive on the board of the cloud collaboration software company <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> with Peter Fenton, who became the longest-serving general partner at Benchmark this year, as famed VC Bill Gurley began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/">transitioning out</a> of an active role at the firm. (Fenton was<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/05/11/peter-fenton-prominent-vc-successful-triathlete/"> poached from Accel</a> back in 2006.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1jiZu67RlR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/">Bill Gurley is stepping away from an active role at Benchmark, 21 years after joining the firm</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bill Gurley is stepping away from an active role at Benchmark, 21 years after joining the firm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/embed/#?secret=1jiZu67RlR" data-secret="1jiZu67RlR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And Grimshaw has been serving on a board with Benchmark&#8217;s Sarah Tavel, who was herself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/benchmark-just-hired-sarah-tavel-the-first-female-general-partner-in-the-firms-history/">poached by the firm</a> in 2017, from Greylock. That company is <a href="https://supergreat.com/">Supergreat</a>, a two-year-old, New York-based site for beauty enthusiasts that&#8217;s building a community of visitors who become reviewers, who then become shoppers.</p>
<p>Supergreat is among Benchmark&#8217;s newest bets. It was announced earlier this month that Benchmark led the startup&#8217;s $6.5 million Series A round.</p>
<p>Before hiring Grimshaw, Benchmark&#8217;s newest general partner was Chetan Puttagunta, who <a href="https://abovethecrowd.com/2018/07/09/benchmarks-newest-general-partner-chetan-puttagunta/">joined the firm in 2018</a> from New Enterprise Associates, where he spent more than seven years.</p>
<p>Benchmark has done better than some firms when it comes to succession, even while many of its general partners remain involved in startups long after they move on from the firm&#8217;s day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Firm cofounder Bruce Dunlevie, for example, joined the board of WeWork back in 2012. He&#8217;s now part of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-wework/amid-wework-board-strife-over-softbank-suit-dissident-directors-win-access-to-skadden-discovery-idUSKBN25K2C9">lawsuit</a> alleging fellow investor WeWork investor SoftBank of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, after SoftBank abandoned a tender offer to buy out earlier shareholders folllowing WeWork&#8217;s pulled IPO last year.</p>
<p>Reportedly, Matt Cohler &#8212; a former Facebook exec who was left an active role as a general partner with Benchmark <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/1/17924540/matt-cohler-benchmark-mitch-lasky">in 2018 </a>after a decade with the firm &#8212; also helped Benchmark <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/benchmark-wins-deal-for-live-shopping-app-popshop-at-100-million-valuation">secure its spot</a> in summer as the lead Series A investor in Popshop Live, a livestreaming e-commerce platform. According to The Information, to help seal the deal, Cohler agreed to join the startup&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>In addition to Cohler and Gurley, who&#8217;ve stepped back in recent years, Mitch Lasky, who joined the firm in 2007, also stepped away from its core team in 2018.</p>
<p>Benchmark made it known this summer that it was looking to bring aboard a fifth partner, one who likely completes the firm&#8217;s roster for now. As Fenton told us in September when he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/benchmarks-peter-fenton-10-to-20-years-of-innovation-just-got-pulled-forward/">sat down</a> with us at our TechCrunch Disrupt event, Benchmark &#8220;can&#8217;t scale. When we&#8217;ve gotten above six partners, the firm doesn&#8217;t work so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fenton talked at some length about how Benchmark views the composition of its team. We also talked about that WeWork deal. If you&#8217;re curious to learn more, you can watch that interview below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was an unprecedented year for [insert anything under the sun], and while plenty of tech verticals saw shifts that warped business models and shifted user habits, the gaming industry experienced plenty of new ideas in 2020. However, the loudest trends don&#8217;t always take hold as predicted.</p>
<p>This year, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon each leaned hard into new cloud-streaming tech that shifts game processing and computing to cloud-based servers, allowing users to play graphics-intensive content on low-powered systems or play titles without dealing with lengthy downloads.</p>
<p>It was heralded by executives as a tectonic shift for gaming, one that would democratize access to the next generation of titles. But in taking a closer look at the products built around this tech, it&#8217;s hard to see a future where any of these subscription services succeed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Massive year-over-year changes in gaming are rare because even if a historically unique platform launches or is unveiled, it takes time for a critical mass of developers to congregate and adopt something new — and longer for users to coalesce. As a result, even in a year where major console makers launch historically powerful hardware, massive tech giants pump cash into new cloud-streaming tech and gamers log more hours collectively than ever before, it can feel like not much has shifted.</span></p>
<p>That said, the gaming industry did push boundaries in 2020, though it&#8217;s unclear where meaningful ground was gained. The most ambitious drives were toward redesigning marketplaces in the image of video streaming networks, aiming to make a more coordinated move toward driving subscription growth and moving farther away from an industry defined for decades by one-time purchases structured around single-player storylines, one dramatically shaped by internet networking and instantaneous payments infrastructure software.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Today&#8217;s products are far from dead ends for what the broader industry does with the technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But shifting gamers farther away from one-off purchases wasn&#8217;t even the gaming industry&#8217;s most fundamental reconsideration of the year, a space reserved for a coordinated move by the world&#8217;s richest companies to upend the console wars with an invisible competitor. It&#8217;s perhaps unsurprising that the most full-featured plays in this arena are coming from the cloud services triumvirate, with Google, Microsoft and Amazon each making significant strides in recent months.</p>
<p>The driving force for this change is both the maturation of virtual desktop streaming and continued developer movement toward online cross-play between gaming platforms, a trend long resisted by legacy platform owners intent on maintaining siloed network effects that pushed gamers toward buying the same consoles that their friends owned.</p>
<p>The cross-play trend reached a fever pitch in recent years as entities like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="epic-games-2">Epic Games&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fortnite developed massive user bases that gave developers exceptional influence over the deals they struck with platform owners.</p>
<p>While a trend toward deeper cross-play planted the seeds for new corporate players in the gaming world, it has been the tech companies with the deepest pockets that have pioneered the most concerted plays to side-load a third-party candidate into the console wars.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already clear to plenty of gamers that even in their nascent stages, cloud-gaming platforms aren&#8217;t meeting up to their hype and standalone efforts aren&#8217;t technologically stunning enough to make up for the apparent lack of selection in the content libraries.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help! We&#8217;ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here.</em></a></p>
<p>For many of us, being home a lot more right now also means being online a lot more. It&#8217;s a great time to evaluate how you&#8217;re keeping your data safe — and to help others in your life do the same.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s teaching them to use things like physical security keys or just convincing them to stop writing their passwords on sticky notes, there are LOTS of little ways to nudge your friends and family in a safer direction. We&#8217;ve put together an array of gift ideas that&#8217;ll help them keep things locked down without breaking the bank (and, if you&#8217;re the one they&#8217;d call to help clean up after a security incident, probably save you some time in the end).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of what we wrote for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/gift-guide-essential-security-and-privacy-gifts-to-help-protect-your-friends-and-family/">our 2019 guide</a> still holds true. There are some timeless security essentials that you can&#8217;t miss out on, and we&#8217;ve searched around for the best deals. But we also have a few more fun gift ideas up our sleeves for the holiday season.</p>

<h2>Timeless security essentials for your friends and family</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2085611" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085611" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085611 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/security-essentials.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085611" class="wp-caption-text">(Images from top-left clockwise: Yubico, 1Password, Amazon and Amazon)</p></div></p>
<h2 id="a-password-manager-subscription">A password manager subscription</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-password-manager/">Password managers</a> are a real lifesaver. One strong, unique password lets you into your entire bank of passwords. They&#8217;re great for storing your passwords and other secrets, but also for encouraging you to use better, stronger, unique passwords. And because many are cross-platform, you can bring your passwords with you. Plenty of password managers exist — from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/free-lastpass/">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/mozillas-free-password-manager-firefox-lockbox-launches-on-android/">Lockbox</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dashlane-series-d/">Dashlane</a>, to open-source versions like KeePass. Many are free, but a premium subscription often comes with benefits and better features. And if you&#8217;re a journalist, 1Password has <a href="https://1password.com/for-journalism/">a free subscription</a> just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Many free; premium offerings start at $36 &#8211; $45 annually<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://1password.com/sign-up/">1Password</a> | <a href="https://lastpass.com/premium/payment">LastPass</a> | <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/plans">Dashlane</a> | <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a></p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t forget about a physical two-factor key</h2>
<p>Your online accounts have everything about you and you&#8217;d want to keep them safe. A security key is a physical hardware device that offers far greater protections than a two-factor code going to your phone. A security key plugs into your USB port on your computer (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/yubikey-dual-usb-c-lightning/">the charging port on your phone</a>) to &#8220;prove&#8221; to online services, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, that you are who you say you are. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/yubico-launches-a-new-nfc-security-key-and-preps-iphone-support/">YubiKeys</a> are by far our favorite and come in all shapes and sizes. The latest YubiKey 5 series has something for everyone, no matter what kind of devices they have. They&#8217;re also cheap. Google also has a range of its own branded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/14/google-titan-security-key-usb-c/">Titan security keys</a>, one of which also offers Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> From $25 &#8211; $55, depending on device type, from <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/compare-yubikey-5-series/">Yubico Store</a> or <a href="https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key">Google Store</a></p>
<h2 id="a-webcam-cover-to-hide-your-modesty">A webcam cover to protect your privacy</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re all living through this pandemic together, and most of us are still working from home. If you, like me, have accidentally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/08/sorry-i-gatecrashed-your-zoom-meeting/">joined a video call by mistake</a>, you&#8217;ll be more thankful for your webcam cover than you could ever know. Webcam covers slide open when you need to access your camera, and slides to cover the lens when you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that easy. You can buy webcam covers from practically anywhere — just make sure you get a thin cover that supports your device so as to not damage its display when you close the lid. You can support local businesses and nonprofits — you can search for unique and interesting webcam covers on Etsy or from your favorite internet rights group.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $5 &#8211; $10.<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/webcam_covers">Etsy</a> | <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/shop/laptop-camera-cover-set-ii">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p>
<h2 id="a-microphone-blocker">A microphone blocker to prevent hot mics (and malware)</h2>
<p>Now that you have your webcam cover, what about your microphone? Just as hackers can tap into your webcam, they can also pick up on your audio. Microphone blockers contain a semiconductor that tricks your computer or device into thinking that it&#8217;s a working microphone, when in fact it&#8217;s not able to pick up any audio. Anyone hacking into your device won&#8217;t hear a thing. Some modern Macs already come with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-t2-security-chip-microphone-eavesdropping/">a new Apple T2 security chip</a> which prevents hackers from snooping on your microphone when your laptop&#8217;s lid is shut. But a microphone blocker will work all the time, even when the lid is open.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPQJGA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01LPQJGA2&amp;linkId=e78b907f7bb41f37fbd6a0478aa177aa">$7</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V9T14N3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07V9T14N3&amp;linkId=3b38295afe79ddde59bc38485389254d">$20</a> on Amazon</p>

<h2 id="pi-hole-to-block-pesky-ads-and-online-trackers">A Pi-hole to block pesky ads and online trackers</h2>

<p>Think of a Pi-hole as a &#8220;hardware ad-blocker.&#8221; A Pi-hole is a modified Raspberry Pi mini-computer that runs ad-blocking technology as a box that sits on your network. It means that everyone on your home network benefits from ad blocking. Online ads generate revenue for websites but are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/apple-online-ads-private/">notorious for tracking users</a> across the web. Until ads can behave properly, a Pi-hole is a great way to capture and sinkhole bad ad traffic. The hardware may be cheap, but the ad-blocking software is free. Donations to the cause are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from $35.<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> | <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a></p>
<h2 id="a-privacy-screen-for-your-computer-or-phone">Get your computer or phone a privacy screen</h2>

<p>How often have you seen someone&#8217;s private messages or documents as you look over their shoulder, or see them in the next seat over? It&#8217;s not as much of an issue when we&#8217;re all at home — but we&#8217;re also all getting pretty comfortable with having whatever on our screens right now, which might not be the best habit to develop. Privacy screens can help protect you from &#8220;visual hacking.&#8221; These screens make it near-impossible for anyone other than the device user to snoop at what you&#8217;re working on. And, you can get them for all kinds of devices and displays — including phones. But make sure you get the right size!</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> from about $17 and up, depending on display size<br />
<strong>Available from:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=privacy+filter&amp;i=computers&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></p>

<p>Technologies to Go Boldly in Space &#8212; For the past half century, space exploration and technology has been earth-centric. We’ve studied the earth, orbited the earth and sent images of distant places back to earth. In the coming decade, we’ll embark on a new commitment: We’re going to space to stay. We’re committing to space commerce, space habitation and space exploration in order to not just stay in space, but to extend our human footprint into this solar system. To be successful, we need bold people and new technology to build and deploy the next generation of space capabilities. We need to capture these space opportunities, avoid potential threats and deliver on the promise of a multi-planet human race. This session showcases our partners USC and MIT, as they provide insight into their space programs. They are joined by university partners UCLA, ASU and Caltech, showcasing a range of emerging space technologies. Working with the Aerospace Corporation, these emerging capabilities can be evaluated and integrated into government space-faring missions for communicating, navigating and exploring in space with NASA, NOAA and the Air Force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://squadapp.io/">Squad</a> and that the team from the screen-sharing social app will be joining Twitter&#8217;s ranks. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squad-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squad-2">Squad&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founders, CEO Esther Crawford and CTO Ethan Sutin, and the rest of the team will be coming aboard inside Twitter&#8217;s design, engineering and product departments, Twitter tells us. Crawford specifically notes that she will be leading a product in the conversations space.</p>
<p>What isn&#8217;t coming aboard is the actual Squad app, which allowed users to share their screens on mobile or desktop and simultaneously video chat, a feature that aimed to find the friend use case in screen-sharing beyond the enterprise use case of presenting. The app will be shutting down tomorrow, Twitter confirms, an unwelcome surprise for its user base largely made up of teen girls.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to share further terms of the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086110" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086110" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086110 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="298" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=768,336 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=680,298 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=1536,673 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_rEcHcBU_Fmu7PSbh6lwJkA.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086110" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The app&#8217;s functionality seems like a natural fit for the service, though the company did not confirm whether any tech was coming aboard as part of the deal. Twitter hasn&#8217;t been keen to keep separate apps functioning outside of the core Twitter app. Vine was infamously shut down, upsetting users who likely later rallied behind TikTok, a massive success story and perhaps one of the biggest missed opportunities for American social media companies. Meanwhile, Periscope which has largely bumbled along over the years, is in a particularly fragile place with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-app-code-indicates-that-live-video-broadcasting-app-periscope-may-get-shut-down/">app code emerging </a>just today that indicates an impending shutdown for the app.</p>
<p>Squad was notably partnered closely with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and was an early adopter of many of the company&#8217;s Snap Kit developer tools. Building so much of the app using Snap&#8217;s developer tools could have made porting the tech to Twitter&#8217;s infrastructure a more complicated task, especially when considering how often Snap Kit apps are tied quite closely to the Snapchat user graph.</p>

Squad was in the right place at the right time in early 2020. When the pandemic first struck, CEO Esther Crawford told TechCrunch that usage of her app spiked 1,100%.</p>
<p>Crawford spoke at length about the challenges of scaling a modern social app while avoiding the pitfalls of toxicity that so often seem to come with reaching new heights. In an interview with TechCrunch last year, she told us her team was “trying to learn from the best in what they did but get rid of the shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://esthercrawford.medium.com/squad-is-now-part-of-twitter-48dd73891f71">Medium post</a>, Crawford also took the opportunity of her startup&#8217;s exit to lobby investors to start backing more diverse founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that our exit will tip the scale a bit more toward convincing investors to put money into diverse teams because each success is another proof point that we, the historically under-capitalized and underestimated founders, are a good bet,&#8221; Crawford wrote in a Medium post. &#8220;Invest in women and people of color because we will make you money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This quarter, strong earnings results from public cloud companies were overshadowed by a seemingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">endless IPO cycle</a>. Another moment we somewhat missed over the last few weeks was the stock market pushing the value of public cloud companies to all-time highs.</p>
<p>These events are connected. And they bode well for startups working on SaaS and API-delivered software, which are keeping the climate for cloud venture investment warm and valuations stretched by historical norms.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The earnings results that have made Wall Street content include a growing number of cloud companies that are seeing revenue growth accelerate from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1337174904861458435">recent analysis by Redpoint&#8217;s Jamin Ball</a>.</p>
<p>Astute readers will recall that The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/why-is-cloud-revenue-growth-so-slow-if-the-digital-transformation-is-accelerating/">chatted with Ball after the Q2 earnings cycle</a>, a conversation that included puzzling over how to square a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/12/is-the-vaunted-cloud-acceleration-falling-flat/">nearly uniform deceleration in revenue growth</a> from Q1 to Q2 in the software sector, which, at the very same time, was supposedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">undergoing a boom in demand</a> thanks to the pandemic and a suddenly remote workforce.</p>
<p>One hypothesis Ball offered was that deals signed in Q2 by SaaS companies would not show up much until Q3 if they were signed in the back-half of the quarter. Regardless of the reason, Q3 featured a far-stronger crop of cloud results that imply a strengthening sector.</p>

If you&#8217;ve been slightly befuddled as to why the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/3-investors-discuss-the-state-of-saas-investing-in-2020/">venture capital space has seen deals accelerate</a> with time-to-conviction falling from weeks to minutes — and pre-emption the new normal — this is part of the why.</span></p>
<p>As the future has been pulled forward when it comes to digitizing the American and global economies, it&#8217;s a good time to be a software company. This was visible in SaaS company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/smartsheet-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="smartsheet-3">Smartsheet&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earnings this quarter. The Exchange chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/markmader">CEO Mark Mader</a> about his company&#8217;s recent earnings results that beat expectations and led to the company&#8217;s shares rising. Analyst upgrades have followed.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s examine the data regarding how many cloud companies are seeing revenue growth accelerate, dig into Smartsheet&#8217;s results to see what we can learn (hint: SMBs matter), and then apply all our findings to the startup market itself so that we can go into the weekend as informed as possible.</p>
<h2>Public acceleration</h2>
<p>At the risk of being cheeky, I&#8217;ve embedded <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1337174904861458435/photo/1">Ball&#8217;s chart</a> concerning Q3 revenue acceleration from cloud companies below. (If you are into similar data sets, <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/">he&#8217;s worth following on Twitter</a>.) Here&#8217;s the data:</p>

<p>This chart shows Q2&#8217;s cloud year-over-year growth rates subtracted from Q3&#8217;s own; a result greater than one shows that a company&#8217;s year-over-year growth accelerated from the second quarter to the third. The higher the number of cloud companies that wind up with a result of 1% or greater in the above chart, the faster the cloud market as a whole is accelerating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission must block the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-Fitbit merger as a matter of democratic imperative, prominent academic and author Shoshana Zuboff has warned.</p>
<p>The Harvard professor who wrote the defining book on <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">surveillance capitalism</a> has become the latest voice raised against the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/">$2.1 billion data+devices deal</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s now been delayed at the regulatory clearance stage for more than a year.</p>
<p>Others calling for the Google-<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisition to be blocked &#8212; unless or until robust competition, democratic and human rights safeguards can be baked in &#8212; include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/">Amnesty International</a>; scores of <a href="https://newamericadotorg.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Joint_NGO_Statement_on_Google_Fitbit_merger_final.pdf">consumer</a>, <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/press-release/3750/press-release-privacy-international-calls-googlefitbit-merger-be-blocked">privacy</a> and digital rights groups across civic society; and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/">EU&#8217;s very own data protection advisor</a>, to name a few.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EU regulators are still considering whether or not to greenlight the merger. The deadline for them to make up their minds was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/eus-google-fitbit-antitrust-decision-deadline-pushed-into-2021/">extended into early 2021</a> &#8212; although a decision could come as soon as next week.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/google-fitbit-deal-to-be-scrutinized-in-europe-over-data-competition-concerns/">August</a>, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the deal &#8212; saying it was concerned it would &#8220;further entrench Google’s market position in the online advertising markets by increasing the already vast amount of data that Google could use for personalisation of the ads it serves and displays&#8221;.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers have also expressed skepticism over initial concessions offered by Google which suggested storing Fitbit data in a silo that it said would be kept separate from other Google data.</p>
<p>It also said it would not use Fitbit data for ad targeting &#8212; at least for a time-limited period (though it&#8217;s not clear what exactly it has proposed in Europe). Elsewhere, Australian regulators are also still eyeing the deal &#8212; and recently <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/accc-asks-industry-if-google-s-fitbit-acquisition-plan-will-work-20201130-p56j79">sought industry feedback</a> on a pledge by Google not to use Fitbit data for ads for 10 years.</p>
<p>The ACCC published <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/mergers-registers/public-informal-merger-reviews/google-llc-proposed-acquisition-of-fitbit-inc">draft undertakings</a> in November which includes stipulations such as: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google must not use any Measured Body Data or Health and Fitness Activity Location Data in or for Google Ads&#8221; and that data must be kept separate. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No Google-Fitbit merger without human rights remedies, says Amnesty to EU&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/embed/#?secret=GFjt18eGJq" data-secret="GFjt18eGJq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Zuboff&#8217;s point is that targeted advertising is just the tip of the vast data-extracting ambitions of surveillance capitalists &#8212; while health data is one of the few personal data fields these digital giants have not yet been able to mine in their usual limitless way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any notion of approving the Fitbit acquisition &#8212; based on Google&#8217;s promises not to do something that is anyway an irrelevant thing, to do or not to do &#8212; is a serious mistake,&#8221; she said yesterday, giving the keynote speech at the annual lecture of the EU Parliament&#8217;s Science and Technology Options Assessment (<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/en/home/highlights">STOA</a>) panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a decision should be reconsidered immediately. And never again repeated,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>A Google spokesman declined to comment on Zuboff&#8217;s remarks &#8212; pointing only to its <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/update-fitbit/">blog post</a> from August where it claims the deal is about &#8220;devices not data&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Beware the &#8220;epistemic coup&#8221;</h2>
<p>In the STOA lecture, Zuboff articulates a view of tech giants&#8217; uncontrolled extraction and use of data leading to what she described as an &#8220;epistemic coup&#8221; &#8212; where bottomless digitally-enabled data extraction leads to an unprecedented dominance of knowledge by the private sector, generating radical inequalities and full-spectrum harms, as a data-empowered few are able to run roughshod over humanity, democratic values and the rule of law in the name of increasing their profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;attention economy&#8217;; these are effects of a deeper cause &#8212; and that cause is surveillance capitalism&#8217;s economic imperatives. These corporations are not publishers, they are not distributors, they are not merely adtech providers; they are indiscriminate, radically indifferent all-you-can-eat extractors of everything forever, all for the sake of prediction that become more lucrative as they approach certainty,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowledge at this kind of scale produces a new kind of power over people. This is what data scientists call the shift from monitoring to actuation. Where there&#8217;s actually sufficient data about a machine system to be able to control it remotely. The thing is now it&#8217;s not just the machine systems; it&#8217;s the human systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wide-ranging <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/panel-for-future-of-science-and-technology-annual-lecture-2020_20201209-1500-SPECIAL-STOA_vd">keynote is well worth watching in full</a> for how clearly Zuboff articulates why allowing corporates to &#8220;unilaterally claim[&#8230;] private human experience for raw material, bent to the purposes of datafication, computational production and sales&#8221; is terrible for humanity and the (genuine) communities which make up our civilization &#8212; likening it to how uncontrolled extraction of oil for corporate profit has threatened the survival of life on earth, fuelling climate change, biodiversity decline and mass species extinction.</p>
<p>The nub of the argument is that surveillance capitalism&#8217;s target is <em>human nature itself</em> &#8212; with Zuboff calling out the &#8220;data business&#8221; playbook of &#8220;hidden extraction mechanisms&#8221; which she said are robbing us of the ability to fight back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today our nemesis is not, and could never be, mere data or technology &#8212; but rather the extractors, led by a handful of giant corporations: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, to name only the largest, along with their complex, far-reaching ecosystems, these are corporate institutions that have pioneered a new logic of extraction but with a dark and startling twist&#8230; These corporations have placed the defence of their narrow economic self-interest above the interests of individual sovereignty, democracy and humanity itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The keynote included a call to action to European lawmakers to step in and reverse what has been allowed to become entrenched at humanity&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here today because the European Union represents humanity&#8217;s best hope to alter this course before lawless, unprecedented computational concentrations of knowledge and power become as irreversible and poisonous to our societies as the toxic concentrations of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere have become to our earth,&#8221; said Zuboff, adding: &#8220;The idea that we could bequeath both of these cataclysms to our children is intolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google-Fitbit deal to be scrutinized in Europe over data competition concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/google-fitbit-deal-to-be-scrutinized-in-europe-over-data-competition-concerns/embed/#?secret=nYOmJcVoTZ" data-secret="nYOmJcVoTZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>EU lawmakers are on the cusp of unveiling a major package of legislative proposals which will update rules for digital services and bring in new requirements for platforms with significant market power.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposals are due to be presented next Tuesday &#8212; the start of a long road of negotiating to turn the policies into EU law.</p>
<p>It has turned out to be particularly awkward timing for the Commission, in parallel with the Google-Fitbit decision. Not least because a key EVP involved in shaping the new digital strategy, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="margrethe-vestager">Margrethe Vestager, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is also the competition commissioner &#8212; so she&#8217;s simultaneously tasked with deciding whether to waive the tech giant&#8217;s latest data acquisition through, even as she puts the finishing touches on ex ante rules for gatekeepers that won&#8217;t likely come into force for years.</p>
<p>Vestager told the EU parliament&#8217;s <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-economic-and-monetary-affairs_20201210-0900-COMMITTEE-ECON_vd">Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs</a> this week that the Commission&#8217;s incoming proposals for a major overhaul of digital regulations are necessary to tackle the challenges of the platform economy.</p>
<p>The scale and the scope of the platform economy is &#8220;unprecedented and it&#8217;s increasing&#8221;, she said, acknowledging that the digitization process has &#8220;given us a concentration of data, intellectual property, capital &#8212; and because of that there&#8217;s a lot of power in the hands of a few global players&#8221;.</p>
<p>That in turn is making it &#8220;really urgent&#8221; to complement existing EU competition law enforcement with dedicated regulation for digital services and platform giants, said Vestager.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DSA will propose a clear set of due diligence obligations and operate the e-commerce framework for all Internet services within the EU and the point is to ensure that digital services face no borders within the EU, define clearer responsibilities and accountability for online platforms such as social media and marketplaces,&#8221; she told MEPs &#8212; saying the overarching aim is to ensure consumers have the same protections online as they already do offline.</p>
<p>The aim of the DMA &#8212; and its incoming list of &#8220;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8221; for platforms that the EU will define as gatekeepers &#8212; is to make sure digital markets &#8220;stay open and contestable&#8221;, and thus to serve consumers in &#8220;the best possible way&#8221;.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Trust but verify&#8217; via audit authority</h2>
<p>In her keynote, Zuboff suggested EU regulators should follow two key principles as they consider what to do.</p>
<p>Firstly, &#8220;trust but verify&#8221; is how to treat with surveillance capitalists &#8212; so no more &#8220;taken at face value&#8221; pledges swallowed naively and later regurgitated under the one-way logic of extraction maximization. (She raised the awkward example of Facebook&#8217;s reversal of an earlier pledge to EU regulators not to combine WhatsApp user data with Facebook data.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Secondly we have to keep in mind so often we reduce the harms back to that originating context of targeted advertising &#8212; when in fact this whole economic logic has moved way beyond targeted advertising to many other markets,&#8221; she also said, warning against EU regulators taking too narrow a view on any concessions made by Google as it works to push open another data gate.  </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Commission for comment on Zuboff&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>Zuboff also spoke to concerns that EU regulators don&#8217;t believe they have legal grounds to deny Google-Fitbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the decision to approve Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit was made because of a determination that EU laws are not strong enough to defend the acquisition denial in the European courts then let us please stop talking this minute; let&#8217;s suspend our event while the parliament moves into an emergency session to pass new laws that are strong enough to take this kind of rejection through the courts. Because we need those laws,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It would certainly be ironic if the Commission green-lit the Google-Fitbit merger because it was worried about losing a legal challenge down the line &#8212; given how frequently tech giants resort to legal action to try to thwart the application of existing EU regulations. Not to mention how fiercely these giants lobby against <em>any</em> new regulation or legislative proposal that would dare to put limits on their ability to continue maximizing their data extraction.</p>

<p>Zuboff said the forthcoming DMA &#8220;is the legal instrument to accomplish this necessary lawmaking [against the surveillance capitalists]&#8221;, addressing her remarks to those in the EU who have the power to pass laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake: This is your opportunity to make a bold intervention to defend democracy against the surveillance capitalists. Faint heartedness is not an option,&#8221; she said, adding that<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DSA is likewise an essential intervention to </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">defend democracy. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is your chance to finally pry open the black box of surveillance capitalism and demand the right of democratic societies to control their own destiny,&#8221; she said, suggesting regulators&#8217; watch word here should be &#8220;audit authority&#8221;.</p>
<p>Democracy must have audit authority to protection the public just as regulators have done in countless other industries, she added.</p>
<p>The Google-Fitbit acquisition was raised in a question to Vestager yesterday during a <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/committee-on-economic-and-monetary-affairs_20201210-0900-COMMITTEE-ECON_vd">session</a> of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs &#8212; where she was asked what the EU intends to do vis-à-vis health data and competition, given the risk of tech giants gleaning far deeper and more intimate knowledge of users than they&#8217;ve been able to via current data-mining practices.</p>
<p>Vestager told the committee she couldn&#8217;t comment on the specific merger as the process is ongoing but she said she agreed health data &#8220;are much more precious and much more sensitive&#8221; than other types of commercially exploited data.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why one has to be very careful when it comes to health data and advertising &#8212; because here it can be a much more vulnerable position for the person in question,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For health data as such I think it&#8217;s very important that the market develops because the more health data that becomes available the more services people expect for the market to provide for them to have a better understanding of how their health develops,&#8221; she went on, adding on Google-Fitbit specifically that &#8220;it remains to be seen how the remedies were to bear out if they were to be accepted&#8221;.</p>
<h2>U.S. versus EU approach to antitrust</h2>
<p>During the session Vestager also faced a number of questions from MEPs about the difference of approach to antitrust between the EU and the U.S. &#8212; where states have just opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">massive antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="75eQH82Yhe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/embed/#?secret=75eQH82Yhe" data-secret="75eQH82Yhe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>She repeatedly stressed that Europe has a &#8220;different&#8221; approach to competition law versus the U.S., sounding a tad on the defensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. Facebook case is a different approach than what we have. In Europe we do not have a ban of monopolies. They have a different legal basis in the U.S. We would say you&#8217;re more than welcome to be successful but with success comes responsibility &#8212; which is why we have article 102 [against abusing a dominant position],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a last resort in Europe we would also be able to ask our [institutions] to split up companies but then we would also have to prove that this was the only thing to solve a competition problem and I don&#8217;t think we have been there yet,&#8221; Vestager added.</p>
<p>Responding to other questions from MEPs she described her department as doing its &#8220;best&#8221; across a number of big tech investigations &#8212; pointing it&#8217;s recently opened case against Amazon and has others ongoing into Google&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s use of data for advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a couple of ongoing investigations into the Facebook ecosystem &#8212; on the use of data from customers and consumers into advertising and how the Facebook marketplace is functioning,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;These cases are not as advanced as they are in the U.S. when it comes to Facebook but I find [the U.S. action] very encouraging,&#8221; she added, saying it&#8217;s a sign that &#8220;the global debate about tech dominance has been shifting over the last couple of years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked about Facebook&#8217;s reversal of an earlier promise not to combine Facebook and WhatsApp user data, Vestager said EU regulators had performed an analysis at the time &#8212; looking into whether such a move would still allow for competition &#8212; and &#8220;found there would be room for others services of the same kind&#8221;.</p>
<p>There were no follow-up questions in the event format so MEPs were unable to ask whether Vestager believes that analysis was sound or flawed. But it&#8217;s not a good look that the EU&#8217;s competition authorities were left so wrong-footed on Facebook&#8217;s market power.</p>
<p>Off her own bat, Vestager merely said: &#8220;It remains to be seen what will be the outcome of the U.S. [Facebook antitrust] case; as I said they have a different legal basis &#8212; to see if by acquiring this company you have entrenched monopoly position.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was also asked what the Commission intends to do about companies using self-serving tactics to artificially prolong investigations (and thus delay competition enforcement) &#8212; such as by procrastinating or handing out requested information only with substantial delay.</p>
<p>Vestager said its approach is to aim to &#8220;always try to balance things out&#8221; but she argued it&#8217;s important to give businesses enough time to respond properly even though it extends the length of investigations.</p>
<p>During the session she did also note that the aim for the DMA is to enable competition authorities to be &#8220;so much quicker&#8221; &#8212; because the ex ante rules will bake in &#8220;self-executing obligations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper status also means regulators will not need to do the work of establishing dominance first &#8212; &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">which means you&#8217;ll get to the sanction must faster and should prevent damages in the marketplace&#8221;, she noted. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether or not the forthcoming legislative package will feature a new competition tool for specifically tackling digital markets &#8212; which the Commission consulted on earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reports have suggested this has been dropped after a standard EU pre-regulatory review process. But the commissioner did not confirm either way.</p>
<p>She was also asked about interim measures &#8212; an existing tool she dusted off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/europe-issues-interim-antitrust-order-against-broadcom-as-probe-continues/">last year</a> after an extended period when it had not been used, applying it in a case against chipmaker Broadcom.</p>
<p>On this she said the tool has been shown to have been useful &#8212; noting the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/european-antitrust-regulators-settle-with-broadcom-a-year-after-interim-measures-flex/">Broadcom case was settled in a year</a> (which is a very speedy turnaround for a competition case) &#8212; and she suggested the tool could be used more frequently in the future. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think that we will see we can use it more often,&#8221; she told the MEPs. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.inemotion.com/en/">In&amp;motion</a> has raised a $12 million (€10 million) funding round led by Upfront Ventures, with 360 Capital also participating. The company has been working on wearable airbag systems for motorbikes.</p>
<p>Integrated in a vest, the airbag is completely autonomous and can detect crashes in 60 milliseconds. The company has worked on a device called the In&amp;box that analyzes movements in real time. Thanks to different sensors, the device can determine when it’s time to activate the airbag.</p>
<p>In&amp;motion has worked on different profiles for different types of activities. For instance, if you’re riding a motorcycle on a MotoGP track, chances are you’re going to move faster and change your trajectory quite often. You can choose between traditional motorcycle riding, track and off-road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Professional racers are increasingly using airbag systems. In addition to MotoGP racers, participants in the 2021 Dakar Rallye will have to use airbags.</p>
<p>The go-to-market strategy is interesting as the startup isn’t selling its system directly to end users. In&amp;motion has partnered with existing motorcycle brands so they can integrate the system in some vests. This way, In&amp;motion doesn’t have to build out a network of resellers from scratch. So far, the company has sold tens of thousands of systems.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://www.inemotion.com/myinemotion/en/moto-membership">subscription component</a>, with unlimited warranty and the ability to replace the In&amp;box device with a new model after three years.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to expand beyond its home country with a focus on Germany and the U.S. The company plans to double the size of its team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gorillasapp.com">Gorillas</a>, a grocery delivery startup that operates its own hyper local fulfillment centers and has already been a hit in Berlin, has raised $44 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Probably one of European tech&#8217;s worst kept secrets this year, the round is led by hedge fund Coatue, with participation from other unnamed European investors. Coatue’s Daniel Senft and Bennett Siegel will join Gorillas‘ board.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Accel and Index were <a href="https://www.deutsche-startups.de/2020/11/02/dealmonitor-02-11-2020/">reportedly</a> in the running, but ultimately didn’t invest. Atlantic Food Labs previously backed Gorillas in a seed round thought to be around €1.2 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Kağan Sümer and Jörg Kattner in May this year and operating in Berlin and Cologne, Gorillas delivers groceries within an average of ten minutes. Unlike gig economy models, it employs riders directly and is emphasising its ability to get fresh groceries, along with other household items, to shoppers at very short notice and at “retail prices”. The idea is that the startup can address a large part of the groceries market that falls outside of a weekly bulk shop.</p>
<p>Some have dubbed the model that Gorillas is attempting to make work, &#8220;dark&#8221; convenience stores, in reference to the dark kitchens that run on top of Deliveroo and UberEats and operate as delivery only restaurants. In this instance, Gorillas and other European competitors, such as Dija (which we reported is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/">closing its own large funding round</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, are building out local delivery only grocery/convenience stores. These startups are also often compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">goPuff</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>Gorillas CEO Kağan Sümer says that mass supermarkets, including their delivery models, are designed so that the consumer organises their grocery shopping around the needs of the supermarket and supply chain, rather than the supermarket being designed around the needs of the consumer.</p>
<p>This sees an emphasis on long shelf life products, where even fresh goods are treated for longer expiry dates, and a model that serves the weekly bulk shop well, but at the detriment of two other use-cases: “emergency” shopping, such as when you’re missing a key ingredient, or quickly replenishing your fridge based on what you fancy consuming right now.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem is that bulk purchases are super served. What I mean by that is this: all of the supermarket infrastructure is shaped around bulk purchases,” Sümer tells me, arguing that this leaves one third of the market underserved.</p>
<p>“You have penne but no Arrabiata; how do you get that sauce that you need now? [There is] no way.</p>
<p>“So we asked ourselves, what would happen if a company pops up and serves people with what they need when they need it? Our hypothesis was that people would appreciate it and shift their interaction with groceries to more on demand purchases”.</p>
<p>With a slogan that reads: “Faster than you,” and a delivery fee of just €1.80, one question mark over Gorillas (and others in the space) is if the unit economics can ever stack up, especially at scale and if the company really isn’t marking up prices significantly. “Through our procurement relationships, we have healthy margins which allow us to sell at retail prices,” says Sümer, pushing back. “Taking into account the solid basket sizes and procurement margins we are able to build a long-term sustainable business”.</p>
<p>He says the average delivery time is 10 minutes. “Through our network of centrally located fulfillment centers we are able to service customers in a small delivery radius. Ultimately we strive to deliver an efficient and fast service with full transparency on delivery times,” adds the Gorillas CEO.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gorillas says the new funding will be used for expansion across Germany and will accelerate its rollout across more of Europe &#8212; first stop, Amsterdam. Additionally, the company will use the capital to build out its team in Berlin. More ambitious, by the end of Q2 next year, Gorillas says it plans to be available in over 15 cities in Germany and across Europe, operating over 60 fulfillment centers.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE 12:55 PM EST: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> called a hold in the countdown with 30 seconds remaining. It hasn&#8217;t shared details about the cause yet, but they did confirm that they won&#8217;t be attempting the launch today and will advise as to the next attempt window.</em></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is already having a banner year, with major accomplishments including its first human spaceflight, and it&#8217;s aiming to pad its current record-breaking launch year with a 25th flight today. The launch will carry SiriusXM-7, a broadcasting satellite for satellite radio service SiriusXM, delivering it to a geostationary transfer orbit from Space Launch Complex-40 in Florida.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is actually the second launch that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has conducted just this week, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/spacex-launches-new-cargo-dragon-to-space-station-for-100th-successful-falcon-9-flight/">flying its 21st commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station for NASA on December 6</a>. SpaceX has a nearly two hour window for today&#8217;s launch, beginning at 11:21 AM EST (8:21 AM PST), and weather is currently looking good. <em>UPDATE: SpaceX updated the launch time to 12:55 PM EST.</em></p>
<p>The booster used on this launch flew during Demo-1, the first crewed flight for SpaceX ever, which brought astronauts to the ISS in May, as well as during a RADARSAT launch, and four separate Starlink launches during 2020. This will be its seventh flight, tying a record for SpaceX&#8217;s flight-proven first-stage boosters. It&#8217;ll attempt to land aboard the company&#8217;s drone landing ship in the Atlantic Ocean after deploying its second stage and cargo.</p>
<p>The broadcast above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the opening of the launch window, so long as everything is tracking on time.</p>

<p>In this week&#8217;s Decrypted, we&#8217;re deep-diving into two stories beyond the headlines, including why the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">breach at cybersecurity giant FireEye</a> has the cybersecurity industry in shock.</p>

<h3 id="google-researcher-finds-a-major-iphone-security-bug-now-fixed">Google researcher finds a major iPhone security bug, now fixed</h3>
<p>What happens when you leave one of the best security researchers alone for six months? You get one of the most devastating vulnerabilities ever found in an iPhone — a bug so damaging that it can be exploited over-the-air and requires no interaction on the user&#8217;s part.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084868" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084868" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2084868" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-project-zero-iphones.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084868" class="wp-caption-text">The AWDL bug under attack using a proof-of-concept exploit developed by a Google researcher. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ian Beer/<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html">Google Project Zero</a></p></div></p>
<p>The vulnerability was found in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), an important part of the iPhone&#8217;s software that among other things allows users to share files and photos over Wi-Fi through Apple&#8217;s AirDrop feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWDL is enabled by default, exposing a large and complex attack surface to everyone in radio proximity,&#8221; wrote <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/i41nbeer/status/1333884909858004992">Ian Beer</a> in a tweet, who found the vulnerability in November and disclosed it to Apple, which pushed out a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210918">fix for iPhones</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210919">Macs</a> in January.</p>
<p>But exploiting the bug allowed Beer to gain access to the underlying iPhone software using Wi-Fi to gain control of a vulnerable device — including the messages, emails and photos — as well as the camera and microphone — without alerting the user. Beer said that the bug could be exploited over &#8220;hundreds of meters or more,&#8221; depending on the hardware used to carry out the attack. But the good news is that <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html">there&#8217;s no evidence</a> that malicious hackers have actively tried to exploit the bug.</p>
<p>News of the bug drew immediate attention, though Apple didn&#8217;t comment. NSA&#8217;s Rob Joyce said <a href="https://twitter.com/RGB_Lights/status/1333928951941566468?s=20">the bug</a> find is &#8220;quite an accomplishment,&#8221; given that most iOS bugs require chaining multiple vulnerabilities together in order to get access to the underlying software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been doubling down on video services within its app, building out Twitter Live and recently launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fleets</a> so that users can share more moving media alongside their pithy 180-word observations, links and still photos. But in the process, it appears that it may also be streamlining its bigger stable of services. Code in the Twitter app indicates that Periscope &#8212; the live video broadcasting app that launched a thousand fluttering hearts &#8212; may be headed into retirement.</p>
<p>Date and other details are still unknown, but super-sleuth developer Jane Machun Wong <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1337344129995395073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a line</a> in Twitter&#8217;s app code that indicated a link to a shutdown notice for Periscope (which currently does not go to a live link).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This text found inside Twitter’s app indicates the shutdown notice might be shown in future versions of the Periscope app, directing users to a FAQ page about the app <a href="https://t.co/gGrNNxRLL7">pic.twitter.com/gGrNNxRLL7</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There are no shutdown references in any of the code in the currently obtainable version of the Persicope app, Wong told us, but she also pointed out that the two apps do share some code &#8212; indeed there are integrations between the two Twitter-owned apps &#8212; and &#8220;I guess [that] is how the text in the screenshot got slipped into Twitter,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to Twitter for a response to her discovery and will update as we learn more.</p>
<p>If this does play out with Periscope getting retired, it would be the end of a five-year run for the app.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/how-periscope-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired Periscope</a> before it had even launched (we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/04/twitter-in-talks-with-live-streaming-app-periscope/?_ga=2.101545153.1912869610.1607285587-2020914112.1606652257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broke the news</a> of the acquisition before that), as part of a bold move to double down on video, and specifically live video. At the time, the move was coming as Twitter was really coming into its own as a platform for media companies, &#8220;citizen journalists&#8221; and simply people who wanted to get the word out more widely on whatever they were thinking about or doing.</p>
<p>At the time, Twitter was also eyeing up and apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/12/this-stream-aint-big-enough-for-the-both-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to stem the viral growth</a> of Meerkat, &#8220;the&#8221; app of 2015. That was not going to be an issue for the long run, though. Eventually Meerkat, either because of Periscope or because of the cyclical nature of hype, did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/meerkat-star-of-2015-is-officially-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fizzle out</a>, only to relaunch as interactive video chat app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/the-internet-third-place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Houseparty</a>, which eventually got noticed by Fortnite maker Epic, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then bought it</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Periscope, meanwhile, took a different route as part of Twitter from the very start of its launched life.</p>
<p>It remained a standalone app, but its team, and specifically founder Kayvon Beykpour, became a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/twitter-gets-a-re-org-and-new-product-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">central part of all of Twitter&#8217;s product development</a>.</p>
<p>And the central feature of Periscope was the app became a native part of the Twitter app; <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/a/2016/go-live-on-twitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Live</a> &#8220;powered by Periscope,&#8221; which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/in-push-for-more-live-video-twitter-officially-announces-the-producer-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded with API access</a> and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/twitter-makes-it-easier-to-share-the-right-part-of-a-live-video-with-launch-of-timestamps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features</a>. Twitter itself promotes Twitter Live content, not Periscope&#8217;s: you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterlive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TwitterLive</a> to get highlights of some of the people and organizations using the live feature in the app. (Other leading social apps like Instagram and Facebook have taken a similar route, offering live video features but more as embedded parts of the main platforms, rather than standalone apps where live is front and center.)</p>
<p>Periscope, you might say, has in the meantime been dying a slow death as a standalone brand and app. But it&#8217;s not a new story: my former (missed!) colleague Josh pointed out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/hindscope-is-20-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was sinking</a> at the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s just about been bobbing along. <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/972909677/app-ranking?app_slug=972909677&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;device=iphone&amp;type=ranks&amp;date=2020-12-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppAnnie&#8217;s rankings</a> indicate that it&#8217;s essentially among the top 100 social networking apps in most markets &#8212; maybe not a bad figure considering how big app stores are now &#8212; although when looking at overall rankings, Periscope is generally too low to register in any major markets.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s definitely not an app that has much buzz, not least because of its owner being popular, but also because video fads have taken a different, TikTok-style turn of late.</p>
<p>The TikTok effect is an interesting one to consider here. Earlier this year it was reported that Twitter was among those interested in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially acquiring TikTok</a> when the popular app, owned by China&#8217;s ByteDance, found itself in some regulatory hot water over national security interests (that is a different story, still playing out and seemingly in limbo right now). Some of the apparent reasoning for Twitter&#8217;s interest? It never really got past its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/haunted-by-regret-over-killing-vine-twitter-purportedl-1844667451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regret</a> over killing off Vine.</p>
<p>Vine, if you recall, was the popular short-form video app that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/if-twitter-gets-into-the-video-hosting-game-it-could-be-a-wonderful-and-horrible-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired</a>, grew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/just-six-months-after-being-acquired-twitters-vine-hits-1-free-spot-on-apples-app-store/?_ga=2.21372859.1070664616.1607334007-209244718.1579131500">really well for a while</a> as it saw it gain some entertaining virality, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then shut down</a> to focus more attention on &#8212; yep &#8212; Periscope.</p>
<p>Many in retrospect have wondered &#8220;what could have been&#8221; had Twitter held on to Vine and put the effort and investment into building it out. (Or indeed, what could have happened <a href="https://twitter.com/rus/status/791681274339622913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E791681274339622913%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2016%2F10%2F27%2Ftwitter-is-shutting-down-vine%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if it never sold to Twitter in the first place</a>, but that is also a different story.)</p>
<p>If Periscope sinking away is on the cards, it&#8217;s a question that probably still bears asking &#8212; what could have been? Even with live video within Twitter&#8217;s app, it&#8217;s not the star of the show. One can&#8217;t help but wonder if live video might next appear front and center elsewhere, made by a different company, much like short-form video finally had its day in a ByteDance way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s official. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-dynamics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-dynamics">Boston Dynamics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is becoming part of the Hyundai family (pending regulatory approval, naturally). The Waltham, Massachusetts-based robot maker confirmed in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-group-to-acquire-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics-from-softbank-group-opening-a-new-chapter-in-the-robotics-and-mobility-industry-301191028.html">a press release</a> today that the South Korean technology company is acquiring controlling interest. The deal, which values the company at $1.1 billion, gives Hyundai Motor Group an 80% stake, with SoftBank controlling the remaining 20%.</p>
<p>The transaction marks the Spot-maker’s third change of hands in a mere seven years. After nearly a quarter-century operating as a research firm (with some big financial help from organizations like DARPA), it sold to Google in 2013, becoming part of a new robotics wing led by then-executive Andy Rubin.</p>
<p>After Google X Robotics was largely dissolved, Boston Dynamics changed hands in 2017, becoming a subsidiary of Japanese investment giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It was an odd fit for the company, and a rough year for SoftBank likely hasn’t helped matters. At the very least, Hyundai is a more logical home for the company, after being owned by a firm whose best-known robot is Pepper, the humanoid hospitality &#8216;bot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iSxz07VGq1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/">Hyundai reportedly in talks to buy SoftBank-owned Boston Dynamics</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hyundai reportedly in talks to buy SoftBank-owned Boston Dynamics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/embed/#?secret=iSxz07VGq1" data-secret="iSxz07VGq1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As we noted while reporting on earlier rumors about the acquisition, Hyundai has been making some big investments in the category. The list includes a recent joint venture with Aptiv to commercialize autonomous driving systems. There’s also the recently announced ultimate mobility vehicles, or UMV &#8212; a borderline sci-fi vehicle with legs.</p>
<p>“Boston Dynamics’ commercial business has grown rapidly as we&#8217;ve brought to market the first robot that can automate repetitive and dangerous tasks in workplaces designed for human-level mobility,&#8221; CEO Rob Playter said in a release tied to the deal. &#8220;We and Hyundai share a view of the transformational power of mobility and look forward to working together to accelerate our plans to enable the world with cutting edge automation, and to continue to solve the world’s hardest robotics challenges for our customers.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, of course, has been blurring the lines between science fiction and reality for several decades now. More recently, however, it’s taken a much stronger interest in commercializing its advanced technologies. Under SoftBank, the company launched Spot, a quadruped robot that draws on years of robotic innovation, including the iconic Big Dog.</p>
<p>Spot went up for sale last year in limited quantities. It’s now available for anyone in the U.S. with $74,500 burning a hole in their pocket. The company is also pushing to commercialize its wheeled Handle robot for warehouse and fulfillment related purposes. That robot is due out some time next year. While the sophistication and resulting price tags for the company’s robots have drawn a fair bit of skepticism, investors have taken increased interest in robots and automation firms in the wake of year-long COVID-19-related shutdowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyundai Motor Group will provide Boston Dynamics a strategic partner affording access to Hyundai Motor Group’s in-house manufacturing capability and cost benefits stemming from efficiencies of scale,&#8221; according to the release. &#8220;Boston Dynamics will benefit substantially from new capital, technology, affiliated customers, and Hyundai Motor Group’s global market reach enhancing commercialization opportunity for its robot products.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in by June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open banking platforms, where services that might not have previously lived next to each other are now joined up by way of APIs, has been one of the emerging trends of the last couple of years, and today one of the leaders in the space out of Europe has closed a round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="http://tink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, a startup out of Stockholm, Sweden that aggregates a number of banks and financial services by way of an API so that those can in turn be accessed via new channels, has raised €85 million (or $103 million at current rates), at a post-money valuation of €680 million (or around $825 million). It plans to use the capital to double down on expanding its network of banks and payment services in Europe. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tink" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tink">Tink <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already links up 3,400 banks, covering some 250 million people, with partners including PayPal, NatWest, ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, Nordea and SEB, some of which are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/tink-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategic investors</a>. On the other side, it has some 8,000 developers using its APIs.</p>
<p>This latest tranche of funding is being co-led by new investor Eurazeo Growth and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dawn-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dawn-capital">Dawn Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with PayPal Ventures, HMI Capital, Heartcore, ABN AMRO Ventures, Poste Italiane and BNP Paribas’ venture arm, Opera Tech Ventures, also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes less than a year after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/19/tink-raises-e90m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a round of €90 million</a> ($105 million) in January 2020, and is more specifically an extension of that round. For context, that previous round was at a €415 million ($503 million) valuation, and the company has definitely grown since then: in January it said it had 2,500 banking partners in its network. It has now raised €175 million in total.</p>
<p>The last year &#8212; shaped by a global health pandemic &#8212; has been all about bringing more services online and into the cloud, so people and businesses that can no longer do things like banking or selling/shopping in person can still get things done. That has most definitely played out strongly in the world of financial services, with banks, bank competitors and their tech partners seeing a surge in demand for more flexible, digital channels.</p>
<p>“Despite the difficulties of 2020, it was a year of great growth for Tink,&#8221; said Daniel Kjellén, co-founder and CEO of Tink, in a statement. &#8220;2020 has seen payments powered by open banking take-off, and in 2021 we expect to see this scale – most prominently in the UK, followed by Europe. This funding extension will further facilitate the development of our payment initiation services across Europe, while continuing to deliver new data-products built on open banking technology to our customers.”</p>
<p>Tink is not the only company that is looking to capitalize on this. Just earlier this week, another startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit, came out of stealth with $18.6 million in funding</a>. It also has ambitions to provide a way to integrate banking features, and banks, into environments where they might have not previously existed. Others also linking up financial services and helping them integrate into other platforms and apps include Plaid and Rapyd.</p>
<p>Plaid is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting acquired by Visa</a> for $5.3 billion, although that deal is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently under antitrust scrutiny</a>. Rapyd remains VC-backed and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/rapyd-which-offers-fintech-as-a-service-via-a-single-api-adds-20m-more-to-its-coffers-at-a-1-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last valued at $1.3 billion</a>. The proliferation and growth of these might prove to be a strong argument in favor of the market not being sewn up by Plaid (no pun intended), although having one owned by a single payments giant would definitely shift how the market is evolving.</p>

<p>&#8220;The open banking movement continues to pick up pace, with 2021 showing every sign that it will bring increased collaboration between fintechs and large enterprises, who want to take digitally enabled services to their customers with a tried and trusted partner,&#8221; said Zoé Fabian, MD of Eurazeo Growth, in a statement. &#8220;Since its inception eight years ago, Tink has proven itself to be the leading open banking platform in Europe, and our investment underlines the confidence we and the industry have in Tink and open banking. We look forward to supporting them on their continued journey.”</p>
<p>Tink&#8217;s business is based around payment initiation technology, providing easy integrations into existing banking services, and then making a commission on transactions that subsequently take place. The company said that it currently processes around 1 million payment transactions per month in five markets.</p>
<p>Although it doesn&#8217;t specify the value of those transactions, or how much it makes itself, it notes that current customers include Kivra, a digital mailbox provider with 4 million adults in Sweden; and, as of earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payment fintech Lydia</a>, with over 5 million customers. It is live in Sweden, U.K., France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands and the plan is to expand to 10 markets in 2021.</p>

<p>While the company will be using the funding to expand partnerships and its footprint, it&#8217;s also not shying away from inorganic growth. This year it made no less than three acquisitions to expand its business &#8212; a sign also of how there is likely more consolidation to come as not every company can find the scale and funding to grow in the current market. Tink&#8217;s acquisitions included Swedish credit decisioning firm Instantor, to expand in credit risk products; Spanish account aggregation provider Eurobits; and U.K. aggregation platform OpenWrks.</p>
<p>“Tink has truly emerged as Europe&#8217;s leading open banking platform and is quickly becoming a key strategic piece of financial technology infrastructure,&#8221; said Josh Bell, general partner of Dawn, in a statement. &#8220;We have seen activity across Tink&#8217;s network rapidly accelerate this year, with increasing adoption and implementation of open banking products and services across their platform. We are delighted to support Tink’s latest funding round, and look forward to working with the team across 2021 to expand the breadth and depth of its already considerable network of banks, accelerate the rollout of its account-to-account payments initiation solutions, and continue to deliver exceptional value to its fast-growing customer base.”</p>
