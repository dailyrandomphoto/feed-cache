										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Facebook has long been working on raising WhatsApp&#8217;s profile as a channel for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/whatsapp-business-now-with-50m-maus-adds-qr-code-and-catalog-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businesses</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interact with</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell to</a>) their customers. Today, a startup that has built a suite of tools for retailers and others to build and run those services over WhatsApp and other messaging platforms is announcing growth funding to address that opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.yalo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yalo</a>, which describes itself as a c-commerce (&#8220;chat commerce&#8221;) startup building tools for businesses to use messaging apps as part of their customer outreach and sales strategies, has raised $50 million, funding that it will be using to expand its services with a specific focus on emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="p1">Yalo already counts big brands like Unilever, Nestle, Coca-Cola and Walmart among the customers using its platform for sales and marketing efforts. In total that speaks to potentially an audience of 350 million, although Yaho doesn&#8217;t disclose how many people are actually using Yalo services as a part of that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The funding is being led by B Capital, with participation from other, undisclosed, investors. Yalo, which recently rebranded from Yalochat, is on a funding roll at the moment: the company&#8217;s last round was in August, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/yalochat-a-fast-growing-conversational-commerce-startup-lands-15-million-led-by-b-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million Series B</a>. B Capital&#8217;s investment is interesting, given Yalo&#8217;s focus on building tools for businesses to better utilize Facebook apps to interact with customers: the VC firm was co-founded by Eduardo Saverin, one of Facebook&#8217;s co-founders.</p>
<p>CEO Javier Mata said in an emailed interview that the reason for the swift funding was because of how fast business has been growing in the last year, part of the bigger boom for e-commerce overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid fast forwarded us into the future and with it the need for conversational commerce increased significantly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It went from being [one] digital commerce channel to becoming the main one.&#8221; He said that some of Yalo&#8217;s customers are seeing 80% of their sales happening on top of (and inside) messaging apps, a huge shift when you consider how reliant some brands in the consumer packaged goods sector have in the past been on more physical retail channels, whether that was a supermarket, a corner shop or a vending machine. &#8220;The market demand increased and we raised to continue overdelivering to customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Yalo wasn&#8217;t looking for more funding, &#8220;but then we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth, so we did it. Everything we do is to provide value to our customers and in this case we decided to accelerate our product development so that customers would get conversational marketing, payments, and the world would get no-code builder to create all kind of conversational app sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yalo is not disclosing its valuation with this round, CEO Javier Mata said in an email interview. The startup has raised $75 million to date, with other past investors includingÂ NXTP from Argentina and Sierra Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in Mexico, now based in San Francisco, and currently active in Mexico, India, Brazil and the U.S., Yalo&#8217;s strategy is to play into the role messaging apps have taken on for consumers in many markets, but especially emerging markets, where many people &#8220;live&#8221; when on their phones, using them not just to chat to friends, but to interact with a wide range of services.</p>
<p>This is also something that messaging companies like Facebook, taking a page from companies like WeChat and Line in Asia, have been looking to cultivate. Over the years, WeChat and Line have leveraged their success as basic messaging apps to build out wider &#8220;super apps&#8221; covering all kinds of other forms of communication, as well as a plethora of services like payments, shopping, entertainment and news, both build by the apps themselves as well as by third parties, and now used by hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is Yalo&#8217;s biggest platform &#8220;by a lot,&#8221; said Mata, with SMS in second place, so this is where a lot of its focus is right now.</p>
<p class="p3">While WhatsApp has been building out the facility to provide more services, Yalo has built a platform that sits in between brands and the apps themselves in order to use them. Its service &#8212; which works with other apps as well (it describes itself as platform-agnostic and able to be embedded in any messaging app) &#8212; lets agencies or the brands themselves plan and run marketing and sales campaigns, offer helpdesk services and take payments, giving customers the option to create &#8220;micro apps&#8221; to live in various messaging environments.</p>
<p>The emerging market focus for Yalo seems to mirror the role that messaging and mobile have taken in these markets overall. In many cases, consumers in developing economies skipped straight over using traditional computers and went online for the first time with cheap smartphones. As a result, that paved the way for consumers, whose digital consumption was more focused on mobile screens, to being more receptive and likely to use messaging apps for more than just messaging.</p>
<p>Mata believes that while emerging markets may have paved the way, though, more developed economies will follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went from brick and mortar to desktop apps, from apps to web apps, from web apps to mobile apps, and now the future/present is about conversational apps,&#8221; Mata said. &#8220;Conversational apps are the future because they take advantage of the messaging app that people have already downloaded and they do not need users to install or learn a new ux. It is easier to adopt a new technology when you do not need to replace a lot of legacy technology and you can just leapfrog. That is exactly what emerging markets are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes that &#8220;the US and other markets will get there but they will take longer, and eventually the lines between e-commerce and c-commerce will blur. You are starting to see that with text marketing, which is only a tiny fraction of conversational and it is already huge. It&#8217;s not a surprise that China is further ahead in digital than the US and conversational commerce is the predominant way of commerce through WeChat. Emerging markets leapfrog when it comes to adopting new tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, <span class="s2">BCG<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OYFlp8ZJJv-kzIlp4bi49m1S318EP6j9/view"> <span class="s3">estimates </span></a>that c-commerce is already a $35 billion market, and will grow to $130 billion by 2025 in emerging markets alone, accounting for 60% of all digital commerce.</span></p>
<p class="p6">The question will be, then, that if this really takes off, whether the likes of Facebook will try to own the integration experience as much as owning the platform itself, or whether those who have helped to build more interesting commerce experiences on the traditional web &#8212; companies like Shopify and Magento, but also Amazon &#8212; might try to own this space too, presenting more competition down the line for Yalo.</p>
<p>Not an issue for now, investors say.</p>
<p class="p6">âYalo has become the leading conversational commerce company, revolutionizing the way large enterprises engage with their customers and enabling them to transact through chat applications. We have been impressed with their execution and are very pleased t<span class="s2">o expand our r</span>elationship with them by leading their Series C round.â said Saverin in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationships between banks and fintechs are multi-faceted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, they partner. In many cases, they compete. In other cases, one acquires or invests in the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, today, an announcement by global payments giant VisaÂ is aimed at helping facilitate banks and fintechsâ ability to work together.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Visa said today it has expanded its </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-partner-connect.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Fintech Partner Connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a program designed to help financial institutions quickly connect with a âvetted and curatedâ set of technology providers.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Angelos, senior vice president and global head of fintech at Visa, to understand just exactly what that means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âGlobal fintech investment last year was $105 billion,â Angelos said. âThere were about 2,861 deals in venture, PE and M&amp;A. So literally over $100 billion is going into fintech, which is more than the combined tech budgets of every bank in the U.S. As a result, a lot of innovation that is occurring in fintech is funded by venture dollars. Weâre trying to bring that innovation to our clients, whether they are banks, processors or other fintechs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program initially launched in Europe in November of 2020, and now is available in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Latin American and CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa). Visa has worked to identify fintechs that can help banks and financial institutions (that are clients of Visaâs) as well as other fintechs âcreate digital-first experiences, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the cost and complexity of building the back-end technology in-house.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">â</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local teams will run programs in the respective regions, and vet and manage partners in the following categories: account opening, data aggregation, analytics and security, customer engagement and new cardholder services and operations and compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Visa has identified about 60 partners that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer a range of technologies &#8212; from back-office functions to new front-end services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Angelos. Those partners include Alloy, Jumio, Argyle, Fidel, FirstSource, TravelBank, Canopy, Hummingbird and Unit21, among others. Twenty-four are located in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âSo much of fintech focus and coverage is about disrupting existing banks. Everyone is trying to disrupt everyone, including fintechs like PayPal,â Angelos told TechCrunch. âVenture numbers are certainly very large. What weâre realizing is there is a significant opportunity to pair up a lot of venture-backed companies with our existing clients. It runs a little bit against us versus them approach you typically hear about.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa clients can get in touch with program partners via the </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-partner-connect.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Partner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website and get benefits such as reduced implementation fees and pricing discounts.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe Fintech Connect program is about both helping to identify and curate interesting fintech companies and then create a favorable commercial partnership for our clients so they can engage with these Fintech Connect partners,â Angelos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does Visa gain from all this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âOur goal is that all of our clients are in a position to build better digital experiences for their consumers,â he told TechCrunch. âWe would love it if every bank had the latest tools in order to onboard clients and build digital experiences.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its partners, for example, is virtual card startup Extend.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThere are fintechs that provide this today such as TripActions, Ramp and Divvy,â Angelos points out. âBut what Visa is doing is looking at âHow can we enable our banking clients to do something similar?â So weâre bringing innovation into our ecosystem so that anyone can take advantage.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also help companies such as TripActions, Ramp or Divvy with other complementary technologies for security posture, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe net beneficiary is to hopefully move more spending onto those rails,â Angelos said. âFor example, if you look at B2B spend, thereâs about $120 trillion of it annually. We believe about $20 trillion of that is card eligible. Today, Visa captures about $1 trillion of that. So, another $19 trillion is available for Visa to capture through our partners if our banks and fintechs can build these kinds of solutions to enable B2B payments.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Visa also invests in startups from time to time. But this initiative is distinct from those efforts, although a couple of its partners have been recipients of funding from Visa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has asked social media firms to provide specific details about whether they have complied with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>Â &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; and &#8220;preferably today&#8221; even as the new regulations are being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">challenged by WhatsApp</a>.</p>
<p>In a letter to &#8220;significant social media intermediaries&#8221; &#8212; which New Delhi defines as social media firms with over 5 million registered users in India &#8212; on Wednesday, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asked the firms to share the names of their apps, websites, or services that will come under the scope of the new IT rules and the status of their compliance.</p>
<p>The letter, obtained by TechCrunch, also asks the firms to provide names and contact details of chief compliance officer, nodal contact person, and resident grievance officer that they have appointed in India as part of the compliance, and also asked for the physical address of the local office. The new rules mandate that firms have several officials in India to address on-ground concerns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The letter also implies that India doesn&#8217;t plan to give social media firms any extension on the deadline to comply with the new regulations. &#8220;The additional due diligence required from SSMI have come into effect today, at the conclusion of three additional months given to SSMIs,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are not considered as SSMI, please provide the reasons for the same including the registered users on each of the services provided by you,&#8221; the letter adds. &#8220;The government reserves the right to seek any additional information, as may be permitted within these Rules and the IT Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday,Â WhatsApp sued the Indian government challenging the second largest internet marketâs new regulations that it said could allow authorities to make peopleâs private messages âtraceable,â and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">conduct mass surveillance</a>.</p>

Founded last year by Jeth Soetoyo to make it easier for first-time investors to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, Pintu is registered under Bappebti and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics as a licensed cryptoassets broker.</p>
<p>A wave of interest in capital investing during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among millennials who want alternatives to keeping their money in low-yield savings accounts, spurred interest in investment apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indonesian-robo-advisor-app-bibit-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Bibit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/">Pluang</a>, which have all recently raised funding.</p>
<p>Many first-time investors are also looking at cryptocurrencies. According to Pintuâs internal estimates, last year Indonesia processed $10 billion USD in cryptoassets transactions, mostly through retail investors.</p>

<p>Pintu chief operating officer Andrew Adjiputro told TechCrunch in an email that many Indonesian retail traders see crypto as an alternative investment asset class, and that the majority of retail investors are aged 20 to 35 years old. But the company is starting to see more older investors as crypto gains popularity.</p>
<p>âBased on our internal survey, in terms of publicâs top of mind asset classes, we see crypto as a top three asset class in Indonesia, alongside gold and mutual funds,â he said.</p>
<p>Other Indonesian cryptocurrency exchanges include Indodax and Tokocrypto. When asked how Pintu differentiates, Adjiputro said it focuses on the mass market to reach mainly first-time crypto users, and its value proposition lies in its mobile-first app, easy user experience and educational materials developed by the company.</p>
<p>âFor most Indonesians, the concept of investing and trading is new, because historically penetration in these categories have been so low,â he explained. âSo what weâre seeing is also the opportunity to help Indonesians understand the concept of investing/trading and along the way leapfrog investments into other asset classes. What this means is that there is a large base of underserved first time investors that demand a simple and intuitive trading platform where they are handheld from the start to finish and also educated on the fundamentals of investing/trading on top of that of crypto.â</p>
<p>Pintuâs new funding will be used on marketing, hiring and product development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The handling of user data in China has become a delicate matter for foreign tech companies operating in the country. Apple&#8217;s move to store the data of its Chinese customers in servers managed by a Chinese state-owned cloud service has stoked controversy in the West over the years. A recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">investigation</a> found that the setup could give Beijing easy access to Apple&#8217;s user data in China, but Apple said it &#8220;never compromised the security&#8221; of its customers or their data.</p>
<p>Tesla, one of the few U.S. tech heavyweights that generate substantial revenues from China, is working out a similar data plan. The electric carmaker said it has established a data center in China to carry out the &#8220;localization of data storage,&#8221; with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company <a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/Kh8mMfpDQ?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment">announced</a> through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically.</p>
<p>Tesla is acting in response to <a href="http://www.moj.gov.cn/pub/sfbgw/zlk/202105/t20210512_392004.html">new requirements</a> drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that &#8220;personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what level of data access Chinese authorities have to Tesla&#8217;s Chinese customers. In the case of Apple, the phone maker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">said</a> it controlled the keys that protect the data of its Chinese users.</p>
<p>Tesla recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/">fell out of favor</a> with Chinese media and the public after a customer protested the carmaker&#8217;s faulted parts at an auto show in Shanghai, earning her widespread sympathy. Tesla also faces fierce competition from domestic rivals like Nio and Xpeng, which are investing heavily in world-class designs and autonomous driving technology.</p>
<p>The American firm clearly wants the government&#8217;s good graces in its second-largest market. It appeared a few days ago at an<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vuMo8hk7QNVGhRimQ5wYqA">Â industry symposium</a> along with Baidu, Alibaba, research institutions, and think tanks to discuss the new vehicle policy proposed by the country&#8217;s cybersecurity watchdog.</p>
<p>âImportant dataâ generated by vehicles as defined by the Chinese internet regulator include traffic conditions in military and government compounds; surveying and mapping data beyond what the government discloses; status of electric charging grids; face, voice, and car plate information; and any data deemed as affecting national security or public interest.</p>
<p>The rules also urge car service providers not to track users by default, as well as inform users of the kinds of data being collected and the reasons as to why. If gathered, information should be anonymized and stored for only &#8220;a minimum period of time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more people than ever before going online to pay for things and pay each other, startups that are building the infrastructure that enables these actions continue to get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://paysend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paysend</a>, a fintech that has built a mobile-based payments platform &#8212; which currently offers international money transfers, global accounts, and business banking and e-commerce for SMBs &#8212; has picked up some money of its own. The London-based startup has closed a round of $125 million, a sizable Series B that the company&#8217;s CEO and founder Ronnie Millar said it will be using both to continue expanding its business geographically, to hire more people, and to continue building more fintech products.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by One Peak, with Infravia Growth Capital, HermÃ¨s GPE, previous backer Plug and Play and others participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Millar said Paysend is not disclosing valuation today but described it as a &#8220;substantial kick-up&#8221; and &#8220;a great step forward in our position ahead towards unicorn status.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I understand though, the company was valued at $160 million in its previous round, and its core metrics have gone up 4.5x. Doing some basic math, that gives the company a valuation of around $720 million, a figure that a source close to the company did not dispute when I brought it up.</p>
<p>Something that likely caught investors&#8217; attention is that Paysend has grown to the size it is today &#8212; it currently has 3.7 million consumer customers using its transfer and global account services, and 17,000 small business customers, and is now available in 110 receiving countries &#8212; in less than four years and $50 million in funding.</p>
<p>There are a couple of notable things about Paysend and its position in the market today, the first being the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>On paper, Paysend appears to offer many of the same features as a number of other fintechs: money transfer, global payments, and banking and e-commerce services for smaller businesses are all well-trodden areas with companies like Wise (formerly &#8220;TransferWise&#8221;), PayPal, Revolut, and so many others also providing either all or a range of these services.</p>
<p>To me, the fact that any one company relatively off the tech radar can grow to the size that it has speaks about the opportunity in the market for more than just one or two, or maybe five, dominant players.</p>
<p>Considering just remittances alone, the WorldBank in April said that flows just to low- and middle-income countries stood at <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/05/12/defying-predictions-remittance-flows-remain-strong-during-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$540 million last year</a>, and that was with a dip in volumes due to Covid-19. The cut that companies like Paysend make in providing services to send money is, of course, significantly smaller than that &#8212; business models include commission charges, flat fees, or making money off exchange rates; Paysend charges Â£1 per transfer in the UK. More than that, the overall volumes, and the opportunity to build more services for that audience, are why we&#8217;re likely to see a lot of companies with ambitions to serve that market.</p>
<p>Services for small businesses, and tapping into the opportunity to provide more e-commerce tools at a time when more business and sales are being conducted online, is similarly crowded but also massive.</p>
<p>Indeed, Paysend points out that there is still a lot of growing and evolution left to do. Citing McKinsey research, it notes that some 70% of international payments are currently still cash-to-cash, with fees averaging up to 5.2% per transaction, and timing taking up to an hour each for sender and recipient to complete transfers. (Paysend claims it can cut fees by up to 60%.)</p>
<p>This brings us to the second point about Paysend: how it&#8217;s built its services. The fintech world today leans heavily on APIs: companies that are knitting together a lot of complexity and packaging it into APIs that are used by others who bypass needing to build those tools themselves, instead integrating them and adding better user experience and responsive personalization around them. notes, is a little different from these, with a vertically integrated approach, having itself built everything that it uses from the ground up.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Millar &#8212; a Scottish repeat entrepreneur (his previous company Paywizard, which has rebranded to Singula, is a specialist in pay-TV subscriber management) &#8212; notes that Paysend has built both its processing and acquiring facilities. &#8220;Because we have built everything in-house it lets us see what the consumer needs and uses, and to deliver that at a lower cost basis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more cost efficient and we pass that savings on to the consumer. We designed our technology to be in complete control of it. It&#8217;s the most profitable approach, too, from a business point of view.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That being said, he confirmed that Paysend itself is not yet profitable, but investors believe it&#8217;s making the right moves to get there. And, to be clear, Paysend actually does partner with other companies, including those providing APIs, to improve its services. In April, <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/paysend-and-plaid-working-together-to-make-international-money-transfers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plaid and Paysend announced</a> they were working together to power open banking transfers, reducing the time to initiate and receive money.</p>
<p>âWe are excited by Paysendâs enormous growth potential in a massive market, benefiting from a rapid acceleration in the adoption of digital payments,&#8221; said Humbert de Liedekerke, managing partner at One Peak Partners, in a statement. &#8220;In particular, we are seeing strong opportunities as Paysend moves beyond consumers to serve business customers and expands its international footprint to address a growing need for fast, easy and low-cost cross border digital payments. Paysend has built an exceptional payment platform by maintaining an unwavering focus on its customers and constantly innovating. We are excited to back the entire Paysend team in their next phase of explosive growth.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As of now, one fo the UKâs biggest and most active tech VCs has a new partner. Principal Colin Hanna has spearheaded several of Baldertonâs deals in the past couple of years, and has now been appointed a Partner. But thereâs a twist to this plot. He will be officially based in Berlin (where heâs lived since 2019), thus giving the VC a more powerful reach, being based, as it is, solely in London.</p>
<p>Hanna said: âHaving been with Balderton for five years, I am humbled to now call my mentors my Partners. I look forward to strengthening Baldertonâs unique approach from Berlin as we engineer serendipity for European founders with planet-scale ambition.â</p>
<p>Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner of Balderton commented: &#8220;We are delighted to announce Colin&#8217;s promotion to Partner. Since he joined Balderton in 2016, Colin has had a significant impact on both Balderton and our portfolioâ¦ Colin has strengthened our position in DACH by establishing our permanent presence in Berlin and bringing in Shikha Ahluwalia, whom we are delighted to have. In addition, he was instrumental in the definition of the Balderton Sustainable Future Goals. We have no doubt Colin will be highly successful in his new role.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The story does not end there, however. Joining him will be tech entrepreneur and founder Shikha Ahluwalia as an Associate covering the DACH region.</p>
<p>co-founded SBL, the D2C womenâs fashion e-commerce company in India. Prior to that she was had a tech advisory boutique, and was previously with JP Morganâs Investment Banking Division in London.</p>
<p>Balderton has 10 current investments across DACH including Contentful, Infarm, SOPHiA Genetics, McMakler, Demodesk, and vivenu.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia commented: âOver the past few years, I have seen the DACH start-up ecosystem evolve rapidly. We at Balderton believe the next European giant will be a technology company and know that the DACH ecosystem plays a significant role in helping form category-leading technology companies. As a former founder myself, I have first-hand experience with the unique challenges of running young businesses. I am excited to contribute and support founders on their own journey as part of Balderton Capital.â</p>
<p>Speaking to me over an interview Hanna said: âShikhaâs hiring deepens our commitment to the local Berlin ecosystem and to the DACH region more broadly. We have been actively supporting Founders in Germany for more than a decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>After spending his childhood in Jakarta and Hong Kong, and picking up a degree in Political Economy, Hanna has carved out a career in venture investing &#8211; at Balderton since July 4, 2016 &#8211; looking at it through the prism on the rise of urban living, grassroots-driven technologies like open source and crypto, and the political ramifications of technology.</p>
<p>He sits on the Board of companies like e-bikes startup VanMoof, Finoa (a crypto custodian), Rahko (quantum computing drug discovery, and helped lead on investments into Traefik and Luno and Vivenu).</p>
<p>One these you might pick up from all those is that they err towards the âpurpose-drivenâ side of the equation.</p>
<p>He told me: &#8220;I believe the next generation of Founders, particularly in Europe, care more about just their bank accounts and want to build companies that generate impact and are not afraid to take a view on how they want the world to change. Measuring this is a challenge and something we are trying to do with our SFGs at Balderton which I helped spearhead. I believe that when companies like Coinbase and others go &#8220;apolitical&#8221; they commit themselves to defending the structural status quo rather than becoming agents of deliberate change.â</p>
<p>&#8220;My point about purpose driven companies is that when I think when employees want to work with companies believe in their values and you try to tell them those aren&#8217;t important, that could be viewed as political. I don&#8217;t think we should be we should be muffling the employees.â</p>
<p>Does he think Coinbase, and also recent more recently Basecamp / 37 Signals were wrong to so-called âdepoliticize&#8217; their businesses?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, I think every CEO is free to run their company how they see fit. But I think that that poses challenges for them on the talent side. I understand, as an American, how charged and how destructive the political climate became, and so I can really understand and empathize why certain choices were made at that time, because you get to a point where that where the conversation becomes toxicâ¦ I hope that the steps that they&#8217;ve taken, don&#8217;t strangle dialogue and conversation that&#8217;s constructive about how we want to make an impact and change the world, either as individuals or with the companies we work for,â he said.</p>
<p>Hanna also told me that he think VCs should be wary that the shift to remote will make it easier to invest more widely. âYou have to more background checks on founders now, and things like that. But is it a &#8216;little bit&#8217; more dangerous or is it &#8216;50% more dangerous&#8217; the fact that people aren&#8217;t meeting up in person?â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.matera.eu">Matera</a> has announced that is has raised a new $43 million (â¬35 million) Series B funding round led by Mubadala Capital. Bpifrance, Burda Principal Investments as well as existing investors Index Ventures and Samaipata are also participating.</p>
<p>The company is building a vertical SaaS for residential property management. In France, co-owners of the common space of a building can decide to ditch the company that handles residential building management for them and do it themselves.</p>
<p>And it could work particularly well for small buildings with 10 or 15 apartments. There are fewer relationships to manage, fewer bills to pay and less work in general.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When co-owners vote to switch to Matera, they get a web-based platform and a mobile app to view information and see all the contracts with various partners â think about elevator maintenance, heating maintenance, water, electricity, etc.</p>
<p>If something feels odd, you can contact a residential building expert on Matera. They can help you make sure you comply with the law and file paperwork for you.</p>
<p>The platform also guides you when it comes to leading an annual co-owner meeting. It can help you communicate with all co-owners with a forum, an on-demand letter service, etc. Essentially, all co-owners get their own login information.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the company launched a new service to tackle a bigger chunk of the building management stack. Matera clients can now decide to manage their buildingâs bank account through the platform. This way, co-owners pay directly on Matera and everybody can keep track of the budget over time.</p>
<p>With todayâs funding round, Matera plans to expand to Germany. The startup has been growing rapidly as it now manages 3,000 buildings, representing a 300% year-over-year jump. Overall, 60,000 owners use Matera.</p>
<p>âThis past year gave us the opportunity to prove the relevance of our model and our value proposition, showing why Matera is the perfect solution for our times. The crisis sped up the digital transformation of our market, while at the same time increasing the attachment to our homes and buildings,â co-founder and CEO RaphaÃ«l di Meglio said in a statement. âOur clients wanted more transparency, and to save money and thatâs exactly what we can bring them.â</p>
<p>By the end of 2021, Matera wants to manage 6,000 buildings including 40 in Germany. The company currently has 200 employees and plans to hire another 50 employees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has sued the Indian government challenging the second largest internet market&#8217;s new regulations that could allow authorities to make peopleâs private messages âtraceable,â and conduct mass surveillance.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp has sued the Indian government challenging the second largest internet market&#8217;s new regulations that could allow authorities to make peopleâs private messages âtraceable,â and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">conduct mass surveillance</a>.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned instant messaging service, which identifies India as its biggest market by users, said it filed the lawsuit in the High Court of Delhi on Wednesday. It said New Delhi&#8217;s âtraceabilityâ requirement &#8212; which would require WhatsApp to help New Delhi identify the originator of a particular message &#8212;Â violated citizensâ constitutional right to privacy.</p>
<p>âCivil society and technical experts around the world have consistently argued that a requirement to &#8216;trace&#8217; private messages would break end-to-end encryption and lead to real abuse. WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy of peopleâs personal messages and we will continue to do all we can within the laws of India to do so,â WhatsApp said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India first proposed WhatsApp to make software changes to make the originator of a message traceable in 2018. The suggestion came at a time when WhatsApp was grappling with containing spread of false information in India, where circulation of such information had resulted in multiple real-life casualties.</p>
<p>But its suggestion didnât <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">become the law until this year</a>. Traceability requirement is part of New Delhi&#8217;s sweeping IT rules that also require social media firms to appoint several officers in India to address on-ground concerns, and also gives authorities greater power over taking down posts it deems offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology and privacy experts have determined that traceability breaks end-to-end encryption and would severely undermine the privacy of billions of people who communicate digitally. Reasonable and proportionate regulations for an increasingly digital world are important, but eroding privacy for everyone, violating human rights, and putting innocent people at risk is not the solution. WhatsApp is committed to doing all we can to protect the privacy of peopleâs personal messages, which is why we join others in opposing traceability,&#8221; the messaging platform, used by over 2 billion users worldwide, <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian government gave large social media firms three months to comply with the new IT rules.Â Wednesday is the deadline for firms, including Facebook, to comply with the new regulation. Failure to do so may take away the safe harbor protection tech companies enjoy.</p>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s move on Wednesday is highly unusual. Facebook has engaged closely with New Delhi over the years &#8212; to a point where allegations were made that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-addresses-political-controversy-in-india-monetization-opportunities-startup-investments/">didn&#8217;t take action on some politicians&#8217; objectionable posts</a>Â because it feared it would hurt its business in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have never seen a company sue the Indian government for asking for information.&#8221; said Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at consultancy firm Convergence Catalyst.Â &#8220;We have seen companies push back, but they have never explored legal options in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>WhatsApp is alreadyÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">fighting a legal case filed by the India government</a>, in the same aforementioned court, over its new privacy policy as New Delhi tries to get the Facebook-owned firm to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/india-tells-whatsapp-to-withdraw-its-new-policy-terms/">withdraw the new terms</a>.</p>
<p>Last year India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned over 200 Chinese apps</a>, including TikTok, which at the time of blocking identified India as its biggest overseas market. India said it was banning the apps because they posed threat toÂ national security and defence of India.</p>
<p>None of the Chinese firms sued the Indian government, with at least two telling TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity that it&#8217;s nearly impossible to win a court case in India against the government when the national security issue has been raised.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much so, that you are going to have a hard time even finding a lawyer who represents you,&#8221; an Indian official added.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited similar national concerns when he unveiled the revised IT rules in February this year.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between American technology giants and the Indian government over the past few months. Earlier this year,Â Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>Last month, the Indian government ordered Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to take down posts that were critical of Modi&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Last week,Â New Delhi objected to Twitterâs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politiciansâ tweets as manipulated media</a>. Earlier this week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to âserve a notice.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi, one of China&#8217;s high-profile tech firms that fell in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, has been removed from a U.S. government blacklist that designated it as a Communist Chinese Military Company.</p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has vacated the Department of Defence&#8217;s designation of Xiaomi as a CCMC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/">in January</a>, a <a href="file:///Users/ritaliao/Downloads/2021.05.25_-_ECF_37_-_ORDER_vacating_Xiaomi_Corporation_s_CCMC_designation_and_remanding_the_matter_to_the_agency_See.pdf">document</a> filed on May 25 shows.</p>
<p>In February, Xiaomi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/xiaomi-sues-the-us-government-over-blacklisting/">sued</a> the U.S. government over its inclusion in the military blacklist. In March, the D.C. court granted Xiaomi a <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22367849/xiaomi_v_us_dept_of_defense.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> against the DoD designation, which would have forbidden all U.S. persons from purchasing or possessing Xiaomiâs securities, saying the decision was &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221; The ruling was made to prevent &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; to the Chinese phone maker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xiaomi has this to say about getting off the blacklist:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Company is grateful for the trust and support of its global users, partners, employees and shareholders. The Company reiterates that it is an open, transparent, publicly traded, independently operated and managed corporation. The Company will continue to provide reliable consumer electronics products and services to users, and to relentlessly build amazing products with honest prices to let everyone in the world enjoy a better life through innovative technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s domestic competitor Huawei is still struggling with its inclusion in the U.S. trade blacklist, which bans it from accessing critical U.S. technologies and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/huawei-iot-strategy/">crippled its smartphone sales</a> around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are backing Koo, an Indian alternative to Twitter, with large size checks at a time when tension is brewing between the American social network and New Delhi.</p>
<p>The Indian startup said on Wednesday it has raised $30 million in a financing round led by Tiger Global Management. Mirae Asset, IIFL&#8217;s venture capital fund and existing investors 3one4 Capital, Blume Ventures, and Accel also participated in the round, which valued the Bangalore-based startup at over $100 million, up from about $25 million in February.</p>
<p>Like Twitter, <a href="http://kooapp.com">Koo app</a> allows users to publish posts in English and half a dozen Indian languages. Its interface, logo, and social sharing mechanism are strikingly similar to those of Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app has gained popularity in India in recent months following flare-ups between Twitter and the Indian government after the San Francisco-headquartered firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year.</p>
<p>(The Indian government, like Singapore&#8217;s, also ordered Twitter and Facebook last week to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">take down posts</a> that identified a new variant of the coronavirus as &#8220;Indian variant&#8221;. Also last week, New Delhi objected to Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politicians&#8217; tweets as manipulated media</a>. Earlier this week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to &#8220;serve a notice.&#8221;)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157509" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157509 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=768,673 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=680,596 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157509" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshots of Koo app</p></div></p>
<p>Several prominent government officials &#8212; including Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, Union Cabinet Minister Smriti Irani, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad &#8212; and many celebrities have signed up on Koo in recent months and urged their followers to follow suit.</p>
<p>Though the app &#8212; co-founded by Aprameya Radhakrishna (who also co-founded TaxiForSure, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold to local giant Ola</a>; and is a prolific angel investor) &#8212; has won the trust of investors, it is yet to gain ground.</p>
<p>Koo app, which was launched last year, had fewer than 6.5 million monthly active users in India in April, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>The startup says it aims to build a social network for the entire nation and not just a fraction of it. Twitter remains largely popular among users in urban cities in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have aggressive plans to grow into one of the worldâs largest social media platforms in the next few years. Every Indian is cheering for us to get there soon,&#8221; said Radhakrishna in a statement.</p>
<p>Koo, whose initial traction has been <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/how-koo-became-a-right-wing-darling-in-india/">credited to Hindu nationalists</a>, is currently one of the handful of social networks that has complied with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">Indiaâs new IT rules</a> that grant New Delhi greater power to take down posts it deems offensive.</p>
<p>The revised IT rules, announced in February, would put an end to âdouble standardsâ by making platforms more accountable to the local law, government officials said then. Failure to comply might bereft social networks of safe harbor protection they enjoy.</p>
<p>The deadline to comply with the new rules expires on Wednesday. Facebook, which identifies India as its largest market, said it âaims to complyâ with the new rules, while Google said in a statement that it ârespectsâ Indiaâs legislative process.</p>
<p>Koo is the latest investment from Tiger Global in India this year. The hedge fund, which has backed over 20 Indian unicorns, has emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">most prolific investor in Indian startups in recent months</a>, winning founders with its pace of investment, check size, and favorable terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart Eye, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, has acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for $73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which spun out of the MIT Media Lab in 2009, has developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, which Smart Eye is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies&#8217; founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems â tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness â and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging &#8220;interior sensing&#8221; market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="http://corp.smarteye.se/en/press/press-releases/press-detail/?slug=smart-eye-enters-into-an-agreement-to-acquire-affectiva-and-intends-to-raise-equity-in-a-directed-share-issue">terms of the deal</a>, $67.5 million will be paid with 2,354,668 new Smart Eye shares, of which 2,015,626 are to be issued upon closing of the transaction. The remaining 339,042 Smart Eye shares will be issued within two years of closing. About $6 million will be paid in cash once the deal closes in June 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Affectiva and Smart Eye were competitors. A meeting at the technology trade show CES in 2020 put the two companies on a path to merge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin and I realized like, wow, we are on a path to compete with each other â and wouldn&#8217;t it be so much better if we joined forces?&#8221; Affective co-founder and CEO Dr. Rana el Kaliouby said in an interview Tuesday. &#8220;By joining forces, we kind of check all the boxes for what the OEMs are looking for with interior sensing, we leapfrog the competition and we have an opportunity to do this better and faster than we could have done it on our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boston-based Affectiva brings its emotion-detection software to the deal, which will allow Smart Eye to offer its existing automotive partners a variety of products. Smart Eye helps Affectiva move beyond the development and prototype work and into production contracts. Smart Eye has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM. Smart Eye, which has offices in Gothenburg, Detroit, Tokyo and Chongqing, China, also has a division that provides research organizations such as NASA with high-fidelity eye tracking systems for human factors research.</p>
<p>Smart Eye founder and CEO Martin Krantz said that European manufacturers building luxury and premium vehicles led the charge for driver monitoring systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the same pattern repeating itself now for interior sensing,&#8221; Krantz said. &#8220;I think a large part of the early contracts will be European premium OEMs such as Mercedes, BMW, Audi, JLR, Porsche.&#8221; Krantz added that there are a number of other premium brands it will target in other regions, including Cadillac and Lexus.</p>
<p>The opportunity will initially be in passenger vehicles driven by humans and will eventually expand as greater levels of automated driving enter the market.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which employs 100 people at its offices in Boston and Cairo, also has another business unit that applies its emotio-detection software to media analytics. This division, which will be part of the deal and will operate separately, is profitable, Kaliouby said, noting the software is used by 70% of the world&#8217;s largest advertisers to measure and understand emotional responses to media content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The social video tool <a href="http://promo.com/">Promo.com</a> just raised $16 million in a Series B round led by Getty Images, the company synonymous with stock imagery.</p>
<p>Brands, creators or whoever else might need some quick and dirty video content can search Promo.com for what they need, just like they would use a stock photography service. Getty offers its own library of stock videos as well, but Promo.com provides both the video clips and the tools for non-editors to craft a basic edit with a little bit of customization.</p>
<p>Brands can select an existing professional video clip from a library, plug in their own message and add a logo or custom audio. All that&#8217;s left is downloading the customized video and whisking it off to their social channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank, one of the largest banks in Israel, also participated in the Series B round through debt financing. Promo.com&#8217;s existing &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; with Getty Images will deepen as part of the deal, giving the former company access to the latter&#8217;s expansive existing pool of video clips.</p>

<p>Of course, Promo.com isn&#8217;t the only show in town. Video creation platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/biteable-raises-7-million-series-a-for-its-template-based-online-video-builder/">Biteable</a> raised $7 million of its own in December, and similarly allows companies to make bright, bite-sized video content for social. The super streamlined<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/"> graphic design platform Canva</a> also supports video editing with its own library of stock images. Vimeo offers its own video template service too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/vimeos-new-app-helps-small-businesses-create-professional-social-videos/">known as Vimeo Create</a>, which grew out of the company&#8217;s acquisition of the AI-powered video editor Magisto.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunchâs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Daily Crunch for May 25, 2021. Whether you are a developer, a startup fanatic or merely someone with wanderlust, we have something for everyone today. Well, except for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">disappointed investors in Lordstown Motors</a>. They are stuck holding the bag today after the American electric vehicle company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">announced a pretty awful set of earnings</a>.</p>
<p>But for the rest of us, thereâs quite a lot of tech and startup news to enjoy. Letâs get to it! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/expensify-ec1-expansion/"><strong>TechCrunchâs deep dive into Expensify continues</strong></a>: Ahead of its IPO, TechCrunch is digging into Expensifyâs growth from startup to unicorn, with our latest entry discussing how the company shed its âSilicon Valley arroganceâ to go global.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/"><strong>$300M for vertical farming</strong></a>: Startups shaking up the agricultural world is no longer a surprising idea, but the recent Bowery Farms round did make us sit up and take note. The company is now worth $2.3 billion, and its âvertically farmed produce is now available in 850 grocery stores.â</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/"><strong>Venture capitalâs global march continues</strong></a>: New data from Africa indicates that the continentâs historically lagging venture capital results are making up for lost time. <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> reports that VC activity in Africa could reach âbetween $2.25 billion and $2.8 billionâ this year. That would be a new record.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/"><strong>$26M for Airbyte, which is working to better connect data to where itâs needed</strong></a>: Having data is one thing, but startups are starting to get into not only <em>storing</em> data, but also how it gets ingested (Monte Carlo is working on that), and making sure itâs moved to where itâs needed. Thatâs where Airbyte comes in. And the companyâs latest round comes just months after it raised a $5.6 million seed deal.</p>
<p>We asked our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> what induced him to cover the round. Hereâs what he had to say: âWhat attracted me to this round was the fact that the founders were using open source to drive the development of a community of users, then worrying about monetization down the road.â</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/twilio-invests-in-adaptive-communications-platform-hyro/"><strong>Twilio opens wallet for Hyro</strong></a>: Whenever a company well known for leading a sea change in the tech world cuts a check, we tend to take notice. Recall when Salesforce was hip; its investments made waves. Today, Twilio is the BigCo in question, and Hyro the startup it is backing.</p>
<p>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, Hyro âcalls itself an adaptive communications platform, which essentially means that customers use plug-and-play tools to get information to end users in a conversational way.â Very cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatnot-raises-50m-to-let-people-sell-pokemon-cards-funko-pops-and-more-via-livestream/"><strong>$50M for Whatnot, which wants to livestream e-commerce</strong></a>: Look, if you are not into buying things, Whatnot is not going to be your jam. But if you are, it has a neat take on e-commerce that is popular around the world, but has yet to take off in North America. Notably this round comes mere months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Whatnot raised $20 million</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/blockchain-startup-propy-plans-first-ever-auction-of-a-real-apartment-as-a-collectible-nft/"><strong>Something something real-life NFTs?</strong></a>: What happens when you cross a startup that wants to bring blockchain to the real estate market and NFTs? You get this: Propy. The startup in question, is âauctioning a real apartment as an NFT.â I donât get it! But maybe thatâs the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/security-startup-tessian-which-uses-ai-to-fight-social-engineering-trousers-65m/"><strong>$65M for social engineering-fighting Tessian</strong></a>: U.K.-based Tessian is a cybersecurity company, which means that of course it raised a huge new round. The cybersecurity market is hotter than all heck given <em>waves arms around at all the breaches lately.</em> But what makes Tessian neat is that it is taking on the human side of things by âflagging problematic [usage] patterns [that] could signify risky stuff is happening.â</p>
<h2>Brian Chesky describes a faster, nimbler post-pandemic Airbnb</h2>
<p>Managing Editor Jordan Crook interviewed Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the worldâs biggest hospitality startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say itâs like driving a car. You canât go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes and expect nothing really bad to happen.</p>
<p>âNow imagine youâre going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today was Microsoftâs Build conference, the second time that the annual Redmond developer confab took place virtually. But before we get into that, a short note on autonomous deliveries.</p>
<p>Getting stuff brought to your house without human power is a long-running technology dream. Remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/a-first-look-at-amazons-new-delivery-drone/">those Amazon drones</a> that everyone got super stoked about and then we never heard from again (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/amazon-asks-faa-for-permission-to-test-its-delivery-drones/">not once, but twice</a>)? Or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/postmates-robot-serve/">cute Postmates robot</a>? Well, thereâs another set of players in the space, namely JD.com and Meituan. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/">the latest</a> on their self-driving delivery efforts.</p>
<p>Back to Build â oh boy was there a lot of news.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles bound for North American customers are being built without radar, fulfilling a desire by CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features.</p>
<p>Like many of Tesla&#8217;s moves, the decision to stop using the sensor runs counter to the industry standard. For now, the radar-less cars will only be sold in North America. Tesla didn&#8217;t state when or if it might remove the radar sensor in vehicles built for Chinese and European customers. Automakers typically use a combination of radar and cameras â and even lidar â to provide the sensing required to deliver advanced driver assistance system features like adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of a car to surrounding traffic, as well as lane keeping and automatic lane changes.</p>
<p>Musk has touted the potential of its branded &#8220;Tesla Vision&#8221; system, which only uses cameras and so-called neural net processing to detect and understand what is happening in the environment surrounding the vehicle and then respond appropriately. Neural nets are a form of machine learning that work similarly to how humans learn. It is a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence algorithm that allows a computer to learn by using a series of connected networks to identify patterns in data. Many companies developing self-driving tech use deep neural networks to handle specific problems. But they wall off the deep nets and use rules-based algorithms to tie into the broader system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380796939151704071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company detailed the transition away from radar in an <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision">update on its website</a>, noting that the switch started this month. This camera-plus-machine learning (specifically neural net processing) approach has been dubbed Tesla Vision and will be used in its standard Autopilot advanced driver assistance system as well as in its $10,000 upgraded feature that has been branded Full Self-Driving or FSD. Tesla vehicles are not self-driving and require a human driver to remain engaged.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles that are delivered without radar will initially limit Autopilot, including the lane-keeping feature known as Autosteer. For a short period of time, Autosteer will be limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph and a longer minimum following distance. The system&#8217;s emergency lane departure avoidance feature and smart summon, which allows the driver to summon its vehicle in a parking lot, may be disabled at delivery, Tesla said.</p>
<p>The company plans to restore these features through wireless software updates in the coming weeks. Tesla didn&#8217;t provide a specific timeline. All other available Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features will be active at delivery, depending on order configuration, the company said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newÂ Model S and Model X vehicles as well as every model built for markets outside of North America, will continue to be equipped with radar and will have radar-supported Autopilot functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Model 3 and Model Y are our higher volume vehicles,&#8221; Tesla noted in its frequently asked questions section. &#8220;Transitioning them to Tesla Vision first allows us to analyze a large volume of real-world data in a short amount of time, which ultimately speeds up the roll-out of features based on Tesla Vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors released its Q1 earnings yesterday, and the electric vehicle manufacturer is facing a few challenges.</p>
<p>Expenses were higher than expected, it plans to slash production by about 50%, and the company reported zero revenue and a net loss of $125 million. Oh, it also needs more capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;But thereâs more to the Lordstown mess than merely a single bad quarter,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm. &#8220;Lordstownâs earnings mess and the resulting dissonance with its own predictions are notable on their own, but they also point to what could be shifting sentiment regarding SPAC combinations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In light of the company&#8217;s lackluster earnings report (and a pending SEC investigation), Alex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">unpacks the company&#8217;s Q1</a>, &#8220;but donât think that weâre only singling out one company; others fit the bill, and more will in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Join TechCrunch reporter Ron Miller and Patrik Liu Tran, co-founder and CEO of automated real-time data validation and quality monitoring platform Validio, on Thursday, May 27 at 9 a.m. PDT/noon EDT for a Clubhouse chat about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/how-to-ensure-quality-in-the-era-of-big-data/">ensuring data quality in the era of Big Data</a>.</p>
<p>The world produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, but modern data infrastructure still lacks solutions for monitoring data quality and data validation.</p>
<p>Among other topics, they&#8217;ll discuss the build versus buy debate, how to better understand data failures, and why traditional methods for identifying data failures are no longer operational.</p>

<h2>How Expensify shed Silicon Valley arrogance to realize its global ambitions</h2>

<p>Expensify may be the most ambitious software company ever to mostly abandon the Bay Area as the center of its operations.</p>
<p>The startupâs history is tied to places representative of San Francisco: The founding team worked out of Peetâs Coffee on Mission Street for a few months, then crashed at a penthouse lounge near the 4th and King Caltrain station, followed by a tiny office and then a slightly bigger one in the Flatiron building near Market Street.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, Expensify still has an office a few blocks away on Kearny Street, but itâs no longer a San Francisco company or even a Silicon Valley firm. The company is truly global with employees across the world â and it did that before COVID-19 made remote working cool.</p>
<p>It makes sense thatÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">a company founded by internet pirates</a>Â would let its workforce live anywhere they please and however they want to. Yet, how does it manage to make it all work well enough to reach $100 million in annual revenue with just a tad more than 100 employees?</p>
<p>As I described inÂ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">Part 2 of this EC-1</a>, that staffing efficiency is partly due to its culture and who it hires. Itâs also because it has attracted top talent from across the world by giving them benefits like the option to work remotely all year as well as paying SF-level salaries even to those not based in the tech hub. Itâs also got annual fully paid month-long âworkcationsâ for every employee, their partner and kids.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Jordan Crook interviewed Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the worldâs biggest hospitality startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say itâs like driving a car. You canât go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen.</p>
<p>Now imagine youâre going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereâs latent demand for life insurance currently unaddressed by much of the financial services industry, and embedded finance can be the solution.</p>
<p>Itâs imperative for companies to consider product lines and partnerships to expand markets, create new revenue streams and provide added value to their customers.</p>
<p>Connecting consumers with products they need through channels they already know and trust is both a massive revenue opportunity and a social good, providing financial resilience to families at a time when they need it most.</p>

<p>Zeta Global raised north of $600 million in private capital in the form of both equity financing and debt, making it a unicorn worth understanding.</p>
<p>The gist is that Zeta ingests and crunches lots of data, helping its users market to their customers on a targeted basis throughout their individual buying lifecycles. In simpler terms, Zeta helps companies pitch customers in varied manners depending on their own characteristics.</p>
<p>You can imagine that, as the digital economy has grown, the sort of work Zeta Global supports has only expanded. So, has Zeta itself grown quickly? And does it have an attractive business profile? We want to know.</p>

<p>In 2016, more than 20 years after Amazonâs founding and 10 years since Shopify launched, it would have been easy to assume e-commerce penetration (the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online) would be over 50%.</p>
<p>But what we found was shocking: The U.S. was only approximately 8% penetrated â only 8% for arguably the most advanced economy in the world!</p>
<p>Despite e-commerce growth skyrocketing over the past year, the reality is the U.S. has still only reached an e-commerce penetration rate of around 17%. During the last 18 months, weâve closed the gap to South Korea and Chinaâs e-commerce penetration of more than 25%, but there is still much progress to be made.</p>
<p>Here are five key predictions for what this road to further penetration will hold.</p>

<p>Every company wants to be innovative, but innovation comes with its share of difficulties. One key challenge for early-stage companies that are disrupting a particular space or creating a new category is figuring out how to sell a unique product to customers who have never bought such a solution.</p>
<p>This is especially the case when a solution doesnât have many reference points and its significance may not be obvious.</p>
<p>Some buyers could use a walkthrough of the buying process. If you are building a singular product in a nascent market that necessitates forward-looking customers and want to drastically shorten sales cycles, create a buyerâs guide.</p>

<p>Pay attention to red flags when meeting with VCs: If they cancel late or leave you waiting, itâs a sign, just like being asked generic questions that demonstrate little or no understanding of the proposition. If they critique you or your business, thatâs fine (obviously), but make sure you find out whatâs behind their assertions to judge how well informed they are.</p>
<p>If youâre going to face these people each month and debate the direction of your business, the least you can expect is a robust argument outlining precisely why you may not have all the right answers.</p>
<p>If you fail to spot the warning signs, youâll live to regret it. But do your due diligence and work constructively with them and, together, you might actually build a sustainable future.</p>

<p>Netflix has two CEOs: Co-founder Reed Hastings oversees the streaming side of the company, while Ted Sarandos guides Netflixâs content.</p>
<p>Warby Parker has co-CEOs as well â its co-founders went to college together. Other companies like the tech giant Oracle and luggage maker Away have shifted from having co-CEOs in recent years, sparking a wave of headlines suggesting that the model is broken.</p>
<p>While there isnât a lot of research on companies with multiple CEOs, the data is more promising than the headlines would suggest. One study on public companies with co-CEOs revealed that the average tenure for co-CEOs, about 4.5 years, was comparable to solitary CEOs, âsuggesting that this arrangement is more stable than previously believed.â</p>
<p>Furthermore, itâs impossible to be in two places at once or clone yourself. With co-CEOs, you can effectively do just that.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For societies with long histories of protecting children with laws and regulations, isnât it surprising that nothing is being done to similarly shield them from the various and proven dangers of social media? We need to institute the same kinds of age limits and protections for technology and web use as weâve done for decades in almost every other sphere.</p>
<p>Think about it. We donât let young people drive, drink, smoke, get married, join the Army, get a tattoo or vote until we feel theyâre old enough to handle it.</p>
<p>But we put some of the most powerful technologies ever known to humankind in the hands of a 13-year-old, and then stand back in amazement when <a href="https://bit.ly/3teWOmL">online bullying</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/2OKteq9">body dysmorphia</a> issues go off the charts, when <a href="https://bit.ly/2PYU8Lw">self-harm</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/3sdAdpf">suicide rates</a> explode, when <a href="https://bbc.in/2RvvNgO">rape culture</a> is inculcated within a generation of young children steeped in porn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For parents with teenage kids, there is a growing, horrifying realization that over the last 10 years, weâve knowingly surrendered our offspring as guinea pigs to a grand scheme from tech companies focused on âmaximizing engagementâ for the sake of profit, with little or no regard to the consequences.</p>

			For societies with long histories of protecting children with laws and regulations, isnât it surprising that nothing is being done to similarly shield them from the various and proven dangers of social media?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We parents were so in love with cool tech ourselves that we thought it hip and helpful and safe to get Johnny and Jane a phone, with a similar disregard for what damage this could do to their self-esteem and healthy development. The first little emoji text we got from them seemed cute. We didnât realize it was going to turn into 100, then 500, then 1,000 â a day.</p>
<p>Forgive us, Lord, for we know not what we do.</p>
<p>Try putting <em>your </em>phone down. Go on, do it now. Count how long you can go before you canât resist picking it up again. How long did you manage? Not long, right? You (like most of us) are a tech addict, and youâre an adult, with willpower and the ability to defer gratification that <em>your</em> upbringing drilled into you. Imagine what itâs like for a 16-year-old whose whole life has been a never-ending carousel of instant gratification.</p>
<p>And weâre surprised when our kids look washed out in the morning before school, after a night of Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and a whole bunch of apps your kids know about but youâve never heard of. School that now involves even more time staring at a screen.</p>
<h2>A license to scroll</h2>
<p>Having an age limit â we suggest 18 for phones and social media â will begin the process of readjusting our relationship with technology toward our better angels. Just as we teach young people to drive a car with driving lessons, classwork, a highway code guide and a test, letâs teach them how to use social media in a way that wonât harm them. Letâs introduce a âsocial media user licenseâ that requires passing a test and can be revoked if they donât follow the rules of the âinformation superhighway.â</p>
<p>Some people think social media is now so pervasive that itâs impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. But we disagree. In fact, we feel that a fatalistic acceptance of whatâs going on is morally unconscionable. Remember, all it takes for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing.</p>
<p>Weâve proved we can introduce rules and regulations to ensure the wise use of powerful technologies. Weâve done it before, with the aforementioned cars, with radiography and nuclear energy â in fact, with all dual-purpose technologies weâve created. Whatâs different about social media? Indeed, in some countries, legislation is beginning to emerge. The U.K., as an example, recently introduced proposed laws that would fine, or even shut down, social media platforms that fail to protect children from harm online.</p>
<p>Some people think that even if we wanted to put age limits in place we couldnât enforce them, logistically. Of course we could â with the biometric security systems now commonplace on our phones (fingerprint readers, facial recognition, etc.) and with the algorithms that routinely customize feeds for billions of active users per day, or with any variety of existing technical solutions. It is simply a question of having the will. Then the way will emerge.</p>
<h2>Keeping a good from becoming evil</h2>
<p>We donât want to ban social media. When used responsibly, itâs a wonderful thing. Particularly now, during the pandemic, social media has been a lifeline against isolation and loneliness. Who can even imagine how much worse sheltering in place and quarantine would have been without technology that allowed us to connect with each other at the exact time we were forced apart? In just a matter of weeks, we simultaneously became more separated â physically â and connected â digitally â than ever before in history.</p>
<p>But social media has grown so vast and so powerful that weâre now past the point where we can continue to justify naÃ¯vetÃ© and youthful exuberance. Itâs time to admit that the inventors, company leaders and consumers â yes, us, too â of these new technologies all know what we are doing. And worse, what weâre doing to our childrenâs minds.</p>
<p>The final objection to our argument is that, even if there were an age limit in place, kids would find a way around it. This is obviously true. Some kids would find a way to access the tech and apps they see adults using, just as some kids drink and smoke before theyâre of the legal age. But if we believed that because some people break laws, thereâs no point in having them, anarchy would await. Imperfect compliance with the law is no argument for its absence.</p>
<p>Young people are not mature enough to be exposed to the bottomless scroll of FOMO, YOLO, trolling, abuse, lunacy and unadulterated filth that is just another day on social media. Thereâs so much evidence of the harm that is being done to kids by it, if you care to look. San Diego State University professor of psychology Jean Twengeâs â<a href="https://amzn.to/2QjplsL">iGen</a>â has a lot of the details &#8212; if you dare to look.</p>
<p>Itâs a parental instinct to protect your children, so letâs act now and set an age limit to spare them from social mediaâs dark side until theyâre mature enough to make responsible choices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In all likelihood, you do not currently associate Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, essayist and cultural critic, with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Serial entrepreneurs Brad Feld and Dave Jilk &#8212; whose friendship dates back to their college days at MIT &#8212; think that you should. Indeed, in the foreword of their new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Weekly-Nietzsche-Book-Disruptors-ebook/dp/B0932BPN7N/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+Entrepreneur%E2%80%99s+Weekly+Nietzsche%3A+A+Book+for+Disruptor&amp;qid=1621968857&amp;sr=8-1">&#8220;The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Weekly Nietzsche: A Book for Disruptors,&#8221;</a> another renowned entrepreneur (and former philosophy student), Reid Hoffman, explains how Nietzsche has inspired him to think differently throughout his own career, noting that, like disruptive entrepreneurs, Nietzsche &#8220;wanted to destroy the old mindsets that locked people into the past&#8221; and that his &#8220;fierce allegiance to the new&#8221; is as relevant today as it was 150 years ago.</p>
<p>If setting aside precious time to study Nietzsche sounds daunting, don&#8217;t worry; Feld and Jilk clearly get it. Their new book aims to make his writings accessible by focusing on their modern-day applicability, arranging their new book into 52 individual chapters &#8212; one for each week of the year &#8212; that each begin with a Nietzsche quote, then quickly delve into an oral history from a founder that ties back to his words.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yesterday, we asked Feld, who has written books about venture capital and startup communities in the past, about his newest project. Our exchange has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the impetus for this new book?â¨</strong></p>
<p>BF: This has been an on-again, off-again project with Dave, my first business partner, that began in 2013. We were spending the weekend in Keystone with our wives Amy and Maureen, which generally involved a lot of sitting around reading. Dave was reading &#8220;On Nietzsche&#8221; by Eric Steinhart. He read a quote to me and asked if I thought it sounded like an entrepreneur. Dave remembers me saying, âHmmm, it sure does.â Then we both went back to our books.</p>
<p>As Dave went deeper into studying Nietzsche, we kept talking about Nietzsche quotes that prompted discussions around aspects of entrepreneurship. I had gone deep into Stoicism and was in love with what Ryan Holiday was doing with his writing. His book &#8220;The Obstacle is the Way&#8221; had a huge impact on me.</p>
<p>By 2016, weâd started working on the book. When Ryan came out with &#8220;The Daily Stoic,&#8221; I suggested to Dave that we write a book using this format. After a little more work, we changed the approach a little, focusing on 52 quotes instead of 365, making our interpretation a little longer and adding a narrative from an entrepreneur to many of the quotes.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is an incredibly important and deeply misunderstood philosopher. Heâs the bridge between many things that came before him &#8212; beyond just philosophy &#8212; and many things that have come after him. Rather than state the answer, he provokes and encourages deep thought. In some ways, heâs the perfect philosophical mentor for an entrepreneur since you can apply his quotes in many different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Should this be placed in the business section or philosophy section of a bookstore?</strong></p>
<p>Well, according to Amazon, itâs already showing up in both! Dave and I wrote this to be an entrepreneurship book, as applied philosophy, but our fantasy is that philosophers who appreciate applications will like what we&#8217;ve done. We&#8217;re not experts on Nietzsche, nor do we pretend to be Nietzsche scholars. However, we have both read a lot of Nietzsche at this point, so weâve been deliberate in the quotes weâve chosen and how we interpret them.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurs are often too busy to be introspective, as you acknowledge in the book. How do you persuade them to make the time?â¨</strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is extremely challenging. It can be excruciatingly difficult. The highs are extraordinary. The lows are devastating. They come endlessly, with unexpected frequency.</p>
<p>If you donât know your âwhy,â being an entrepreneur is much more difficult than it needs to be. And, no one can tell you your âwhyâ â you have to discover it for yourself. As you grow, experience and age, your âwhyâ will change. You have to build the muscle to continually figure out your âwhy,â and figure out how it relates to what you are doing.</p>
<p>If you canât make the time for this, your journey as an entrepreneur will be much harder. When you face failure, it could be catastrophic or permanent rather than episodic. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, you wonât have the tools to figure out what to do to emerge stronger. While you may utter Nietzscheâs famous quote, âWhat does not kill me makes me stronger,&#8221; if you havenât thought about it, you are echoing a clichÃ© rather than incorporating an important concept into your way of being.</p>
<p>As for when [to find the time], we talk in the book about establishing cycles of âstepping backâ from the business. We discuss the notion of a âmetastrategyâ â what is your strategy for periodically revising your strategy? We also observe that when things are going well you are likely to plateau, making that an important &#8212; though counterintuitive &#8212; time to think hard.</p>
<p><strong>There are great oral histories throughout this book. How did you choose the storytellers and were they interviewed or did you email them questions, then edit down their responses?â¨</strong></p>
<p>We focused on experiences we were aware of and people we thought might have some connection to the quote. We used our primary network but didn&#8217;t try to be exhaustive. Some of the experiences we already knew about or had played a role in; others were new to us.</p>
<p>We emailed them the quote and a short guideline of what we were looking for. In most cases they wrote a nearly finished narrative; in a few cases, they gave us an outline and we filled it in, or we interviewed them and wrote the text ourselves. We wanted these narratives to feel like the entrepreneurs were talking to the reader in their own voices, and telling the stories that occurred to them, rather than making it an extension of the essay.</p>
<p>We especially love the [stories] where the narrative went in a different direction than our preceding essay, as it demonstrates the different ways Nietzsche can provoke thoughts from a simple quote.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the company's putative performance not being very good thus far today, I can't really find much bad about the company's valuation and implied multiples.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The spinout of video platform Vimeo from IAC <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iac-completes-spin-off-of-vimeo-301298522.html">completed today</a>, with the smaller company now trading as an independent entity under the ticker symbol VMEO.</p>
<p>If you missed the news that the internet conglomerate was spinning out the video service, don&#8217;t feel bad; it slipped past many radars. But with the company now trading, with our <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1837686/000183768621000004/vmeo-20210331.htm">access to its historical results</a>, and with our minds still enthralled by YouTube&#8217;s recent financial performance for Alphabet, it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to digest the company&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s answer a few questions: How quickly is Vimeo growing, how profitable is its business, and what can its spinout tell us about the larger video market? Recall that Kaltura, another video-powering company, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/as-procore-looks-to-nearly-double-its-private-valuation-the-ipo-market-shows-signs-of-life/">put its IPO back into the pipeline</a> after a small delay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">during what felt like a snap-freeze of the public markets</a> toward the start of the second quarter.</p>
<p>So the Vimeo debut could impact a possible forthcoming unicorn IPO. With that in mind, let&#8217;s dig into the numbers.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Vimeo&#8217;s revenues expanded from $57 million to $89.4 million, a gain of around 57%. That&#8217;s a solid pace of expansion, but not a surprising one considering how much digital video the world consumed during the COVID-19 pandemic, a fact that could have bolstered the company&#8217;s recent performance.</p>
<p>Over the same time frame, Vimeo&#8217;s gross profit grew from $38.6 million to $64.5 million, a gain of around 67%. As you can infer from faster-rising gross profit than revenue, Vimeo&#8217;s gross margins improved during Q1 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, from 68% to 72%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Turntable.fm&#8217;s founder Billy Chasen dusted off the old site and resurrected it for the pandemic age. I know I wasnât the only one feeling a wistful pang of nostalgia for the service during the long, dull days of sheltering in place. And while March 2020 would have been the best time for a relaunch, March 2021 was pretty good, too.</p>
<p>Today Chasen <a href="https://blog.turntable.fm/im-super-excited-to-announce-that-turntable-has-raised-7-5-b3f676b90c0d">announced that the service</a> has received a nice little slice of VC backing to help the service (which has thus far been invite/password only) take the next step. Andreessen Horowitz led the $7.5 million round a decade after the siteâs original launch. Funding had thus far been limited to fans through services like Patreon and Venmo. He notes that he will be turning off the service&#8217;s Patreon.</p>
<p>Chasen is staying mum as far as where the funding will go, stating, âAnd now with the new fundraising, we can continue to innovate and truly explore the cross section of social + music. I have a lot of ideas for the space and Iâm excited to start building them.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though, a blog post does note that the company is hiring engineers and designers. Understandable, though as someone <a href="https://turntable.fm/profile/604154afc2dbd9001be73f2d">whoâs been enjoying the site</a> these last few months, Iâm actually pretty surprised at how fresh the whole thing feels.</p>
<p>The team found a clever loophole around music rights in the form of YouTube videos, but perhaps a future version of the service will involve more direct music licensing or ties to popular apps like Spotify. A mobile app would be nice, if I&#8217;m just spitballing here.</p>
<p>Turntable.fm initially shut down back in 2013, stating at the time, âIt was a tough decision to make because we love this community so much, but the cost of running a music service has been too expensive and we canât outpace it with our efforts to monetize it and cut costs.&#8221; The service added that it was focusing on a live events platform instead.</p>
<p>Notably, Turntable.fm is not the only Turntable service looking to relaunch in 2021. Thereâs also Turntable.org (confusingly <a href="https://tt.fm/">located at TT.fm</a>), which is seeking fan funding, as well as looking toward a subscription fee. It announced that it had raised $500,000 in March and was aiming for an April launch for a mobile and desktop version. The site currently reads, âWeâre building a new version just as much fun as the original.â</p>
<p>The two Turntables are not affiliated.</p>
