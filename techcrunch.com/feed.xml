					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Three themes this weekend, my dear friends. The first is fear, namely <em>market concern. </em>The second is loathing, or my gut reaction to a particular bit of corporate news. And, finally, corporate gifting, a dive into a fascinating startup war. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Fear</h2>
<p>DocuSign took a gut punch this week, with the e-signature company’s stock price dropping by more than 40% on Friday as I write to you. That’s among the worst post-earnings share-price movements I have ever seen, aside from cases of fraud or other corporate shenanigans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What happened? DocuSign <a href="https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/DocuSign-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat revenue expectations</a> in its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2022). But the company’s billings — a proxy for future revenue — came in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/docusign-shares-tank-30-amid-revenue-forecast-miss-142636595.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharply under expectations</a>. And the company’s CEO, Dan Springer, said this in its investor letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>After six quarters of accelerated growth, we saw customers return to more normalized buying patterns, resulting in 28% year-over-year billings growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Springer thinks the market is overreacting and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/docu-sign-shares-fall-40-ceo-said-he-is-buying-5-million-worth-of-more-stock-183938500.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intends to buy DocuSign shares next week.</a> Are the markets making too much of what appears to be a return to more regular growth at DocuSign?</p>
<p>Maybe not? I’ve been talking to folks about this since it happened — including my dear friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Miller</a>, who keeps me sane at work — trying to work out if we’re seeing Wall Street impatience or something else. I’m leaning toward the latter.</p>
<p>Per Yahoo Finance data, DocuSign is worth around $27 billion after its huge declines. Or about 12.4x its current run rate. For an already-public tech company showing strong hints at future revenue deceleration, who among us will stand up and say that that is too low?</p>
<p>A lot of folks, but that’s because the general climate for SaaS multiples has been so hot for so long. Not <em>too </em>long ago, DocuSign at 12.4x its present-day run rate after posting billings growth of 28% would have been fine, if not good. So, a return to prior norms could be in the air?</p>
<p>Fear. That’s what I expect to taste if we are seeing multiple compressions among software companies. So very many private-market bets have been placed on the expectation that public valuations for comps would stay high. But after a few awful days for tech stocks more generally this week, the climate in tech could finally be shifting away from a 100% risk weighting toward something more balanced.</p>
<h2>Loathing</h2>
<p>Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">pulled three-quarters of a billion dollars from its SPAC debut forward</a>, giving it access to ample funding for its operations. Then it fired a chunk of its staff. The CEO said 15% during a call with the laid-off staffers. Better <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">insists that the number is actually 9%</a>. The discrepancy is wild, given that the CEO was reading from notes and claimed that he had made the call to execute the layoffs. If he made the decision, how did he get the number wrong?</p>
<p>Regardless, here’s a master class in how not to fire a huge stack of your workers:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7GVklRqHRY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>(We’ve preserved a copy of the video, of course, in case that version gets yanked.)</p>
<p>Don’t forget: You are not family at your place of employment. You are an asset that it wants to leverage and derive profit from!</p>
<h2>Corporate gifting</h2>
<p>Turn the clock back to early 2020. In February of that year, right before the turn of the pandemic, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/online-to-offline-platform-sendoso-raises-40m-after-growing-330-in-2019/">covered Sendoso’s $40 million Series B</a>. The company is in the corporate gifting space and has since gone on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers/">raise a $100 million Series C</a>.</p>
<p>Separately, an investor I know connected me to another player in Sendoso’s market, Postal.io, or just Postal. The two compete for market share in the <em>send stuff to current and potential customers </em>market, which is, it turns out, huge.</p>
<p>Regular Exchange readers will already be wondering if we didn’t touch on this recently. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/divining-the-real-value-of-my-favorite-fintech-sub-niche/">We did!</a> Back in September, taking a look at Postal and its progress right before Disrupt.</p>
<p>But I’ve since extracted some growth metrics from Postal and Sendoso that I wanted to append to our continuing coverage of the space. Why do we care? Because akin to the OKR software space, or the instant grocery delivery market, there’s an interesting startup cluster to track.</p>
<p>Sendoso and Postal compete with Alyce and Reachdesk, for example, among others. That’s a lot of startup activity for the online-to-offline market channel. And the market is big enough — Sendoso told The Exchange that the “U.S. corporate gifting market is projected to reach $242 billion by the end of this year,” citing Coresight — for several players to grow at once.</p>
<p>Postal was the most free with metrics, sharing that it has seen 70% subscription revenue growth for the last five consecutive quarters. The startup has also seen GMV scale 3,765% from Q3 2020 to Q3 2021, as customers rose from 35 to 286. That’s why it managed to raise capital in September, we figure.</p>
<p>Sendoso was more coy with numbers regarding its recent performance. The startup grew 330% in 2019, recall, but regarding its recent results did not deign to share an updated figure. Instead, Sendoso said that it has 900 customers (north of 20,000 seats at those companies, for detail), and that its warehouses “in North America, Europe and Asia [have] handled upward of 3 million sends in over 165 countries.”</p>
<p>We didn’t get new numbers from Alyce or Reachdesk in time for publication, but if they do share results, we’ll bring them to you next week.</p>
<p>Also like the OKR startup market, there’s variation within the larger theme. In the case of corporate gifting, Postal is building a more digital offering, connecting goods companies to buyers, while Sendoso has a larger IRL footprint including its own physical item aggregation points. We do love to have business cases battle it out in real time.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, however, that intense competition doesn’t leave all parties unscathed. In the OKR market Koan failed to make it to its next fundraising milestone, and Microsoft scooped up one of the startup cohort. In the instant grocery space, 1520 just went kaput. Not that Sendoso or Postal are in danger of running out of cash, but if and when their market does find a point of consolidation will be interesting to see.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today, the age of corporate social justice is dawning. With the business case for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) now more vital than ever, we&#8217;re beginning to see organizations truly embrace social activism.</p>
<p>And while social justice was, rightly, the initial impetus, companies are finally waking up to the business case for diversity initiatives. Recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by McKinsey</a> shows that organizations with the most ethnically diverse teams are 36% more likely to financially outperform those with the least. This is because diversity increases revenue, boosts innovation, sparks creativity and leads to better decision-making.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the more diversity you have, the more challenging it can be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The problem is that business leaders and diversity advocates have failed to consider an approach to diversity that goes beyond &#8220;add diversity and stir.&#8221; Diversity is not a numbers game wherein the solution is to merely increase the numbers of traditionally underrepresented groups in your workforce.</p>
<p>Now, as the world adjusts following the pandemic, it&#8217;s time to stop pretending that outdated diversity programs work. So let&#8217;s explore some of the measures leaders can take to root out bias and subjectivity from the outset, and instead adopt an approach of “radical objectivity” &#8212; combining data and human science to ensure that talent and merit win every time.</p>
<h2>Inclusion is about more than hitting diversity recruiting optics</h2>
<p>Diversity in the workplace starts with an inclusive culture. Unfortunately, many companies get this wrong. This is because diversity is quantitative &#8212; it&#8217;s the extent of heterogeneity within your workforce. On the other hand, inclusion describes the experiences of different individuals in the workforce and the degree to which they&#8217;re invited to participate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Delivering on inclusion, therefore, is about more than hitting diversity recruiting optics. Done right, an inclusive culture should help to foster a sense of belonging and shared values. By arming themselves with data and insight instead of diversity quotas, forward-thinking organizations can create an environment in which individuals of all backgrounds can thrive.</p>
<p>So how do they get there?</p>
<h2>It starts with language</h2>
<p>Diversity initiatives often fail because they land too late in the employee journey to have a lasting impact. Change needs to be embedded in the talent acquisition process, which means evolving the way that you engage with your prospective employees &#8212; starting with language.</p>
<p>The words you choose to bring your business to life will make the difference: Words are influential ambassadors of your workplace&#8217;s culture. Technology and data analysis can help you here, providing robust insights on the messages you&#8217;re sending.</p>
<p>For example, are you using gender-coded or inclusive-coded language to attract inclusion-minded people? Are you taking the time to update your communications regularly to make sure they&#8217;re understanding of different cultural contexts &#8212; not just gender and ethnic but organizational and generational, too?</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just the language that you use in your marketing that matters. Have you considered the words used by your hiring managers and recruiters? At Inbeta, we use technology that enables organizations to move beyond the basics when it comes to inclusion.</p>
<p>For example, we bury specific questions in our recruitment interviews, the answers to which can be linguistically analyzed to understand the genuine values and behaviors of candidates, recruiters and hiring managers. This means you no longer need to rely on simplistic “bias checker” software, which tends to be based on outdated research with few controls on data integrity.</p>
<p>Remember, the best candidates have options. So what will you say that makes them want to work for you?</p>
<h2>Moving past preconceptions</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s also essential to bear in mind that, when it comes to language, it works both ways. When deciding whether to hire someone, we need to move past conceptions of how the ideal candidate should talk. That, too, leads to homogeneity. Technology and training in tandem can help with that.</p>
<p>At Inbeta, we recently partnered with a prominent high-street retailer to recruit a board director and encountered in our search a prominent candidate from a working-class background. However, the initial assumption from their tone and the way they articulated was that they had got to their accomplished position through “grit” and “graft” and lacked the strategic capability required for the new role.</p>
<p>Our linguistic intelligence coupled with human expertise surfaced early on that this was not the case and allowed us to counteract the biases at play. We were able to advocate for the individual and design a bespoke coaching intervention that raised the profile within the process, showcasing objective potential and ensuring they were given an equitable chance. The individual is now in the final stage, despite the disadvantage their socioeconomic background would have otherwise caused them.</p>
<h2>Looking where others wouldn&#8217;t (or couldn&#8217;t)</h2>
<p>Traditional approaches are too static to uncover all the potential that&#8217;s out there.</p>
<p>A standard executive search process will typically entail significant manual desk research reviewing historical databases that are only as up-to-date as the day each CV was written. Failing that, you&#8217;re at the mercy of the headhunter&#8217;s black book of acquaintances &#8212; or perhaps a combination of the two. Either way, the process is far from efficient, let alone equitable.</p>
<p>We use a suite of technologies that allows us to identify “hidden” talent without relying on either approach. We&#8217;re currently working with a leading fashion brand to hire a customer and digital director, for example, and the use of our tools has meant that we&#8217;ve been able to rapidly deliver a long list of 74 high-priority real-time candidates within 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is a potential talent pool that would take more traditional search processes weeks to develop &#8212; and that&#8217;s before validation. Not only are we able to map candidates quickly and efficiently, by leveraging technology, we can independently execute due diligence to quantify these leads: Are they exhibiting typical job-seeking behaviors? What are their cultural drivers? Do they have the desired leadership qualities?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just about speed and efficiency &#8212; although, of course, that&#8217;s a bonus &#8212; this is, crucially, about surfacing candidates that would usually be overlooked in the search process.</p>
<h2>Moving beyond cultural fit</h2>
<p>In tackling unconscious bias, it&#8217;s also worth considering what a truly inclusive approach to talent acquisition looks like. Companies have long hired for “cultural fit,” but there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of bias in these mindsets.</p>
<p>By aiming to hire people whose attributes mesh with the company&#8217;s goals and values, your resulting workplace is one in which everyone looks, thinks and acts alike. Instead, organizations must move away from a practice that aims to mold people to fit their norms.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a recent story that always springs to mind. In the run-up to the pandemic, I was working with a significant multinational retail group to source a group chief digital officer as part of a very high-profile board restructure.</p>
<p>The individual we surfaced had no fashion experience and limited retail experience. Furthermore, their mindset couldn&#8217;t have been further from that of the existing C-suite, meaning they would have been entirely overlooked by the majority of headhunters. But, on the other hand, this individual had outstanding digital expertise, a career spanning innovation across several FTSE100 companies. And on top of all this, they’d been operating as a digital nomad in remote central Africa.</p>
<p>Their technical proficiency, coupled with their incredibly diverse mindset, meant that they were the perfect person to revolutionize a very traditional organization. But they simply wouldn&#8217;t have been identified had we been seeking out somebody who was a so-called “cultural fit.” By getting past the cultural fit default, companies are far more likely to build teams with the diversity of mindset, experience, ethnicities and backgrounds that they claim to be seeking.</p>
<h2>Rewiring the system</h2>
<p>Ultimately, taking a holistic view of diversity means looking beyond numbers; a tick-the-box program doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>Cultural change is challenging, perhaps even more so when the objective is creating an inclusive culture. But without a concerted effort to change organizational culture and foster inclusion, diversity initiatives are likely to fail.</p>
<p>The easiest way to address this is to re-examine your hiring process with a radically objective approach. Companies today need to leverage technology and data to mitigate implicit bias wherever they can and match that with human touch and cultural intelligence. The route to diversity success is to perpetually listen, adapt and develop.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>About 30 years ago, the political scientist Joseph Nye overturned convention when he suggested that states exert not just “hard” power — i.e., military might — but “soft” power as well. Soft power, Nye wrote is &#8220;when one country gets other countries to want what it wants … in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, soft power is rule by attraction, not by force. Countries with greater cultural, economic, scientific and moral influence, the theory goes, “punch above their weight,” converting that influence into material gains. It encompasses everything that isn’t guns, soldiers or materiel. Queen Elizabeth II is a soft power all-star, as is Rihanna. But so too are Hollywood, sushi, Louis Vuitton and Copacabana Beach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The likes of Broadway, Michael Jordan, Harvard and Starbucks have long made America, a superpower by conventional means, a soft power one as well. But much of American soft power in recent years can be attributed to our technological ingenuity. After all, the biggest names in technology — Amazon, Facebook, Google — are American. The world’s rich almost universally use iPhones; the world’s top firms run on Microsoft Windows. And world leaders from Narendra Modi to the Pope rely on Twitter and Instagram to reach their followers.<br />

<p>The world’s OS, in other words, is American. And that means the majority of the world lives on technology that is based, for the most part, on American values like free speech, privacy, respect for diversity and decentralization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Silicon Valley is perhaps the biggest overseas draw America has. As many as <a href="https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/covid-19-immigrant-tech-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of software workers are immigrants. Google, Tesla and Stripe all have immigrant founders. When I attended Stanford a decade ago, I witnessed firsthand the endless march of visiting delegations. Germans, Australians — even Russian President Dmitry Medvedev — all came with some version of the same question: How do we replicate Silicon Valley back home?</p>
<p>American politicians have been right to point to our tech sector as one of America’s best exports. But what happens when it stops being a force for good? Is it possible for soft power to actually go in reverse and <em>detract</em> from a nation’s influence?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After all, the harmful externalities of technology are amply documented — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59006615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake news</a> in India, a gencoide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ginned up</a> in Myanmar, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/tech-giants-told-to-remove-extremist-content-much-faster/">ISIS propaganda</a> in Britain. Europe has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/europe-tech-digital-tax.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone</a> after tech giants like Apple and Google for dodging taxes and violating privacy while Amazon has come <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/12/uk-must-compel-amazon-to-improve-worker-conditions-say-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under fire</a> in Britain for worker abuses. And tech’s unhealthy impact on children and teens is rightfully coming under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/snap-tiktok-youtube-senate-hearing-congress/">increased scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>As tech is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">tied</a> more and more to hard power — and as American supremacy relies more and more on Big Tech firms — Washington is left with a conundrum: If, as Nye, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posited</a> in 2012, “credibility is the scarcest resource,” is America able to separate the increasingly baleful actions (and reputations) of its tech firms from Brand USA?</p>
<p>This whole situation reminds me of the COP26 climate change negotiations that wrapped up last month in Glasgow. Aren’t rich countries, many argue, responsible for the actions of their energy companies? It’s a controversial question, but one thing is certain: Exxon Mobil no longer burnishes America’s image. In fact, as the economic costs of climate change are increasingly priced in, it is more likely a liability than an asset.</p>
<p>Unlike its oil giants, America’s tech industry is not precipitating a civilizational crisis. We generally find their products useful. They have generated massive economic activity. And they do have positive externalities. To take one not-so-hypothetical example, Apple iPhones are now used to record human rights abuses, which are posted on Alphabet’s YouTube and shared on Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>But when American tech firms spread hate or abet violence in other countries, they reflect poorly on the U.S. And if the U.S. is to bask in their glow, it should also take responsibility for their shortcomings, if for no other reason than its own reputation.</p>
<p>Of course there is no shortage of Washington politicians seeking to bring Big Tech to heel. The Biden administration is working hard to coordinate with allies on a great number of regulatory actions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">Congress</a> and agencies like the FCC and FTC are poised to take meaningful antitrust action.</p>
<p>These moves, as well as broader reforms like the recent global corporate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/g20-leaders-endorse-global-minimum-corporate-tax-deal-2023-start-2021-10-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax deal</a> at the G20, go some way toward ameliorating corporate abuses. But while regulatory efforts rightly focus on protecting American consumers, they should also take some responsibility for the very real lives harmed abroad.</p>
<p>What would that look like? For one, antitrust investigations might examine tech firms’ monopolies in foreign markets. U.S. standards for free speech may not be applicable in blanket fashion, but regulators might nudge American tech firms to apply the same care in serving poor foreign markets as they do at home, starting with more content moderation in foreign languages. They should also consider adopting more locally nuanced rules in foreign markets (while avoiding doing the bidding of whomever is in charge).</p>
<p>Governments should also work more with the tech giants to share intelligence about how their products are used — both organically to ill effect and maliciously by foreign actors. American diplomats on the ground might regularly brief tech executives about the on-the-ground impact of their products and nudge them toward policies that are less harmful. They might require experimentation with more forms of external oversight, as Facebook has done with its Oversight Board. At a minimum, they might proactively work together to ensure American technologies don’t fuel nascent or ongoing crises, as appears to be the case in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/11/1045084676/facebook-is-under-new-scrutiny-for-its-role-in-ethiopias-conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethiopia</a> right now. But the U.S. shouldn&#8217;t shy away from more aggressively using its Entity List to sanction companies involved in human rights abuses.</p>
<p>There is much firms can do on their own proactively as well. LinkedIn, to its credit, stopped doing business in China when faced with increasing censorship on its platform. When pushed, the platform decided that its (liberal) values were too important to sacrifice. Fourteen years after handing over dissidents’ user data to Chinese authorities, Yahoo stopped doing business in China as well. And tech workers should speak up too. Many have objected when their firms work with the Pentagon or other national security agencies; they ought to be as — if not more — critical of work with authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>Tech firms have more power than they think. When they let undemocratic governments get away with outrageous requests like censoring content, spying on dissidents and denying technology to democracy activists, they risk diminishing the magic that makes American tech firms so attractive in the first place. We are all poorer for the self-censorship already practiced by American firms (when was the last time a movie depicted China in a negative light?). Exporting self-censored technology would be exponentially worse.</p>
<p>Tech executives have grown fond in recent years of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/technology/the-phony-patriots-of-silicon-valley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defending</a> their companies (and their monopolies) on patriotic grounds. But when tech errs, it is far more harmful than producing an offensive movie. Policymakers must make clear that if American tech firms expect goodwill from Washington, they should make good on their words and consider how their actions directly harm American interests and values. They must recognize that tech’s reputation is America’s as well.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All founders want their companies to thrive without them, but the readiness to act on that awareness continues to be one of the more uncomfortable conversations within today’s market. After all, the glorification of founders (and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/3-views-on-jack-dorseys-decision-to-step-down-as-twitters-ceo/">constant habit of treating them like rockstars)</a> has some validity: Visionaries are intrinsically interesting humans, wild enough to bet that people would <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">sleep in strangers&#8217; homes</a> or come to a <a href="https://twitter.com/home">bird-friendly app</a> to share their unfiltered thoughts every single day.</p>
<p>This tension &#8212; of society both positioning a founder as the figurehead of a startup’s success and realizing that succession is key to the longevity of any business &#8212; is why a few lines within Jack Dorsey’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">recent Twitter resignation tweet</a> stood out to me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led,&#8217;” Dorsey wrote. “Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.” Dorsey added that he believes “it’s critical that a company can stand on its own, free of its founder’s influence or direction.”</p>
<p>Dorsey started a conversation that I’ve now been having with founders and investors all week: Removing the idea from the founder’s identity so that the company doesn’t feel innately tied to its creator is healthy for the company. But will require some real conversations on attribution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, I wrote about the importance<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/"> of establishing the difference</a>, both in ownership and incentive, between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee. This week, we need to talk about why it’s important to understand how governance can change over time, and why a founder&#8217;s job title one day might just be “the VP of Nothing.”</p>
<h2>Unlearning the weeds</h2>
<p>“At some point, the founder becomes the VP of nothing,” <a href="https://twitter.com/donutsdidthis">Iris Choi</a>, partner at <a href="https://www.floodgate.com/">Floodgate,</a> said during our latest Equity podcast. “In the beginning you are the head of product, head engineer &#8212; both an individual contributor, as well as the person picking up all the loose ends or filling in the gaps.”</p>
<p>The identity crisis begins when a company gets to the growth stage. Then, founders look less like the scrappy engineer pulling an all-nighter and more like the visionary who is responsible for hiring talent and making sure “the trains are running on time.”</p>
<p>“To a certain extent, you have to let the founder be elevated and not just be in the weeds anymore,” Choi said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fractional co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hellastellah">Stella Han</a> recently went through Y Combinator and raised millions in a seed round. Her business is all about making ownership more accessible to strangers and friends, which means she’s had to have conversations with her co-founder about how to practice that internally as well.</p>
<p>“When you’re a co-founder, you’re very active in the execution of the product, versus being an executive leader, [when] it’s about how well you can empower other people to take the reins and take things into action and have the company grow,” she said. “When you need a conductor for the orchestra, it&#8217;s about communicating that vision and that magic and then having everyone be able to be a team and carry out that whole experience together and deliver it to the audience and the consumers.”</p>
<p>While it’s not controversial to begin building a smart executive team around a brilliant founder as the company scales, it is contrarian to tell the person who thought of an idea that it’s time for them to step down and make room for another acting CEO. In other words, what do you do if you’re not ready to step down or at least away?</p>
<p>Han thinks it comes down to incentive alignment.</p>
<p>​​“Ego is a huge part of a person, and maybe that&#8217;s why they might be doing something that seems right to them but maybe it&#8217;s not for the company overall,” she said, adding that the founder (and any other incoming or existing executives) need to figure out “what is the more holistic bigger-picture incentive that everyone should be aligned on.”</p>
<p>Then, she said, founders need to remove themselves from “being so in the weeds in the heated moment and doing what&#8217;s overall the best.”</p>
<p>Getting more comfortable with decentralizing power within companies will require a broader shift in how investors write checks. Today, having an idea and then getting credit for that idea is an entrepreneur’s most lucrative currency when it comes to pitching a venture capitalist to bet on them. What can replace that incentive?</p>
<h2>Due diligence gets a tweak</h2>
<p>“All businesses want star founders who recruit star teams and turn those into an ecosystem that is the next PayPal Mafia,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/blairsilverberg">Blair Silverberg</a>, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://humcapital.com/">Hum Capital. </a>“Very few businesses ever achieve this vision. The reason is lack of clarity between what teams do, how those actions produce results for the business, and how the individuals involved can take the ownership for the wins they create with them as they start new or join new businesses.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2uXEmOVr28"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">Hum Capital thinks the future of funding is a return to old-school Wall Street</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hum Capital thinks the future of funding is a return to old-school Wall Street&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/embed/#?secret=2uXEmOVr28" data-secret="2uXEmOVr28" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Silverberg is describing some of the promises of Web3, which wants to formalize processes so it’s easier to transparently see who owns, and executes, parts of businesses. But, the entrepreneur doesn’t think we have to wait until the school of thought becomes mainstream to see a shift happen.</p>
<p>“The concept of a hedge fund manager having a portable track record is incredible to think about in the context of an operating business,” he said. “If we can create a world where a similar track record exists, we can match society’s capital with talent at the level of people, not just businesses.” And, as we talked about last month, in an ideas economy, proof of who came up with the winning business strategy matters (both legally and financially).</p>
<p>Within the pitch Zoom, though. I think early-stage investors who want to bet on a successful company &#8212; versus a single person &#8212; will need to push co-founders on their ability to hire, change their minds and understand when it’s time to walk away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-seth-gokhale-b0906014/detail/photo/">Sonia Gokhale</a>, a GP at early-stage fintech fund <a href="https://www.venturesouq.com/">VentureSouq</a>, said that even when she invests, she’s usually looking for co-founders rather than a single founder, both because it de-risks a company in case of unplanned succession, and it’s helpful to have someone to balance out the other.</p>
<p>“A lot of our founding team spends part of due diligence focused on if the two founders work together well. Is there chemistry between them? Are there synergies? Do we have a gut feeling?” she said. “And if we sense any tension that shows up, that’s a red flag.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zjp5V7kbWB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/">Choose your job title before you name your startup</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Choose your job title before you name your startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/embed/#?secret=Zjp5V7kbWB" data-secret="Zjp5V7kbWB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dorsey’s argument that it is critical for a company to stand on its own may not require forcing every single founder out of their company at some point. Instead, as Sounding Board’s Christine Tao pointed out, it can just be an awareness held by “good leadership.”</p>
<p>“CEOs are just people too &#8212; and while a lot of our identity may get wrapped up in our companies &#8212; we&#8217;re not perfect,” she said. “Companies evolve and change, and may need different leadership at different times.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Internet of Things (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/iot/">IoT</a>) devices — essentially, electronics like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fitness-trackers/">fitness trackers</a> and smart lightbulbs that connect to the internet — are now part of everyday life for most.</p>
<p>However, cybersecurity remains a problem, and according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/kaspersky/">Kaspersky</a>, it’s only getting worse: there were 1.5 billion breaches of IoT devices during the first six months of 2021 alone, according to the antivirus provider, almost double from 639 million for all of 2021. This is largely because security has long been an afterthought for the manufacturers of typically inexpensive devices that continue to ship with guessable or default <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/password/">passwords</a> and insecure third-party components.</p>
<p>In an effort to try to improve the security credentials of consumer IoT devices, the U.K. government this week introduced the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-product-security-and-telecommunications-infrastructure-psti-bill-factsheets">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure bill</a> (PST) in Parliament, legislation that requires IoT manufacturers, importers, and distributors to meet certain cybersecurity standards.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The bill outlines three key areas of minimum security standards. The first is a ban on universal default passwords — such as &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;admin&#8221; — which are often preset in a device’s factory settings and are easily guessable. The second will require manufacturers to provide a public point of contact to make it simpler for anyone to report a security vulnerability. And, the third is that IoT manufacturers will also have to keep customers updated about the minimum amount of time a product will receive vital security updates.</p>

<p>This new cybersecurity regime will be overseen by an as-yet-undesignated regulator, that will have the power to levy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a>-style penalties; companies that fail to comply with PSTI could be fined £10 million or 4% of their annual revenue, as well as up to £20,000 a day in the case of an ongoing contravention.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the PSTI bill sounds like a step in the right direction, and the ban on default passwords especially has been widely commended by the cybersecurity industry as a “common sense” measure.</p>
<p>“Basic cyber hygiene, such as changing default passwords, can go a long way to improving the security for these types of devices, Rodolphe Harand, managing director at YesWeHack, tells TechCrunch. “With a new unique password needing to be provided by manufacturers, this will essentially offer an additional layer of protection.”</p>
<p>But others say the measures — particularly the ban on easy-to-guess passwords — haven&#8217;t been thought through, and could potentially create new opportunities for threat actors to exploit.</p>
<p>“Stopping default passwords is laudable, but if each device has a private password, then who is responsible for managing this?&#8221; said Matt Middleton-Leal, managing director at Qualys. &#8220;It’s common for end-users to forget their own passwords, so if the device needed repair, how would the specialist gain access? This is dangerous territory where manufacturers may have to provide super-user accounts or backdoor access.”</p>
<p>Middleton-Leal, along with others in the industry, are also concerned about the PSTI bill’s mandatory product vulnerability disclosure. While sensible in principle, since it ensures security researchers can contact the manufacturers privately to warn of flaws and bugs so they can be fixed — there’s nothing in the bill that requires bugs to be fixed before they are disclosed.</p>
<p>“If anything, this increases risk when the vulnerability becomes common knowledge, as bad actors then have a red flag to focus their efforts upon and find ways to exploit it,” Middleton-Leal added.</p>
<p>John Goodacre, director of UKRI’s Digital Security by Design, agrees that this mandate is flawed, telling TechCrunch: “The policy accepts that vulnerabilities can still exist in even the best-protected consumer technologies with security researchers regularly identifying security flaws in products. In today&#8217;s world, we can only continue to patch these vulnerabilities once they are found, putting a plaster over the wound once damage may have already been done. Further initiatives are needed for the technology to block such wounds from happening at the foundational level.”</p>
<p>The third key area outlined in the bill, which details how long devices will receive security updates, is also under fire for fears that it could encourage manufacturers to discount prices once a device nears end-of-life, which could incentivize consumers to buy devices that will soon be without security support.</p>
<p>Some believe the U.K. government isn’t acting fast enough. The bill — which does not consider vehicles, smart meters, medical devices, and desktop or laptop computers that connect to the internet — has given IoT manufacturers 12 months to change their working practices, which means that for the next year, many will continue to churn out inexpensive devices that might not adhere to the most basic of security standards.</p>
<p>“Manufacturers will likely continue to regard speed to market as a priority over device security, believing that this is the primary consideration for maintaining profits,&#8221; Kim Bromley, a senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/digital-shadows-gets-14m-to-keep-growing-its-digital-risk-scanning-service/">Digital Shadows</a>, tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bromley also believes that the U.K. will struggle to enforce these regulations against manufacturers based in mainland China (PRC). “Some PRC-based manufacturers release products that are cheaper than other products on the market, and therefore users will continue to buy products that may contain security flaws, or at the very least, do not comply with UK legislation,” said Bromley. “The new requirements will also place huge burdens on UK resellers that may use PRC manufactured products on their own; keeping pace with the requirements and changing working practices could prove difficult.”</p>
<p>The solution, however, remains unclear, though cybersecurity experts seem to universally agree that the U.K. government needs to be flexible in its approach to IoT security, and ensure it doesn&#8217;t fall into the common trap of looking only at the past and the present, instead of the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both attackers and, sadly, unscrupulous manufacturers and vendors, are endlessly creative,&#8221; says Amanda Finch, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec). &#8220;There will inevitably be new avenues of attack that circumvent the demands of the bill, and new vulnerabilities created by lazy manufacturers. As such, this bill has to be seen as one step in an endless process of review and refinement, rather than an end in itself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not for the first time, SoftBank is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. Indeed, even while the Japanese conglomerate is known for its extremes &#8212; be it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-gains-coupang/softbank-reaps-33-billion-coupang-windfall-idUSKBN2B32QV">bold</a> bets, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-rajeev-misra-used-campaign-of-sabotage-to-hobble-internal-rivals-11582743294">internal</a> squabbles, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-turns-away-from-softbank-and-its-founder-masayoshi-son-11624021118">soured</a> business <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-adam-neumann-masa-son-cult-of-we-11626474657">relationships</a>, or its ability to repeatedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-reports-highest-ever-annual-profit-for-a-japanese-company-11620803131">bounce back</a> from the brink &#8212; some newer developments could prove particularly hard, if not impossible, to overcome.</p>
<p>The worst of these, seemingly, is the lawsuit filed yesterday by the Federal Trade Commission to block chipmaker Nvidia&#8217;s acquisition of Arm, the British company that licenses chip technology, out of stated concern that the deal would give Nvidia too much control over computing technology.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow’s technologies depend on preserving today’s competitive, cutting-edge chip markets,” Holly Vedova, the director of the agency&#8217;s competition bureau, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger">said in a related statement</a>. “This proposed deal would distort Arm’s incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia’s rivals.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242989" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The problem for SoftBank? A scuttled deal could means tens of billions of dollars to the outfit, which acquired the now 21-year-old Arm in July 2016 for $32 billion before selling it to Nvidia in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $40 billion. It&#8217;s even worse than it sounds. Nvidia&#8217;s share price has continued to rise so fast that, as Bloomberg noted earlier today, that $40 billion deal has since ballooned into a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/softbank-poised-to-lose-74-billion-payday-if-arm-deal-is-halted?sref=gni836kR">$74 billion deal</a>.</p>
<p>It might not be a complete disaster for SoftBank. The deal has expected to receive regulatory scrutiny from the moment it was announced, so SoftBank might already have factored in this very likely possibility. Nvidia also says it will contest the FTC lawsuit (though it seems unlikely to win against the agency). Besides, all things chip-related are much in demand at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, it isn&#8217;t clear what Arm would be worth to another buyer. Meanwhile, if SoftBank decides to take the outfit public instead, it could be worth closer to half what Nvidia paid for it, estimates Bloomberg, based on the average market-capitalization-to-sales ratio of 9.9 times that members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index currently enjoy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, SoftBank is also in danger of losing a key lieutenant over compensation. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/softbank-poised-to-lose-74-billion-payday-if-arm-deal-is-halted?sref=gni836kR">New York Times story</a> published this afternoon, Marcelo Claure, who is SoftBank&#8217;s chief operating officer and is widely believed to be the right-hand man to SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, has been locked in a protracted battle with the company over his compensation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, according to four people who spoke with the Times, he&#8217;s apparently prepared to leave SoftBank if he doesn&#8217;t get what he wants, which is $2 billion in compensation over the next several years. SoftBank is apparently thinking more along tens of millions of dollars at most instead.</p>
<p>Asked for more information, a SoftBank spokesperson sent us the following statement: &#8220;Softbank and Marcelo Claure are actively engaged in discussions about his role at the company and his compensation. Marcelo is an important executive at Softbank who has helped with many important initiatives since joining us in 2017. SoftBank does not intend to comment further on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be a major loss to SoftBank. Claure wears many hats for the company. He was WeWork&#8217;s interim CEO after it pushed out Adam Neumann for example, and helped recruit current CEO Sandeep Mathrani. Claure is also at the top of two other org charts: its diversity-focused SoftBank Opportunity Fund and its SoftBank Latin America Fund vehicles, which are responsible for most of the firm&#8217;s outsize bets these days. (We talked with Claure about SoftBank&#8217;s aggressive LatAm strategy at Disrupt in September; see below.)</p>
<p>Claure would also be among the highest profile in a very long string of departures from the firm. Earlier this month, Bloomberg noted that SoftBank&#8217;s &#8220;eccentric&#8221; approach to compensation &#8212; it pays far less than similar-size rivals &#8212; has helped precipitate the resignations of seven managing partners since March of last year, with its only senior managing partner, Deep Nishar, announcing last week that he is joining General Catalyst as a managing director.</p>
<p>SoftBank has recovered from worse, but it seems particularly vulnerable at the moment. Just last week, Son revealed that SoftBank Group has lost more than $50 billion owing to Beijing’s tech crackdown and its shares are down sharply. With these two newer and very public developments, it&#8217;s going to be that much harder to boost investor confidence in the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Systemic racism is nothing new in America, and the effects of unconscious racial bias have long created inequity in the workplace. So why &#8212; when presented with the task of developing new “normal” hybrid workplaces &#8212; are we allowing the same systemic problems that boxed generations of Black and brown people out of the workforce to exist?</p>
<p>We must bravely confront this problem with whatever tools are available to us now while we still have a once-in-a-generation chance to shape the foundation of what is being built.</p>
<p>Statistics help tell the story of stark disparities in the economic status of Black and white families. The typical Black household earns only 57 cents on the dollar made by white families, and the median wealth of Black families is just $17,000 &#8212; compared with $171,000 for white families. Black families also suffer from lower annual incomes, making about $29,000 less a year, on average, than their white counterparts. Their children are three times as likely to grow up in poverty and stay poor throughout their lifetimes. There’s also a dismal wealth gap in homeownership: Only 42% of Black families own their homes, compared with 73% of white families.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242728" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I recently shared this data with lawmakers serving on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion. The hearing, “The Legacy of George Floyd: An Examination of Financial Services Commitments to Economic and Racial Justice,” specifically addressed the negative economic impact of systemic racism in the financial services industry. Everything from biased lending practices to an imbalance in the distribution of philanthropic dollars has massive economic ramifications.</p>
<p>Equity cannot be fully achieved by simply donating money to external partners, such as my organization, the National Urban League. While I’m the first to say the league and many of my colleagues in the field are doing great work, too many companies are relying on us alone to change the world.</p>
<p>Actions speak. Entrepreneurs need to help get their employees into proven training programs that show the true impact of their unconscious biases. Startups must look inward and ensure their organizations are diverse, inclusive and equitable places for both employees and their customers.</p>
<p>But this requires internal work. And in certain cases, external voices. We have already seen companies like Comcast NBCUniversal, Charter Communications and T-Mobile create external diversity and inclusion councils with independent leaders to advise and help drive common objectives forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) isn’t just the right and moral thing for entrepreneurs to do. It also makes economic sense. Companies that stress internal diversity are more profitable, as they can successfully appeal to more diverse markets. Ethnically diverse companies are 35% more likely to outperform companies with less diversity.</p>
<p>To be sure, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and profoundly altered many aspects of work life, including in-person diversity training and workforce development.</p>
<p>As more workplaces move to a hybrid model of remote and in-person work, this is the time to take DEI off the back burner and rethink inclusion programs to incorporate leading-edge technology to reach employees wherever they are.</p>
<p>Companies must start now. But there’s no need to start from scratch. The resources already exist, and there is a wealth of external partners that can help improve corporate culture and diversity metrics. With a deep and nuanced understanding of the issues at hand, civil rights organizations are uniquely poised to support corporate DEI management by providing strategic advisory services, executive coaching, DEI subject matter expertise, and DEI strategy development and planning. For instance, we have the lessons we’ve learned over our 111 years working to connect diverse communities to opportunities, and we integrate these lessons with new tech advancements to advise our partners.</p>
<p>Accordingly, groups like the National Urban League have successfully collaborated with public and private partners on the issues of diversity, inclusion, fair employment, equity and parity. Although these conversations can sometimes be difficult, companies who are intentional in addressing these issues must do so head-on.</p>
<p>Here are some ways founders can usher in a more inclusive startup culture in a hybrid work environment.</p>
<h2>VR training programs</h2>
<p>Virtual reality technology is one of the newest additions to the DEI training toolbox to facilitate having those sometimes difficult discussions. Virtual reality scenarios can be used to train a large group of people in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>By donning a VR headset, individuals can participate in an immersive training experience where they can engage in a conversation about race and inherent bias without fear of judgment or reprisals.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mothandflamevr.com/">Moth+Flame</a>, a Brooklyn-based virtual reality developer and production studio, has already developed successful DEI programs for the U.S. Air Force and Accenture, where users enter a simulated real-world environment to practice tough conversations using their own voice. This innovative technology offers a deep level of immersion that creates a long-lasting emotional impact for employees.</p>
<p>The beauty of VR is that it lends itself well to in-person situations and can also be used effectively with remote employees. In a hybrid workplace, VR ensures all employees walk away with a consistent training experience &#8212; regardless of their location.</p>
<h2>Professional and workforce development programs</h2>
<p>Programs can be developed for America’s startups to connect recruiting teams to historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions. These programs include supported and hosted online job boards, career fairs and workforce development initiatives.</p>
<p>But just getting diverse faces in the door isn’t enough — that’s only diversity. Founders need to invest in their employees of color by allowing them to participate in professional development programs to create the next generation of executives — that’s equity. This is even more critical with a dispersed workforce as a divide in the employee experience can become more pronounced when some groups work in the office and some remain remote. Workers can feel left out, lonely or just out of the loop. Professional development programs encourage employee engagement and signal the company is investing in their personal and professional growth despite where they are located — that’s inclusion.</p>
<h2>Supplier diversity</h2>
<p>The return to some level of in-office activities also comes with the return of relying on suppliers — like travel agents, catering vendors, event production companies and more. As companies look for new suppliers to build out their new hybrid work environments, they should be working now to create a framework for establishing a diverse supplier network, vetting current vendors and sourcing new vendors.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, many companies consistently list difficulty in locating diverse suppliers as the chief impediment to furthering such diversity. To remedy the problem, <a href="https://bidconnectusa.com/">BidConnect USA</a> created a centralized business network platform that connects companies and government agencies with small businesses, aggregates online events and creates a tool to foster ethical practices and economic inclusion.</p>
<h2>Recognizing, assessing, measuring</h2>
<p>Without employees coming together in the same office day in and day out, it can be harder for staff to feel when progress is made toward positive company cultural change. That’s where numbers and accountability come into play.</p>
<p>Startups must transparently determine which metrics they want to incorporate to measure diversity within their organization. With equity being a higher priority than ever for employees, consumers, investors and activists, there have never been greater risks and costs for lagging or greater rewards and benefits for leading.</p>
<p><a href="https://mlt.org/">Management Leadership for Tomorrow</a>’s (MLT) Black Equity at Work Certification Program enables employers that embrace rigorous action to minimize downside and maximize upside by assuring major, sustained Black equity progress and providing valuable recognition.</p>
<p>The MLT program isn’t another pledge, index or disclosure push. It’s a unique, affordably priced improvement system that includes a meticulously developed scoring rubric that quantifies overall Black equity progress; planning resources and support that enable employers to chart their own path on their timeline; an array of valuable services that ensure and accelerate results; and a high degree of trust and guarantee of strict confidentiality. Socializing tangible data to measure progress toward diversity goes a long way toward shaping company culture.</p>
<p>Achieving full racial equity and inclusion won’t be easy. It requires the firm commitment of all sectors of our civil society. Government entities, startups, private and public companies, and nonprofits alike need to ask themselves uncomfortable questions, address inequities head-on, and resolve to change practices and policies so that all people have equal opportunities to live full and prosperous lives. With the right programs in the hands of dedicated employees, we might just get there a little faster.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 3, 2021! I don’t know about you, but after watching stocks get hammered all day, I mostly want to snag a nap and breathe. But things were worse for DocuSign and Didi than they were for us, so we can take solace in that. What did Didi do? Well, let’s talk about it. —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/">Didi to delist:</a> </strong>The latest detail from the dada-esque Didi disaster came today, with the Chinese ride-hailing giant announcing that it will delist from U.S. markets. It will, instead, list in Hong Kong. The Didi IPO, akin to the failed Ant debut, may become timeline markers of further decoupling of the Chinese market with the larger world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/mrbeast-squid-game-creator-economy-viral/"><strong>Read this Amanda Silberling piece on the creator economy:</strong></a> The worldwide success of Netflix’s &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; has spawned a cottage industry of me-toos. None, perhaps, more notable than an entry from YouTuber MrBeast. I once saw a clip of him burying himself alive for laughs.

<p>This week, LinkedIn rolled out support for Hindi users, allowing it to reach approximately 500 million people in India and 100 million more around the globe.</p>
<p>Talented developers abound in emerging markets, but few of them use the same social network that so many startup recruiters rely upon. Additionally, many devs simply don&#8217;t like social media — so what&#8217;s your plan for reaching them?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the midst of a talent drought, so it&#8217;s a good idea to draw water from more than one well. To bring in a broader mix of candidates, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/hiding-in-plain-sight-3-ways-to-recruit-engineers-who-fly-under-linkedins-radar/">use the three ideas laid out here</a> to elevate your startup&#8217;s hiring game.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/facebook-messenger-is-testing-a-new-split-payments-feature-in-the-u-s/">Facebook Messenger tests payment splitting:</a></strong> When you reach Facebook’s scale, every product in the market is a potential add-on to your core service. So, that Big Blue is adding payment splitting to its Messenger service is not a huge surprise. What can users do with the ability to “share the cost of bills and expenses through the app”? Well, most of what you can do with Venmo or Splitwise, we reckon.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/tech-stocks-are-getting-hammered-again/">Tech stocks get hammered (again):</a></strong> Leading the downward charge, DocuSign was the first horseman of the tech valuation unravelling this Friday. Shares of tech stocks took a number of blows this week, pushing software stocks into bear market territory. Sure, valuations are still high, but the hype could be evaporating atop the market’s warm climate.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/pinduoduo-puts-profit-into-agriculture/">Why is Pinduoduo growing food?</a></strong> This was a surprise to my eyes. Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo unveiled a huge agricultural effort in August, where it is seemingly putting both capital and focus. “The program won’t be profit-driven, the company promised, and all profit from the second quarter and ‘any potential profits in future quarters would be allocated to the initiative,’” TechCrunch reported. My first take is that this is how tech companies in China can keep being tech shops while also fitting into the top-down demand for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/hiding-in-plain-sight-3-ways-to-recruit-engineers-who-fly-under-linkedins-radar/">&#8220;common prosperity.&#8221;</a></li>

<p>As we wade into the second pandemic-era holiday season, there&#8217;s no better time to throw yourself headlong into a new hobby. Or that&#8217;s what you should tell your loved ones when you gift them one of the cameras on our list of photography gift ideas this year.</p>
<p>Mobile photography is ubiquitous but it still can&#8217;t compete with the control and quality afforded by some of the most innovative cameras around, so don&#8217;t rule out a serious upgrade for anyone on your gift list who&#8217;s looking to get more creative this winter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241841" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>GoPro Hero 10 Black</h2>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2241883" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241883" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241883 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="735" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241883" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GoPro</p></div></p>
<p>For action and sports, GoPro still leads the pack. The tiny cube-like GoPro Hero 10 Black can record any thrill-seeking endeavor you can dream up and pull off, with excellent waterproofing and a wealth of useful accessories to make it happen.</p>
<p>The GoPro Hero 10 Black is the cream of the crop with a faster processor and slightly higher image resolution, but the previous generation Hero 9 Black will save you some cash with little sacrifice. But because the laggy user interface is historically one of the only downsides to shooting with a GoPro, you probably won&#8217;t be mad about going for the latest and greatest, though older generations offer a great value.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/gopro-hero10-black-action-camera/6474501.p?skuId=6474501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$449 from Best Buy</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Sony A7C</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2241884" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241884" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241884 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a7c-e1638400007107.png" alt="Sony A7C" width="600" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a7c-e1638400007107.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a7c-e1638400007107.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a7c-e1638400007107.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/a7c-e1638400007107.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241884" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>Released late last year, Sony&#8217;s A7C builds on the company&#8217;s solid track record of releasing innovative mirrorless cameras that even pro photographers can love. The Sony A7C is a full-frame mirrorless shooter, which means it&#8217;s probably overkill for any brand new photographer just figuring out the ropes, but it&#8217;s a perfect upgrade for anyone who&#8217;s pushed past the limits of an old DSLR or a newer APS-C camera. The A7C bills itself as an ultra-portable option within an already ultra-portable category, and with in-body image stabilization and an impressive sensor, the A7C doesn&#8217;t require any meaningful trade-offs.</p>
<p>Also: For anyone looking to pick up a similarly super-compact full-frame camera at a friendlier price, the Canon EOS RP is worth a look. It lacks the in-body image stabilization of its pricier competition but is a great entry point for someone looking to make the leap to full-frame photography in a tiny package.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Sony A7C, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1592776-REG/sony_alpha_a7c_mirrorless_digital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,800 from B&amp;H</a> <strong>|</strong> Canon EOS RP, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1459282-REG/canon_eos_rp_mirrorless_digital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$999 from B&amp;H</a></p>

<p><div id="attachment_2241886" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241886" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241886 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="2500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fujifilm-x100v.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fujifilm</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no new model this year, but Fujifilm&#8217;s X100V is still an amazing option for a pocket-sized pro-level camera. Offering tactile touches that hearken back to a bygone era of photography, it&#8217;s no surprise that Fujifilm&#8217;s little shooter manages to charm so many people. You don&#8217;t get interchangeable lenses for the price, but you do get a very capable camera that fits in a pocket, making all kinds of unobtrusive street and travel photography a breeze.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://www.adorama.com/ifjx100vb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,400 from Adorama</a></p>
<h2>DJI Mini 2</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2241888" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241888" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241888 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dji-mini-2.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241888" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DJI</p></div></p>
<p>For the drone-curious giftee, the DJI Mini 2 is a perfect well-rounded entry point. Small enough to be carted around on adventures but feature-rich enough to be worthwhile, the Mini 2 brings DJI&#8217;s smaller option closer to parity with the more advanced Mavic line. Notably, the Mini 2&#8217;s addition of Ocusync 2.0 makes for a more reliable connection and an improved motor makes things more stable across the board — and the 4K video doesn&#8217;t hurt either.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://m.dji.com/product/mini-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$450 from DJI</a></p>

<p>Okay, there are probably more practical instant photography options out there, but have you seen this thing? Possibly the cutest camera (device?) ever made, the Polaroid Go is probably the smallest instant camera ever at 4.1 inches on the widest side. It shoots a miniaturized version of Polaroid&#8217;s classic film that&#8217;s not much of a size step-down from something like the tried-and-true Instax format, and you can even wear it around your neck.</p>

Logitech&#8217;s StreamCam can produce pro-level video, complete with face-tracking tech and 1080p video quality 60 frames per second.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> from his role. He appointed CTO Parag Agrawal as new CEO, effective immediately. Agrawal, who joined Twitter as an engineer in 2011, already announced a major reorganization of the company today, per an internal email obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-agrawal-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>. Twitter confirmed the news to TechCrunch, as well.</p>
<p>So far, two executives have stepped down as part of this restructuring: Twitter&#8217;s Chief Design Officer Dantley Davis, who joined the company in 2019, and Head of Engineering Michael Montano, who joined in 2011.</p>
<p>In August, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/technology/twitter-culture-change-conflict.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> reported on Davis&#8217; &#8220;tough love&#8221; policy in the workplace, which company officials said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/technology/twitter-culture-change-conflict.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have gone too far</a> at times. This behavior seemed contrary to Twitter&#8217;s #LoveWhereYou Work and <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/tweep-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#OneTeam </a>slogans, which emphasize &#8220;creating a culture that&#8217;s supportive, respectful, and a pretty cool vibe.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Dantley’s departure is singularly focused around shifting our organizational model around a structure that has one lead manager supporting a key company objective,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span id="m_-282017669953659303gmail-docs-internal-guid-c29740f0-7fff-1cfa-027e-ea39e28f22bb">We don’t have further details to share on these changes out of respect for the individuals involved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Parag is focused on operational excellence and setting Twitter up to hit its goals; these changes were made with that in mind. For our teams working within the product and technology organizations, we’re moving to a General Manager model and having one person lead work that supports one of our key company objectives. This will allow us to operate more cross-functionally and enable faster, more informed decision-making,&#8221; the Twitter spokesperson added.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Dorsey was criticized and even <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/twitters-jack-dorsey-sued-by-shareholder-over-his-dual-role-as-square-ceo-192802483.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued by a shareholder</a> over his dual CEO roles at Twitter and Square, the fintech giant that he also co-founded. Twitter had been slow to innovate, but for much of this year, the platform has rapidly added new features like its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">subscription Twitter Blue service</a>, Spaces audio rooms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Ticketed Spaces</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">crypto features</a> and more. Agrawal has expressed interest in continuing to pick up the pace at Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve recently updated our strategy to hit ambitious goals, and I believe that strategy to be bold and right,&#8221; Agrawal wrote in an email to staff on Monday, which he then <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465349749607854083/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>. &#8220;But our critical challenge is how we work to execute against it and deliver results &#8212; that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ll make Twitter the best it can be for our customers, shareholders and each of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For both companies that Dorsey co-founded, it&#8217;s been a week of immense change. Days after his announcement to step down as Twitter CEO, Square announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">rebrand to Block</a>.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The road to a successful funding round can be a long and arduous one.</p>
<p>From your first meeting with a VC to money in the bank, a seed round takes on average 18.5 weeks. Within that time frame, you are pitching your heart out to multiple investors and ideally setting a number of meetings, either virtual or in-person.</p>
<p>You’re also busy building and constantly tweaking your narrative (and pitch deck) and managing each of those meetings and the necessary followup. Then, if things go well, you’re negotiating term sheets and final closing details. All the while running a startup with equal intensity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Having transparency into how investors engage with your pitch deck gives you an advantage.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So how do you prepare for this important stage in your company’s growth, navigate the challenges of a fundraise, and not let the process overwhelm the responsibility of still running your business? While not every fundraise is the same, founders can tap the experience of others who have been down this path to ensure their fundraising efforts are efficient and, most importantly, successful.</p>
<p>This can be done both qualitatively and quantitatively. Tap your network to learn from both peers that have been through the fundraising process recently as well as more seasoned experts that can impart useful wisdom and perspective. And quantitatively, there’s a ton of data out there on the fundraising process that can remove the mystery and uncertainty for you as a founder. Having very clear data on where VCs focus their time on pitch decks or in meetings will guide you to deliver a finely tuned pitch to the right investor.</p>
<p>This year has shown growth in the fundraising landscape like we’ve never seen before. Records in deal dollars have been continuously broken, and VC demand and startup supply have increased consistently since April 2020. While the tides have seemingly turned in the favor of founders, there are different investor expectations for each stage of funding, from pre-seed to Series A and beyond.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242528" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242528" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2242528" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.jpg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242528" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/docsend-startup-index/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=referral%20traffic&amp;utm_campaign=techcrunch&amp;utm_content=fundraising-byline">DocSend’s weekly PDI metrics</a></p></div></p>
<p>As more founders pitch their startups, funding rounds are competitive, so you need to prepare accordingly. Below I’ll lay out a few essential steps every founder will take during their fundraising journey, with proven and data-driven strategies to approach them.</p>
<h2>The right pitch deck</h2>
<p>A good pitch deck is key to opening the door to funds. It’s the first impression you make on a VC, and with them breezing through decks at record speeds (2 minutes and 34 seconds per deck), yours has to count. It needs to clearly communicate purpose and value, demonstrating that your company is a solid investment and that your idea is worth their money and time.</p>
<p>By analyzing deck compilation and comparing it to metrics, <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/pitch-deck-metrics/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=referral%20traffic&amp;utm_campaign=techcrunch&amp;utm_content=fundraising-byline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DocSend has found</a> that startups that have successfully fundraised have commonalities across their pitch decks. This can be broken down by different stages and help you understand the order of your slides, which sections to include more detail on, which sections will get the most attention and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year's re:Invent felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map. Maybe that's what we all needed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://aws.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS</a> held its annual customer conference,<a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> re:Invent</a>, this week in Las Vegas. It&#8217;s typically been a high-energy customer extravaganza — a circus for tech people — but there were a few unusual things about this year&#8217;s model that made the event feel a bit more subdued than in the past.</p>
<p>For starters, it was the first time back in Vegas after the pandemic forced the event into virtual mode last year. There were fewer people onsite than in a normal year (whatever normal is now), and it was also the first re:Invent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/with-his-first-reinvent-looming-what-will-awss-new-boss-bring-to-the-table/">with new CEO Adam Selipsky</a> delivering the main keynote on Tuesday.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Amazon CTO Werner Vogels pointed out that much of the innovation was going on behind the scenes as the company worked to simplify operations for its customers.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There was some thinking that he would want to put his stamp on things and perhaps chart a course for the future of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">the lucrative division</a>, but what the audience got was more incremental than innovative, more bland than exciting. It was a nice, well-organized affair without a lot of fanfare.</p>
<p>Selipsky&#8217;s delivery was smooth and professional but lacked a major announcement to really turn heads, as Andy Jassy had in the past. While there were newsworthy announcements &#8212; we certainly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2021/">covered a bunch of them</a> &#8212; nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool. It felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s what we all needed this year. Maybe it&#8217;s the best that Amazon could do in a year of turbulence, when Jassy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">moved on to become CEO</a> of the entire company and the world fought its way through a pandemic. But whatever the reason, it just didn&#8217;t seem like anything major happened.</p>

<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research who has attended the conference for nine straight years, called it &#8220;one of the tamest re:Invents&#8221; he could remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall re:Invent did not have the usual big announcements. For example, this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database. Instead, it moved a number of services to serverless and added [minor] capabilities across the board,&#8221; he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve recently been bombarded with news of job surpluses, including predictions that the number of software developer roles will increase <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">22%</a> by 2030. With the need for nearly a quarter more developers, recruiters are having to scale their search and look under the stones that have previously been left unturned.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to assume in the digital age that job candidates are waiting at the end of a mouse click, but the online hiring space isn&#8217;t as encompassing as we think. Less than <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10%</a> of people on LinkedIn don&#8217;t have an education that surpasses high school, despite <a href="https://blog.hyperiondev.com/index.php/2018/04/04/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2018-key-findings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of developers having taught themselves a new coding language, framework or tool without formal education.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			People who live in emerging markets use LinkedIn less frequently, even though these locations harbor some of the world&#8217;s most promising tech talent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some developers choose not to have a LinkedIn account because it feels like another social media channel to maintain. This aversion makes sense considering engineers focus more on hard skills rather than their online personae.</p>
<p>This week, LinkedIn announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/linkedin-adds-hindi-to-reach-500-million-people-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would start offering its services in Hindi</a>, which will allow the service to reach 600 million people globally. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272783/linkedins-membership-worldwide-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People who live in emerging markets use the platform less frequently</a>, even though these locations harbor some of the world&#8217;s most promising tech talent.</p>
<p>Companies can&#8217;t let how they&#8217;ve hired in the past influence their approach today &#8212; doing so means missing not just the quantity of developers, but the quality and diversity of them. The remote revolution didn&#8217;t just broaden where we can recruit, it&#8217;s expanded who we can bring on board. With that in mind, these are the best ways to tap into the hidden developer gems.</p>
<h2>Open up your content, chats and code</h2>
<p>No recruiter should think of hiring a developer as the same process as selling a product or service. As Adam DuVander explains in &#8220;<a href="https://everydeveloper.com/developer-marketing/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Marketing Does Not Exist</a>,&#8221; resonating with developers requires more education and less promotion than the majority of companies currently provide.</p>
<p>The content you publish can organically pique people&#8217;s interest, as long as it has a strategic purpose and doesn&#8217;t overly mention your brand or services; for example, blog posts about upskilling, industry trends and exclusive data insights. You could also host events like webinars, round tables, quizzes and hackathons that are less for recruitment purposes and more to showcase the team and culture. Don&#8217;t be afraid to be lighthearted with your content, either. Memes, GIFs and videos are a great way to demonstrate that you don&#8217;t take yourself too seriously. And once you remove the promotional positioning, developers in the shadows will start to come forward.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The air we breathe has a carbon problem. But in Hellisheidi, Iceland, a geothermally active plateau just outside of Reykjavik, a new technology is taking a small but mighty step toward fixing it.</p>
<p>A plant called Orca, built by <a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a>, is the first-ever facility where CO<sub>2</sub> is being filtered directly from the air and stored permanently underground.</p>
<p>Orca’s carbon-capturing devices resemble giant transistor radios. They fit right into an already larger-than-life Icelandic landscape, where the wind blows fierce even on a rare day when sunlight gleams off the icy mountaintops.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Though the plant has only been operational since September, its air-straining technology, known as direct air capture, has been a point of contention among environmentalists for much longer. Vacuuming up carbon dioxide was once considered a last resort, but it’s looking like we’re headed toward a future where last resorts are a must-have.</p>
<p>“The combination of direct air capture and storage is very likely what the world will need at a massive scale if we want to be compliant with Paris climate targets,” said Jan Wurzbacher, the CEO and co-founder of Climeworks.</p>
<h2>Carbon removal, by math and magic</h2>
<p>By “Paris” targets, Wurzbacher was referring to the global goal of limiting emissions to two degrees Celsius (or ideally 1.5 degrees), established under the 2015 Paris Agreement. To meet that goal, the United Nations has estimated that 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide will need to be removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050. That number is a best-case scenario, assuming that aggressive cuts in emissions are achieved through other means. Without enough cuts, the need for carbon removal could be even higher.</p>
<p>“It’s relatively simple climate math,” Wurzbacher explained on a video call from Zurich, Switzerland, where Climeworks is based. “By mid-century, we need to remove 10 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, if everything else goes well. We might end up needing to remove 20 billion tons, because we can’t ramp down fast enough coal power plants and other stuff.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Direct air capture technology is one among many options for removing excess CO<sub>2</sub>. There are natural methods, like planting trees, and there are technologies that capture CO<sub>2</sub> directly from smokestacks and other emission sources. Compared to capturing CO<sub>2</sub> at the source, it’s more challenging and costly to pull CO<sub>2</sub> literally out of thin air, but a benefit of direct air capture is that it doesn’t require finding and stopping every single polluter. It’s a solution that works across the globe.</p>
<p>“When you do direct air capture, you don’t need to go where the CO<sub>2</sub> is, because air is everywhere,” said Wurzbacher.</p>
<p>The Orca plant consists of eight shipping container-sized boxes, which Climeworks calls collectors. On the front of each box, there are slats, kind of like large venetian blinds. On the back, there are 12 fans that pull air through the box. Within the collectors, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules hit the surface of a specially developed filter material, where molecules, called amines, selectively grab onto them.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://climeworks.com/co2-removal">point of contact</a> is a magical moment. The rest of the air continues out the other side of the collectors, but the carbon sticks tight to the amines. In that moment, the CO<sub>2</sub> goes from the chaotic fray of the atmosphere to the ordered grip of humanity, potentially remaining under control for thousands of years to come. With the application of heat, the CO<sub>2</sub> is released from the amines, and then it gets pumped into nearby volcanic rocks, where it forms long-lasting carbonate minerals.</p>
<p>Currently, removing a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> at Orca costs between $600 and $800, which is prohibitive for most potential payers. Early customers have been companies and individuals willing to pay a premium, such as Microsoft, Stripe, Swiss Re and even <a href="https://climeworks.com/news/climeworks-supported-by-coldplay">the band Coldplay</a> (which hired Climeworks to cancel out some of the emissions from its upcoming world tour).</p>
<p>Climeworks is aiming to get that cost down to between $100 and 200. The US Department of Energy recently<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-remarks-going-carbon-negative-doe-event-us-pavilion-cop26"> set a similar goal</a> of bringing the cost of technological carbon removal to under $100 per ton. At those lower price points, direct air capture would be on par with other ambitious measures to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2241087,2241088,2241086"]</p>
<p>For now, the magic moment of capture may not be cheap, but at least it works.</p>
<p>“Orca has gone from zero to one,” said Dr. Julio Friedmann, a senior research fellow at Columbia University “At this point we know, if we had to, we could make more Orcas. We imagine the cost will reduce, we imagine the performance will improve, et cetera, but we now have a single-unit device that pulls four thousand tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from the air every year.”</p>
<p>In addition to the high cost, Orca has been criticized for the miniscule quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> that it captures. Four thousand tons is paltry compared to the 10 billion tons that need to be removed within several decades. At our current level of emissions, humanity is canceling out Orca’s yearly efforts every three seconds.</p>
<p>However, it may be helpful to reframe this amount by considering it relative to other means of removing carbon from the atmosphere. Growing an acre of<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716302584"> redwood forest</a> also removes about 4,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, but it takes much longer than a year, and it can only be done in a limited number of places.</p>
<p>Friedmann framed the elevator pitch for direct air capture in similar terms: “It does the work of two hundred thousand trees, in one thousand times less space.”</p>
<p>Activists like Greta Thunberg have<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit"> dismissed</a> engineered solutions like direct air capture as “technologies that barely exist” and have instead promoted nature-based solutions, but it’s possible to pursue both strategies. If the United Nations estimates are correct, there will be room for multiple solutions to suck up the extra carbon.</p>
<p>“It’s at the order of billions of tons that we will need this. I’m quite sure of that,” said Wurzbacher.</p>
<h2>Sometimes, smaller is better</h2>
<p>Criticisms of Orca’s small size also miss another key point: starting small is a unique learning opportunity.</p>
<p>Like with any technology, direct air capture can improve with iteration, becoming more efficient and less expensive over time. The Climeworks CO<sub>2</sub> collectors are modular, meaning that the way to collect more CO<sub>2</sub> is to add more collectors, rather than making the collectors themselves any bigger. With a modular product, it’s cheaper and easier to iterate than with one that’s larger and more bespoke.</p>
<p>“By the time we build big plants or multiples of what we have now, we are quite certain that it works and how we keep operating,” said Nathalie Casas, the head of technology at Climeworks. “That’s the beauty of the modular approach.”</p>
<p>A bigger plant is already in the works, according to Wurzbacher, though the location has not yet been determined. It will be ten times larger than the Orca plant, so there will be 80 shipping container-sized collectors, instead of just eight, capturing 40,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
<p>An advantage of building a plant the size of Orca is that any tweaks to the collector design only need to be repeated eight times.</p>
<p>“If you build eighty containers, it’s a whole different story,” Wurzbacher said.</p>
<p>Climeworks’ small- to medium-scale approach stands in contrast to that of another major company commercializing direct air capture technology, Carbon Engineering, which is currently building a plant in Texas that will capture half a million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. That plant is scheduled to go online towards the middle of this decade.</p>
<p>“Climeworks is going into the swimming pool step by step as opposed to cannonballing in all at once,” said Colin McCormick, chief innovation officer at Carbon Direct, an investment and advisory firm focused on carbon removal.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if one, both, or neither of these approaches will be able to achieve carbon removal at scale and at cost. Direct air capture is still in its infancy, but it has parallels to some of the heavy hitters of sustainable technology. Both solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines started off as long shots several decades ago, but now they’re huge and growing industries at the vanguard of the energy transition.</p>
<p>The solar comparison is particularly apt, because the panels were working with novel materials to achieve something theoretically possible but commercially unproven.</p>
<p>According to McCormick, there’s a minimum amount of energy needed to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air, and it’s substantial, but Climeworks and Carbon Engineering are both using about ten times more energy than that minimum, so there’s a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p>“We’re wildly off from 100% efficiency, and that’s okay,” he said. “Early solar panels were a few percent efficient.”</p>
<p>There are many ways that Climeworks is seeking to boost efficiency and reduce costs. A big one is to improve the filter material, so that it captures more CO<sub>2</sub> and lasts longer. The company is also sorting out how to streamline production, so that the modular units are cheaper to build. Then there are the relatively fixed costs, like pipelines for CO<sub>2</sub>, that will naturally decrease as the plants get bigger.</p>
<p>The technical challenges ahead may seem daunting, but the team at Climeworks is unfazed. In fact, Wurzbacher considers the current state of direct air capture to be much more favorable than that of wind and solar in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>“If you compare it to where solar PV or wind started, they had to do larger factors of cost reduction,” said Wurzbacher. “It’s actually good news that it’s only on the order of a factor of ten that we have to do.”</p>
<p>Achieving these cost reductions requires learning that can only take place in real-world conditions, not a laboratory or an office.</p>
<p>“It’s not a software startup,” said Wurzbacher. “We’re putting steel and concrete in harsh environments. Weird things happen that you can only predict maybe to ninety percent, but the last ten percent you can never predict, and then you learn it, so it’s so important to get stuff out in the field.”</p>

<h2>Why Iceland?</h2>
<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find a field site more majestic than Orca. The plant sits on the edge of a grassy plain, just beneath craggy black peaks accentuated with crisp white snow. But the Climeworks team didn’t choose to build Orca in that spot for the scenery. The site in Hellisheidi offers two elements that are essential for direct air capture: cheap renewable energy and a place to put CO<sub>2</sub>. Both of those elements are products of Iceland’s unique volcanic geology.</p>
<p>Orca is located directly next to the Hellisheidi Geothermal Power Plant, which is one of Iceland’s biggest sources of geothermal energy. The plant draws hot water from over a mile below the ground, where it’s naturally warmed by a volcanic hotspot. The geothermal process produces heat and electricity, both of which are key inputs to direct air capture.</p>
<p>The electricity is used to move air through the collector, and the heat is used to release captured CO<sub>2</sub> from the filter material, which happens at around 100 degrees Celsius, the temperature of boiling water.</p>
<p>“Geothermal is particularly good to start with, because it’s 24/7; it’s heat and electricity, so it’s really well suited to what we are doing,” said Wurzbacher.</p>
<p>Then there’s the CO<sub>2</sub>. The rock under Hellisheidi is porous basalt, less than 1 million years old, which means it’s pretty much brand new, geologically speaking. A company called <a href="https://www.carbfix.com/">Carbfix</a> has figured out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0011-8">how to inject CO<sub>2</sub></a> into this young rock so that it reacts to form carbonate minerals.</p>
<p>Carbfix is a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy, the municipal-owned utility that operates the geothermal plant. For over five years, it had been using its technique to store the small amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> released from the geothermal process, so the infrastructure to store the CO<sub>2</sub> from Orca was already in place.</p>
<p>“This is a big part of why Orca is in Iceland,” said McCormick. “They have waste heat and zero-carbon power from the geothermal field. They have already-drilled injection holes and excellent geology for injecting CO<sub>2</sub>, so that location has everything you want.”</p>
<p>Carbon storage is an essential piece of the equation for carbon removal. There are many ways to do it, but the Carbfix method is particularly promising because the carbon dioxide turns quickly into rock. It mineralizes within two years—or more likely a few months—and it will remain in that solid state for thousands of years.</p>
<p>“The CO<sub>2</sub> is not going anywhere, so basically once it’s underground, we know it’s going to stay underground,” said Kari Helgason, the head of research and innovation at Carbfix.</p>
<p>This time frame contrasts with other methods, like storage in abandoned oil wells, which requires indefinite monitoring to make sure that the CO<sub>2</sub> does not escape.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the Carbfix method is that the cost is almost negligible, especially relative to the high cost of capturing carbon.</p>
<p>“If we receive pure CO<sub>2</sub>, it’s pretty cost efficient,” said Helgason. “What we’re doing with Climeworks, it’s ridiculously cheap.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Iceland is comprised mostly of basalt, so the storage opportunities are almost limitless. Helgason estimates that each cubic kilometer of basalt can store one hundred million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>“The storage capacity is enormous,” he said.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Iceland where this massive storage capacity exists. Carbfix put together an<a href="https://www.carbfix.com/atlas"> online atlas</a> that maps out regions round the world with potential for geologic carbon storage.</p>
<p>Wurzbacher noted that Hellisheidi and Carbfix were a perfect match for the Orca plant, but Climeworks is open to other locations for subsequent projects.</p>
<p>“What is not so perfect is the weather and wind in Iceland,” he said. “If you ask our commissioning team if they want to build the next plant in the same weather conditions, they might rather ask for going to Hawaii or someplace else with a lot of volcanic rocks.”</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2241305,2241306,2241326,2241325"]</p>
<h2>It takes a village to capture carbon</h2>
<p>The partnership between Climeworks and Carbfix is an example of the collaborative innovation that’s needed for carbon removal to succeed. In an attempt to incentivize similar relationships, the US has allocated $3.5 billion for building four direct air capture “hubs,” where multiple companies will work together to capture and store CO<sub>2</sub>. The provision is part of the infrastructure bill recently passed in Congress.</p>
<p>“It’s really important to think of direct air capture as a partnership among a number of different groups,” said Rory Jacobson, deputy director of policy at Carbon180, a think tank focused on carbon removal.</p>
<p>Often, oil and gas companies have been part of direct air capture projects, usually in the role of financial backers. Carbon Engineering is partnering with Occidental Petroleum on its project in Texas, and another direct air capture company, Global Thermostat, is is<a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/inside-exxonmobils-hookup-carbon-removal-venture-global-thermostat"> partnering with Exxon Mobil</a> on several smaller projects in the US.</p>
<p>For carbon capture startups, it makes sense to work with these larger companies, because they can write big checks and have a deep understanding of geology, but such partnerships have also fueled claims that carbon capture is a smokescreen for continued pollution.</p>
<p>“The thing that’s really promising about Orca is that there is no clear fossil fuel involvement at all in the project,” said Jacobson.</p>
<p>With or without help from the fossil fuel industry, direct air capture is likely to face limits in its ability to scale without support from government climate policy. The problem is that there’s no inherent market for removing carbon from the atmosphere, like there is for the electric power generated from wind and solar. Direct air capture needs to be funded by voluntary purchases (such as those that have so far supported Climeworks) or government incentives and directives.</p>
<p>“The voluntary market for carbon removal will bring us to millions of tons, maybe ten million tons, maybe more,” said Wurzbacher. “Public instruments will have to bring us from tens of millions of tons to billions of tons.”</p>
<p>Some incentives are already in place. The US currently has a policy called <a href="https://carbon180.medium.com/enhancing-and-expanding-the-45q-tax-credit-for-direct-air-capture-85f0f00c98c">45Q</a> that pays $50 per ton for carbon capture and storage, and that payment would be expanded to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/congress-eyes-235b-in-clean-energy-subsidies-here-they-are/">$180 per ton</a> under the Build Back Better bill, which was recently passed by the House of Representatives but remains in limbo in the Senate.</p>
<p>However, direct air capture will have a much bigger market if governments charge high carbon taxes or enact other measures that force industries to steeply reduce or remove their emissions right away. At the recent United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, world leaders weren’t announcing those kinds of bold moves. That may change as both public pressure and the effects of climate change continue to intensify. Neither shows signs of letting up any time soon.</p>
<p>If stronger policies materialize in the coming years, Climeworks will be ready, with direct air capture technology that’s likely to be much cheaper than it is today. The price will still be high, but the price of doing nothing could be far higher.</p>

<p>First, everyone was talking about &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; the Korean psychological thriller that became Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1448045816308961280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest series launch</a> ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/netflix-says-142-million-households-watched-korean-series-squid-game/">142 million viewers</a>. Now, everyone&#8217;s talking about YouTuber MrBeast&#8217;s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recreation</a> of the show&#8217;s titular fight-to-the-death, which racked up 142 million views in eight days. (Don&#8217;t worry, no one was killed).</p>
<p>Jimmy Donaldson (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrBeast</a>), the 23-year-old who was <a href="https://blog.youtube/culture-and-trends/2021s-top-trending-videos-and-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just named</a> YouTube&#8217;s Top U.S. Creator for the second year in a row, built sets and made costumes for 456 competitors, making the video look as close to the Netflix show as possible. And, like the popular series, the last player standing would win a life-changing cash prize &#8212; in Donaldson’s case, competitors had the chance to win $456,000.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are a number of reasons why Donaldson’s “Squid Game” is almost as popular as “Squid Game” itself, at least by the number of views. For one thing, YouTube is free, and Netflix isn’t.</p>
<p>But Donaldson’s virality comes at a cost. His 25-minute video required a whopping $3.5 million to make, he said on <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1459407625389490183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1459407625389490183%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fentertainment%2Fmrbeast-reveals-insane-cost-of-highly-anticipated-squid-game-video-1697945%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>. For comparison, the nine-episode series cost Netflix a total of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21.4 million</a>, averaging out to about $2.4 million per hour-long installment.</p>
<p>Even the most popular YouTube creators like Donaldson can’t measure up to the resources that a publicly traded, global company like Netflix has. So for creators who make shocking, stunt-based videos like Donaldson, it’s getting harder to do something unprecedented, like recreating “Squid Game.”</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t had nine hours to spare since the September release of &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; here&#8217;s the premise: If you&#8217;re so deep in debt that you&#8217;ll never get out, why not fight to the death for the chance to win unfathomable wealth? This is director Hwang Dong-hyuk&#8217;s response to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/08/squid-game-lays-bare-south-koreas-real-life-personal-debt-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> South Korea&#8217;s debt crisis</a>, but international viewers can relate &#8212; the U.S. has<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/america-has-1point73-trillion-in-student-debtborrowers-from-these-states-owe-the-most.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1.73 trillion in student debt</a>, increasing by more than 91% over the last 10 years. If you&#8217;re someone who fears that one bad dental visit could deplete your life savings, it&#8217;s not hard to relate to these characters&#8217; desperation for quick cash.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; it turns out that a ring of wealthy elites created the games for their own entertainment &#8212; why not pay poor people to fight to the death if they agree to the terms of the game?</p>
<p>But in a far less extreme way, MrBeast&#8217;s videos do the same thing. He gives out large sums of money to ordinary people, entertains millions of viewers with his brand of performative philanthropy, then reaps the financial benefit of their attention.</p>
<p>Predictably,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MrBeast’s &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; video</a> lacked the emotional resonance and suspense that made the Netflix show so compelling &#8212; since there is nothing at risk for the participants, the stakes feel about as high as a daytime rerun of “Wheel of Fortune.” But Donaldson has pioneered &#8212; and perfected &#8212; this style of YouTube content: Do something outrageously absurd, and people will watch, because, on YouTube, time watched is money. However, the cost to capture users’ attention when pursuing this model requires an increasingly heftier investment over time.</p>
<p>As the creator economy grows, some YouTubers’ budgets are growing, too. But with the precarious nature of this work, falling into the red could be dangerous. While Netflix&#8217;s “Squid Game” has made at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/netflix-says-142-million-households-watched-korean-series-squid-game/">$891.1 million</a> so far (almost 42 times the size of its budget), Donaldson might not recoup his own &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; investment.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0e3GPea1Tyg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Going big until you can&#8217;t go bigger</strong></h2>
<p>In Donaldson&#8217;s video &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-HphHIJS9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How I Gave Away $1,000,000</a>,&#8221; the creator explains how he got started making this sort of content when Quidd, a digital collectibles app, offered him a $10,000 brand deal for a video. He filmed a video giving the $10,000 to a homeless person, and then Quidd kept paying him to make more videos, so it snowballed from there.</p>
<p>Today some of his most popular videos include even larger investments, like &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Y3Pkn95GI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Ate A $70,000 Golden Pizza</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxYjTTXc-J8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last To Leave Circle Wins $500,000</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6jC6VaO3j0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donating $100,000 To Streamers With 0 Viewers</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, MrBeast told the creator-focused YouTube channel<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCamLstJyCa-t5gfZegxsFMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Colin and Samir</a> that he spends<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW7cH2wLv00" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $4 million every month</a> to make his videos, and while some outperform his expectations, other videos don&#8217;t. He said that his video &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJH28ICkCdU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Sold My House For $1</a>&#8221; cost over $1 million to make, but he recouped less than half a million from ad revenue, and sponsorship money didn’t make up the difference. But as long as some videos do better than he expected, a slightly-less-viral video here and there won’t kill him.</p>
<p>“Once you know how to make a video go viral, it’s just about how to get as many out as possible,” he<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-22/who-is-mrbeast-meet-youtube-s-top-creator-of-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> told Bloomberg</a> last year. “You can practically make unlimited money.”</p>
<p>Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/12/18/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-of-2020/?sh=55bdb6c96e50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that Donaldson made $24 million on YouTube between June 2019 and June 2020 (YouTube isn’t his only income source – he also runs a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/dining/ghost-kitchen-mrbeast-burger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ghost kitchen</a> called MrBeast Burger, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mrbeast6000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streams</a> on Twitch and collaborates with a number of brands). But he said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYvmvr5_smQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> with fellow viral star Logan Paul that he puts most of his income directly back into his videos.</p>
<p>“If I make three or four million dollars a month, I just spend it on videos the next month,” Donaldson said. “We literally have like, razor-thin margins, and just reinvest it all.”</p>
<p>The problem with this clickbait model is that viewers become desensitized to these high-budget YouTube videos, which requires creators to keep upping the ante.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qfi9JpgMc2U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The comedian Demi Adejuyigbe also encountered this issue with his yearly videos in which he dances to &#8220;September&#8221; by Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire.</p>
<p>In his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPwG6L73-VU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first viral video</a> in 2016, he simply<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPpUYXZb2AA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> danced in his bedroom</a> wearing a homemade shirt that read &#8220;SEPT 21&#8221; on the front and &#8220;THAT&#8217;S TODAY&#8221; on the back. The following year, he got some fancy balloons, then in 2018, he<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG7YHFT4hjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> enlisted a children&#8217;s choir</a>, and in 2019, he hired a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hpU6UEq8hA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> mariachi band</a> &#8212; you get where this is going. This year, he decided he wasn&#8217;t going to make any more videos, because it&#8217;s too time-consuming and challenging to keep going bigger and better every year &#8212; so he<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfi9JpgMc2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> went all out</a> one last time and ended up raising over $1 million for charity from fans. But these “September” videos aren’t Adejuyigbe’s bread and butter. Going viral might have helped him get noticed in Hollywood, though. In between plotting each year’s “September” videos, he earned <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5093519/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing credits</a> on shows like “The Good Place” and “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”</p>
<p>A fashion and beauty creator, Safiya Nygaard, is another example. She first developed a following as a video producer at BuzzFeed, but<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aiRY5EwqPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> left</a> to invest in her own channel and retain more independence. Nygaard differentiated herself in the beauty space by doing “bad makeup experiments,” like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOFXPlUPOIg&amp;list=PLTJwUfUd8XBguvffQBb8-n1KTopgJzbUh&amp;index=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melting All My Nude Lipsticks Together</a>” or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahw3WH_UW7M&amp;list=PLTJwUfUd8XBguvffQBb8-n1KTopgJzbUh&amp;index=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixing All My Foundations Together</a>.” Over a year, this escalated to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3B-qp3U5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melting Every Candle From Bath &amp; Body Works Together</a>” and &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhllRWReNEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melting Every Lipstick From Sephora Together</a>.&#8221; For the latter video, she used more than 600 lipsticks &#8212; and with Sephora lipstick prices ranging from around $10 to $50, Nygaard’s bill was so expensive that she filmed the Sephora cashier calling her bank to verify the purchase.</p>
<p>But once you buy every lipstick at Sephora, you can’t really push further. Now, Nygaard updates her YouTube channel with almost 10 million subscribers only once or twice a month, though she started posting on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/reels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> every few days. Sometimes, even a TikTok might require a pricey purchase &#8212; in one <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany/video/6965594498302807301?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular TikTok</a>, Nygaard styles Balenciaga’s <a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/heeled-toe--black-636813W18061000.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,350 toe-heels</a>. Still, that’s a small purchase compared to 117 Bath and Body Works candles, or 600 Sephora lipsticks.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhllRWReNEE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Creators like Nygaard and Adejuyigbe have been able to pivot away from this high-cost, sometimes-low-reward content. But Donaldson&#8217;s high-budget videos are his lifeblood. He can&#8217;t stop making more and more extreme content if he wants his channel to remain at the top of the YouTube food chain.</p>
<h2><strong>Funding the creator economy</strong></h2>
<p>When startups need cash to fund the growth of their business, they turn to venture capital. Now, some firms are looking at viral creators as an investment opportunity in a time when video creation costs are growing. Venture capital firm SignalFire says that creators are the<a href="https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/#:~:text=More%20than%2050%20million%20people,%25)%20when%20they%20grow%20up." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fastest-growing small businesses</a>, and some firms like Sam Lessin&#8217;s Slow Ventures take that idea to the next level. Slow Ventures<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kb9mg/a-former-facebook-vp-thinks-investing-in-humans-is-the-future-of-vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recently invested</a> $1.7 million in the future of YouTuber Marina Mogilko, whose channel is called<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiq1FIgtEK7LRAOB1JXTPig" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Silicon Valley Girl</a> &#8212; they will get 5% of her earnings as a creator for the next 30 years.</p>
<p>Investing in literal people might seem sketchy, but assuming everyone involved has good intentions, is offering artists a financial cushion really the worst thing in the world? This is essentially what happens in Hollywood already. A production company might buy a script, hire talent and market a film, only for it to be a flop at the box office.</p>
<p>But creators &#8212; literal people &#8212; aren’t startups. And what happens when you keep trying to out-do yourself? You burn out.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the cushion of venture funding could take some financial burden off of creators, but the pressure to appease stakeholders could also add more stress.</p>
<p>YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki acknowledged the growing issue of burnout in a <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/my-final-letter-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to creators </a>in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard some creators say they feel like they can&#8217;t take a break from filming because they&#8217;re concerned their channel will suffer,&#8221; Wojcicki wrote. &#8220;If you need to take some time off, your fans will understand. After all, they tune into your channel because of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>YouTube’s product team found that creators only garner more views once they come back from breaks. But Drake McWhorter <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/tech/youtube-creator-burnout/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told CNN at the time</a> that he didn’t think this was true.</p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube is a treadmill,&#8221; McWhorter said. &#8220;If you stop for a second, you&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s easier than ever to go viral online, but that doesn’t always mean it’s easy to capture viewers’ attention in the long term &#8212; and to make a living on the internet, you need an audience. Now that MrBeast is making YouTube videos with Hollywood-sized budgets, yet still making a “razor-thin” profit, we have to ask: Who’s winning in the creator economy? At the end of the day, the success of “Real Life Squid Game” may be better news for YouTube, or even Netflix, than it is for Donaldson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The plan is simple: First, we create a knockoff of a popular digital service. Second, we cry political persecution. Third, we raise a bunch of money with a SPAC. And then, to cap it off, we take on AWS.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually funny is that I am not kidding. That is not only a real plan, but one that we&#8217;ve now seen twice.</p>

<p>We first got wind of the method of raising capital with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">the Trump SPAC deal</a> taking a collection of ideas and very little product public. And then we got another dose yesterday <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/">with online video hosting portal Rumble&#8217;s SPAC plan</a>. Both have long-term ambitions, or at least teasers, to take on the incumbent cloud players.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Good luck? That goal, about a hundred billion dollars, and 15 years might get you to quaternary status in the vicinity of where the big public clouds play.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at the Rumble scheme to conquer the digital world. After all, startups are designed to make big plans. Rumble&#8217;s plot to take on the combined heft of Amazon, Microsoft and Google is, if nothing else, not a small endeavor.</p>
<h2>Surely *this* is peak SPAC?</h2>
<p>Rumble, a self-described &#8220;neutral video platform,&#8221; is merging with CF Acquisition Corp. VI. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, per the companies. Here are <a href="https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/">the financial terms of the deal</a> (modestly condensed):</p>
<blockquote><p>The transaction values Rumble at an initial enterprise value of $2.1 billion, with current Rumble shareholders having the ability to earn additional shares of the combined company if the stock reaches price hurdles of $15.00 and $17.50 per share. The transaction is expected to provide approximately $400 million in proceeds to Rumble, including a fully committed PIPE of $100 million at $10.00 per share and $300 million of cash held in the trust account of CFVI.</p></blockquote>
<p>You are correct in being surprised that Rumble is worth $2.1 billion, or will be next year when it combines with the blank-check company. After all, we don&#8217;t really know that much about it.</p>
<p>Crunchbase data has a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rumble-inc-2-series-unknown--d2098ab7">single funding event</a> on record for the company, a May 2021 round with capital arriving from Peter Thiel and J.D. Vance. At the time, the company was worth around $500 million, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-j-d-vance-invest-in-rumble-video-platform-popular-on-political-right-11621447661?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter">per The Wall Street Journal</a>. The Journal also notes that Rumble was founded in 2013, but only recently found more mainstream popularity after right-wing figures began to promote the service as &#8220;a more welcoming, free-speech alternative&#8221; to video offerings from major platform players like Meta and Alphabet.</p>

The new feature is rolling out [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Messenger <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/12/03/close-out-the-year-with-messengers-new-expression-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that it&#8217;s starting to test out a new &#8220;Split Payments&#8221; feature that introduces a way for users to share the cost of bills and expenses through the app. The company says the new feature is a &#8220;free and fast&#8221; way to handle finances through Messenger. The new feature is rolling out next week for U.S. users.</p>
<p>To use Split Payments, users need to click on the “Get Started” button in a group chat or the Payments Hub in Messenger. From there, you can split a bill evenly or modify the contribution amount for each individual in the group chat, either with or without yourself included. You&#8217;ll also have the option to enter a personalized message. Lastly, you will be asked to confirm your Facebook Pay details, after which your request will be sent and viewable in your group chat thread.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’ve struggled with dividing up (and getting paid back for) group dinners, shared household expenses or even the monthly rent, it’s about to get easier,&#8221; the company said in a blog post about the new feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The launch of Split Payments comes as Messenger added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/messenger-adds-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-the-u-s/">Venmo-like QR codes</a> for person-to-person payments a few months ago. The codes launched in the U.S. and allow anyone to send or request money through Facebook Pay — even if they’re not Facebook friends. The feature can be accessed under the “Facebook Pay” section in Messenger’s settings.</p>
<p>Facebook Pay first <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/simplifying-payments-with-facebook-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in November 2019, as a way to establish a payment system that extends across the company’s apps for not just person-to-person payments, but for other things like donations and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Split Payments was introduced alongside a few other Messenger updates, including four new group AR effects designed with creators Emma Chamberlain, Zach King, Bella Poarch and King Bach. The company notes that it also recently launched two new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; Soudmojis, which are emoji that play a sound when you send them within Messenger, and a new chat theme. Messenger also recently rolled out a new Taylor Swift Soudmoji to celebrate the release of &#8220;Red.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Friday, which means the whole crew was aboard for this particular episode. We had <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris</a> behind the scenes, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> on the mics. And, frankly, we needed the full team, because the holidays aren&#8217;t slowing any news down.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>First up? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">Square becoming Block</a>, which we wanted to make fun of but mostly found to be reasonable, given the company&#8217;s disparate interests.</li>
<li>From there we chatted about Inpathy&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/inpathy-aims-to-be-a-social-network-that-mirrosrs-real-human-experience/">neat take</a> on social networking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/massive-wants-to-rent-your-spare-compute-power-to-pay-for-apps/">Massive&#8217;s $11 million funding round</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/butter-raises-7m-to-end-accidental-churn-due-to-payment-failure/">why Butter could help grease the skids</a> of many a subscription business.</li>
<li>Then it was time to trade startups for bigger companies, as we had to riff on Bret Taylor&#8217;s quasi-ascension to the top of Salesforce along with a host of other executive exits. Alex calls it cold resignation winter, but Meta clearly has put some people on the hot seat.</li>
<li>Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">was also in our remit this week</a>, due to its fundraising and layoffs. We debate if you should raise if it comes at the cost of your employees, and the morality of a Zoom layoff.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/sounding-board-lands-series-b-to-move-coaching-beyond-services-and-into-saas/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Sounding Board&#8217;s Series B</a> reminded us that executive coaching, even and especially for the folks above, isn&#8217;t just a services business. It&#8217;s a SaaS business.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you here next week, unless Jack shaves off his beard and we&#8217;re forced to do a shot.</p>
