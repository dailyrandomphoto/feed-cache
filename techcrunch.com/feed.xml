										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grab Financial Group <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-financial-groups-fintech-leadership-recognised-in-series-a-funding-round-of-over-us300-million/">said today </a>it has raised more than $300 million in Series A funding, led by South Korean firm Hanhwa Asset Management, with participation from K3 Ventures, GGV Capital, Arbor Ventures and Flourish Ventures.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e5143de1-b7f8-4410-898f-b4f9bdec823d">Financial Times reports</a> that the funding values Grab Financial, a subsidiary of ride-hailing and delivery giant Grab, at $3 billion. Both K3 Ventures and GGV Capital were early investors in Grab, which was founded in 2012.</p>
<p>Back in February 2020, Grab announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/grab-and-gojek-began-discussing-a-potential-merger-more-than-three-months-ago/">had raised $856 million in funding</a> to grow its payment and financial services. That news came during speculation that Grab and Gojek, one of it top rivals, were finally getting closer to a merger after lengthy discussions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the Grab-Gojek talks stalled, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/gojek-is-said-in-talks-with-tokopedia-for-18-billion-merger">Gojek is now reportedly in talks to merge with Indonesia e-commerce platform Tokopedia</a> instead. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/gojek-is-said-in-talks-with-tokopedia-for-18-billion-merger">According to Bloomberg</a>, the combined company would be worth $18 billion, making it a more formidable rival to Grab.</p>
<p>In its funding announcement, Grab Financial Group said its total revenues grew more than 40% in 2020, compared to 2019. This driven by strong consumer adoption of services like AutoInvest, an investment platform that allows users to invest small amounts of money at a time through the Grab app and insurance products. Grab Financial announced the launch of several financial products for consumers and SMEs in August 2020.</p>
<p>Usagea of digital financial services by consumers and SMEs in Southeast Asia increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-economy-sea.appspot.com/assets/pdf/e-Conomy_SEA_2020_Report.pdf">report</a> published by Google, Temasek and Bain &amp; Company in November, usage of banking apps and online payments, remittances, insurance products and robo-advisor investment platforms all grew in 2020, and the region’s financial services market may be reach $60 billion in revenue by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sennder.com/">Sennder</a>, a large digital road freight forwarder based out of Germany, has raised $160m in Series D financing. The round was led by an unnamed party, but round participants included Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania. To date, Sennder has raised more than $260m, allowing it to lay claim to a potential $1bn valuation.</p>
<p>Sennder directly connects enterprise shippers with trucking companies, thus disintermediating the traditional freight model. It says it will move over 1 million truckloads this year. So far it’s concentrated on the lucrative European market. In June 2020 it merged with French competitor Everoad and acquired Uber Freight’s European business last September. The European logistics and freight sector has a market size of $427bn.</p>
<p>Sennder competes with large incumbents like Wincanton and CH Robinson as well as other startups such as OnTrac in Spin, and Instafreight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The whole digital freight forwarding market is booming. Only last November, Germany’s Forto, a digital freight forwarder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">raised</a> another $50 million in funding taking its total raised to $103 million. And in 2018 FreightHub, another European digital freight forwarder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/freighthub-b/">raised</a> $30 million in Series B financing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Sennder’s new investment will mean it can expand in European markets. It already partners with Poste Italiane in Italy, as well as Scania and Siemens, and is now supplying transport services to over 10 organizations listed in the German DAX 30, and 11 companies comprising the Euro Stoxx 50.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2015 by David Nothacker, Julius Köhler and Nicolaus Schefenacker, the company has grown to 800 employees and seven international offices.</p>
<p>David Nothacker, CEO and Co-Founder of Sennder, said: “We are now an established industry player on equal terms with other more traditional sector pioneers, but have maintained our founding spirit. As a data-driven company, we contribute to making the logistics industry fit for a sustainable future; ensuring transparency, flexibility and efficiency in the distribution of goods. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a digitalized logistics industry.</p>
<p>Sonali De Rycker, Partner at Accel commented: “It is always fantastic to see a portfolio company reach such a significant milestone. 2020 highlighted the value that Sennder’s innovative digital offering brings to the freight industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh off the announcement of more than $500 million in new capital across two new funds, Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group has announced that they&#8217;re adding Anu Sharma and Daniel Li to the team&#8217;s list of Partners.</p>
<p>The firm, which in recent years has paid particularly close attention to enterprise software bets, invests heavily in the early-stage Pacific Northwest startup scene.</p>
<p>Both Li and Sharma are stepping into the Partner role after some time at the firm. Li has been with Madrona for five years while Sharma joined the team in 2020. Prior to joining Madrona, Sharma led product management teams at Amazon Web Services, worked as a software developer at Oracle and had a stint in VC as an associate at SoftBank China &amp; India. Li previously worked at the Boston Consulting Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U1UZi77aN6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/seattle-based-madrona-raises-320m-for-its-eighth-fund/">Seattle-based Madrona raises $345M for its eighth early-stage fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seattle-based Madrona raises $345M for its eighth early-stage fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/seattle-based-madrona-raises-320m-for-its-eighth-fund/embed/#?secret=U1UZi77aN6" data-secret="U1UZi77aN6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I got the chance to catch up with Li who notes that the promotion won&#8217;t necessarily mean a big shift in his day-to-day responsibilities &#8212; &#8220;At Madrona, you&#8217;re not promoted until you&#8217;re working in the next role anyway,&#8221; he says &#8212; but that he appreciates &#8220;how much trust the firm places in junior investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about leveling up his venture career during a time when public and private markets seem particularly flush with cash, Li acknowledges some looming challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;On one hand, it&#8217;s just been an amazing five years to join venture capital because things have just been up and to the right with lots of things that work; it&#8217;s just a super exciting time,&#8221; Li says. &#8220;On the other hand, from a macro perspective, you know that there&#8217;s more capital flowing into VC as an asset class than ever before. And just from that pure macro perspective, you know that that means returns are going to be lower in the next 10 years as valuations are higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Li is plenty bullish on internet companies claiming larger swaths of the global GDP and hopes to invest specifically in &#8220;low code platforms, next-gen productivity, and online communities,&#8221; Madrona notes in their announcement, while Sharma plans to continue looking at to &#8220;distributed systems, data infrastructure, machine learning, and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch recently talked to Li and his Madrona colleague Hope Cochran about some of the top trends in social gaming and how investors were approaching new opportunities across the gaming industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quite a bit has happened since Snap announced last week that it was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/"> indefinitely locking President Trump&#8217;s Snapchat account</a>. But after temporary bans from his Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts as well as a permanent ban from Twitter, Snap has decided that it will also be making its ban of the President&#8217;s Snapchat account permanent.</p>
<p>Though Trump&#8217;s social media preferences as a user are clear, Snapchat gave the Trump campaign a particularly effective platform to target young users who are active on the service. A permanent ban will undoubtedly complicate his future business and political ambitions as he finds himself removed from most mainstream social platforms.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s deplatorming follows riots last week at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob emboldened by the President himself. Since then, a number of companies have severed ties with the Trump brand, while social platforms have aimed to minimize Trump&#8217;s presence on their platforms in his final days as President and beyond.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap says it made the decision in light of repeated attempted violations of the company&#8217;s community guidelines that had been made over the past several months by the President&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last week we announced an indefinite suspension of President Trump’s Snapchat account, and have been assessing what long term action is in the best interest of our Snapchat community. In the interest of public safety, and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence, which are clear violations of our guidelines, we have made the decision to permanently terminate his account,” a Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s decision to permanently ban the President was first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-snapchat-will-permanently-ban-trumps-account-05419dd3-fed6-4614-9ed0-c2d606ef0e62.html">Axios</a>.</p>

<p>In the video, Trump instructs his followers to shun violence, calling it un-American. &#8220;No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence,&#8221; he said, days after calling rioters &#8220;great patriots&#8221; and telling them &#8220;we love you, you&#8217;re very special&#8221; as they despoiled the House and Senate.</p>
<p>He pivoted after a few minutes to the topic that, after his historic second impeachment, is almost certainly foremost on his mind: being banned from his chief instrument of governance, Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days,&#8221; he said, although the bans and other actions are all due to documented breaches of the platforms&#8217; rules. &#8220;The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>After having his @realdonaldtrump handle suspended by Twitter, Trump attempted to sockpuppet a few other prominent accounts of allies, but was swiftly shut down. What everyone assumed must be plans to join Parler were scuttled along with the social network itself, which has warned it may be permanently taken offline after Amazon and other internet infrastructure companies refused to host it.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering how Trump was able to slip this one past Twitter&#8217;s pretty decisive ban to begin with, we were curious too.</p>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>This Tweet is not in violation of the Twitter Rules. As we previously made clear, other official administration accounts, including @WhiteHouse, are permitted to Tweet as long as they do not demonstrably engage in <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/ban-evasion">ban evasion</a> or share content that otherwise violates the Twitter Rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, while Trump the person was banned, Trump the <em>head of the Executive branch </em>may still have some right, in the remaining week he holds the office, to utilize Twitter as a way of communicating matters of importance to the American people.</p>
<p>This gives a somewhat unfortunate impression of a power move, as Twitter has put itself in the position of determining what is a worthwhile transmission and what is a rabble-rousing incitement to violence. I&#8217;ve asked the company to clarify how it is determined whether what Trump does on this account is considered ban evasion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, almost simultaneous with Trump&#8217;s surprise tweet, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690">unloaded 13 tweets&#8217; worth of thoughts</a> about the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.</span></p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Jack neither reaches any real conclusions nor illuminates any new plans, but it&#8217;s clear he is thinking real hard about this. As he notes, however, it&#8217;ll take a lot of work to establish the &#8220;one humanity working together&#8221; he envisions as a sort of stretch goal for Twitter and the internet in general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. safety regulators have asked Tesla to recall 158,000 vehicles over media control unit failures that cause the touchscreen displays to stop working, following a months-long investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>The Office of Defects Investigation unit of the agency determined that the failure of the media control unit is a safety issue since functions like the backup camera and defogging and defrosting setting controls stop working as well as audible chimes, which are used when the turn signal indicator is activated and to alert drivers while the vehicle&#8217;s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system is engaged. Reports of the MCUs suddenly failing have been a topic for years in Tesla forums.</p>
<p>The failure is caused when the memory storage in a flash drive used in the used in these vehicles reaches capacity, investigators concluded. The only solution is to replace the physical piece of hardware. Vehicles affected include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 as well as Model X SUVs in 2016 through 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company did provide information to NHTSA, which is contained in the report. Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device’s finite storage capacity. Tesla provided its own statistical model showing the number of projected weekly MCU repairs from 2020 to 2028. The automaker estimated that replacement rates for MCU failures will peak in early 2022 and gradually decline until (near) full part turnover has been accomplished in 2028, according to the report.</p>
<p>These vehicles are equipped with an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device. Part of this 8GB storage capacity is used each time the vehicle is started. The eMMC NAND cell hardware fails when the storage capacity is reached, resulting in failure of the MCU, the agency said.</p>
<p>The eMMC NAND flash device&#8217;s lifespan based upon the number of program/erase cycles, after which the MCU fails due to memory wear-out. Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P/E cycles would take only 5 to 6 years, the agency said.</p>
<p>The agency has officially requested that Tesla initiate a recall to notify all owners, purchasers, and dealers of the subject vehicles of this safety defect and provide a remedy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tokyo-based <a href="https://soda-inc.jp/">SODA</a>, which runs sneaker reselling platform <a href="https://snkrdunk.com/">SNKRDUNK</a>, has raised a $22 million Series B led by SoftBank Ventures Asia. Investors also included basepartners, Colopl Next, THE GUILD and other strategic partners. Part of the funding will be used to expand into other Asian countries. Most of SNKRDUNK’s transactions are within Japan now, but it plans to become a cross-border marketplace.</p>
<p>Along with SODA’s $3 million Series A last year, this brings the startup’s total funding to $25 million.</p>
<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic was initially expected to put a damper on the sneaker resell market, C2C marketplaces have actually seen their business increase. For example, StockX, one of the biggest sneaker resell platforms in the world (which hit a valuation of $2.8 billion after its recent Series E), <a href="https://www.complex.com/sneakers/2020/07/stockx-biggest-months-ever-may-june-2020">said May and June 2020</a> were its biggest months for sales ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>SNKRDUNK’s sales also grew last year, and in December 2020, it recorded a 3,000% year-over-year increase in monthly gross merchandise value. Chief executive officer Yuta Uchiyama told TechCrunch this was because demand for sneakers remained high, while more people also started buying things online.</p>

<p>Launched in 2018, SNKRDUNK now has 2.5 million monthly users, which it says makes it the largest C2C sneaker marketplace in Japan. The Series B will allow it to speed up the pace of its international expansion, add more categories and expand its authentication facilities.</p>
<p>Like StockX and GOAT, SNKRDUNK’s user fees cover authentication holds before sneakers are sent to buyers. The company partners with FAKE BUSTERS, an authentication service based in Japan, to check sneakers before they are sent to buyers.</p>
<p>In addition to its marketplace, SNKRDUNK also runs a sneaker news site and an online community.</p>
<p>SODA plans to work with other companies in SoftBank Venture Asia’s portfolio that develop AI-based tech to help automate its operations, including logistics, payment, customer service and counterfeit inspection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One in five people have a mental health illness. <a href="https://pace.group/">Pace</a>, a new startup founded by Pinterest and Affirm executives, wants to pay attention to the other four in that statistic.</p>
<p>“Nobody is perfectly mentally healthy all the time,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackwchou/">Jack Chou</a>, Pace co-founder. “It’s a non-existent idea, everyone is sort of swimming in between being clinically mentally unhealthy and perfectly mentally happy.”</p>
<p>While diagnosable mental health conditions might get an individual medication or therapy, those that live in a grey space might still need resources to stay afloat. After Chou experienced the <a href="https://medium.com/pacetogether/why-mental-health-is-about-everyone-and-why-we-started-pace-d68485671be">detrimental effects of burnout</a> while working for Pinterest and Affirm, and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecatlee/">Cat Lee</a>, formerly of Pinterest and Maveron, experienced a personal travesty, the former colleagues realized there needed to be a way to help people who didn’t fit squarely into one bucket.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So Pace, which launched out of private beta today, wants to address this fallacy by creating small-group training classes for people interested in taking care of their emotional and mental health. It is launching with $1.9 million in seed funding. Investors include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nellie-levchin-90b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nellie-levchin-90b/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErQXtGfLksRpmjRycCCLy0iv3v4g">Nellie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUXTnHgue12gcBfW3eif4HWPqhfQ">Max Levchin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKeF1BfnxFSod6YBch8B-f6_FMzA">Jeff Weiner</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliechoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliechoi/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmX2cQz7jbvnNOcdUYxHFpT6fLFg">Emilie Choi</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silbermann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/silbermann/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQ_YLngNl2hokCfQxAWTQLD_sSAQ">Ben Silbermann</a>, Box Group, and SV Angel.</p>
<p>The core of the product is a 90-minute live video group session once a week, delivered through Pace’s platform. The video component integrates with Twilio and Agora (and interestingly, not Zoom, because its SDK lacks personalization options). Users can attend the sessions on Web, iOS or Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096056" style="width: 882px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096056" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2096056" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png" alt="" width="872" height="544" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png 1826w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=1536,959 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096056" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pace</p></div></p>
<p>Pace forms cohorts of eight to 10 people around shared interest or identities, such as a founder group or parent group. Then, Pace interviews a new user for 15 to 30 minutes to learn about what they hope to get out of the experience.</p>
<p>Once a group is formed, they meet weekly with a facilitator at the helm. While it’s not trying to be a therapy replacement, the startup is looking for facilitators who are licensed in mental health practice. To help them do this, Pace secured two founding members who are psychologists: Dr. Kerry Makin-Byrd and Dr. Vivian Oberling.</p>
<p>When users sign on, they are prompted to pick three words that describe themselves from dozens of options. Those words show up under their video as they talk, and help skip some small talk in the beginning of the sessions.</p>

<p>The group talks about a variety of topics, from how to manage stress to how to adapt to a remote world. There is no formal curriculum, but each class has a takeaway for participants to leave with.</p>
<p>Pace doesn’t follow any specific curriculum during the meetings, but instead uses the time for people to talk through their feelings. Facilitators are licensed mental health clinicians, with the majority of the leaders being part-time or freelancers. It plans to introduce asynchronous ways for group members to chat and stay in touch beyond the weekly class, as well as spend time building out a product that feels beyond a Zoom call.</p>
<p>Mental health software startups are on a tear right now. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/">Lyra Health raised $175 million at a $2.25 billion valuation</a> to connect employees to therapists and mental health services. Another telehealth provider, Talkspace, announced today that it was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/13/talkspace-to-go-public-in-1-4-billion-spac-deal/">going public through a SPAC</a>. There’s also Calm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">last valued at $2 billion</a>, and Headspace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/headspace-raises-53-million-and-40-million-in-debt-as-it-pursues-clinical-validation-for-mindfulness/">its biggest competitor</a> in the mindfulness app space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q0L6eeIY6H"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">Calm raises $75M more at $2B valuation</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Pace’s focus is more similar to the latter than the former: It’s avoiding the telehealth label and positioning itself more as supplementary to formal health services.</p>
<p>“Our hope is that as [therapists] have individual patients who they’d like to incorporate some group work, or need a next thing, that we’re here for that too,” says Chou.</p>
<p>One of Pace’s closest competitors is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/coa-seed-soulcycle-for-your-soul/">Coa</a>, which launched with $3 million in seed funding in October 2020. The startup is similarly using small-group fitness culture and applying it to mental health. It mixes lecture-style teaching with breakout sessions to breed conversation.</p>
<p>Pace wouldn’t expand on how it differentiates from Coa beyond alluding to upcoming product features and community investments. Coa charges $25 for drop-in classes (sticking to that fitness class theme) while Pace charges $45 per week for the same group to meet for months at a time. While Coa has licensed therapists, Pace has licensed mental health clinicians.</p>
<p>Coa co-founders Alexa Meyer and Dr. Emily Anhalt say their service is unique from Pace in a curriculum perspective.</p>
<p>“Although all of Coa’s classes are facilitated by licensed therapists, Coa’s classes are different from group therapy,” Meyer said. Coa uses Anhalt’s research around mental happiness to create programming. Both companies are still pre-launch, but Coa says it has 6,000 people on its waitlist.</p>

<p>For both startups, the hurdles ahead are common for any startup: customer acquisition, effectiveness in tracking outcomes and scaling an innately emotional and personalized experience. As Homebrew’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk">Hunter Walk</a> pointed out<a href="https://hunterwalk.com/2021/01/10/why-i-worry-about-venture-backed-mental-health-addiction-startups/"> in a recent blog post</a>, vulnerable populations being exposed to venture-level risk is a difficult phenomenon. Startups fail often, and in this case, that could mean leaving without once-critical support people who are depending on group therapy.</p>
<p>Going forward, the real winner in the mental health fitness space will come down to a thoughtful curriculum and a user experience that brings out vulnerability in people even over a virtual setting. Regardless, innovation pouring into the sector couldn’t come at a better time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last several years have seen a substantial increase of ability for robotic exoskeleton technology. Completely understandable. For one thing, it’s that rare technology you encounter that really feels like it’s going to change lives for the better the first time you see it. I’ve had a number of demos with companies that frankly took my breath away &#8212; watching someone walk across the room for the first time in years while their spouse stands by you crying will do that.</p>
<p>For another thing, there are two distinct use cases for this tech. The first is the aforementioned mobility &#8212; whether it&#8217;s full paralysis or simply helping people with walking impairments move a bit more easily. The second is work. Exoskeletons have great potential to ease the burden of lifting heavy objects or standing for extended periods. For this reason, many companies like Esko Bionics have created two distinct divisions to serve both sides.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;At least one of Samsung’s new robots is definitely coming out (hint: it’s the vacuum)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/at-least-one-of-samsungs-new-robots-is-definitely-coming-out-hint-its-the-vacuum/embed/#?secret=56F9YyOnM0" data-secret="56F9YyOnM0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So it’s a big, potential market &#8212; albeit one that’s still going to take a number of years to mature. For that reason, we’re really only talking rough projections here. I do think there’s still space for some smaller companies to carve out a meaningful business in the category.</p>
<p>I also won’t be surprised when more big companies get involved in the category. It’s a good way to put your stamp on the robotics category. Samsung’s GEMS is certainly the biggest-name product in the category this week at CES &#8212; even if it didn’t warrant a ton of stage time. It debuted at the event two years ago and we were able to try it out. For now, the news centered around hardware improvements like battery and the beginning of clinical trials – a necessary part of bringing this sort of healthcare or healthcare-adjacent product to market.</p>

<p>As with most of Samsung’s robotics announced at the show this week, the jury is very much still out with regards to how seriously the company is taking the product. Last year it made a brief appearance at CES as part of an “immersive workout experience.”</p>

<p>Some smaller companies have shown off compelling entries. Japan-based Archelis Inc. is top of mind, showcasing the ArchelisFX, whose name derives from the Japanese word for &#8220;walkable chair.&#8221; The device is designed for a number of different scenarios, including back pain and those who have recently undergone surgery. The company says it will be available to rent or buy for around $5,000.</p>
<p>On the whole, the exoskeletons on display at this year’s virtual CES tend largely toward the mobility side of the equation. Notably absent was Sarcos Robotics, which announced a partnership with Delta Airlines at last year’s event. In September, the company built on that interest to raise a $40 million round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://weezy.co.uk/">Weezy</a> — an on-demand supermarket that delivers groceries in as fast as 15 minutes — has raised $20 million in a Series A funding led by New York-based venture capital fund Left Lane Capital. Also participating were U.K.-based fund DN Capital, earlier investors Heartcore Capital and angel investors, notably Chris Muhr, the Groupon founder.</p>
<p>Although the company hasn&#8217;t made mention of a later U.S. launch, the presence of U.S. investors would tend to suggest that. Weezy is reminiscent of Kozmo, the on-demand groceries business <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozmo.com">from the dot-com boom</a> of the late &#8217;90s. However, it differs from Postmates in that it doesn&#8217;t do pickups.</p>
<p>The cash injection will be used to expand its grocery delivery service across London and the broader UK, and open two fulfillment centers across London. Some 40 more U.K. sites are planned by the end of 2021 and it plans to add 50 new employees in the next four months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in July 2020, Weezy uses its own delivery people on pedal cycles or electric mopeds to deliver goods in less than 15 minutes on average. As well as working with wholesalers, it also sources groceries from independent bakers, butchers and markets.</p>
<p>It has pushed at an open door during the pandemic. In Q2 2020, half a million new shoppers joined the grocery delivery sector, which is now worth £14.3 billion in the U.K., according to research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/blog/every-day-is-tag-day-is-your-pet-protected/">around 10 million pets</a> go missing in the U.S., and millions of those end up in shelters where they aren&#8217;t always reunited with their owners, due to their lack of identification or a microchip. A new mobile app, <a href="https://shadowapp.com/">Shadow</a>, aims to tackle this problem by leveraging a combination of a volunteer network and A.I. technology to help dog owners, in particular.</p>
<p>The startup is working in partnership with animal shelters and rescue organizations around the U.S. to pull in photos of the dogs they&#8217;re currently housing, then supplements this with photos pulled from social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>It then uses A.I. technology to match the photograph of the missing dogs to possible matches from nearby shelters or the web.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095976" style="width: 642px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095976" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?w=632" alt="" width="632" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,827 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=632,680 632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shadow</p></div></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s not a match found, Shadow will then programmatically set a search radius based on where and when the dog went missing, and suggest other actions that the dog&#8217;s owner can take as the next steps.</p>
<p>This includes viewing all the photographs from the shelters directly, in the case that the technology matching process missed a possible match, as well as working with other Shadow users to help crowdsource activities like hanging &#8220;Lost Dog&#8221; flyers around a neighborhood, for example.</p>
<p>The app also relies on a network of volunteers who help by also reviewing shelter photographs and broadcasting missing posters to social media sites they use to increase the chances of the dog being found. Dog owners can even advertise a reward in the app to encourage people to help search.</p>
<p>Today, Shadow has grown its volunteer user base to over 30,000. And it&#8217;s partnered with the ASPCA, Animal Care Centers of New York and L.A., the Dallas shelter system and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095977" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095977" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?w=574" alt="" width="574" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=127,150 127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=253,300 253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,910 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=574,680 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shadow</p></div></p>
<p>While Shadow is free to use, it makes money through a virtual tipping mechanism when it makes a successful match and the dog is found. It also offers users the ability to buy an Instagram ad in-app for $10. Here, Shadow provides the visual assets and manages the ad-buying process and placement process on owners&#8217; behalf.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by former Zocdoc founder Cyrus Massoumi, has been in a sort of public stealth mode for a few years as it grew beyond its hometown of New York. It&#8217;s now offering dog-finding services in 76 counties across 20 U.S. states.</p>
<p>We should note that Massoumi&#8217;s exit from Zocdoc was complicated. <a href="https://www.axios.com/zocdoc-health-tech-startup-lawsuit-new-york-5c151b39-d9ea-449f-b0fd-3e6933b3261d.html">He sued his co-founders and CFO</a> for orchestrating a plot to oust him from the company during a Nov. 2015 board meeting, claiming fraud. The lawsuit <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/zocdoc-swings-back-ousted-ceos-fraud-allegations">detailed the internal strife</a> inside Zocdoc at the time. A New York Supreme Court judge recently determined this lawsuit, which is ongoing, needs to be filed in Delaware, instead of New York. So a ruling is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, Zocdoc <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zocdocs-company-culture-2015-7">had been accused by Business Insider</a> of having developed a stressful, &#8220;bro culture,&#8221; in which young, male employees would make inappropriate remarks about the women who worked there. This was ahead of the larger rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement">#MeToo</a> movement, which has since impacted how businesses address these issues in the workplace.</p>
<p>Massoumi disputes the claims were exactly as described by the article. The company had 300 salespeople at the time, and while he agrees some people may have acted inappropriately, he also believes the company&#8217;s response to those actions was handled properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The allegations were fully investigated at Zocdoc and found to be without merit,&#8221; he told TechCrunch, adding that Zocdoc was repeatedly recognized as a &#8220;best place to work&#8221; while he was CEO. (There were never allegations against Massoumi, but ultimately, the buck stops with the CEO.)</p>
<p>Shadow today claims a different makeup. It has a team of 12 people, and two-thirds of its product and engineering team are women. Some Zocdoc investors have also returned to back Massoumi again.</p>
<p>The startup is funded by Founders Fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/humbition-is-a-new-fund-led-by-the-indiegogos-slava-rubin/">Humbition</a> (Massoumi and Indiegogo founder Slava Rubin&#8217;s fund), Lux Capital, firstminute Capital, and other angels, including a prior Zocdoc investor.</p>
<p>Despite the complicated Zocdoc history, the work Shadow is doing is solving a problem many people do care about. Millions of pet owners lose their pets to euthanization as they end up at shelters that cannot keep animals indefinitely due to lack of space. Meanwhile, the current system of having lost-pet messages distributed across social media can mean many of those posts aren&#8217;t seen &#8212; especially in larger metros where there are numerous &#8220;lost pet&#8221; groups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095978" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095978" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2095978" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shadow-screenshot-2.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095978" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shadow</p></div></p>
<p>As Shadow began its work in 2018, it was local to the New York area. Its first year, it reunited 600 dogs. The next year, it reunited 2,000 dogs. The third year, it reunited 5,000 dogs. Today, it&#8217;s nearing 10,000 dogs reunited with owners.</p>
<p>More than half of those were since the pandemic began, which saw many new pet owners and increased time spent outdoors with those pets, when dogs can sometimes get loose.</p>
<p>Massoumi says he was inspired to found Shadow after a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlTcJiCDmj7/">friend</a> lost his own dog, the namesake Shadow. It took the friend over a month to find the dog after both following false leads and being connected with people who tried to help him.</p>
<p><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/273420927" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking to myself, this is something that happens 100 million times a year, globally … and for people who love pets, this is a lost family member,&#8221; Massoumi explains. &#8220;It seemed to me to be a similar problem that I&#8217;d already been solving in healthcare, where there&#8217;s fragmentation &#8212; people want to see the doctor and the doctor wants to see the patient, but there&#8217;s just not a central way to make it work,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>More broadly, he wants to see technology being put to good use to solve problems that people actually care about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there needs to be more technology that injects the humanity back in what everyone does. I think that it&#8217;s very core that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With many social networks suddenly reevaluating their policies in light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">recent political violence in the U.S.</a>, the popular messaging app Telegram has begun chipping away at an organized network of neo-Nazi and white supremacist accounts flourishing on the platform.</p>
<p>Telegram confirmed to TechCrunch that it has removed dozens of channels over the course of the last day, citing concerns that the accounts were inciting violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Terms of Service expressly forbid public calls to violence,&#8221; Telegram spokesperson Mike Ravdonikas told TechCrunch. &#8220;&#8230;In the past 24 hours we have blocked dozens of public channels that published calls to violence for thousands of subscribers.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Asked if those takedowns relate to last week&#8217;s violent siege of the U.S. Capitol, Ravdonikas said that Telegram will &#8220;examine all incoming reports&#8221; and that the company is &#8220;monitoring the current situation closely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company confirmed that a number of accounts TechCrunch had previously observed promoting white supremacy, Nazi iconography and other forms of far-right extremism were part of the new enforcement action, which is still expanding. Some of the blocked channels were still viewable on Telegram&#8217;s web client Wednesday.</p>
<p>One of those now-removed groups bemoaned Telegram&#8217;s bans Tuesday in a post displaying a Nazi flag and the warning &#8220;you can&#8217;t kill an idea.&#8221; Prior to being taken down, that channel boasted more than 10,000 followers.</p>
<p>Many extremist channels began publicizing backup accounts Tuesday, pointing subscribers to dozens of other groups where they could continue to gather. Other sympathetic channels chronicled the bans in real-time, posting screenshots documenting violations of Telegram&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>The cluster of far-right accounts Telegram closed were largely not focused on mainstream U.S. politics or pro-Trump conspiracies. Some of the channels even spoke derisively of QAnon&#8217;s outlandish beliefs, dismissing them as a distraction. Many of the channels openly advocated for racial purity through strategic tactics, some gleaned through guides to guerrilla warfare and other texts admins provided for users through Telegram&#8217;s hosted files feature. One account advertised itself as &#8220;The Neo-Nazi Accelerationists your girlfriend told you not to worry about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Telegram&#8217;s new batch of takedowns appears to be connected to an effort by self-described anti-fascist and activist Gwen Snyder, who marshaled Twitter users in a &#8220;mass-reporting campaign&#8221; following last week&#8217;s violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years, we&#8217;ve been tracking these Nazi Terrorgram channels and reporting horrendous, explicit calls to racist violence and insurrection, and Telegram did nothing,&#8221; Snyder told TechCrunch, noting that the new wave of reporting sought to shame the company into action.</p>
<p>&#8220;It worked, and Telegram is finally dismantling the network of Nazi channels that have spent months and years overtly attempting to incite just the sort of terror we saw in D.C.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is huge:</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after we started calling out <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@telegram</a> for allowing Nazi terrorists to publicly try and (further) radicalize MAGA folks looking for a new post-Parler home, they felt the pressure and shut down notorious Terrorgram channel HateLab. <a href="https://t.co/8juLpczCgF">pic.twitter.com/8juLpczCgF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gwen Snyder is uncivil (@gwensnyderPHL) <a href="https://twitter.com/gwensnyderPHL/status/1349078118926004228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Many extremist Telegram channels blamed Snyder for the takedowns, leading to an aggressive doxxing campaign that is now circulating her home address. On one channel calling for her death, an image depicts Snyder&#8217;s face with a bloody hole in its forehead. Another image includes an address, screenshots of her Twitter posts and the text &#8220;You know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snyder says she heard pounding on her door Tuesday night. &#8220;My address is all over those channels with people saying I should be shot and raped for this, and they only have to convince one person.&#8221;</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">President Trump suspended from most major platforms</a> and restrictions tightening on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">pro-Trump conspiracies like QAnon</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">Stop the Steal movement</a>, social media users have fled in droves to platforms that remain willing to incubate extremism.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">Prominent among those is Parler</a>, a social network hailed by many pro-Trump figures as a politically friendly alternative to mainstream social media. But with Parler offline after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-sues-amazon-leveling-far-fetched-antitrust-allegations/">Amazon suspended the account&#8217;s web hosting services</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google</a> booted it from their respective app stores, some users flocked to more private options where violent extremism continues to flourish, including Telegram.</p>
<p>Apple and Google did not respond to questions about Telegram&#8217;s standing and if those companies have issued the messaging app any warnings in the last week.</p>
<p>Telegram saw an explosion in growth this month, with 25 million new users signing up within 72 hours. While the timing overlaps with some U.S. social media users denouncing mainstream social platforms, the influx stemmed from <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1348839600333049857">viral misinformation about changes to WhatsApp&#8217;s data sharing policies</a> with Facebook, which is already notorious for privacy failings.</p>
<p>&#8220;People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services,&#8221; Telegram founder Pavel Durov said in a post to his Telegram channel Tuesday. &#8220;They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The electric, autonomous vehicles of the future might be manufactured by Apple&#8217;s main supplier Foxconn and Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.</p>
<p>The two companies have agreed to form a joint venture focused on contract manufacturing for automakers, with a specific focus on electrification, connectivity and autonomous driving technology as well as vehicles designed for sharing. Each party will hold an equal 50% stake in the new joint venture. The board of directors will consist of five members, with Foxconn appointing three, including the chairman, and Geely Holding appointing two, according to a statement issued by the two companies.</p>
<p>The agreement follows moves by both companies to take larger roles in contract manufacturing for automakers. Earlier this week, Geely said it would help China’s search giant Baidu set up a company to produce electric vehicles. Baidu will provide smart driving technologies while Geely will be in charge of car design and manufacturing. Meanwhile, Foxconn has announced plans to help troubled Chinese electric car startup Byton build its M-Byte SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Geely Holding Group CEO Daniel Donghui Li said that the global automotive industry is undergoing profound changes. Geely must &#8220;actively embrace change, build alliances and synergize resources to create greater value for our users,&#8221; he said, adding that Foxconn&#8217;s expertise will offer important insight for the transformation and evolution of the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The joint venture will provide consulting services on whole vehicles, parts, intelligent drive systems and other automotive ecosystem platforms to automakers as well as ridesharing companies. Geely will bring its experience in the automotive fields of design, engineering, R&amp;D, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management and quality control while Foxconn will bring its manufacturing and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) know-how.</p>
<p>The aim, the companies said, is to help automakers accelerate their transition to new innovative and efficient manufacturing processes and business models based on connected, autonomous, shared and electrified technologies (referred to in the industry as CASE).</p>
<p>Dozens of new companies aiming to become the next Tesla or trying to commercialize autonomous vehicles have popped up in recent years, giving this Foxconn-Geely enterprise a long list of potential customers. One of the primary roadblocks to making vehicles at volume is the billions of dollars required to build and tool a factory. That need for capital has prompted a number of EV startups to become publicly traded companies by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Nikola Corp. are a few that have merged with a SPAC, otherwise known as a blank-check company.</p>

<p>Foxconn Technology Group chairman Young-way Liu called the alliance a milestone in cooperation between the automotive and information and communication technology (ICT) industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Foxconn&#8217;s globally leading R&amp;D technologies, intelligent manufacturing, and hardware-software integration capabilities, the two parties form a highly complementary partnership which allows us to better serve and meet the diverse needs of different customers, and offer the most advanced, fastest, cost-effective full value-chain vehicle production service platform,&#8221; Young-way Liu said, adding that the partnership will<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> result in tremendous change in the development of the automotive industry. </span></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the last decade we&#8217;ve seen massive changes in how we consume and interact with our world. The Yellow Pages is a concept that has to be meticulously explained with an impertinent scoff at our own age. We live within our smartphones, within our apps.</p>
<p>While we thrive with the information of the world at our fingertips, we casually throw away any semblance of privacy in exchange for the convenience of this world.</p>
<p>This line we straddle has been drawn with recklessness and calculation by big tech companies over the years as we&#8217;ve come to terms with what app manufacturers, large technology companies, and app stores demand of us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Our private data into the cloud</h2>
<p>According to Symantec, <a href="https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/mobile-privacy-apps">89% of our Android apps and 39% of our iOS apps require access to private information</a>. This risky use sends our data to cloud servers, to both amplify the performance of the application (think about the data needed for fitness apps) and store data for advertising demographics.</p>
<p>While large data companies would argue that data is not held for long, or not used in a nefarious manner, when we use the apps on our phones, we create an undeniable data trail. Companies generally keep data on the move, and servers around the world are constantly keeping data flowing, further away from its source.</p>
<p>Once we accept the terms and conditions we rarely read, our private data is no longer such. It is in the cloud, a term which has eluded concrete understanding throughout the years.</p>
<p>A distinction between cloud-based apps and cloud computing must be addressed. Cloud computing at an enterprise level, while argued against ad nauseam over the years, is generally considered to be a secure and cost-effective option for many businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2010/03/04/steve-ballmer-cloud-computing/">Even back in 2010</a>, Microsoft said 70% of its team was working on things that were cloud-based or cloud-inspired, and the company projected that number would rise to 90% within a year. That was before we started relying on the cloud to store our most personal, private data.</p>
<h2>Cloudy with a chance of confusion</h2>
<p>To add complexity to this issue, there are literally apps to protect your privacy from other apps on your smart phone. Tearing more meat off the privacy bone, these apps themselves require a level of access that would generally raise eyebrows if it were any other category of app.</p>
<p>Consider the scenario where you use a key to encrypt data, but then you need to encrypt that key to make it safe. Ultimately, you end up with the most important keys not being encrypted. There is no win-win here. There is only finding a middle ground of contentment in which your apps find as much purchase in your private data as your doctor finds in your medical history.</p>
<p>The cloud is not tangible, nor is it something we as givers of the data can access. Each company has its own cloud servers, each one collecting similar data. But we have to consider why we give up this data. What are we getting in return? We are given access to applications that perhaps make our lives easier or better, but essentially are a service. It&#8217;s this service end of the transaction that must be altered.</p>
<p>App developers have to find a method of service delivery that does not require storage of personal data. There are two sides to this. The first is creating algorithms that can function on a local basis, rather than centralized and mixed with other data sets. The second is a shift in the general attitude of the industry, one in which free services are provided for the cost of your personal data (which ultimately is used to foster marketing opportunities).</p>
<p>Of course, asking this of any big data company that thrives on its data collection and marketing process is untenable. So the change has to come from new companies, willing to risk offering cloud privacy while still providing a service worth paying for. Because it wouldn&#8217;t be free. It cannot be free, as free is what got us into this situation in the first place.</p>
<h2>Clearing the clouds of future privacy</h2>
<p>What we can do right now is at least take a stance of personal vigilance. While there is some personal data that we cannot stem the flow of onto cloud servers around the world, we can at least limit the use of frivolous apps that collect too much data. For instance, games should never need access to our contacts, to our camera and so on. Everything within our phone is connected, it&#8217;s why Facebook seems to know everything about us, down to what&#8217;s in our bank account.</p>
<p>This sharing takes place on our phone and at the cloud level, and is something we need to consider when accepting the terms on a new app. When we sign into apps with our social accounts, we are just assisting the further collection of our data.</p>
<p>The cloud isn&#8217;t some omnipotent enemy here, but it is the excuse and tool that allows the mass collection of our personal data.</p>
<p>The future is likely one in which devices and apps finally become self-sufficient and localized, enabling users to maintain control of their data. The way we access apps and data in the cloud will change as well, as we&#8217;ll demand a functional process that forces a methodology change in service provisions. The cloud will be relegated to public data storage, leaving our private data on our devices where it belongs. We have to collectively push for this change, lest we lose whatever semblance of privacy in our data we have left.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at Harvard&#8217;s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have created a set of fish-shaped underwater robots that can autonomously navigate and find each other, cooperating to perform tasks or just placidly school together.</p>
<p>Just as aerial drones are proving themselves useful in industry after industry, underwater drones could revolutionize ecology, shipping and other areas where a persistent underwater presence is desirable but difficult.</p>
<p>The last few years have seen interesting new autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, but the most common type is pretty much a torpedo — efficient for cruising open water, but not for working one&#8217;s way through the nooks and crannies of a coral reef or marina.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4H9iOrmjNu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/coral-vita-cultivates-2m-seed-to-take-its-reef-restoration-mission-global/">Coral Vita cultivates $2M seed to take its reef restoration mission global</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For that purpose, it seems practical to see what Nature herself has seen fit to create, and the Wyss Institute has made a specialty of doing so and creating robots and machinery in imitation of the natural world.</p>
<p>In this case, Florian Berlinger, Melvin Gauci and Radhika Nagpal, all co-authors on a new paper <a href="http://robotics.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abd8668">published in Science Robotics</a>, decided to imitate not just the shape of a fish, but the way it interacts with its fellows as well.</p>
<p>Having been inspired by the sight of schooling fish during scuba diving, Nagpal has pursued the question: &#8220;How do we create artificial agents that can demonstrate this kind of collective coherence where a whole collective seems as if it’s a single agent?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095527" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095527" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2095527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a fish-shaped robot" width="1024" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg 1425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=768,347 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blueswarm-1.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095527" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berlinger et al., Science Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Their answer, Blueswarm, is a collection of small &#8220;Bluebots,&#8221; 3D-printed in the shape of fish, with fins instead of propellers and cameras for eyes. Although neither you nor I is likely to mistake these for actual fish, they&#8217;re far less scary of an object for a normal fish to see than a six-foot metal tube with a propeller spinning loudly in the back. The Bluebots also imitate nature&#8217;s innovation of bioluminescence, lighting up with LEDs the way some fish and insects do to signal others. The LED pulses change and adjust depending on each bot&#8217;s position and knowledge of its neighbors.</p>
<p>Using the simple senses of cameras and a photosensor at the very front, elementary swimming motions and the LEDs, Blueswarm automatically organizes itself into group swimming behaviors, establishing a simple &#8220;milling&#8221; pattern that accommodates new bots when they&#8217;re dropped in from any angle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095530" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bluebot-behav.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095530" class="size-full wp-image-2095530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bluebot-behav.jpg" alt="Images showing how &quot;bluebots&quot; swarm intelligently and find each other." width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berlinger et al, Science Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>The robots can also work together on simple tasks, like searching for something. If the group is given the task of finding a red LED in the tank they&#8217;re in, they can each look independently, but when one of them finds it, it alters its own LED flashing to alert and summon the others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to imagine uses for this tech. These robots could get closer to reefs and other natural features safely without alarming the sea life, monitoring their health or looking for specific objects their camera-eyes could detect. Or they could meander around underneath docks and ships inspecting hulls more efficiently than a single craft can. Perhaps they might even be useful in search and rescue.</p>

<p>The research also advances our understanding of how and why animals swarm together in the first place.</p>
<p>With this research, we cannot only build more advanced robot collectives, but also learn about collective intelligence in nature. Fish must follow even simpler behavior patterns when swimming in schools than our robots do. This simplicity is so beautiful yet hard to discover,&#8221; said Berlinger. &#8220;Other researchers have reached out to me already to use my Bluebots as fish surrogates for biological studies on fish swimming and schooling. The fact that they welcome Bluebot among their laboratory fish makes me very happy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Congratulations, you&#8217;re no longer selling your company for billions of dollars!</p>
<p>As strange as it sounds, that&#8217;s the leading perspective from venture capitalists concerning Plaid, now that its much-touted sale to Visa <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">has fallen apart</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">$5.3 billion deal</a> would have seen banking API startup Plaid join consumer payments and credit giant Visa. But the American government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">took a dim view of the deal</a>, and according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-f84fa6ec-3db7-4274-aa3b-f71dbe1bd4f2.html">Axios reporting,</a> Plaid felt like it could be worth more money in time.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team has collected views from venture capitalists, analysts and <a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">Anshu Sharma</a>, CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">another API-powered startup</a> and a former VC to get a better view on the perspectives in the market concerning the blockbuster breakup.</p>
<p>From the venture capital side of things, most takes we received were bullish regarding Plaid&#8217;s chances now that it&#8217;s no longer being taken over by Visa. <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Amy Cheetham</a>, for example, of <a href="https://twitter.com/costanoavc">Costanoa Ventures</a>, said that the result is &#8220;good for the company, ultimately.&#8221; She added that Plaid may now see better &#8220;talent acquisition,&#8221; faster product decisions and a better eventual valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much left for them to build in fintech infrastructure,&#8221; Cheetham said in an email, adding that she sees &#8220;Stripe-like scale potential&#8221; in Plaid. Stripe is reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">raising capital at a valuation that could reach $100 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Cheetham is not alone in her bullish perspective. <a href="https://twitter.com/nicberardi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Nico Berandi</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ANIMOvc">Animo Ventures</a> wrote to TechCrunch to say that he &#8220;still wishes&#8221; that his firm had been &#8220;around back then to have invested&#8221; in Plaid, adding a smiley face at the end of his missive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a move that could have wide ramifications across the tech landscape, Intel announced that <a href="http://vmware.com">VMware</a> CEO Pat Gelsinger would be replacing interim CEO Bob Swan at <a href="http://Intel.com">Intel</a> on February 15th. The question is why would he leave his job to run a struggling chip giant.</p>
<p>The bottom line is he has a long history with Intel, working with some of the biggest names in chip industry lore before he joined VMware in 2009. It has to be a thrill for him to go back to his roots and try to jump start the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was 18 years old when I joined Intel, fresh out of the Lincoln Technical Institute. Over the next 30 years of my tenure at Intel, I had the honor to be mentored at the feet of Grove, Noyce and Moore,&#8221; Gelsinger wrote in <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/note-from-pat-gelsinger-to-intel/">a blog post</a> announcing his new position.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Certainly Intel recognized that the history and that Gelsinger&#8217;s deep executive experience should help as the company attempts to compete in an increasingly aggressive chip industry landscape. &#8220;Pat is a proven technology leader with a distinguished track record of innovation, talent development, and a deep knowledge of Intel. He will continue a values-based cultural leadership approach with a hyper focus on operational execution,” Omar Ishrak, independent chairman of the Intel board, said in a statement.</p>
<p>But Gelsinger is walking into a bit of a mess. As my colleague Danny Crichton wrote<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/"> in his year-end review of the chip industry</a> last month, Intel is far behind its competitors, and it&#8217;s going to be tough to play catch-up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Intel has made numerous strategic blunders in the past two decades, most notably completely missing out on the smartphone revolution and also the custom silicon market that has come to prominence in recent years. It’s also just generally fallen behind in chip fabrication, an area it once dominated and is now behind Taiwan-based TSMC, Crichton wrote.</p></blockquote>

<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, agrees with this assertion, saying that Swan was dealt a bad hand, walking in to clean up a mess that has years long timelines. While Gelsinger faces similar issues, Moorhead thinks he can refocus the company. &#8220;I am not foreseeing any major strategic changes with Gelsinger, but I do expect him to focus on the company&#8217;s engineering culture and get it back to an execution culture,&#8221; Moorhead told me.</p>
<p>The announcement comes against the backdrop of massive chip industry consolidation last year with over $100 billion changing hands in four deals, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">Nvidia nabbing ARM </a>for $40 billion, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/amd-grabs-xilinx-for-35-billion-as-chip-industry-consolidation-continues/">$35 billion AMD-Xilink deal</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/analog-devices-to-acquire-rival-chipmaker-maxim-integrated-for-21-billion/">Analog snagging Maxim</a> for $21 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/more-chip-industry-action-as-marvell-is-acquiring-inphi-for-10b/">Marvell grabbing Inphi</a> for a mere $10 billion, not to mention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/intel-agrees-to-sell-its-nand-business-to-sk-hynix-for-9-billion/">Intel dumping its memory unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>As for VMware, it has to find a new CEO now. As Moorhead says, the obvious choice would be current COO Sanjay Poonen, but for the time being, it will be CFO Zane Rowe serving as interim CEO, rather than Poonen. In fact, it appears that the company will be casting a wider net than internal options. The official announcement states, &#8220;VMware’s Board of Directors is initiating a global executive search process to name a permanent CEO&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says it will be up to Michael Dell to decide who to hand the reins to, but he believes Gelsinger was stuck at Dell and would not get a broader role, so he left.</p>
<p>&#8220;VMware has a deep bench, but it will be up to Michael Dell to get a CEO who can innovate on the software side and keep the unique DNA of VMware inside the Dell portfolio going strong, Dell needs the deeper profits of this business for its turnaround,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The stock market seems to like the move for Intel, with the company stock up 7.26%, but not so much for VMware, whose stock was down close to the same amount at 7.72% as we went to publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today shares of Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later unicorn, started trading above $90 per share, far above <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/">its $49 per-share IPO price</a>, a figure that was already miles above the company’s early expectations.</p>
<p>The pop comes after Affirm raised its pricing range earlier this week, to $41 to $44 per share, up from an initial range of $33 to $38 per share. To see the company double from its raised price implies strong demand for its shares, a thin float, or both.</p>
<p>Affirm’s explosive debut comes on the heels of similarly strong results from DoorDash, C3.ai and Airbnb. Those companies’ debuts were so strong that Roblox delayed its IPO, later swapping a traditional IPO for a direct listing to get around the pricing issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IPO delays are bumming me out&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/embed/#?secret=SnVbCF9tyr" data-secret="SnVbCF9tyr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today’s IPO shows that the same dynamics that were at play in those IPOs have persisted into 2021. More public debuts are expected in Q1, including Coinbase, another well-known unicorn. Other names like Robinhood, Bumble and others are in the wings.</p>
<p>Affirm’s first-day performance will certainly raise eyebrows from regular critics of the traditional IPO process. But the company did raise more money than it perhaps anticipated, and is having a raucous first-day’s trading, so it’s hard to fret too much for the company. If its share price is still as high in a month as it is today, perhaps it was as underpriced as some will claim.</p>
<p><strong>Fintech</strong></p>
<p>Affirm’s pricing brings a green splash to a busy week for fintech giants. Yesterday, Visa’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid failed to go through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">due to regulatory concerns</a>. While the fallen deal could have a chilling effect on fintech startups, Plaid told TechCrunch that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. Plaid’s next step, per many in the VC and tech community, will be even bigger than its once-planned $5.3 billion dollar exit.</p>
