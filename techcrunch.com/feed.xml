					<description><![CDATA[Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.olist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olist</a>, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator, confirmed it is now valued at $1.5 billion after securing $186 million in Series E funding, led by Wellington Management.</p>
<p>The new round follows quickly behind a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/goldman-sachs-leads-23m-in-funding-for-brazilian-e-commerce-startup-olist/">$23 million Series D extension</a> the company announced in April, led by new investor Goldman Sachs Asset Management to bring its total Series D financing to $80 million.</p>
<p>It was then we profiled Olist, which connects small businesses to larger product marketplaces to help entrepreneurs sell their products to a broader customer base. Its technology enables small merchants to gain market share across the country through a SaaS licensing model to small brick and mortar businesses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This investment by Wellington is the company’s first contribution to a private company in Latin America, according to Olist. Joining Wellington in the round were funds managed by SoftBank, Corton Capital, Valor Capital Group, Goldman Sachs, Globo Ventures and Kevin Efrusy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Olist said it tripled its size in 2021 and closed on four acquisitions within the last year, including social commerce startup Clickspace, logistics company PAX and VNDA and Tiny ERP, both offering commerce tools for small businesses.</p>
<p>“With more than 45,000 shopkeepers and retailers as clients, Olist has always been at the forefront of digital retail, long before the e-commerce hype that helped drive the search for our solutions,” said Tiago Dalvi, founder and CEO of Olist, in a written statement. “With this new round, we want to go beyond what we do today and deliver more and more value to our customers.”</p>
<p>In fact, the company wants to go beyond marketplaces, and the new capital will enable it to offer a fulfillment operation, set to open early next year, and financial services. Retailers on Olist already have access to credit lines for working capital, but the company plans to expand that technology to include risk management, accelerated sales and internal credit models for merchants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company recently began operations in Mexico and intends to expand its footprint across Latin America next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.prellisbio.com/">Prellis Biologics</a>, a company developing the tools to create 3D printed organs, announced a $14.5 million Series B round on Wednesday. Prellis has spent years developing tissue engineering capacity, but has focused recently on developing one type of structure in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Prellis </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/3d-printing-organs-moves-a-few-more-steps-closer-to-commercialization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has focused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 3D printing vascular scaffolds that would allow companies to grow healthy and oxygenated human organs (or miniature versions, called organoids) for drug testing, and eventually transplant. But the company has recently debuted a new product, called EXIS (short for Externalized Immune System): a lab-grown version of a human lymph node. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymph nodes are critical parts of the human immune system – they store certain immune cells, and help the body manufacture immune responses. Ideally, those lymph node organoids would aid in drug development by mimicking how a person’s immune system might respond to new treatment. And, perhaps, help create some new drugs along the way. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By creating this immune system in a dish, we can actually test if those therapeutics are going to elicit an immune response before it goes into a human,” founder and CEO Melanie Matheu told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company’s edge is that [EXIS] is out of the box fully human.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis Biologics, founded in 2016, has raised about $29.5 million to date. This Series B round was led by Celesta Capital and existing investor Khosla Ventures. In addition, the company will add Kevin Chapman, Celesta advisor and former CSO of Berkeley Lights, as Chief Scientific Officer. Yelda Kaya, formerly of J&amp;J Innovation, will join as Chief Business Officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymph node responses to drugs or pathogens</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.711307/full#h2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been recognized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to predict how the whole immune system might react. Correspondingly, a number of academic labs working on developing in-vitro models of human lymph nodes – from l</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.711307/full#h3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ymph nodes on chips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to growing lymphoid organoids from</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01145-0#Sec10"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tonsil tissue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis has entered the fray by using its scaffolds to facilitate oxygen and nutrient exchange needed to grow functioning lymph node organoids. This method, Matheu says, allows Prellis to “replicate the human immune system outside the human.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This focus on the lymph node, in turn, opens up new angle for the company: antibody drug development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing new antibody treatments and predicting how they’ll work in clinical tests is becoming a more competitive space, and there are a few different approaches underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are computational. Nabla Bio, which just raised a $11 million, has used </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/nabla-bio-raises-11m-for-an-end-to-end-antibody-design-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural language processing to design antibodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Generate Bio, which just raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/generate-biomedicines-raises-370m-series-b-with-a-focus-on-protein-based-drugs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$370m Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has also used a machine learning approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prellis’ approach is to model the immune system in miniature and develop a cadre of drug candidates by mining immune responses. Matheu calls it “natural intelligence” as opposed to artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company can create 1,200 organoids from one blood draw, challenge those immune systems with a particular antigen, and see what each immune system comes up with. That process, she says, can be done with different blood donors with different immune system characteristics to create a plethora of responses to analyze. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s very rare that all 10 of those people are going to come up with the same antibody solution to the problem of: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does it bind this protein</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? And so from a given human, we&#8217;re averaging anywhere from 500 to 2000 unique antibodies, and then you just multiply that by the number of people, and these are all target binding antibodies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about 18 days to go from blood draw to “antibody library,” per materials provided by Prellis Biologics. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247300" style="width: 1536px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247300" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2247300 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png" alt="" width="1526" height="329" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png 1526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=150,32 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=300,65 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=768,166 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=680,147 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1526px) 100vw, 1526px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Prellis Bio</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matheu says the company has developed antibodies responsive to SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (these results haven’t been published). It has also entered into partnership with five drug companies, though Matheu declined to name which ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use this round to move from an R&amp;D driven company to a product focused one – which means developing more drug partnerships, and demonstrating the platform’s capability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major marker of success, she says, would be to bring an antibody treatment into the clinic. That may occur through collaboration with a pharmaceutical partner, though the company hasn’t ruled out creating a drug pipeline of its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matheu is light on specifics, but says Prellis is developing “internal technology” that would support a therapeutic pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will say, we will move in that direction as the technology develops,” she said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When COVID-19 closed down most of society in 2020, Kian Sadeghi, like many of his then-classmates at the University of Pennsylvania, found himself holed up in his bedroom. He prefers it that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During those months at home in Brooklyn, Sadeghi filled eight spiral notebooks with research on genetic sequencing, computer science and statistics. The result was the formation of Nucleus Genomics (still listed as a “stealth” startup on his LinkedIn, as of writing), which he has dropped out of Penn to pursue full time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus’ Genomics pitch, per Sadeghi, provides a fresher take on genomic analysis. Users can upload their genetic information obtained through an established company, like 23andMe or Ancestry, or order a genetic testing kit. Then the company’s “proprietary algorithms” will calculate polygenic risk scores – measure of disease risk based on analysis of genetic variants – and display them in a user-friendly platform. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245657" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thesis is a human genome on every iPhone,” Sadeghi told TechCrunch. “So we combine genetic and non-genetic information to eventually calculate the absolute risk scores for people for disease.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus announced a $3.5 million seed round on Tuesday led by Founders Fund. The round includes participation from Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Patrick Hsu (Professor at UC Berkeley and co-inventor of CRISPR), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep), Joshua Browder (CEO, DoNotPay), Cory Levy, Adam Guild, Pareto Holdings, Pomp, Shrug, Ankur Nagpal, Quiet Capital, Salt Fund, Bluewatch Ventures, Night, and Brandon White. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The background behind Nucleus Genomics is the idea that people will be eager to know more about their genomes. And that they’ll want to learn how to actually interpret that information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi clearly has this interest himself. He traces the ideological origin of his company to the premature death of a cousin from long QT syndrome, which in some cases, is genetically linked. He then started to experiment with genes on his own at Brooklyn-based Genspace, a community biology lab. (He was featured in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">story on </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/diy-gene-editing-fast-cheapand-worrisome-1488164820"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DIY CRISPR enthusiasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi’s interest in genetics is shared by others. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing initially spawned a subculture of people who have uploaded their genetic information to services like </span><a href="https://www.gedmatch.com/how-it-works"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GEDMatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has been used to help people find lost relatives, or under controversial circumstances, </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/22/how-your-family-tree-could-catch-a-killer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve cold cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But direct-to-consumer genetic testing has truly exploded in recent years. In 2013 fewer than </span><a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/06/DTC_graph.png"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people ordered consumer genetic tests. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/12/145676/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was north of 12 million. By 2021, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-04/23andme-to-use-dna-tests-to-make-cancer-drugs"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that one in five Americans has turned over their genetic data to either 23andMe or a competitor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be more fuel left to burn in this fire. One 2018 poll run by the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research </span><a href="https://reports.norc.org/issue_brief/genetic-testing-ancestry-interest-but-privacy-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as 54 percent of Americans had still heard little or nothing about genetic testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadeghi&#8217;s pitch is many of those who have yet to embrace genetic testing are younger people. There’s some evidence to back this up, though not a huge amount. </span><a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/455006#T02"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about 1,600 DTC genetic test consumers (from 23andMe and Pathway), found that the average user was middle aged, white, and, most likely, a college educated female. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average age of a 23andMe user, </span><a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/press-releases/23andme-database-surpasses-100000-users"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s 2011 numbers, is 45. TechCrunch has reached out to 23andMe to confirm the age of their user base, but has not heard back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus, he says, will aim to boil down genetic testing into user-friendly reports that will be distributed through “newfound distribution channels” – an effort to reach younger audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can tap into a brand-new audience and introduce an entire generation to genetic testing, just as you could say Robinhood introduced an entire generation to the stock market,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus, though, won’t necessarily rely on new users. It also aims to become a third-party platform, where people could upload their genomic data collected by other companies. There are already third-party platforms like impute.me (a nonprofit), and </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005140/en/Allelica-Raises-1.75-Million-in-Seed-Financing-to-Advance-Polygenic-Risk-Score-PRS-Analysis-into-Clinical-Practice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allelica (raised 1.75 million in a recent seed round) </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that provides detailed information on clinical disease risk if users upload genetic information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that landscape, Nucleus does offer a good incentive to upload: cash for the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus will also be open to sharing genetic information with drug companies, says Sadeghi, if users opt-in to sharing their information. Should they choose to share genetic information through Nucleus they can earn a potential “dividend payment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer data is already being shared anyway. 23andMe has </span><a href="https://blog.23andme.com/news/collaboration-with-gsk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">struck a deal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with GSK to use genetic information for drug identification and research – only data from users who opt-in to this service is shared. (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-04/23andme-to-use-dna-tests-to-make-cancer-drugs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe and GSK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already have a cancer drug in </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/29/cancer-drug-first-therapy-to-emerge-from-23andme-glaxosmithkline-collaboration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical trials</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In exchange for the genetic data they provide, which increasingly could be used to develop money-making drugs and other medical products, users get their own payout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the amount of that dividend payment is undecided, says Sadeghi. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, 23andMe first debuted reports using genetics to predict health risk. But FDA asked the company to pump the brakes and issued </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/211831908-23andMe-and-the-FDA#:~:text=In%202013%2C%2023andMe%20received%20a,the%20agency's%20regulatory%20review%20process.&amp;text=23andMe%20will%20continue%20to%20seek%20FDA%20authorization%20to%20offer%20new%20reports."><span style="font-weight: 400;">a warning letter.</span></a> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-direct-consumer-tests-provide-genetic-risk-information-certain-conditions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company has received FDA approval for a </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/211831908-23andMe-and-the-FDA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of genetic tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that quantify health risks for conditions like Parkinson’s or breast cancer, to name a few. A diabetes risk calculation test was debuted in 2019, but didn’t go through FDA approval because it was called a “wellness product”– </span><a href="https://medcitynews.com/2019/03/23andme-launches-new-diabetes-risk-test-but-experts-are-wary-of-its-benefit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparking some criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over its utility.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe essentially hammered out the process of getting DTC tests and reports approved. And that has opened up the possibility of obtaining 510(k) premarket clearance for other genetic analysis algorithms, should they show equivalent accuracy. (</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1804591/000119312521210858/d154309ds1.htm#tx154309_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23andMe was concerned about this exact process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and disclosed it as a risk factor in S-1 filings). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Nucleus is still developing its polygenic risk score algorithms. Those are the company’s secret sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s extremely technical, extremely hard, extremely cutting edge,” Sadeghi said. But as for regulatory strategy, the company initially plans to go a route </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/10/15/ancestry-health-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">once used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ancestry – order tests from a clinical network, rather than creating their own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That does allow the company to sidestep FDA approval of its algorithms at first (this process is regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid). But perhaps not for long. Eventually Ancestry <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/ancestrys-new-510k-clearances-point-toward-otc-consumer-genetic-health-risk-testing">pivoted</a> and applied for 510(k) market approval for its own DNA testing kit and genetic test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch pointed this out in a followup email: Sadeghi said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, in the future, we do seek to go that route.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the company plans to launch sometime around January 2022 and has plans to grow the team from three to six or seven members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s an imminent inevitability that every person has the human genome sequence,” said Sadeghi. “The question is who is actually going to respond to collect that data? I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;s going to be Nucleus.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFB Fertility, the creator of a suite of at-home pregnancy-related hormone tests, announced a $9.7 million Series A round this week. The round follows several milestones for the company including an FDA premarket approval for a progesterone urine test and the rollout of a mobile app. It also gives the company more fodder to build towards its thesis: that at-home hormone testing can save both time, and stress related to &#8220;unexplained&#8221; infertility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFB Fertility is more commonly known as Proov – the name of the test developed by owner and CEO Amy Beckley. Proov was founded in 2018, after Beckley had her own struggles with infertility and miscarriage. She found herself classified as “unexplained infertile.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Beckley’s case, a prescription solved her problem. But the Proov tests, she says, were created for women who also find themselves in the “unexplained” category of infertility diagnoses. </span><a href="https://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Abstract/2014/02000/Definition_and_Epidemiology_of_Unexplained.17.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have estimated that somewhere between 15 and 30 percent of infertility diagnoses worldwide fall into that unexplained category. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246221" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s just a cop out,” Beckley told TechCrunch. “For a woman to go in and get all the tests and then come out on the other end, and it&#8217;s like, oh, yeah, you know, you&#8217;re unexplained infertile.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hambrecht Ducera Growth Ventures. It includes participation from SteelSky Ventures, WCC Partners, Lightship Capital, GingerBread Capital, and Portfolia FemTech II Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexplained infertility can come down to any number of male or female factors. Proov&#8217;s flagship test is designed to rule out two problems: the status of ovulation – the process by which an egg is matured and released, and the readiness of the uterus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you go to a doctor’s office, that doctor might perform a blood test for </span><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/progesterone-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progesterone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a hormone that helps ready the uterus for pregnancy, and spikes after an egg is released. Proov has developed an at-home urine test to measure a metabolite of progesterone, PdG.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">External research has validated PdG as a marker of ovulation. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5689497/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2017 review paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that measuring urine PdG levels over three days was accurate when it came to confirming ovulation, but that no point of care tests using this method had been developed yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We developed the first and only FDA- cleared way to measure this at home through urine to understand what we call ovulation quality: is the uterus optimally prepared to have the highest chance of conception?” said Beckley. “We invented it. I literally was the first person to ever have this technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proov has gone through the process of getting the PdG test evaluated and approved by the FDA. It received 510(k) clearance in </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191462.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because its results were substantially similar to progesterone tests (not direct to consumer) that already exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proov’s own clinical trials have suggested that progesterone (and PdG) can also be useful markers of other pregnancy outcomes. The data has yet to be published, but Proov reported data from </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05033366"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 54 pregnant women suggesting that women who had two days or more of negative PdG tests during a critical window of time saw increased rates of miscarriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That data is reported in a </span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/american-college-of-obstetricians-and-gynecologists-updated-guidance-for-the-use-of-progesterone-to-prevent-miscarriage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change.org petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> run by the company. The petition is in response to </span><a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(19)32762-0/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting progesterone therapy only be given to women who have already had miscarriages (the company argues that certain tests could also used as impetus for progesterone therapy).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PdG tests, though, aren’t the only thing Proov has been up to. The company’s newest product is a “complete” testing product that will provide tests for PdG, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and an estrogen marker. And, it’s rolled out a mobile app to help users interpret those tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app itself is an entry point for more detailed information. Users can submit photos of multiple test strips, which then yield numerical scores detailing certain hormone levels. Those scores are produced via “machine-learning and back-end algorithms,” says Beckley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the month, the app will provide an ovulation score, says Beckley. Though, critically, the app does more than just provide a number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a test or even a score on its own, she said, led to frustration with users. “Literally, they were writing on our Facebook: ‘I hate this, because I don’t know what to do with a negative result,” Beckley explained.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response the app allows patients to share their results with doctors, speak with experts and also receive certain lifestyle tips (like exercise or nutrition) that might go on to improve progesterone levels through the app. The company is also currently building a supplement platform that would be integrated with the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The takeaway, per Beckley, is that testing alone isn’t enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to take that information and gently give her that, but also give her solutions at the same time,” she said. </span></p>
<h3><b>General Trends </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few general trends playing in Proov’s favor. First, is the rise of at-home medical testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major diagnostics companies have already announced intent to expand from at-home COVID tests into other arenas. Quest Labs estimates that at-home consumer testing will become a <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/quest-eyes-2b-dtc-testing-potential-to-capitalize-on-breakout-consumer-g/596609/">$2 billion dollar</a> industry by 2025. Robert Ford, CEO Of Abbott Labs, for example has also suggested that at-home COVID tests are</span><a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/abbott-quest-look-to-post-pandemic-home-testing-beyond-covid-19/599063/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “seeding” the idea of at-home tests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">all over the country. If you’re getting used to taking at-home COVID tests, maybe you’ll become accustomed to at-home testing in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beckley too has noticed diagnostic company interest in Proov as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a lot of the bigger kind of diagnostic companies that are the most interested in what we&#8217;re doing,” she said. “Their market is doctors, hospital systems, payers. They don’t understand consumers and what’s buying behavior, so they’re leaning into direct-to-consumer companies like us, that market directly to women.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fertility testing too – for both men and women – has </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/parenting/fertility/fertility-startups-kindbody.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proved to be</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/its-a-new-era-for-fertility-tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially active area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for startups and investors since about 2019. Crunchbase’s numbers reported an </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vc-startups-investment-fertility-services-birthrate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in funding for fertility startups between 2020 and 2021, suggesting that the trend is still going strong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kalendar.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kalendar AI</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that&#8217;s been building on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-3</a>&#8216;s language model &#8212; developing a SaaS for automating lead generation and sales outreach to make it easier for companies to get initial meetings with prospective customers &#8212; has raised $3.2 million in pre-seed funding from 500 Startups; <em>The Lean Start</em>up author, Eric Ries; VC firms Village Global and Metaplanet; and 20+ angel investors (including CEOs of &#8220;popular&#8221; but undisclosed companies).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our AI technology writes personalized invitations to ideal customers with personalized decks &#8212; inviting them to take a meeting,&#8221; explains founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu.</p>
<p>The SaaS was launched in February this year, although the startup itself &#8212; which is called Kriya Inc &#8212; was founded back in 2017 and had been bootstrapping prior to raising this pre-seed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247999" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The idea for the b2b product is to automate the time-consuming and expensive process of sales outreach, including locating and pitching leads, as well as to offer tools to streamline and enhance initial sales meetings.</p>
<p>Kalendar AI claims to have amassed a database of 340M+ &#8220;ideal customer profiles&#8221; upon which it unleashes its AI sales rep bots to send &#8220;personalized&#8221; pitches (including &#8220;interactive presentations that convert into one-click meetings&#8221;) to likely looking customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our solution brings down the time to initiate a conversation to book an appointment from 7 days to 30 seconds from a sales perspective,&#8221; claims Vadrevu, who also argues there are big productivity wins from a marketing perspective vs other channels.</p>
<p>So where is Kalendar AI getting data on all those hundreds of millions of potential customers from?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have our own datasets that we built over years from publicly available information,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, specifying that it uses Common Crawl, an open-source repository of the Internet, to collect &#8220;publicly available metadata information&#8221; and &#8220;form an index for searching&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get all the available B2B company domains and the people associated to those domains (this information updates every quarter),&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;We only engage people on their business email, and don&#8217;t store any personal information. We disclaim this in the footer of our every interaction that our technology predicted their business email in real-time using machine learning patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>For &#8220;content narratives&#8221;, Vadrevu says the AI relies upon &#8220;real-time data services&#8221; such as the latest company news, company descriptions, current weather/events around a location, industry news, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to increase such contexts by investing in content R&amp;D,&#8221; he further notes.</p>
<p>Asked if it&#8217;s using any data scraped from LinkedIn, Vadrevu claims not &#8212; arguing: &#8220;We don&#8217;t need LinkedIn profiles as we process names &amp; predict emails from publicly available domain/company metadata in real-time. LinkedIn is a personal network, and most business interactions usually happen, and more effective on a business email.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scraping LinkedIn is &#8220;not only unethical but it&#8217;s also unnecessary&#8221;, he adds when pressed for a confirm that Kalendar AI does not scrape the Microsoft-owned professional social network to enrich its database.</p>
<p>The SaaS is &#8220;nearing&#8221; its first 100 customers at this stage, per Vadrevu, who says the best markets for the product so far are technology, marketing &amp; advertising, IT &amp; Infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have customers ranging from a small team of 5 people to public companies like Upwork. However, most of our customers are digital media companies, startups, and new growth entrepreneurs building businesses on top of our platform,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve reached $1M in ARR revenue in the last three months, consistently maintaining a 60% month-over-month growth,&#8221; he also tells us, specifying that the new funding will mostly go toward building out the engineering team and improving the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently [we&#8217;re] focused on forming an engineering growth team responsible for optimizing our algorithms to ensure the engagement is pleasant, effective, and efficient for all of our customers and the recipients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&#8217;t require a ghost in the machine to tell you that while AI can be a powerful productivity tool it can also be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong/">terribly hit-and-miss</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AoOC3s0IQd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong/">Here are a few ways GPT-3 can go wrong</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Here are a few ways GPT-3 can go wrong&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong/embed/#?secret=AoOC3s0IQd" data-secret="AoOC3s0IQd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And even if the claimed &#8220;personalization&#8221; of sales pitches is spot on target, receiving an automated sales pitching might risk a potential customer feeling, well, roundly unimpressed at the robotic cold call. Or &#8212; to put it another way &#8212; like they just got spammed. So a pitch-by-robot might be all too easy to ignore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very hard problem and we don&#8217;t please everyone yet,&#8221; admits Vadrevu. &#8220;We have a 2% error rate that sometimes creates unpleasant experiences where we created channels for people to directly give us feedback and let them opt-out of our platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;What surprises us by being transparent is that more people are considerate about helping businesses than we thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we become successful, the beauty of AI eventually empowers businesses &amp; individuals connecting in many ways beyond sales like how we call connect today,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We&#8217;re still very early and are grateful for our investors who&#8217;re supporting us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s ultimate goal for is the product is to be able to provide a fully end-to-end SaaS for sales outreach and meetings (including videoconferencing and CRM), not just fancy personalized pitches that its AI sales bots fire out at inhuman speeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to build an ecosystem around the appointments we set, including video conferencing, CRM, etc., to improve the quality of the meetings,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The immediate impact of such technology is on sales (revenue autopilot), which otherwise involves heavy marketing &amp; sales processes to achieve. The adjacent markets for such a technology could also be recruiting, job search, etc., which is not our focus,&#8221; Vadrevu also suggests.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s own sales pitch for its SaaS is that it can radically reduce the time and cost of booking &#8220;a high quality meeting that directly impacts revenue<span style="color: #0e101a;">&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">But of course the b2b product is certainly not free.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">A &#8220;basic plan&#8221; starts at </span>$2,000/m for 20 &#8220;AI authors&#8221; (booking an estimated range of 20 meetings per month; since its fee is pay-per-meeting), according to Vadrevu.</p>
<p>While a &#8220;Scale plan&#8221; starts at $4,000/m for 50 AI authors (booking an estimated range of 40 meetings pm).</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Vadrevu argues this pricing puts the product &#8220;</span>on the cheaper side&#8221; vs other tools companies would be using to try to lock in leads, suggesting b2b companies&#8217; customer acquisition costs for a single meeting range from $150 to $2,000 (i.e. &#8220;using Google SEM, digital marketing, sales tools, etc to get the same ROI&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making it cheap for our customers by bundling meetings into SaaS,&#8221; he further argues. &#8220;At scale, we might get into a price per meeting prediction but we saw that SaaS is ideal for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the competitive front, <span style="color: #0e101a;">Vadrevu claims Kalendar AI is breaking new ground &#8212; and that &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">no one else is doing what we are doing until now as it&#8217;s incredibly hard&#8221; &#8212; emphasizing that development covers product iterations on content personalization with real-time feedback loops; AI-powered matching that needs to be adequately accurate, safe and not (so) spammy; as well as compliance with variable data regulations &#8212; hence why it took the startup three years to push the button on a market launch.</span></p>
<p>But pressed to name some startup competition, he says that for the personalized outbound messaging component there are AI copywriting tools such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">Copy.ai</a>; while for inbound decks he suggests it&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> competing with scheduling pages such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/sales-scheduling-platform-chili-piper-raises-33m-series-b-funding-led-by-tiger-global/">Chili Piper</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/how-calendly-is-building-a-platform-by-turning-scheduling-into-a-center-stage-event/">Calendly</a>, and &#8220;any other inbound marketing funnel tools&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Still, Kalendar AI&#8217;s wider pitch is that it&#8217;s going further by using AI to join up a bunch of manual sales and marketing work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently for b2b companies, there&#8217;s marketing and sales working separately to book appointments. But it takes a lot of manual effort to reach a consistent number of meetings every month on autopilot,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Our approach leverages personalized sales outreach, coupled with interactive inbound (decks with one-click meetings; we might patent it) bringing down the cost &amp; time to book a high quality meeting that directly impacts revenue<span style="color: #0e101a;">.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ample co-founder John de Souza shared the merits of a B2B GTM strategy, how to create a fun and functional company culture and what it takes to go after the idea most people say won't work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The odds are against San Francisco-based electric vehicle battery swapping company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/ample-raises-160m-to-scale-its-battery-swapping-service/">Ample.</a> Other companies have tried to build a business on exchanging dead batteries for fresh ones to solve the problem of long EV charge times: Fourteen years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/from-the-ashes-of-nearly-a-billion-dollars-ample-resurrects-better-places-battery-swapping-business-model/">Better Place</a> raised nearly a billion dollars to do what Ample&#8217;s doing, and it ended up declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p>But that was more than a decade ago, when EVs weren&#8217;t sufficiently advanced —or plentiful — to make the business model work.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t deter Ample co-founder John de Souza. Born and raised in Ethiopia to a Greek/Ethiopian mother and a Portuguese/Indian father who found ways to send him and his siblings to school despite their poverty, his family relocated to Dubai when the Ethiopian Civil War started in the 1970s. After emigrating, de Souza finished out high school before heading to the United States at 16 to attend university under a full scholarship.</p>
<p>Since then, he has founded multiple companies, including fintech company Smartleaf, internet startup Flash Communications and consumer health platform MedHelp, where his current co-founder, Khaled Hassounah, served as CTO. Both de Souza and Hassounah come from immigrant backgrounds, which de Souza said affords them with that creative entrepreneurial mentality.</p>
<p>Neither co-founder had previous experience in the energy sector, but by 2018, both co-founders saw an opportunity in the EV market. The only problem was that it would be difficult to get people to convert to EVs when the technology, at least from a refueling UX perspective, was much worse than the status quo.</p>
<p>Many investors didn&#8217;t last five minutes into an Ample pitch because they could still see the smoldering ruins of Better Place, but de Souza and Hassounah raised upward of $275 million to solve for the limitations of plug-in charging.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">Ample has partnered with Sally</a>, an EV rental company that offers ride-hailing, taxi and last-mile deliveries, along with Uber and Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company. The company&#8217;s path to market relies on contracts with fleets wherein Ample&#8217;s battery chemistry-agnostic modular battery packs can be swapped into and out of any vehicle. Ample already has deployed seven swapping stations in the Bay Area for participating Uber drivers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/ample-is-the-ev-battery-industrys-newest-unicorn/">plans to launch in Europe</a>, starting with Madrid next year. Depending on COVID-19 border restrictions, Ample is also targeting late next year to start building stations in Japan.</p>
<p>We sat down with de Souza to discuss the merits of a B2B go-to-market strategy, how to create a fun and functional company culture and what it takes to go after an idea most people say won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>You have a track record of founding quite a few companies that span communications, fintech, health tech and now EV battery swapping. A couple of your companies did end up being acquired, so are you planning on sticking it out with Ample? Or are you already thinking about your next startup?</b></p>
<p>Well, it’s not just me, because I have my co-founder and you need to be in sync about what you’re doing. So firstly, I would recommend to any founder, it’s so much better doing it with somebody else than doing it on your own. And it’s easy to be friends with somebody you’ve worked with, but working with a friend is much harder because you may not be friends for long. But I think as we went into this, we’re not thinking about the exit. You go into it assuming it’s going to be a long journey, then it will be a fun journey.</p>
<p>To create something takes time. You need to go through the process, and as long as you’re creating value, you actually want to see the realization. I feel when you jump into it just to quickly create and sell, it&#8217;s not as much fun and it shows in the company culture. People spend so much time at the company that they need to enjoy being there, so if you’re a company where people love Fridays and hate Mondays, then you’re at the wrong company; it’s time to move on.</p>
<p><b>You don’t seem to have any competition in the EV swapping space. Maybe it’s not such a great idea if no one else is trying to solve the problem in the same way.</b></p>
<p>My co-founder and I connected on this idea of doing things that are very improbable, but possible. You just need to find a potential path. If everybody says, &#8220;Oh yeah, this is gonna happen,&#8221; it&#8217;s too late for us. We know it&#8217;s the right time and it&#8217;s possible there&#8217;s a path, but most people are saying this will never work. That doesn&#8217;t discourage us, because it’s clearly in that sector of low probability, and that’s a sector we’re most comfortable in.</p>
<p><b>Better Place tried and failed. Why do you think your company will be successful?</b></p>
<p>We did a lot of research on electric cars before starting this and found electric cars go back a century. One of the reasons people went over from electric to gas was everybody was building specific batteries for each type of car, but gas was possible to use in any car, and that became very convenient. So now with EVs, we’re asking people to go from something very convenient to something that’s exceedingly inconvenient.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is joining other tech giants by lowering its cut of developer revenue generated by voice apps, known as Alexa skills, which run on Amazon&#8217;s smart speakers and other Alexa-powered devices. The company this week <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/12/announcing-updated-benefits-to-help-developers-make-more-money-with-alexa">announced</a> it would next year reduce its commission from 30% to 20% for Alexa skill developers who earn less than $1 million in revenue through things like Skill purchases (paid installs), in-skill purchases (the Alexa equivalent of in-app purchases) and skill subscriptions.</p>
<p>The changes will go into effect starting in the second quarter of 2022, and will be joined by an expansion of developer benefits designed to help third-party developers generate traffic and increase their skills&#8217; visibility. Amazon says developers who generate less than $1 million in the previous calendar year, as well as new Alexa developers, will be eligible for the new program.</p>
<p>The update to Amazon&#8217;s commission structure for Alexa developer revenue follows similar moves made by other tech giants, including Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247966" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Just over a year ago, Apple responded to the increased regulatory scrutiny of its App Store business by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">dropping its commission rate to 15%</a> for small businesses developers with under $1 million in App Store revenues over the course of a year. Previously, those developers had to pay Apple&#8217;s standard 30% commission. Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">soon followed suit</a> with a similar program for Google Play which lowered its cut to 15%, with a slight differentiation as to how it calculated when the lowered commissions would apply. Both companies have since gone on to carve out further exceptions to their standard commission rates for select categories of apps, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">news publishers</a> and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">subscription apps.</a></p>
<p>In addition, Microsoft this year <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">updated</a> its revenue share terms to more favorable rates, with an 85/15 revenue split for app developers using its payments platform and an 88/12 split for game developers.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Alexa platform, however, isn&#8217;t quite in the same category as these other, larger app ecosystems.</p>
<p>While the company had originally planned for a voice app catalog to rival any other app store, the reality is that few developers have been able to capitalize on Alexa&#8217;s <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-maintains-big-lead-google-apple-u-s-smart-speaker-market-new-study-says/">sizable</a> footprint in U.S. consumers&#8217; homes to create profitable businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, Amazon has struggled over the years with skill discovery, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/shopping-via-smart-speakers-is-not-taking-off-report-suggests/">studies found that</a> Alexa device owners largely used their smart speakers and screens for their built-in functions &#8212; like controlling smart home devices, playing music, making shopping lists, setting timers, listening to news and getting quick updates on things like the weather or sports scores, for example. Even voice-based shopping, which Amazon had hoped would take place through Alexa devices, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-reality-behind-voice-shopping-hype">never fully took off.</a></p>
<p>In other words, Amazon&#8217;s adjustment to its commission rates can&#8217;t be viewed in the same light as the changes to other app stores&#8217; policies. While, to some extent, Amazon likely feels pressure to follow market trends, it clearly also hopes that lowered commissions could incentivize Alexa developers to build for its platform.</p>
<p>In the same announcement, Amazon also said it will roll out more benefits designed to increase developers&#8217; potential revenue under the new program that begins next year. These additional perks could be worth &#8220;up to an additional 10 percent&#8221; of a developer&#8217;s potential revenue, Amazon noted. The benefits will include incentive programs, personalized feedback to help developers optimize their skills, help identifying monetization opportunities, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/amazon-begins-rewarding-top-performing-alexa-skill-developers-with-direct-payments/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/amazon-will-now-directly-pay-top-alexa-kid-skill-developers-in-the-u-k-and-germany/">tried</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/amazon-will-now-pay-alexa-developers-for-top-performing-skills-for-kids/">direct</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/amazon-expands-program-that-pays-developers-for-top-voice-apps-to-france-italy-spain/">payments</a> for top skill developers over the years. It&#8217;s unclear for now if the new incentives will be different, or just more of the same. Amazon said it will share more details about the program closer to its launch next year.</p>
<p>The company over the past year, has tried to bring back interest in skill development, by introducing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/amazon-aims-to-inject-new-life-into-alexa-with-huge-release-of-developer-tools-and-features/"> more opportunities</a> to make Alexa skills profitable. It <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/08/developers-can-now-start-building-alexa-paid-skills-in-the-us">launched</a> <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/paid-skills/overview.html">Paid Skills,</a> where consumers pay upfront to access the add-on voice app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/amazon-aims-to-inject-new-life-into-alexa-with-huge-release-of-developer-tools-and-features/">introduced</a> Alexa Shopping Actions to allow developers to sell from Amazon.com within their skill (and earn affiliate income), expanded access to in-skill <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/alexa-in-skill-purchasing-which-lets-developers-make-money-from-voice-apps-launches-internationally/">purchases</a> to more international developers, and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html">reduced the cost of hosting skills</a> to nearly $0.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The crease, it seems, is unavoidable. It’s right there, smack in the middle of the those big, expensive folding displays. And it’s invariably (and perhaps understandably) the first comment on nearly every story I post about a foldable phone. The alternative isn’t ideal, either &#8212; a gap between two distinct displays à la Microsoft’s Surface Duo.</p>
<p>The “N” in Oppo’s new Find N foldable doesn’t stand for “no crease,” exactly, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all reports</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oppos-find-n-foldable-takes-on-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thus far</a> point to a reduction of that being among the biggest aesthetic complaints revolving around the first few generations of foldables. It is, according to Oppo, &#8220;up to 80% less noticeable” than on standard foldables. Crease detection is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, but more than anything, it depends on how the light hits the screen.</p>
<p>But either way, the crease has been a kind of nagging nuisance &#8212; far more than the notch &#8212; in the fact that it cuts right down the center of the screen. What’s notable here is how much work Oppo has been putting in behind the scenes. The company decidedly did not rush this thing to market. It reportedly comes on the tail of six generations of internally developed prototypes as part of a project the hardware maker has been operating since 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The whole of the foldable landscape has decidedly been a mixed bag, thus far &#8212; with some of those failures self-inflected. The broad consensus is that Samsung was just too quick to market with its first foldable, though subsequent generations have made the product much more viable for consumer usage. There’s nothing mainstream about them yet (sorry Samsung), but they’ve undoubtedly come a long way, and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first time I’ve seriously thought “I could use this phone” during the testing process.</p>
<p>Huawei’s original Mate X was promising the few times I had occasion to use it, but that, too, was sidelined when the company ultimately went back to the drawing board. And in the meantime, other, bigger issues than that have been plaguing the hardware maker. Meanwhile, Motorola’s first attempt at a foldable Razr was a flop, though it has managed to correct some of those mistakes with a second generation.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Oppo has avoided some of those pitfalls by waiting. Truth of the matter is, in this industry, being the first to something isn’t always an advantage. At a certain point in the process, you’re effectively doing widespread beta testing among early adopters. And while I sadly wasn’t at Oppo’s big show this week (though Rita’s been doing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/oppos-first-self-developed-chip-is-all-about-imaging-performance/">a splendid job covering it for us</a>), hands-ons have been complimentary with regards to the numerous things the company did right here.</p>
<p>At the very least, it’s easy to see Oppo got a lot right with the 18:9 aspect ratio in that &#8212; unlike other foldables &#8212; it looks like a phone when closed. It’s admittedly pretty thick when closed, but the hinge does a good job keeping the displays flush. At 7.1-inches, the screen falls short of the Fold 3’s 7.6-inches, though I suspect the former is large enough for most folks who feel compelled toward these devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s worth noting, too, that Samsung Display made the folding screen (though Oppo says it did a lot of proprietary work on top) &#8212; which means that, even if Oppo does well, Samsung still gets a cut. A rising tide lifts all boats, I suppose, assuming all of those boats happen to be largely comprised of Samsung components.</p>
<p>The rub here &#8212; and it’s a big one &#8212; is that this is a China-only device. The world’s largest smartphone market, it seems, is enough for Oppo. Of course, now that OnePlus has effectively <em>ahem</em> folded into Oppo, perhaps there’s some opportunity for synergy there. The brand <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/oneplus-tri-fold-foldable-phone-concept-shown-off-20211123/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has notably been toying around</a> with its own foldable concepts of late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another travel startup that found itself scrambling to pivot as the COVID-19 pandemic took off is now announcing a huge round of funding after finding its feet and proving that it can grow, even under adverse circumstances. <a href="https://avantstay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AvantStay</a> &#8212; which has built a platform where it decorates and then lists properties owned by others for people to rent out for vacations or other short-term stays &#8212; has raised $160 million in a Series B round of funding. The company saw revenues grow tenfold in the last two years and its total number of properties balloon to over 1,000, and now it will use the new funding for expansion, specifically adding more properties to its platform; and to continue developing its technology as it expands into more aspects of the property rentals business.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tarsadia Investments and</span> <span class="s3">3L Capital (which led its Series A) co-led this round, with participation also from previous backers </span>Plus Capital, Bullpen Capital and Convivialite; new, strategic investors <span class="s3">Capital One,</span> Saluda Grade, Coller, Greenhawk, Stephen Pagliuca, Fred Tuomi, Jerry Coleman and Jay Mckee; and celebrity investors including Paul George and Shawn Mendes.</p>
<p>AvantStay&#8217;s basic premise is based around kitting out and then handling the rentals for high-end homes as a viable alternative, or even improvement on, the experience that a typical guest might have had in a five-star hotel; and it has harnessed technology in aid of that. The tools that it has built include Voyage, its proprietary operating system to manage properties; a concierge app to help its guests with services before, during and after stays; its front-end booking platform; and a recently launched real estate platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247902" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The concierge service is part of AvantStay&#8217;s strategy of complementing its rentals with as many amenities as guests might have in high-end hotels &#8212; and among its tech investment plans, it wants to continue extending the services that can be offered on it. The startup will also continue to evolve the real estate business, where it helps connect vacation property investors with properties, acting as the broker and then the sole agent for renting those homes out. (But to be clear, it does not own properties itself.)</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based AvantStay has been around since 2017 and had only raised $25 million in the last four years. In that context, this funding is significant &#8212; and large for a Series B &#8212; and underscores some of the traction the company has been having, especially at a time when vacationing all but ground to a halt. The company said that in the last two years it added more than 700 homes and 80 new destinations (some in part by way of six acquisitions that it has made in that time), and it grew revenues 10x.</p>
<p>In all, Sean Breuner, AvantStay&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Reuben Doetsch (the CTO), said that 750,000 guests stay in its network of properties, with the average number per homes being seven guests. It&#8217;s currently not profitable, but it actually did tip into profitability during the pandemic, cutting lots of costs and also shifting to longer-term rentals aimed at corporates.</p>
<p class="p3">Airbnb has created and leads the market for private home accommodation &#8212; and it happens to be one of 60 partners that AvantStay has secured for marketing the homes on its platform &#8212; but Breuner believes the opportunity to develop a business distinct from that, aimed specifically at the opportunity with higher-end properties, still has a lot of growth left in it in its own right, in part because there are still a lot of consumers and business travelers that have yet to accept that they could have an experience better than what they have at high-end hotels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers are starting to meet the demand from an experience perspective in rental homes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has always lagged hotels by a wide margin. But the experience now matches the needs and requirements of what a guest is looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Since we led AvantStay’s Series A investment over two years ago, we’ve watched the company not only grow their supply and revenue tenfold, but also navigate one of the worst possible macro shocks that occurred in the hospitality industry,” said Jodi Kessler, a partner at 3L, in a statement. “Their incredible execution and resilience, combined with a massive tailwind in the travel sector for AvantStay’s product makes us excited to double down on and support the team as they continue to build both a world-class hospitality brand for travelers, and a vertically integrated platform through which individuals and institutions can invest in short-term rental properties.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora&#8217;s self-driving trucks are hauling goods for Uber Freight customers in Texas as part of a multiphase commercial pilot that aims to more closely integrate the two companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pilot was officially announced Wednesday, Aurora&#8217;s self-driving trucks, which always have two vehicle safety operators on board, have been working with Uber Freight for about a year, according to a spokesperson. The news marks a progression from those early tests to a formal commercial pilot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora is using the Uber Freight brokerage platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered, to haul freight for customers between Dallas and Houston. Aurora said it will expand routes as it adds more terminals. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247544" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hauling goods via the Uber Freight platform is notable. The real opportunity, which the companies also plan to do, is to integrate Aurora&#8217;s trucking subscription service into Uber Freight. The trucking subscription service called Aurora Horizon can be thought of as an overarching digital and logistics companion to the self-driving system. Under Aurora Horizon are several other products, including a mission control system that integrates with a carrier or network&#8217;s system and app to communicate dispatching and routing, monitor vehicle health and handle incident response and a roadside assistance program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora plans to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/aurora-shines-spotlight-on-autonomous-truck-tech-strategy-ahead-of-spac-merger/">autonomous trucking business</a> by the end of 2023. If the pilot with Uber Freight succeeds, carriers with subscriptions to Aurora Horizon will be able to access Uber Freight to haul more goods. Aurora&#8217;s pitch is that this will improve efficiency for carriers and ensure trucking capacity isn&#8217;t underutilized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement Wednesday is also a reminder of Aurora and Uber&#8217;s close ties. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Aurora acquired Uber ATG</a>, the company&#8217;s self-driving unit, a year ago. As part of that complex deal, Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. Aurora was privately held at the time, a status that changed in 2021 when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company. Aurora became a publicly traded company in November. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber Freight has been making its own moves. The logistics business, which spun out of Uber in 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">acquired Transplace</a> for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital earlier this year. The acquisition is part of Uber Freight&#8217;s aim to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expand into Mexico.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost three million Americans a year are denied a mortgage. Most don&#8217;t even know where to start or understand what would qualify them. The system has become complex and confusing, causing people to never make it onto the housing ladder at all. This is in contrast to the mortgage industry, which is leaving these people on the table by being geared only to those who are ready and qualified to buy, a relatively small percentage of those who&#8217;d actually like to.</p>
<p>Fintech startups like NerdWallet, Lower.com, Divvy and Landis have appeared in recent years trying to, for instance, make it easier to save for home loans. But there’s clearly plenty of room for more entrants, especially ones that can hand-hold consumers through the complex process.</p>
<p><a href="http://quo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quo</a> is a relatively new startup with what it claims is a fresh approach to homeownership. Its consumer-oriented app shows users where they are today in terms of their financial position and goes through what mortgage qualification criteria they need to hit in order to secure a home loan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It has now raised $7.2 million in a seed funding round led by <a href="https://signalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SignalFire</a>, with participation by Justin Mateen and current investors Soma Capital, Global Founders Capital and others.</p>
<p>Alongside that, it has also acquired Uncapped Mortgage, a licensed mortgage brokerage startup based out of Nashville, and re-branded it to QuoHome. QuoHome provides mortgage brokering services for Quo users once they are ready to buy.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new funding will be used to accelerate the growth of the QuoHome coaching app. Quo claims its users have amassed $200 million in home buying power and are working towards $1.2 billion in homes, growing at over 100% CMGR.</p>
<p>The Quo product works by connecting to your credit, savings and income information to build a financial profile. It then compares your information to mortgage underwriting guidelines to assess how much you can afford today and the bar you need to hit across credit, debt and savings to afford the home you want.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It then finds shortcuts for you to be able to afford a home faster, such as working out whicht debts you should pay off, versus saving that money for a down payment.</p>
<p>Quo was founded in 2018 by Tucker Haas and Neel Yerneni while they were seniors at Stanford University with the mission to make building wealth more equitable, starting with homeownership.</p>
<p>Haas says he grew up in a household that struggled with home financing for years after they got into economic problems.</p>
<p>“Having grown up in a low-income household, I had firsthand experience with a broken financial system. Quo is our way of driving at the mission of making building wealth more equitable,” he said. “Since launching the beta in June, our members now manage over $21 million in home savings with Quo and are building towards almost half a billion dollars in homes. With our $7.2 million in funding led by SignalFire, we’re proving there’s a more aligned and accessible way to approach this industry.”</p>
<p>Josh Constine of Signalfire commented: “I think the big trend here is economic uncertainty spurring a new wave of fintech for savings and homeownership as the middle-class tries to find some stability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest move to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">placate European competition regulators</a>, Google has offered a set of commitments to France&#8217;s antitrust watchdog &#8212; in the hopes of settling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">costly</a> (for it) intervention over legally mandated payments for displaying snippets of news publishers&#8217; content.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">Back in July</a>, France&#8217;s Autorité de la Concurrence slapped the tech giant with a fine of half a billion euros over a series of suspected breaches in how it negotiated with news publishers to remunerate them for reuse of their content.</p>
<p>The backstory here is the European Union agreed to a reform of digital copyright rules, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">back in 2019</a>, which (among other changes) extended copyright law to cover snippets of news publishers&#8217; content that were being routinely reused by aggregators like Google News.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247885" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While there was plenty of criticism of the reform at the time, the directive has given the bloc&#8217;s news publishers leverage over Google and does appear to have contributed to the adtech giant&#8217;s decision to abandon its earlier hard line stance &#8212; of saying it would never pay a penny for news content &#8212; in favor of creating its own content licensing product aimed at news publishers.</p>
<p>However that News Showcase product looked like a cynical attempt by Google to more cheaply circumvent legal requirements by using a global news licensing vehicle to bundle compliance with a growing number of national laws on news content remuneration (see also: Australia, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">earlier this year</a> passed a law requiring Google and Facebook engage in mandatory negotiations with publishers over content reuse) &#8212; and grab itself sweeping rights to publishers&#8217; content in the process &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly the sort of &#8220;bad faith&#8221; behavior that Google is being called out for in France.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TjEYsLdk9w"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/embed/#?secret=TjEYsLdk9w" data-secret="TjEYsLdk9w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France was one of the first EU Member States to transpose the pan-EU copyright directive into national law, and the Autorité has taken an aggressive approach to enforcing complaints over Google&#8217;s compliance with the new rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, for example, when Google sought to evade application of the law in the country &#8212; by stopping displaying snippets of local publishers&#8217; content unless publishers gave it free authorization to show them &#8212; the watchdog slapped down the practice, finding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">last year</a> that it was likely to be abuse of a dominant market position; and telling Google it could not just unilaterally withdraw the content.</p>
<p>It also ordered Google to negotiate in good faith with publishers to pay for displaying their legally protected content &#8212; giving it three months to do so. After which, following a number of complaints by French publishers, the Autorité stepped in again to investigate Google&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p>And it went on to apply interim measures in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">July</a>, based on its preliminary concerns.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the Autorité believes Google has applied &#8220;unfair and discriminatory settlement conditions&#8221;; and is likely to have sought to circumvent the law on &#8220;related rights&#8221; &#8212; although its investigation continues in parallel with the intervention.</p>
<p>The latest development now is that the <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/google-proposes-commitments-part-investigation-merits-related-rights-case-autorite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autorité has published details</a> of a set of commitments Google has offered to try to resolve the investigation. The watchdog is consulting on the proposals &#8212; inviting interested third parties, publishers and news agencies to submit comments before January 31, 2022.</p>
<p>It will then hold a hearing with relevant parties and could choose to close the case &#8212; if it decides Google&#8217;s commitments are acceptable &#8212; at which point it would make them binding on Google.</p>
<p>It could also opt to amend and beef up the commitments. So Google&#8217;s offer is by no means the final word.</p>
<p>Over in the U.K., meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority is undertaking a similar procedure in relation to Google&#8217;s planned deprecation of tracking cookies to migrate to alternative ad targeting tech &#8212; with the CMA currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">consulting on commitments Google has offered around its Privacy Sandbox proposal</a> (and in that case if they are accepted Google has said it will apply them globally) &#8212; underlining the growing influence European regulators are having over the future shape of Big Tech.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">an in-train procedure related to Google&#8217;s News Showcase T&amp;Cs</a>. So Google is likely facing more antitrust action on this front in Europe.</p>

<h2>What is Google offering in France?</h2>
<p>The Autorité said Google has proposed the following &#8220;remedies&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google undertakes to &#8220;negotiate in good faith&#8221; with press publishers and news agencies that so request, the remuneration for any reproduction of protected content on its services in accordance with the modalities laid down in Article L.218-4 of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriété intellectuelle) and according to transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria.</li>
<li>Google undertakes to communicate the information necessary for a transparent evaluation of the proposed remuneration, as provided for in Article L.218-4 of the French Intellectual Property Code (Code de la propriété intellectuelle).</li>
<li>Google undertakes to make a proposal for remuneration within three months of the start of negotiations.</li>
<li>In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the negotiating parties will have the option of referring the matter to an arbitration tribunal to determine the amount of remuneration. Google undertakes to pay the fees of the arbitrators and the arbitration proceedings in the first instance.</li>
<li>Google undertakes to take the necessary steps to ensure that the negotiations do not affect the indexation, ranking or presentation of protected content.</li>
<li>Google undertakes to take the necessary steps to ensure that the negotiations do not affect any other economic relationship that may exist between Google and the news publishers and news agencies.</li>
<li>An independent trustee approved by the Autorité will ensure the implementation of the commitments made and may, if necessary, call on the services of a technical, financial or intellectual property expert.</li>
<li>The commitments will apply for a period of five years.</li>
</ul>
<p>In its own <a href="https://france.googleblog.com/2021/12/nos-engagements-sur-les-droits-voisins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about the proposals (written in French), attributed to Sébastien Missoffe, VP and CEO of Google France<i>, </i>Google points to recent deals it has inked with local publishers (such as AFP) &#8212; claiming this sums to &#8220;significant progress&#8221; on reaching an <em>entente cordiale</em> on the news numeration issue, while acknowledging negotiations with other French publishers are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Google condenses what it&#8217;s proposing &#8212; and what it hopes will end the expensive litigation, with Missoffe suggesting the proposals will &#8220;open a new chapter in the area of ​​Neighboring Rights&#8221; &#8212; under the following three subtitles: &#8220;Specific offers on neighboring rights&#8221;; &#8220;Respect for the choices of the publishers&#8221;; and &#8220;More transparency and independent supervision&#8221;.</p>
<p>And we could perhaps further condense that to an offer of &#8220;specific respect, supervised&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly notable that both the Autorité&#8217;s intervention over news and the CMA&#8217;s investigation of Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox have led to an offer &#8212; by Google &#8212; of an monitoring trustee to verify compliance, underlying how little trust advertisers and publishers have in the tech giant doing the right thing when no one is looking.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">first set of commitments Google offered the CMA</a> did not go far enough to convince the wider market which feeds Google&#8217;s ad coffers that it would play fair &#8212; leading Google to come back with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">enhanced commitments</a> (including the offer of the monitoring trustee and a slight extension to the length of time the commitments would be enforced).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether publishers in France will be content with Google&#8217;s first offer &#8212; or also push for greater assurances that the tech giant will play fair over news remuneration.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, signs off its blog post by claiming its &#8220;objective&#8221; is to &#8220;conclude definitive agreements, in compliance with the law, and to open a new chapter with press editors&#8221;. But the prospect of a $592 million fine has doubtless helped concentrate minds in Mountain View vis-à-vis compliance with French law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of these commitments, Google will continue to invest, as we have for years, in products and training to support journalism,&#8221; Missoffe adds in remarks that are of course irrelevant to the specific issue of compliance with French law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Launched in 2006, education startup<a href="https://www.coursehero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Course Hero</a> started its life away from the attention of venture capital. After launching, the company waited eight years to raise a $15 million Series A. Then, after going another nearly six years without raising venture capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">Course Hero closed two financings in 2020.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coursehero.com/blog/course-hero-series-c-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yesterday</a>, the edtech company announced yet another tranche of capital: a $380 million Series C at a $3.6 billion valuation. The financing, led by Wellington Management with participation from new investors Sequoia Capital Global Equities, OMERS Growth Equity and D1 Capital Partners, as well as existing investors, brings a 227.3% increase to Course Hero’s valuation in a little over a year. The business has been cash flow positive and profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis for over five years, it claims.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247628" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The raise comes as a stark contrast to CEO and co-founder Andrew Grauer&#8217;s comments in 2020, when he spoke on the “risk and reward of raising capital.”</p>
<p>“If you raise too much money early on, you can get misaligned expectations based on different time horizons set up by different terms of incoming shareholders or investors,” he said. Course Hero’s rapid capitalization today thus suggests that Grauer now thinks that the startup has graduated past a point of dealing with unfavorable incentives from its investors.</p>
<p>And to be fair, his new vision for the company makes a good argument for why he needs so much capital in this given moment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247631" style="width: 969px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247631" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2247631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png" alt="" width="959" height="501" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png 2700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=2048,1070 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/prnewswire.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Course Hero</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founder believes that Course Hero has evolved past its main business model &#8212; a place where students can come to access more than 80 million course-specific study resources and guides &#8212; into a platform play. Going forward, Course Hero will formalize its mass consolidation mindset, as we’ve seen through its acquisitions of Symbolab<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">,</a> LitCharts, CliffsNotes and QuillBot, as a business strategy.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re working to build a platform that serves the entire learning journey, almost like a productivity suite for learning,” he said. “Each business will continue to build their products and brands, and there&#8217;s an opportunity for us to build an ecosystem to integrate the products into each other that create more value for learners and educators.&#8221; PR-speak aside, the capital will be used to fuel acquisitions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/03/edtech-2021/">And we know edtech is full of them.</a></p>
<p>Grauer estimates that he can grow Course Hero from gaining 2 million subscribers per year to 50 million subscribers per year by 2030 by serving more than just as a “study platform for students and a resource for educators.” Going forward, students will be able to go to coursehero.com like they traditionally have, but also navigate to its broader product and brand suite.</p>
<p>“The last two years we have seen a bigger shift in advancing pedagogy online and the way that we evaluate and assess student comprehension is evolving as a result,” he told TechCrunch. “All of these changes require better, more affordable and effective resources, tools and services to meet the needs of today’s students and educators.”</p>
<p>The co-founder explained that he plans to use the new capital to acquire businesses operating in new verticals, subject areas, grade levels and countries. &#8220;This definitely includes a focus on technical topics and skills as well as tool-driven product solutions,&#8221; he added. And clearly, there’s still solid room to grow.</p>
<p>Grauer said that Course Hero hasn’t yet begun to “fully dive into crypto and web3,” a movement that could definitely use some translation help to the legions of people who haven’t fallen down the rabbit hole just yet. As the company’s total addressable market becomes broader, and hopefully more diverse, Course Hero will need to evolve to support a whole range of learning needs &#8212; not just requests for 24/7 homework help or study guides on the latest lit assignment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the same way that PayPal and Stripe radically changed online payments by allowing any online service to embed payments, the race is on to have the same impact on crypto assets. To this end, players such as <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyre</a> (raised $29.1 million) and <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoonPay</a> (raised $555 million) have risen to the fore. But in the summer of this year, a similar, U.K.-based startup called <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> (not to be confused with U.S. &#8220;trad-fi&#8221; startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">Ramp</a>) de-cloaked like a Klingon battleship in space, with a $10.1 million <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/london-based-startup-ramp-raises-7-1m-to-become-the-paypal-for-crypto-20210615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round</a>, and even had hard-won approval from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under its belt.</p>
<p>The company is now clearly on a roll.</p>
<p>Ramp has now raised a $52.7 million Series A round led by Balderton Capital. Existing investors NFX, Galaxy Digital, Seedcamp and Firstminute Capital also participated, alongside angel investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise) and Francesco Simoneschi (TrueLayer), and the investment will see Balderton’s General Partner Rana Yared join the Ramp board. The startup has now raised a total of $63 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Szymon Sypniewicz (CEO) and Przemek Kowalczyk (CTO, CPO), Ramp has a non-custodial, full-stack payment infrastructure. The idea here is to open up digital assets to more businesses and users by making it possible to send or receive crypto without having to go through an exchange like Coinbase, for instance.</p>
<p>Ramp allows anyone that wants to offer crypto-enabled services to do so via its SDK in a few hours, without the need to set up their own on-ramping stack to an exchange, an extremely time-consuming and potentially costly business.</p>
<p>This is, of course, very advantageous to Ramp, because it forces users to move between Ramp-powered services without having to jump through multiple verification hoops. Faster for the users, but also great for Ramp.</p>
<p>In part because of this ease of use, it’s managed to partner up with more than 400 developers, including Mozilla, Browser and Dapper Labs and DeFi apps like Aave, Argent, Trust Wallet and Zerion. It is also the exclusive on-ramping partner for Sorare, the blockchain-based, global sports video game, and Flow, the blockchain which specializes in NFT marketplaces and digital assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Furthermore, users of the Opera browser can top-up crypto wallets from within the app, or Sorare NFT game players can buy and sell virtual players via Ethereum. In addition, the NFT-based game Axie Infinity used Ramp to shorten its onboarding process from two hours to minutes.</p>
<p>The ultimate vision is to facilitate crypto transactions for banks’ or other financial institutions’ end-users within their banking apps. This would be where TradFi meets DeFi.</p>
<p>Ramp has also recently received regulatory approval from U.S. FinCen &#8212; the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enables the company to operate legally in the U.S. And in Poland, it has become the first on-ramping company to <a href="https://medium.com/rampnetwork/ramp-got-open-banking-license-60be108a9df2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive</a> an open banking license from The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) in 2020.</p>
<p>Szymon Sypniewicz, Ramp co-founder and CEO, said: “There is so much potential in unlocking cryptocurrency and digital assets beyond today’s narrow and restrictive use cases. We’re on a mission to provide instant access to cryptocurrencies through a provider they can trust.”</p>
<p>On its competitive position against Wyre and MoonPay, a spokesperson said Ramp is focusing on transaction transparency and regulatory approval, hence the FCA and FinCen stuff: “While several competitors prefer to embed some of their fees in conversion rates, Ramp prides itself on showing its fees up-front so that consumers know exactly what they are paying for.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An analyst note from JP Morgan has thrown a wrench into the valuations market for technology shares. And while the impact of the missive is being felt most sharply among public companies, its impacts could show up in the valuations of yet-private technology firms as well.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The note changed the bank&#8217;s valuation perspective regarding a number of technology companies. In response to what <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/cloud-stocks-adobe-cloudflare-zscaler-plunge-on-jpmorgan-downgrades.html">CNBC described</a> as a &#8220;wave of downgrades&#8221; from JP Morgan, investors pulled the rug on a few notable tech companies. Here&#8217;s a partial list of the damage from yesterday&#8217;s trading, after the downgrades were made public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zscaler: -7.84%</li>
<li>Datadog: -6.54%</li>
<li>Cloudflare: -8.98%</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You get the picture.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more important is that the note connected rising interest rates to an anticipated decline in the value of various technology shares. To wit: &#8220;With rates climbing, this adds risk to higher multiple software stocks trading over 20 times revenue,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/cloud-stocks-adobe-cloudflare-zscaler-plunge-on-jpmorgan-downgrades.html">per a CNBC quote</a> of the note. (A longer list of upgrades and downgrades from the communiqué can be found <a href="https://247wallst.com/apps-software/2021/12/14/jp-morgan-makes-big-changes-to-software-stock-ratings/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If tech companies valued at more than 20x revenues see their valuations decline as rates rise, it would create a downward compression effect on tech valuations more generally. Put simply: If the tech companies with the richest valuations were dragged closer to a 20x multiple, it would slash the worth of nearly every tech company, period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney+ is the latest streaming app to add support for Apple&#8217;s SharePlay, the iOS 15 feature that offers a co-viewing experience over FaceTime video calls on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV devices. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-shareplay-for-co-watching-streaming-and-screen-sharing-over-facetime/">announced</a> during Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, SharePlay rolled out with the iOS 15.1 update, soon offering co-viewing experiences <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across a variety of apps</a>, including NBA, <a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-latest-get-shareplay-update-adds-new-us-page-during-facetime-calls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-shareplay-iphone-ipad-facetime-192948698.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, Paramount+ and Showtime, as well as Apple&#8217;s own apps like Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Fitness, among others.</p>
<p>Disney+, however, has been a long-awaited addition to this lineup, as Apple had announced during WWDC that the streaming service would be among those supporting the new feature.</p>
<p>Today, the companies are making good on that promise with the release of a Disney+ app update that will allow subscribers to use the SharePlay feature on Apple&#8217;s iOS, iPadOS and tvOS devices. Disney says the feature will be compatible globally across the entire Disney+ catalog from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. This includes its new titles like Marvel Studios&#8217; &#8220;Hawkeye,&#8221; &#8220;Welcome to Earth&#8221; and its upcoming Disney+ premieres, like &#8220;Encanto,&#8221; which arrives on Christmas Eve (December 24), and the &#8220;The Book of Boba Fett,&#8221; which becomes available starting on December 29.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2247941" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247941" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2247941" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=1536,752 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=2048,1003 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SharePlay_Encanto.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247941" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney</p></div></p>
<p>Once updated, users will be able to host and attend SharePlay sessions that allow up to 32 people to co-watch Disney+ together. This could make for an easy way for a family who can&#8217;t be together for the holidays to have a Disney movie night, for example, or a way to entertain the kids by having them stream Disney+ with friends back home while out of town for a holiday trip, among other things.</p>
<p>The SharePlay feature itself is relatively easy to use as it&#8217;s built into the FaceTime app. To use the feature, you&#8217;ll first start the FaceTime call, then open the Disney+ app. A notice will appear at the top of the screen alerting you that SharePlay is available. You&#8217;ll tap play on the content you want to watch and begin watching with everyone else on the call. The playback controls are available to everyone else on the SharePlay session, allowing each user to press play, pause, rewind or fast forward.</p>
<p>Disney notes that each participant can select the audio and subtitles in the language of their choice when streaming on their device. The feature also offers multiple viewing options, allowing people to watch the streaming content on their Apple TV while still FaceTiming with friends and family on their iPhone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SharePlay has been one of the more interesting features in the iOS 15 release, as it seems like a natural next direction for the FaceTime software in an age where social distancing and remote work have become the norm, and apps like Zoom have crossed into consumer territory. In addition to supporting co-watching, users can also screen-share over SharePlay, even launching apps and browsing together &#8212; great for anything from online shopping to offering aging family members remote tech support.</p>
<p>To use SharePlay to stream Disney+, all participants must be running at least iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1 and tvOS 15.1, and they&#8217;ll need to be a Disney+ subscriber.</p>
<p>Though Disney is embracing SharePlay, its own in-app co-viewing feature, <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-plus-introduces-group-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called GroupWatch</a>, will continue to be available to all subscribers in the same country across compatible devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re very excited to launch SharePlay on Disney+ for Apple users in time for the holidays and ahead of several highly anticipated premieres,&#8221; said Jerrell Jimerson, EVP of Product &amp; Design, Disney Streaming, in a statement. &#8220;With thousands of movies and shows and a growing content catalog of new titles and originals, SharePlay provides another opportunity for personal friends and family around the world to come together and create new memories with their favorite stories on Disney+,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gothelist.com/gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The List</a> joins the social commerce movement with a new app connecting consumers with global luxury brands and retailers to offer a personalized discovery and shopping experience.</p>
<p>Focused on sourcing hard-to-find items, the app launch is buoyed by $3.5 million in seed funding backed by a group including American Designer and Rachel Zoe, who is both an investor and advisor to the New York-based company.</p>
<p>The List, with offices in Dubai and Lisbon, was founded in 2016 as an e-commerce marketplace and works with authorized, professional sellers. Its new app is an extension of the marketplace, merging content, social networking and live commerce.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247603" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The foundation of our business is to help retail stores and brands join the e-commerce wave that is happening,” The List founder and CEO Andreas Skorski told TechCrunch. “We built machine learning and computer vision into the supply chain so they can plug and play into a store. We also have multiple APIs to sync and digitalize inventory to create a product catalogue.”</p>
<p>App features include the ability to livestream with a retailer, brand or personal shopper, ask questions in real time and receive recommendations or in-store presentations. Shoppers can follow their favorite brands and stores and engage when images or videos are shoppable. They can also upload a photo of an item to the seller network and get its sourced fast and at the best possible price.</p>
<p>On the seller side of the app, you can set up a digital store in minutes and determine how their brand and products will be presented and promoted. The List takes care of the entire fulfilment process, including insurance, taxes and duties, as well as store-to-door express delivery to 190 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For years, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1280/social-commerce/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China led in social commerce</a>, but it became a more popular concept in the United States during the global pandemic.  As such, Grand View Research reported earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/social-commerce-market-size-worth-3-369-8-billion-by-2028--cagr-28-4-grand-view-research-inc-301207167.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global social commerce market</a> was forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion by 2028 from growing annually by over 28% between now and then.</p>
<p>Social commerce is also proving to be global, with companies across the world finding success is this sector and attracting venture capital to back it up. For example, in November, Facily, a Brazil-based social commerce marketplace, closed on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/brazilian-social-commerce-marketplace-facily-quietly-raises-366m-in-less-than-a-year-now-valued-at-850m/">$250 million Series D round</a>. Prior to that, Evermos an Indonesian social commerce startup, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/indonesian-social-commerce-startup-evermos-lands-30m-series-b/">$30 million in Series B funding</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The List works with over 150 retail partners around the world, and while the U.S. is The List’s largest market, the app launch will help it grow into additional markets and offer products in different languages.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow aggressively and add to its 55-person workforce. Over the past year, The List saw growth on both sides of its business model, with several hundred people joining the supply side, and on the consumer side, revenue jumped by a couple thousand percent, Skorski said. In fact, this year’s Black Friday in November contributed to the best month ever in company history, he added.</p>
<p>“Digital sales has taken a dominant role, much like how restaurants have iPads at tables,” Skorski said. “The same will happen in the retail space, and it will be a matter of who gets there faster. We are creating this world to enable true storytelling in its best form.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we last checked in with <a href="https://www.cequence.ai/">Cequence Security</a> in February 2019, the company had just closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/cequence-security-hauls-in-17m-series-b-investment-to-help-protect-applications/">a $17 million Series B</a> and was concentrating on security to protect business logic. While it still does that, it has shifted focus to API security, and today it announced a $60 million Series C.</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures led the latest round with participation from new investors Icon Ventures, Telstra Ventures and HarbourVest Partners along with existing investors Shasta Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital and T-Mobile Ventures. The company said it has now raised $100 million.</p>
<p>CEO Larry Link said that the startup was seeing more vulnerabilities through APIs with customers, and they began to shift the focus of the Cequence analytics engine to find those kinds of vulnerabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247897" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We now will discover what your API footprint looks like. [Without having] to instrument it, we&#8217;re finding things, and then we detect [any] abuse that&#8217;s going on on those API endpoints, and then we can mitigate that. So that&#8217;s how the product has evolved,&#8221; Link told me.</p>
<p>He said that Cequence looks at approximately 150 data points to determine if the activity is something to worry about.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we look at individual requests first, and then we look at clustering of requests second, and then we look at the intent of those requests third, and that&#8217;s where we tease things out like, &#8216;Hey, this is an account takeover attack, or this is a credential stuffing attack, or this is an inventory manipulation attack,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Link said the company grew 2.5x over the last year and that there is a lot of room for growth. &#8220;We&#8217;re not releasing our revenue numbers, but it&#8217;s a very healthy growth rate and pretty high ARR for this kind of the business, and that&#8217;s why we wanted to raise this Series C, because we have a lot of opportunity. We need to fuel that,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has just over 100 employees today and could reach as high as 250 by the end of 2022, depending on how the business goes. Link said that as the company expanded over the last year and moved at least partly remote, the workforce has grown more diverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in the value of a diverse workforce. We think it gives us better insight and is a better platform to grow and expand the company. So the recent change in the last year and a half where some jobs need to be HQ-based, but most of our jobs can be working from anywhere. And this is kind of a new transition that we&#8217;ve seen, and it&#8217;s enabling us to get, I think, a better quality workforce and also a more diverse workforce,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is Link&#8217;s fifth startup. His previous job before joining Cequence was VP of Sales at Palo Alto Networks. The founders hired him after starting the company to add an experienced industry veteran to run the show.</p>
