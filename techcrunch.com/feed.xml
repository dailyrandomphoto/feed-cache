										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a turbulent week for the stock market and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">halts to the trading of certain speculative securities</a> including GameStop (GME) and AMC, consumer investing app Robinhood has raised new capital. The new funds total more than $1 billion, with the company telling TechCrunch that they were raised from its existing investor base.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html">reports that</a> the company raised the new equity capital after tapping its credit lines for $500 to $600 million; the company did not answer a question from TechCrunch regarding its credit lines.</p>
<p>The reported drawdown matches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">reporting from yesterday</a> indicating that Robinhood had accessed nine-figures of capital to ensure it had enough funds on hand to meet regulatory minimums and other requirements related to its users&#8217; trading activity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Individual retail investors, along with institutional capital, have attacked short positions in some stocks in recent weeks, leading to a tug-of-war between bullish investors and bearish wagers; the resulting tumult led to surging volume for volatile stocks, leading to Robinhood needing more capital to keep its gears turning.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility">post</a> discussing its decision yesterday to restrict trading on select securities, Robinhood wrote that it has &#8220;many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits,&#8221; adding that &#8220;some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unicorn consumer fintech company halted trading in stocks like GameStop that had become the center of the trading storm yesterday, leading to frenetic accusations from incensed users that something nefarious was afoot. Later in the day the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/webull-and-public-remove-restrictions-on-memestocks-after-citing-trade-settlement-firm-as-the-cause/">clearing house entity powering trading for other consumer trading services</a> also halted service for a similar set of stocks.</p>
<p>Robinhood told users that it would allow trading to begin in some fashion today in shares it had previously restricted.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>It does not appear that the current trading scrap will abate soon. Shares of GameStop, the most famous so-called &#8220;meme stock&#8221; in the current trading war, is up just under 94% this morning in pre-market trading, implying that many investors are willing to continue pushing its value higher in hopes of breaking short bets laid by other investors.</p>
<p>One result of the current climate is a boom in demand for trading apps. Today on the US iOS App Store, Robinhood is ranked first; Webull, a rival service is second; Reddit, a hub for trading gossip mostly via r/WallStreetBets is third; Coinbase a popular crypto trading service is fourth in line. Square&#8217;s Cash App, which allows for share purchases is ranked seventh, Fidelity&#8217;s iOS app comes in tenth place, and TD Ameritrade is 16th. Finally, E*Trade&#8217;s own app is ranked 18th. That&#8217;s a good showing for fintech, both startup and incumbent alike.</p>
<p>No one knows what comes next, how the trades play out, and if the present-day surge in retail interesting in stock trading will persist. What does seem clear, however, is that today is going to be very silly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another COVID-19 vaccine is almost ready to begin being distributed – a single-shot inoculation made by Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Janssen pharmaceutical subsidiary. The company just released an<a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial"> efficacy report based on data from its Phase 3 trial</a>, which found that the new vaccine is 66% effective overall in preventing moderate to severe incarnations of COVID-19 in those who received the jab, and 85% effective in preventing sever disease.</p>
<p>Those numbers aren&#8217;t as impressive as the reported figures for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines that are already being distributed via emergency FDA approval, both of which reported 90+% efficacy. But Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s vaccine is a single shot rather than a two-course treatment, which should make it much easier to distribute much more quickly. The vaccine also showed 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death among participants in the trial, 28 days after vaccination, which is a key measure when considering the broader impact of COVID-19 on healthcare resources, and efficacy varied by region, with the jab proving 72% effective in the U.S. across moderate and severe cases vs. 66% globally.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Phase 3 trial is happening amid the emergence of new strains of the virus, including much more contagious versions like the UK and South African variants. At the time that both Moderna and BioNTech released their trial data, these variants hadn&#8217;t yet emerged or been confirmed by pandemic researchers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s vaccine uses a modified version of a common cold virus to deliver DNA that provides a person&#8217;s body with instructions on building a replica of the spike protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to attach to cells. The modified adenovirus can&#8217;t replicate in human cells, however, meaning it won&#8217;t lead to illness – only an immune response that can later be employed to combat contracting the virus that leads to COVID-19. This adenovirus method is much more proven in terms of use in human patients vs. the mRNA method that the other vaccines currently in use employ.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, despite headline numbers that appear to fall short relative to the data we&#8217;ve seen from Moderna and Pfizer, this Johnson &amp; Johnson report is actually very encouraging. The company says it expects to file a request for an Emergency Use Approval (EUA) from the FDA in February, which could see it begin to be distributed next month, adding yet another weapon in the arsenal to combat the global pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber&#8217;s plan to acquire Autocab, a maker of SaaS for booking and dispatch software for the taxi and private hire vehicle industry which also operates a global trip marketplace for taxis and PHVs (<a href="https://www.autocab.com/our-solutions/igo/">iGo</a>), is being looked at by the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog &#8212; which <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/600fe20fd3bf7f05be4d1e22/Uber_Autocab_Notice_commencement_initial_period_.pdf">announced</a> the launch of an inquiry today.</p>
<p>The deadline for a decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on whether to refer the merger for an in-depth investigation is March 26.</p>
<p>Uber announced its intention to acquire UK-based Autocab last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/uber-picks-up-autocab-to-push-into-places-its-own-app-doesnt-go/">August</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Competition considerations could arise if Uber, a provider of ride-hailing services that competes with traditional taxis and private hire vehicle firms for customers, were to shutter Autocab&#8217;s alternative trip booking marketplace or close it in selective markets where its own ride-hailing service operates, for example.</p>
<p>Although, at the time it announced the acquisition, Uber said it planned to support Autocab’s expansion of SaaS and iGo internationally. The <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">move also looks intended to create more opportunities for Uber drivers to pick up jobs from outside its own platform, including delivery work, as ride-hailing has faced a demand squeeze during the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the overlap between Autocab&#8217;s iGo marketplace and Uber&#8217;s core rides service certainly merits questions being asked about risks to competition.</p>
<p>The CMA has opened an invitation for comment on the merger &#8212; with a February 12 deadline for submissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;To assist it with this assessment, the CMA invites comments on the transaction from any interested party.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the inquiry in a statement, an Uber spokeswoman said: “We are cooperating fully with the UK Competition and Market Authority’s inquiry to ensure it can conclude its review as quickly as possible. We are confident that this acquisition is positive for consumers, will help local operators grow and provide drivers with genuine earning opportunities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sirenum.com/">Sirenum</a>, a platform for remotely managing a shift-based workforce across industries such as railway, aviation, construction, and the gig economy, has raised a $2.7 million Series A  funding round from new investors including former Tesco CEO Sir Terry Leahy, Intrinsic Capital founding partner Mark Horrocks and investment manager Bill Currie.</p>
<p>Sirenum says its subscription model platform simplifies the process of managing shift workers, including rostering and managing schedules, monitoring and engaging staff, and processing key financial processes including payroll. Its clients include Randstad, Impellam, Manpower and GI Group as well as specialist agencies like TES.</p>
<p>The issue with shift workers is that they need to be in the right place at the right time and paid the right amount. Obviously. Sirenum says it allows staff to manage their own time by accepting or rejecting shifts and check their payroll at any time through a mobile app. The platform handles shift management, payroll, compliance, and scheduling. The app also tracks the fatigue of workers based on the UK’s Health and Safety guidelines, meaning employers can track the wellness of employees and adhere to compliance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product came about when Sirenum founder Benjamin Rubin ran a staffing agency in London. He was on honeymoon with his wife when he received a call that one of his employees had been hit by a train.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the employee was fine, but Rubin realized that to avoid being in that same situation again, he needed a tool to be able to manage his staff safely at multiple locations. He developed the Sirenum product as a solution for his agency and in 2012 won the contract to staff the Olympic Stadium. In 2014 Sirenum became a standalone product. It now claims to have nearly 400,000 workers on the platform.</p>
<p>Its competitors include TempBuddy (owned by Bullhorn), Shiftboard, and WorkN. Shiftboard has raised $16.9 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.chefclub.tv/en-us//">Chefclub</a> announced earlier this week that it has raised a $17 million funding round led by First Bridge Ventures. SEB Alliance, the venture arm of kitchen appliance maker Groupe SEB, Korelya Capital and Algaé Ventures are also participating.</p>
<p>Chefclub has been building a major media brand on social media platforms. It has attracted a huge audience that doesn’t look bad next to well-funded media brands Tastemade and Tasty.</p>
<p>I already covered the company at length, so I encourage you to read my previous profile of the company:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9TCyt6cAiK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/how-food-media-brand-chefclub-reached-1-billion-organic-views-per-month/">How food media brand Chefclub reached 1 billion organic views per month</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How food media brand Chefclub reached 1 billion organic views per month&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/how-food-media-brand-chefclub-reached-1-billion-organic-views-per-month/embed/#?secret=9TCyt6cAiK" data-secret="9TCyt6cAiK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chefclub is an interesting lesson in sales funnel. It has a huge top of the funnel with 100 million followers YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. Overall, they generate over 1 billion views per month.</p>
<p>The company leverages that audience to create new products. It starts with cooking books, obviously. Chefclub has sold 700,000 books so far. As those books are self-published, the company gets to keep a good chunk of the revenue.</p>
<p>More recently, the startup has launched cooking kits for kids with colorful measuring cups, cooking accessories and easy-to-understand recipes. 150,000 people have bought a product for children.</p>
<p>Chefclub now wants to display its brands in stores thanks to partnerships. That’s why having Groupe SEB as an investor makes sense. You can imagine co-branded items boosted by promotion on Chefclub’s accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, the startup plans to enter a new market —&nbsp;consumer-packaged goods. That’s the same thinking behind it, except that we’re talking about food. It’s interesting to see that Chefclub doesn’t think online ads represent the future of the company. And it seems like a smart decision during the current economic crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi, the world&#8217;s third largest smartphone maker, today unveiled “<a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/">Mi Air Charge Technology</a>” that it says can deliver 5W power to multiple devices “within a radius of several metres” as the Chinese giant invited customers to a “true wireless charging era.”</p>
<p>The company said it has self-developed an isolated charging pile that has five phase interference antennas built-in, which can “accurately detect the location of the smartphone.”</p>
<p>A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming, the company said, adding that “in the near future” the system will also be able to work with smart watches, bracelets, and other wearable devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A company spokesperson said Xiaomi, which has previously introduced <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-80w-wireless-charging-fills-4000mah-battery-19-minutes/">80W</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-first-phone-qualcomm-quick-charge-5/">120W</a> wireless charging tech, won’t be deploying this new system to consumer products this year.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsFHKCcV2rg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company has described the mechanics of its new tech:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.</p>
<p>Currently, Xiaomi remote charging technology is capable of 5-watt remote charging for a single device within a radius of several meters. Apart from that, multiple devices can also be charged at the same time (each device supports 5 watts), and even physical obstacles do not reduce the charging efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>News site XDA-Developers <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/">reported</a> on Friday that a Motorola executive also demonstrated a prototype remote charging system that appears to deliver power over the air. No word on when its tech will hit consumer devices either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://traderepublic.com">Trade Republic</a> is rolling out its app and service in France this week. This is a significant expansion move as Trade Republic has only been available in Germany and Austria so far.</p>
<p>Trade Republic lets you buy and sell shares or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from your phone with low, transparent fees. The company charges €1 ($1.21) in fees per order, whether you’re buying a single share worth €100 or allocating €10,000 of your savings on an ETF. The company promises that it doesn’t add any commission on top of that €1.</p>
<p>The startup lets you buy European shares as well as stock in Asian or American companies. Overall, there are 7,500 shares and ETFs available in the app. While the service is relatively new, Trade Republic has been working on its infrastructure for several years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, the company has partnered with <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a>, a German banking-as-a-service platform regulated by German authorities. It means that your deposits are covered up to €100,000 ($121,000) in case of bankruptcy. When you’re submitting an order, Trade Republic works with LS Exchange and HSBC Transaction Services to handle those shares.</p>
<p>Trade Republic wants to position itself differently from Robinhood. The company thinks there are currently two options when it comes to trading.</p>
<p>You can open a trading account with your bank or a legacy broker, but they’ll charge a lot of money. Or you can use a mobile-first broker, but they’ll push you toward risky assets and day-trading. And we’ve seen this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">with the GameStop saga</a> that the second option can lead to some backlash.</p>
<p>Trade Republic is promoting a third way — low fees and low risk. The company wants to promote savings plans for instance. Those plans let you buy shares progressively, which should protect users against volatility.</p>
<p>The company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/">€62 million funding round</a> ($75.22 million at today’s rate) last year. The Series B round was co-led by Accel and Founders Fund.</p>
<p>As for French users, don’t forget that you have to declare that you have a <a href="https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/international-particulier/questions/comment-declarer-mes-comptes-et-mes-contrats-dassurance-vie">foreign bank account</a> when you file your taxes. Foreign brokers also don’t necessarily send information to tax authorities to pre-fill your tax reports. But if you’re fine with that, Trade Republic is most likely cheaper than your bank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The impact of United States government sanctions on Huawei is continuing to hurt the company and dampen overall smartphone shipments in China, where it is the largest smartphone vendor, according to a <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-declines-11-in-2020">new report by Canalys</a>. But Huawei’s decline also opens new opportunities for its main rivals, including Apple.</p>
<p>Canalys says Apple’s performance in China during the fourth-quarter of 2020 was its best in years, thanks to the iPhone 11 and 12. Its full-year shipments returned to its 2018 levels, and it reached its highest quarterly shipments in China since the end of 2015, when the iPhone 6s was launched.</p>
<p>Overall, smartphone shipments in China fell 11% to about 330 million units in 2020, with market recovery hindered by Huawei’s inability to ship new units. Even though demand in China for Huawei devices remains high, the company has struggled to cope with sanctions imposed by the U.S. government under the Trump administration that banned it from doing business with American companies and drastically curtailed its ability to procure new chips.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In May 2020, Huawei rotating chairman Guo Ping said even though the firm can design some semiconductor components, like integrated circuits, it is &#8220;incapable of doing a lot of other things.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1O9K1VF6YY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/">Huawei admits uncertainty following new US chip curbs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei admits uncertainty following new US chip curbs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/embed/#?secret=1O9K1VF6YY" data-secret="1O9K1VF6YY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This left Huawei unable to meet demand for its devices, but gives its main rivals new opportunities, wrote Canalys vice president of mobility Nicole Peng. &#8220;Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi are fighting to win over Huawei’s offline channel partners across the country, including small rural ones, backed by huge investments in store expansion and marketing support. These commitments brought immediate results, and market share improved within mere months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple benefited from Huawei’s decline because the company’s Mate series is the iPhone’s main rival in the high-end category, and only 4 million Mate units were shipped in the fourth quarter. &#8220;However, Apple has not relaxed its market promotions for iPhone 12,” wrote Canalys research analyst Amber Liu. “Aggressive online promotions across e-commerce players, coupled with widely available trade-in plans and interest-free installments with major banks, drove Apple to its stellar performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the fourth-quarter of 2020, smartphone shipments in mainland China fell 4% year-over-year to a total of 84 million units. Even though it held onto its number one position in terms of shipments, Huawei’s total market share plummeted to 22% from 41% a year earlier, and it shipped just 18.8 million smartphones, including units from budget brand Honor, which it agreed to sell in November.</p>

<p>Huawei’s main competitors, on the other hand, all increased their shipments at the end of 2020. Oppo took second place, shipping 17.2 million smartphones, a 23% increase year-over-year. Oppo’s closest competitor Vivo increased its quarterly shipment to 15.7 million units. Apple shipped more than 15.3 million units, putting its market share at 18%, up from 15% a year ago. Xiaomi rounded out the top five vendors, shipping 12.2 million units, a 52% year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>Huawei’s decision to sell Honor means the brand may rapidly gain market share in 2021, since it already has consumer recognition, wrote Peng. 5G is also expected to help smartphone shipments in China, especially for premium models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For American importers, finding suppliers these days can be challenging not only due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The U.S. government&#8217;s entity list designations, human rights-related sanctions, among other trade blacklists targeting Chinese firms have also rattled U.S. supply chains.</p>
<p>One young company called <a href="https://www.icw.io/">International Compliance Workshop</a>, or ICW, is determined to make sourcing easier for companies around the world as it completed a fresh round of funding. The Hong Kong-based startup has just raised $5.75 million as part of its Series A round, boosting its total funding to around $10 million, co-founder and CEO Garry Lam told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>ICW works like a matchmaker for suppliers and buyers, but unlike existing options like Alibaba&#8217;s B2B platform or international trade shows, ICW also vets suppliers over compliance, product quality, and accreditation. It gathers all that information into its growing database of over 40,000 suppliers &#8212; 80% of which are currently in China &#8212; and recommends them to customers based on individual needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016, ICW&#8217;s current client base includes some of the world&#8217;s largest retailers, including Ralph Lauren, Prenatal Retail Group, Blokker, Kmart, and a major American pharmacy chain that declined to be named.</p>
<p>ICW&#8217;s latest funding round was led by Infinity Ventures Partners with participation from Integrated Capital and existing investors MindWorks Capital and the Hong Kong government&#8217;s $2 billion<a href="https://www.itf.gov.hk/l-eng/ITVF.asp"> Innovation and Technology Venture Fund</a>.</p>
<h2>Supply chain shift</h2>
<p>In line with the ongoing shift of sourcing outside China, in part due to the U.S.-China trade war and China&#8217;s growing labor costs, ICW has seen more customers diversifying their supply chains. But the transition has limitations in the short run.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still very difficult to find suppliers of certain product categories, for example, Bluetooth devices and power banks, in other countries,&#8221; observed Lam. &#8220;But for garment and textile, the transition already began to happen a decade ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, which has been replacing a great deal of Chinese manufacturing activity, each country has its slight specialization. Whereas Vietnam abounds with wooden furniture suppliers, Thailand is known for plastic goods and Malaysia is a good source for medical supplies, said Lam.</p>
<p>When it comes to trickier compliance burdens, such as human rights sanctions, ICW relies on third-party certification institutes to screen and verify suppliers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a [type of] qualification standard that verifies whether a supplier has fulfilled its corporate social responsibility&#8230; like whether the factory fulfills the labor law, the minimum labor rights, or the payroll, everything,&#8221; Lam explained.</p>
<p>ICW plans to use the fresh proceeds to further develop its products, including its compliance management system, product testing platform, and B2B sourcing site.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a taste of what we got into:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami, an emerging startup hub, has a new check-writer in town: SoftBank. The Japanese multinational conglomerate announced plans today to invest $100 million, drawn from across its funds, into Miami-based startups. Notably, SoftBank’s $5 billion Latin America fund is headquartered in Miami, as well.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by SoftBank CEO Marcelo Claure. The fund will back companies who are in Miami or plan to move there.</p>
<p>A SoftBank check is somewhat of a Silicon Valley rite-of-passage, so the firm’s involvement in the scene will likely signal to others that the growth of Miami is something to be taken seriously. The tax-free haven is attracting swathes of investors and founders from around the country looking to join the growing scene. Relocators include Keith Rabois of Founders Fund, David Blumberg of Blumberg Capital, Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz and David Sacks of Craft Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has been on a <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1335037068108554241">Twitter tear</a> asking techies to move to Miami, has spearheaded much of the efforts to turn the city into a startup epicenter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big Win for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiTech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MiamiTech</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/marceloclaure?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@marceloclaure</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SoftBank?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SoftBank</a>’s latest investment initiative: The $100M Miami Tech Fund will directly fund and support Miami-based businesses, creating Miami unicorns right here at home. <a href="https://t.co/b15skzokhN">pic.twitter.com/b15skzokhN</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mayor Francis Suarez (@FrancisSuarez) <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1354912470238961666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ruben Harris, founder of Career Karma, has been working with Suarez <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenharris/status/988430185484685313">since 2018</a> to help people break into tech.</p>
<p>“Now that Softbank has made this move, we will see more funds follow their example and this is a huge win for diversity not just from a race perspective, but also from a socioeconomic perspective, and from a gender perspective,” Harris said, who is thinking about moving to the city. Career Karma is currently working with VC funds to get old laptops into its Reskill America program, to help train an emerging workforce <a href="https://careerkarma.com/reskill-america/apply/">in Miami. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/monicasblack">Monica Black</a>, who is behind Function, a Miami-based non-profit investor syndicate, hopes that SoftBank&#8217;s entrance &#8220;will not only increase the amount of capital going to local startups and help them grow to the Series A stage and beyond, but also attract other institutional VCs as co-investors.&#8221; Historically, she said, it&#8217;s been tough for local startups to raise capital from Silicon Valley or New York funds. The exception to this was Papa, which raised $18 million in September to connect older adults with virtual companions from Sound Ventures and Canaan.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nicberardi">Nico Berardi</a>, the founder of Miami-based fund ANIMO Ventures, connected the new SoftBank initiative to the recent announcement by San Francisco’s Founders Fund to open an office in Miami.</p>
<p>“Both are symbolic and I think symbols matter,” Berardi said. “[They] are planting a flag here and saying look this is a viable scene.” Of his 16 portfolio companies, Berardi says only one startup is based in Miami. With more and more investors moving to the city, Berardi is optimistic that it can magnetize more talent to move, too.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful that this can attract tens or hundreds of founders to build their next thing in Miami,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amidst all of the the <em>sturm und drang</em> of <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">l&#8217;affaire GameStop</a>,</em> Qualtrics went public today.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/qualtrics-prices-ipo-at-30-per-share-above-its-upgraded-target-range/">pricing its stock</a> above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/qualtrics-raises-ipo-pricing-ahead-of-debut/">raised IPO range</a>, the company received a warm welcome from public investors. After starting its trading life worth $41.85, Qualtrics closed the day worth $45.50, up some 51.67%.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Qualtrics did everything that it said it was going to.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The software company&#8217;s debut comes after a lengthy path to the public markets; Qualtrics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">sold to SAP</a> on the eve of its first run at a public listing back in 2018. Now, SAP has completed spinning the company out, though the software giant remains the Utah unicorn&#8217;s largest shareholder.</p>
<p>That Qualtrics&#8217; IPO might perform well was presaged in its pricing run, having prices far above its initial valuation estimates; there was evidence of strong demand even before its shares started to trade.</p>
<p>But did Qualtrics misprice, given its strong first-day performance? TechCrunch spoke with Qualtrics CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zigserafin/">Zig Serafin</a>, and its founder and current executive chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanQualtrics">Ryan Smith</a> about its public offering, hoping to learn a bit about what is next for the company.</p>
<h2>Pricing, plans</h2>
<p>Having spoken to myriad folks on IPO days, I&#8217;ve learned the best way to kick off is to ask about emotions. Most CEOs and other execs are tied up in what they can (and cannot) say. And they are well-trained by communications experts regarding what to repeat and emphasize. You can sometimes loosen them up a little, however, by asking them how they feel.</p>
<p>In response to that question, Serafin described a feeling of gratitude and Smith brought up the long game. Qualtrics, he said, had been told that it couldn&#8217;t bootstrap, that it couldn&#8217;t build in Utah, that SAP had overpaid, that SAP had messed up and so forth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After enduring a day&#8217;s worth of taking a beating <a href="https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1354886106001649679">across social media</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1354917642507866114">government</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1354814429511131138">various app stores</a> of the mobile world, Robinhood <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility">took to its own blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vladtenev/status/1354900958942175233">CEO&#8217;s Twitter account</a> to explain why it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">halted trading</a> of some stocks earlier today.</p>
<p>That Robinhood had restricted trading in a number of securities was bombshell news after the consumer trading platform had become synonymous with not only a rise in retail investing, but also a risky wager by some individual investors to push shares of heavily-shorted companies, including GameStop, AMC and others higher. Speculation that Robinhood was limiting the trading ability of those users at the behest of, pick your poison, Citadel, the US government, hedge funds, Janet Yellen, or others, ran rampant.</p>
<p>But none of it was true – at least according to Robinhood&#8217;s telling. In its post, Robinhood wrote that (emphasis TechCrunch):</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1611870043839_198" class="">[a]mid this week’s extraordinary circumstances in the market, we made a tough decision today to temporarily limit buying for certain securities. <strong>As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.</strong> These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That reads like Robinhood ran low on capital and had to make some hard decisions, quickly. The securities its users wanted to trade likely generated the highest capital obligations given how volatile they proved and how long it takes for trades to settle, so Robinhood had to shut off some trades to stay on the right side of its capital needs. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg5HOnq7zD0">Not great, not terrible?</a>)</p>
<p>Reporting <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=gni836kR">from Bloomberg indicates</a> that Robinhood &#8220;tapped at least several hundred million dollars&#8221; from credit lines today makes sense in this context. As does the unicorn&#8217;s decision to allow for some trading of the afore-limited securities in the near future (&#8220;starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities,&#8221; the company wrote); now reloaded with more capital, Robinhood can afford to let its users get back, somewhat, to business.</p>
<p>Of course Robinhood could have been more clear about all of this earlier in the day. Instead, unfairly or not, it became the face of theoretical corruption and other nefarious forces. (Here&#8217;s a tip, if your theory sounds like it could fit inside the Qanon orbit, try again?)</p>
<p>Nothing is settled. Congress has its hackles up. Other trading platforms had to suspend trading in GameStop and other stocks for a spell as well. Social media is pissed. Some Robinhood users were forced to liquidate positions. And somehow GameStop closed the day worth more than $196 per share. And after-hours it is up $72.40, or 37.40% to $266 per share.</p>
<p>Who knows what comes next. But grains of salt, please, as we continue this bizarre adventure.</p>

<p>Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), chairwoman of the House Committee on Financial Services, announced plans for an investigation into the situation, pointing to a history of &#8220;predatory conduct&#8221; from hedge funds.</p>
<p>Waters didn&#8217;t call out Robinhood or any other trading services by name, but did note that a future hearing would focus on the systemic financial impact of short selling, &#8220;gamification&#8221; and online trading platforms. The hearing date is not yet set.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Addressing that predatory and manipulative conduct is the responsibility of lawmakers and securities regulators who are charged with protecting investors and ensuring that our capital markets are fair, orderly, and efficient,&#8221; Waters said.</p>

<p>In the Senate, incoming Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1354881250922819585">announced his own plans for a hearing on the &#8220;current state of the stock market&#8221;</a> in light of recent events. &#8220;People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they&#8217;re the ones getting hurt,&#8221; Brown said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Reps. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-robinhood-aoc-ted-cruz-tlaib-khanna-robinhood/">all condemned the startup Robinhood</a> for halting some trades in the midst of the Reddit retail investor-led volatility. Morgan Stanley-owned E-Trade followed suit.</p>
<p>Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz echoed Democrats&#8217; concerns over Robinhood&#8217;s actions, signaling that even in the midst of pandemic relief negotiations and an impeachment trial that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle still have an appetite for dragging tech in for questioning.</p>
<p>And apparently it&#8217;s not just Congress. New York Attorney General Letitia James also issued a short statement Thursday noting that her office is &#8220;aware of concerns raised regarding activity on the Robinhood app&#8221; and would be reviewing the situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An early Snapchat employee who once architected the &#8220;Our Stories&#8221; product, Chloë Drimal, has now launched her own social app, <a href="https://www.yonicircle.com/">Yoni Circle</a>. Described as a membership-based community, the app aims to connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womxn">womxn </a>using storytelling &#8212; including through both live video chat sessions as well as with pre-recorded stories that are available at any time.</p>
<p>The company has been quietly operating in beta since April 2020, but is now making its public launch.</p>
<p>Drimal came up with the idea for a social storytelling app, in part, because she saw the potential when working on the Snapchat &#8220;Our Stories&#8221; product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2105726" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105726" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2105726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?w=500" alt="" width="351" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chloë-Drimal-Headshot.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105726" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yoni Circle; founder Chloë Drimal</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I got to see that storytelling connects us,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;I got to peer into global experiences like New Year&#8217;s Eve or witnessing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and I just saw firsthand how connected we are as people,&#8221; Drimal continues. &#8220;I got to see how that was affecting our Snapchat users and making them feel more connected to the world because of this art of storytelling,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>But another inspiration came from Drimal&#8217;s personal experience in being taken off the &#8220;Our Stories&#8221; product to work on other projects at Snap &#8212; a difficult time in her career that started to make her feel very alone. She later ended up having conversations with other women &#8212; often older women who shared their own experiences &#8212; who helped her realized that she wasn&#8217;t as alone as she first thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their stories empowered me to write my next chapter, and know that this wasn&#8217;t the end of my career as I dramatically thought as a twenty-five or twenty-four year-old. It really was just the beginning and it helped me see the healing of storytelling &#8212; but also the importance of what strangers being vulnerable can do,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>After leaving Snap, where she had later run women&#8217;s initiatives, Drimal began hosting an in-person community focused around more structured storytelling circles. The community evolved to become what&#8217;s now the Yoni Circle app, whose beta version was built with help from former Snap engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akivab/">Akiva Bamberger</a>, now a Yoni Circle advisor.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105723" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105723" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2105723" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home-Screen.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105723" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yoni Circle</p></div></p>
<p>Today, the app has two main features: the interactive Storytelling Circles component and the more passive Yoni Radio.</p>
<p>The former allows members to join 60-minute moderated live video chat sessions with up to six womxn who connect with one another by listening to each others&#8217; stories. During the Circle, a trained &#8220;Salonniere&#8221; guide will first lead the group through introductions, a breathing exercise, and will then introduce a storytelling prompt based on a specific theme, like &#8220;Stories on Gratitude,&#8221; or &#8220;Stories on Surprise,&#8221; for example.</p>
<p>The Salonnieres are not volunteers, but rather paid contractors who have undergone specific training to lead these sorts of sessions. Over time, they&#8217;ll also be able to gather members to paid web-based events, which could be things like yoga classes, book clubs, cooking classes and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105721" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105721" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2105721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Circles-Available.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yoni Circle</p></div></p>
<p>The Circle sessions have a basic rule: take the stories with you, and leave the names behind. In other words, what&#8217;s shared in circles is meant to remain confidential, unless the member chooses to share it publicly. Anyone violating that rule will be banned.</p>
<p>Members are also advised to speak simply, leave their egos at the door, and respect differences. No one receives the topic beforehand, either, so members can&#8217;t rehearse their speeches and put on a &#8220;performance.&#8221; The act of participating is meant to be about authenticity and vulnerability.</p>
<p>During the session, each participant takes their turn to share their own story and will listen to the others&#8217; in return. Users only speak when they have the &#8220;talking piece,&#8221; and they can react to another story with snaps, or by clicking a snap icon.</p>
<p>While the sessions may uplift members the way that group therapy does, they&#8217;re not really focused on addressing psychological issues. Instead, Drimal says members compare them to &#8220;a slumber party combined with a mindfulness class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, she says, members feel like participating is an act of self-care.</p>
<p>&#8220;You just feel lighter,&#8221; Drimal explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard not to listen to other stories, to see yourself and just be reminded that you aren&#8217;t alone in the highs and lows of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105725" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105725" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2105725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Profile-_-Personal-Yoni-Radio.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yoni Circle</p></div></p>
<p>Members can also opt to record their own stories and then set them as either public or private on their Yoni Circle profile. The team then curates the public stories to share as highlights on the app&#8217;s homepage, allowing users to listen at any time. This also powers the Yoni Radio feature.</p>
<p>Recently, the company had been testing a weekly broadcast of these recorded stories, but will soon trial a new &#8220;story of the day&#8221; feature instead.</p>
<p>The Yoni Circle app first launched into beta last April, just as the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. had begun. That led to people isolating themselves at home away from friends, extended family, and other social interactions &#8212; driving demand for new social experiences.</p>
<p>But Yoni Circle doesn&#8217;t quite fit into the new live, interactive mobile market that&#8217;s developed as of late, led by apps like <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clubhouse-voice">Clubhouse</a> and Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to think we&#8217;ve carved out something different,&#8221; says Drimal. &#8220;It is intimate because we&#8217;re creating a safe space to be vulnerable&#8230;the things that I share in any circle I would never share on Clubhouse,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s also why we&#8217;ve been so focused on the way we grow our community. Yes, we&#8217;re looking to have millions of members, but we need to get there carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Yoni Circle is open to people who identify as womxn, and it involves an application process where you have to share who you are and what you&#8217;re looking to gain from the experience. Longer-term, the goal is to evolve the platform into a safe space that&#8217;s open to all.</p>
<p>Though the pandemic helped generate initial interest in the app  &#8212; it now has members from 1,000 cities across 80 countries &#8212; the startup sees a future in the post-pandemic market with in-person events that further connect its members.</p>
<p>Yoni Circle today is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/th/app/yoni-circle/id1499411785?ign-mpt=uo%3D2">available on iOS</a> for free. It will later monetize through an Audible-like credits model which provides access to the Circle sessions.</p>
<p>The L.A. and New York-based team of seven is backed by $1.3 million in pre-seed funding, led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boxgroup">BoxGroup</a>. Investors include <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cassius-family">Cassius Family</a>, <a href="https://www.advancitcapital.com/">Advancit</a>, and angels including Rent the Runway co-founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jenny-fleiss">Jenny Fleiss</a>, Mirror founder and CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brynn-jinnett-putnam">Brynn Putnam</a>, Beme CTO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-hackett-2">Matt Hackett</a>, early Snap engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danoz73/">Daniel Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Yoni Circle plans to raise a seed round in a few weeks.</p>

<p>We’re just beginning to understand the extent of their infiltration, but this story brings to light what the cybersecurity industry has already known: Solving the cybersecurity problem will take more time and resources than we are currently allocating.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Solving the cybersecurity problem will take more time and resources than we are currently allocating.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Adding to the challenge, COVID-19 has created fertile ground for the acceleration of cyberattacks that are more sophisticated, dangerous and prevalent. In this dire setting, cybersecurity has become even more competitive and a national security imperative and created higher demand for new solutions.</p>
<p>This is something we all — enterprises, startups, government and investors — need to work together to solve. So, from the venture capital perspective, where are cybersecurity investments being made, and where is the talent coming from to help stem the onslaught of hacks?</p>
<p>California’s Silicon Valley has traditionally been the epicenter of cybersecurity innovation. It’s home to some of the largest cybersecurity companies including McAfee, Palo Alto Networks and FireEye, as well as more recent high flyers such as CrowdStrike and Okta, providing a robust talent base for many willing venture investors.</p>
<p>However, that’s rapidly changing. Cybersecurity expertise is now budding in new regions where there is talent and a hands-on recognition of the need for innovative solutions. In particular we are seeing growth in areas such as the East Coast of the U.S. and in Europe, led by the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Investment in Silicon Valley cybersecurity startups remained flat in 2020 as we are seeing record venture funding of cybersecurity companies in these emerging regions. And the reasons why may mean better solutions to solve current and future cyber needs.</p>
<h2>The emergence of a new cybersecurity ecosystem</h2>
<p>A new generation of cyber-experienced practitioners coming from government and financial services are becoming the next generation of entrepreneurs. Fueling new innovation, this newest breed of cybersecurity startups in emerging in cities like New York, Washington, D.C. and London, and away from Silicon Valley. East Coast businesses like <a href="https://www.ironnet.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ironnet.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611799919469000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH263cl9DZYsUMfk5a-5P2ct2SR5w">IronNet</a>*, founded by former NSA director General Keith Alexander, is one example of this growing trend of new leaders coming from federal government backgrounds.</p>
<p>These new cybersecurity leaders with front-line experience are developing solutions that fix the problems they faced as customers and, thanks to COVID-19, are hiring the best talent to join them regardless of their location. The pandemic has accelerated remote-working trends, increasing more flexible-location working opportunities in the cybersecurity industry. These companies are creating advantages over their West Coast counterparts in the ability to recruit better talent, lower costs and have closer proximity to customers and prospects.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few tech sectors had more to gain from the events of 2020 than home fitness. Interest in the category was swift, as gyms were declared one of the bigger problem areas amid the worldwide spread of COVID-19. Suddenly home workouts were more than just luxury.</p>
<p>For YC-backed <a href="https://avironactive.com/">Aviron</a>, it was the ideal time to pivot. The Toronto-based startup had been providing gamified rowing machines for the B2B market — specifically for use in high-traffic settings like hotels and apartment buildings. It’s still a small operation with 10 employees and around $750,000 raised to date.</p>
<p>Suddenly the company found itself attempting to compete for market share against tech giants like Peloton.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, thus far Aviron’s own sales are considerably more humble than the cycling giant&#8217;s. Until now, the company has largely relied on word of mouth sales, having sold in the neighborhood of 1,000 rowing machines since launching for the consumer market in July. The equipment retails for $2,299 a piece — though you can find it online for less.</p>
<p>Aviron works with an ODM to create the machine. While it touts some nice touches like a quiet nylon belt and 100 pounds of automatic electronic resistance, Aivron’s main differentiator is the software — especially a connected gaming experience via the built-in display. The monthly subscription runs $20-$30 and the company is quick to note that you can cancel at any time.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ke_RXQz7Ak?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“Rowing engages 85% of your muscles,” founder and CEO Andy Hoang tells TechCrunch. “It’s low impact. There are a ton of benefits, but it’s super boring and super tough. When you combine it with high-intensity training, you have a death machine that pretty much no one’s gonna want to do. What better way to make it fun and exciting than by putting video games on there?”</p>
<p>The system sports six different workout categories, including real-time competition with other rowers. There are a few introductory workouts, to ensure that first-timers don’t injure themselves by just jumping directly into competitive rowing, but on the whole, the system avoids Peloton-style classes.</p>
<p>“Our workouts are short,” says Hoang. “They’re like 10-15 minutes. You do maybe one or two of them, and by the end of it, you feel like you&#8217;re going to die because it’s so tough. Peloton is typically 40-60 minutes, a little bit lower intensity and with less resistance. And obviously it’s a class led by an instructor, rather than getting chased by zombies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three of the popular retail stock market trading apps that have hosted much of the activity related to the Wall Street Bets subreddit-spurred run on stocks including GameStop (GME) and AMC, among others, have removed all restrictions on their exchange by their users. M1, Webull and Public had restricted transactions for the affected stocks earlier in the day, along with Robinhood.</p>
<p>M1, Webull and Public all attributed the restrictions placed on these volatile stocks not to any effort to curb their purchase or sale, but instead cited the costs associated with settling the trades on the part of their clearing firm, Apex. All three platforms employ Apex to clear trades made by users via their platform.</p>
<p>In an interview with Webull CEO Anthony Denier, Yahoo Finance confirmed that the restriction was not something the company had any hand in deciding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: The CEO of Webull tell us the decision to join Robinhood in restricting AMC and GameStop trades came from soaring costs to settle its users trades:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Public confirmed via Twitter that users can now buy and sell $GME and $AMC and $KOSS on the platform, thanks to the resolution of the Apex blocker. Meanwhile Webull noted that all three stocks are now also available for exchange via their app, as <a href="https://twitter.com/M1_Finance/status/1354881668843188226?s=20">did M1 shortly after</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Other platforms like SoFi so far haven&#8217;t restricted the stocks, <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/status/1354879252303286273">CEO Anthony Noto confirmed on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Robinhood earlier <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility">issued a blog post</a> noting that it is restricting a number of stocks tied to the r/WallStreetBets action to counter short-seller hedge funds, arguing that it&#8217;s doing so in the best interest of users. This has not seemed to have been much appreciated by most users, based on the reaction on social media to that action thus far. Robinhood at no time references any technical barriers imposed by any clearing house.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">2021 is going to be another glorious year for e-commerce.</p>
<p>It is that time of the year when most of us are looking back at the &#8220;total addressable market&#8221; estimates to plan for specific campaigns. Unlike us, if you had your 2021 kick off in Q3, bless your soul. You are an enlightened being.</p>
<p>For the rest of you, for whom e-commerce is a strategic market, I have a question — have you built your total addressable market (TAM) and serviceable addressable market (SAM) estimates for 2021 considering how things evolved in 2020?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It&#8217;s important to understand the underlying business model dynamics of companies and visualize TAM from those perspectives.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For most of us, research is a mind-numbing, repetitive exercise of clicking through links on Google until they all turn purple — at which point we start seeking the simplest possible explanation. For e-commerce, addressable market estimates come in the form of headlines from platforms like Shopify. The company quotes a merchant count number in its earnings calls and that becomes the basis for guesstimating the current TAM of e-commerce companies.</p>
<p>The other, rather simplistic approach is to look at the user-base count from several databases that publish tech platform-level user stats.</p>
<p>In reality, the simplest answer is not the right answer.</p>
<h2>Mind the gap</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take e-commerce shopping cart installations. Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, BigCommerce and others publish installation numbers that run into millions.</p>
<p>Here is the dichotomy that should frame your TAM discussions.</p>
<p>E-commerce is long-tail heavy. Yes, there are millions of merchants, but e-commerce revenue is a fat-tail phenomenon — meaning, a disproportionate amount of e-commerce revenue comes from a few tens of thousands of companies.</p>
<p>PipeCandy publishes bottom-up <a href="https://pipecandy.com/RESEARCHer/">TAM estimates </a> with detailed data cuts by technology, logistics and payment system adoptions by firms across revenue tiers across all major markets. One of the common misconceptions we see in how firms misinterpret TAM estimates is that they equate revenue to spend potential.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
