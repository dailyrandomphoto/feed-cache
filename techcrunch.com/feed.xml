										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magic Leap has had one hell of a journey, and to their credit, it seems investors are still addicted to giving them money.</p>
<p>The augmented reality startup announced today that they have raised $500 million at a $2 billion valuation from existing investors. The round echoes the terms of an October 2014 raise where Magic Leap raised $542 million at a reported $2 billion valuation. Quite a bit has happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>Curiously, Magic Leap decided not to actually disclose any of the specific investors participating in this latest fundraise. At this point, the company has raised $3.5 billion in total funding according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, meaning that most of the investors they&#8217;ve brought in haven&#8217;t fared too well thus far.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest valuation is a far cry from the company&#8217;s $6.7 billion valuation they reached in 2019, but for a startup that nearly shut down last year, it could be a lot worse. Magic Leap fired a healthy chunk of its staff and was forced to raise hundreds of millions at slashed valuation terms last year. The startup also replaced its founder Rony Abovitz with former Microsoft VP Peggy Johnson as CEO.</p>
<p>The company has been trying to turn things around by revamping its messaging with a focus wholly on enterprise audiences after years of trying to compete with Microsoft for military contracts (and failing) and trying to compete with Microsoft for enterprise clients (with some success), all while attempting to also stay on consumer radars by bankrolling expensive games for their very expensive headset.</p>
<p>Alongside news of this new round, we also got a new rendering, via CNBC, of the startup&#8217;s next AR glasses product. The device seems to have gotten a much smaller device footprint, but Magic Leap didn&#8217;t have too much to say on the device&#8217;s new capabilities. In a press release, Magic Leap says that it will roll out the new hardware, called the Magic Leap 2, sometime next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has started shipping replacement battery modules for recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles to dealers, after delays due to shutdowns at multiple manufacturing plants as a result of the widespread shortage of semiconductors.</p>
<p>The two battery assembly facilities in Holland and Hazel Park, Michigan, resumed production at the end of September. At that time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">GM said</a> that replacement battery modules would be shipped to dealers as soon as mid-October.</p>
<p>Vehicles will be prioritized according to “specific build timeframes,” or the batches of vehicles it believes defects appear to be clustered, GM said. The replacement process should take around two days at a dealership, and the new batteries will come with an 8-year or 100,000-mile limited warranty. GM is also launching new diagnostic software by mid-November to monitor EV batteries, which will also be installed at a dealership.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The recall was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects, a torn anode tab and folded separator, that together can increase the risk of fire. It’s the third time GM has issued a recall for the vehicle, and the most comprehensive, spanning all Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017.</p>
<p>The news will surely be welcome to Bolt drivers, who were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</a> to park their vehicles away from their homes in the case of fire risk. GM also advised Bolt owners to not park within fifty feet of other vehicles, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/gm-tells-some-bolt-owners-to-park-50-feet-away-from-other-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>In all, GM is anticipated to spend around $1.8 billion on costs associated with fixing defective Bolt batteries. The automaker said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/gm-says-it-will-seek-reimbursement-from-lg-chem-for-1b-chevy-bolt-recall-losses/">seek reimbursement</a> from its battery partner, LG Chem, for the tune of around $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Africa’s telecommunication provider Telkom SA SOC Ltd has since October discontinued Netflix Inc. from its phone and internet set-top box, said a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-11/telkom-says-netflix-no-longer-available-on-south-africa-provider?sref=gni836kR">report</a>.</p>
<p>Telkom&#8217;s Content Executive Wanda Mkhize said in a statement that the partnership between the two firms would not be renewed and declined to provide further details, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>We have reached out to both companies and will update this post as we learn more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216240" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Netflix has been exploring growth opportunities across Africa over the last few years in the hope of growing its subscriber base and revenues. It’s not clear whether it has plans to build a different route to consumers and existing subscribers in South Africa now that its relationship with Telkom has ended.</p>
<p>Last month, the company announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/netflix-free-plan-kenya/">free plan</a>, available on Android mobile phones, in Kenya to attract new subscribers – who have access to “about one-quarter of its TV shows and movies”TELE.</p>
<p>Netflix, in a bid to win and retain subscribers across Africa, now features content produced in various markets across the continent including South Africa’s Queen Sono, Kenya’s Sincerely Daisy and Nigeria’s 2 weeks in Lagos.</p>
<p>The video streaming service is looking to tap 303 million people, about 28% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa, connected to mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>. The number of people connected to mobile internet is expected to grow to about 40% of this population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Netflix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cheaper and faster internet across the continent has provided a space for video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon.inc to gain a foothold across the continent.</p>
<p>Netflix still has another partner in the country. MultiChoice Group Limited, the continent’s largest pay-TV provider, now offers Netflix and Amazon.Inc as part of its paid video services in South Africa after signing deals with the two firms mid last year. The move aims at retaining MultiChoice’s subscriber numbers, creating more of a moat around its own budget streaming service, Showmax, introduced in 2015.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has pulled several &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; ads that violated its policies by promoting apps that encouraged prospective users to spy on their spouses&#8217; phone.</p>
<p>These consumer-grade spyware apps are often marketed to parents wishing to monitor their child&#8217;s calls, messages, apps, photos and location, often under the guise of protecting against predators. But these apps, which are often designed to be installed surreptitiously and without the device owner&#8217;s consent, have been repurposed by abusers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">spy on the phones of their spouses</a>.</p>
<p>The rise in the use of so-called &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; (or spouseware) prompted an industrywide response in recent years to combat the spread of phone monitoring apps. Antivirus makers have worked to better <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/coalition-against-stalkerware-expands-membership">detect stalkerware</a>, and federal authorities are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">taking action</a> against spyware makers that further expose their victims to security threats. Last August, Google banned ads in users&#8217; search results that promoted apps that are designed &#8220;with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216253" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But TechCrunch found five app makers were still advertising their stalkerware apps as recently as last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not allow ads promoting spyware for partner surveillance. We immediately removed the ads that violated this policy and will continue to track emerging behaviors to prevent bad actors from trying to evade our detection systems,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--callout block--right" >

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">FTC bans spyware maker SpyFone, and orders it to notify hacked victims</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">A ‘stalkerware’ app leaked phone data from thousands of victims</a></li>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Google said its <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6016086">policy on enabling dishonest behavior</a>, which governs the promotion of spyware, bans ads from promoting intimate partner surveillance, but does not extend to ads that promote tracking a child&#8217;s activity or workplaces monitoring their employees&#8217; devices, the spokesperson confirmed. The policy also exempts private investigation services, though Google would not say if or how it determines for what purpose an app is used.</p>
<p>Vocal supporters of Google&#8217;s efforts against stalkerware have expressed concerns with the policy&#8217;s enforcement. Malwarebytes, a founding member of the <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>, a group of companies committed to combating the growing threat of stalkerware, said last year that <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware/2020/07/stalkerware-advertising-ban-by-google-a-welcome-if-incomplete-step/">the policy was &#8220;incomplete&#8221;</a> since it allowed stalkerware makers to &#8220;skirt the rules by changing the face of what they’re selling, without changing the core technology within.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesperson for Google declined to provide specifics of how Google&#8217;s enforcement works, but said it looks at a combination of factors to determine if an ad violates its policies, such as looking at the text and images of the ad, how the product is promoted and the landing pages of the ads when clicked.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that several stalkerware apps used a variety of techniques to successfully evade Google&#8217;s ban on advertising apps for partner surveillance and were able to get Google ads approved.</p>
<p>In one case, mSpy, a spyware app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/mobile-spyware-maker-leaks-2-million-records/">had a major security lapse in 2018</a>, ran Google ads that linked to an interstitial web page on an entirely separate domain from mSpy&#8217;s website, which tripped up Google from detecting that the app was also being marketed to spy on &#8220;your kids, husband or wife, grandma or grandpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another stalkerware maker, ClevGuard, which in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">spilled the phone data on thousands of victims</a>, ran Google ads that linked to a page on its website that said the app could be used on a spouse to &#8220;dispel any doubts in a relationship.&#8221; The page was hidden from Google&#8217;s search index using a &#8220;robots&#8221; file that tells search engines what should and shouldn&#8217;t appear in search results. TechCrunch found two other stalkerware apps using this same technique to run ads, which Google said also violated its policies.</p>
<p>Other violating ads were more overt. PhoneSpector, a spyware maker based on Long Island, NY, ran ads that promoted the app as a way to &#8220;catch a cheater.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of September, Google said it <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10957124">will suspend</a> the accounts of advertisers for three months who repeatedly violate its ad policies, including for promoting spyware for targeting spouses.</p>
<p>None of the stalkerware companies responded to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The potential for telehealth across Africa is vast and promising as mobile connectivity  deepens, and innovations that could potentially bridge the doctor-patient ratio gap increase according to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-nl-mhealth.pdf">Deloitte report</a>.</p>
<p>One company that is planning to drive the wave of telemedicine across the continent, as the Covid-19 pandemic rages on, is <a href="https://mpharma.com/">mPharma</a>, a Ghanaian health tech start-up that is set to open 100 virtual centers across seven markets in Africa over the next six months.</p>
<p>As it rolls out these centers, mPharma said its end goal is to deliver quality primary care in communities they serve by providing medical examinations, a service, the startup co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson, said lacks in most telemedicine structures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We saw this as an opportunity to leverage our pharmacies as virtual doctor offices so that patients could get examined remotely during a virtual consultation. This is what makes mPharma&#8217;s telemedicine unique,” Rockson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said that mPharma already provides about 10,000 physician consultations to patients at the startup’s network of pharmacies, and that the new system will enable them to do it electronically too, reaching more people.</p>
<p>mPharma, originally founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">to manage</a> prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, also runs retail pharmacy operations and provides market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh">Rockson</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il"> Daniel Shoukimas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/">James Finucane</a>, mPharma is one of the well-funded startups across Africa raising over $50 million since inception, this includes <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/">a Series C round</a> of $17 million, led by UK&#8217;s development arm CDC Group, it received last year. Other <a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/mpharma-raises-6-6-million-in-series-a-funding-463dafda6e0b">existing investors</a> include Silicon Valley backer Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, Shravin Bharti Mittal of Bharti Global Limited-an Indian Conglomerate, Social Capital and Golden Palm Investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>mPharma also enjoys expertise backing from well experienced professions in the pharmaceutical industry. They include  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S. and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and Chairman of Novartis are members of the board.</p>
<p>The tech startup plans to use its network of pharmacies to build what they describe as a digital primary care service. It will <a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/telemedicine-2-0-mpharmas-vision-to-transform-primary-care-in-africa-576fad3152cb">offer</a> all-in-one diagnostics services using digital “stethoscope, otoscope, thermometer, and examination camera with built-in illumination for high-definition skin and throat images powered by Tytocare”, a telehealth service.</p>
<p>The doctor will also be in a place to request for rapid diagnostics tests to be carried out, a service that will be supported by a licensed community health nurse as the medic consults remotely.</p>
<p>Patients in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, where mPharma has a presence, are set to benefit from the virtual consultations. It is raising more funding to further grow its business across the continent.</p>
<p>“We currently have five centers open.  We have done an assessment of all our pharmacies and plan to establish the Mutti Doctor locations (the virtual centers) based on the needs of the community. We have already identified the first 100 locations,” said Rockson.</p>
<p>The tech startup’s efforts will add to services of tens of other startups across Africa offering variations of telemedicine like Vezeeta, an Egyptian doctor appointment booking startup. Vezeeta fast-tracked the rollout of home-visit solutions, teleconsultation, online pharmacies across Egypt and Saudia Arabia last year, after landing $40 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p>Quro Medical, a South Africa start-up, also offers home care complimented by telemedicine service, a step it had to take following the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the exposure of Covid virus on patients and the doctors. The health start-up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/south-africas-quro-medical-comes-out-of-stealth-with-1-1m-to-expand-its-hospital-at-home-service/">received $1.1 million</a> in April this year to help the company increase its reach and improve care among its patients.</p>
<p>Rocket Health, with a presence in Uganda and Kenya, also offers consultation, pharmacy, lab services electronically and through a USSD service, making these services accessible to people without internet connection too.</p>
<p>As the pandemic rages on, the industry is expected to continue growing especially in emerging markets with poor health infrastructure and where doctor to patient ratio remain grim, when compared to the richer nations.</p>
<p>According to World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)">data</a>, countries across sub-Saharan Africa have an average of 0.23 doctors for every 10,000 people. This is against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in some of the most developed countries.</p>
<p>Telemedicine is envisaged to bridge this gap and inspire partnerships and birth more startups like Bima, that provide other range of services including health insurance policies. The Europe-based startup which offers services in emerging markets recently received $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>The African pharmaceutical market is also expected to grow exponentially as the population balloons, thus providing a space for innovation and a market for startups offering mobile health solutions</p>
<p>Across Africa, the Deloitte report says, East Africa is the most promising region in terms of healthcare investment owing to its integration and the growing economy, supported by various sectors including agriculture and tourism. Increased demand for services and products as consumers gets more spending power will also increase in healthcare and telecom spend, it said.</p>
<p>As more startups are launched, a market intelligence report by Salient on innovations in healthcare across sub-Saharan Africa, said that they will need to come up with ways to retain customers as competition grows and also come up with methods to partner. The partnerships could be with e-commerce companies for the faster distribution of products, to develop ordering, payment and fulfillment digital systems.</p>
<p>“If mHealth’s opportunity is to be fully exploited, stakeholders will need to proactively seek strategic partnerships, public-private or otherwise, and build cooperative and sustainable business models,” the Deloitte report said.</p>
<p>Deloitte remains upbeat that the industry will take off and recommended that startups such as mPharma use data for better public health supply chain planning and visibility, forge partnerships and to inform company growth.</p>
<p>Rockson hopes that other telemedicine services can utilize the infrastructure his startup has setup to improve the services they offer to patients.</p>
<p>“We are not looking to compete directly with existing telemedicine providers but rather enable them to plug their service into our remote medical examination solution to close the gap they currently face when providing a teleconsult.”</p>
<p>mPharma, which employs 400 people, says it is set to create an additional 340 opportunities over the next six month by employing a wide-range of specialists including engineers and clinicians.</p>
<p>It recently entered the ninth market after it was contracted to build a drug supply chain infrastructure by the Gabonese government. This comes months after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">entered the Ethiopian market</a> with plans to franchise its brand and focus more on building and refining its infrastructure for a seamless sourcing and distribution system. This in the hope of solving the challenges facing the pharmaceutical market across Africa including unpredictable supply chains, exorbitant prices and low orders.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It was Branson versus Bezos, rocket against rocket, in the race to send the first billionaire into space.</p>
<p>Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">announced</a> on June 7 that Jeff Bezos, its founder, would fly on the firm’s first crewed mission scheduled for July 20. That same day, <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/06/07/virgin-galactics-richard-branson-aims-to-fly-to-space-before-jeff-bezos/">Parabolic Arc</a> reported that Virgin Galactic was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/">planning</a> to send Richard Branson on a suborbital flight on July 11. And both aimed to beat the third space-going billionaire, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>More than half a century after Apollo 11 landed on the moon, space exploration is clearly on the upswing again. However, today’s missions reflect far more than the ambitions of billionaires, even if Musk, Bezos and Branson have generated the most headlines for their personal space plans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, we’re seeing the emergence of a true space economy. This new sector is in its exponential growth phase, and what unifies current commercial projects is the influx of investments in new technologies and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today’s explorers have plans for expansion that range from the outer limits of our imagination — travel to other planets or colonizing Mars — to the launches of thousands of telecommunication, global navigation and Earth observation satellites, with massive investments being made.</p>
<p>The size of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/2018_ast_compendium.pdf">global space economy</a> &#8212; which combines satellite services and ground equipment, government space budgets and global navigation satellites equipment &#8212; is estimated to be about $345 billion. Startup space ventures <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Start_Up_Space_2020.pdf">brought in $5.7 billion</a> in 2019, easily besting 2018’s $3.5 billion record. By 2040, Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space">more than $1 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re at the start of a gold rush in outer space — and our track record for the sustainable development of any environment during gold rushes hasn’t been particularly noteworthy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The threat of catastrophic space collisions is growing</h2>
<p>We are at a critical tipping point for ensuring the safe and sustainable development of new business opportunities in space. Many of these activities use the same regions of the Earth’s orbit, which is not an infinite space. According to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html">NASA</a>, more than 100 million pieces of orbital debris of about 1 mm or larger are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors. Much more debris &#8212; too small to be tracked, but large enough to threaten human spaceflight and robotic missions &#8212; exists in the near-Earth space environment.</p>
<p>In an environment where both debris and spacecraft are traveling at velocities in excess of 15,700 mph in low-Earth orbit, even a 5 mm nut can shred a solar panel like it was made of paper. In fact, NASA reports that millimeter-sized orbital debris represents the highest mission-ending risk to most robotic spacecraft operating in low-Earth orbit. As space becomes more and more congested, unsafe or irresponsible actions by any one actor could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Advances in reusable rockets, which lowered the cost to launch 1 kilogram of payload mass to orbit, and the miniaturization of satellites have all helped to create this threat of a traffic jam in Earth’s orbit. Nearly <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/visualizing-easrth-satellites-sapce-spacex/">3,000 active satellites</a> are currently in orbit above our planet, and this number will likely skyrocket in the coming years. A 230% increase in satellite launches per year is expected by 2025, with 24,000 satellite launches now in planning, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/space-infrastructure-is-the-next-investment-frontier-and-spacs-are-a-launch-pad-11618294752#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20experts%20predict%20a,applied%20to%20fly%2040%2C000%20satellites.">according to MarketWatch</a>. And that figure doesn’t even include launches by SpaceX, OneWeb or Kuiper. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613591/spacexs-starlink-satellites-are-clearly-visible-in-the-skyand-astronomers-arent-happy/">SpaceX’s</a> Starlink alone has applied to fly 40,000 satellites.</p>
<p>The cost to launch 22 tons to low-Earth orbit has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/06/space-tech-transforming-satellite-launches-with-blockchain/">declined</a> from $200 million to about $60 million thanks to reusable rockets. Satellite applications that once required one massive high-performance satellite with a cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars can now be tackled with constellations of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/06/small-satellites-growth-space/#:~:text=It%20says%20it%20can%20build,able%20to%20endure%20for%20years.">cheaper</a> ($1 million), smaller, lower-performance satellites working together to provide a global service.</p>
<p>While the performance of a single smaller satellite is still inferior to that of a much larger one, the use of data from multiple satellites can often produce comparable results. Moreover, the architecture of a constellation is highly scalable, so as soon as newer generations of satellites are launched, the performance of the infrastructure as a whole increases exponentially.</p>
<h2>Sustainable development requires new technologies and better governance</h2>
<p>Sustainable economic expansion will require innovative solutions to support traditional and new customers throughout the life cycle of a space mission, from a careful analysis of a mission&#8217;s requirements to end-of-life decommissioning.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions will require completely new space-based infrastructures that can streamline launch, operation and decommissioning. D-Orbit’s ION Satellite Carrier, for example, is a space transportation vehicle designed to host a batch of satellites, transport them to orbit and release them individually into distinct orbital slots. This deployment service complements the one offered by launch providers, which targets only the most strategic orbits, enabling satellite operators to cover the last mile in a significantly shorter time and use all the resources of their spacecraft to extend the duration of the mission itself.</p>
<p>This is the first step toward the creation of permanent space logistic infrastructures that can move spacecraft from one orbit to another, extend the life of older vehicles, perform repairs and collect satellite wrecks and other debris.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding sustainable growth in the space economy are too important and consequential to be left to a single company or country.</p>
<p>To strengthen international cooperation and establish a set of ground rules, we need a new model of space governance based on consensus among countries, with common standards. While the technology for debris-capturing spacecraft is already attainable, for example, there are still legal challenges to allow an operator based in a country to approach, capture and remove a space object launched by another country. Formulating global regulation to address this kind of operation is an essential step that can open new markets and business opportunities.</p>
<p>Forty-eight organizations and other government and industry stakeholders, including D-Orbit, formed the <a href="https://spacesafety.org/">Space Safety Coalition</a> (SSC) in 2019 to actively promote best practices for the long-term sustainability of space operations. The SSC has developed guidelines for avoiding launch and on-orbit collisions, minimizing human casualties from spacecraft or debris reentry and minimizing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) events, among other best practices for the overall long-term sustainability of space operations.</p>
<p>This industry-led sustainability effort needs to be adopted by all space stakeholders. How we develop and regulate the space economy will have long-lasting repercussions, and the window for avoiding mistakes is rapidly closing.</p>
<p>It is essential that we lose no time in developing the infrastructure, best practices and governance that will broaden humankind’s ability to operate in space and create still-unimagined opportunities for us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today released its second minor update to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ios-15/">iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/apples-ipados-15-breaks-the-app-barrier/">iPadOS 15</a>, which includes an &#8220;important security update&#8221; for a zero-day bug under active exploitation.</p>
<p>iOS 15.0.2 and iPadOS 15.0.2, which are available to download on supported devices now, include a fix for a memory corruption vulnerability that allowed an application to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of device access, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846">Apple says on its security support page</a>.</p>
<p>While details on the bug remain thin, Apple warns that it &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; — so it&#8217;s probably a good idea to update your devices right away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The updates also address a number of other glitches in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, including an issue that caused the iPhone Leather Wallet and with MagSafe and not to connect to Find My, a bug that could cause AirTags not to appear in the ‌Find My‌ Items tab, and another that caused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/carplay/">CarPlay</a> to fail to open audio apps or to disconnect during playback. There&#8217;s also a fix for a glitch that saw photos saved to your library from Messages deleted after removing the associated thread or message.</p>
<p>Apple is currently testing the first major update to iOS 15.1, which will be the first major update to iOS 15. This update will re-enable SharePlay in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">FaceTime</a>, add new iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max camera features, and bring support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet. It&#8217;ll probably include a handful of bug fixes, too.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When building a startup, you’re making what feels like a million decisions on timing — when to launch to time the market, when to hire that key role, when to raise another round. But one of your most important timing decisions might be one you aren’t even considering yet: When to approach the enterprise. If you aren’t debating that now, chances are you’re overlooking a big opportunity.</p>
<p>I saw this time and again while working with dozens of startup CEOs while at Greylock Partners. Approaching the enterprise can feel daunting for early-stage teams. Many founders would push back when I suggested it, and I get why: It’s uncomfortable and maybe even counterintuitive. A commonly heard refrain was: &#8220;We&#8217;re not ready. We&#8217;re too early. We want to optimize our product more first.&#8221; They were afraid that if they talked to large enterprise companies too soon, they’d blow it.</p>
<p>In my experience, the opposite is true. At a startup, you’re constantly trying to maximize learning in the tightest loops possible. The earlier you start, the more valuable the knowledge and iterations you accrue. Your go-to-market is no different.</p>
<p>I’m here to tell you it’s possible to be both a product-centric company <em>and</em> woo the enterprise at the same time.</p>
<h2>A short history lesson</h2>
<p>Take Slack, for example. A darling of startups across the Valley and beyond, Slack grew into a can’t-live-without technology for many teams. It&#8217;s a success by nearly anyone’s standards, and yet, it is a company that didn’t survive as an independent public company. Why? Because it couldn’t quite break into the enterprise on its own timetable.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I’m here to tell you it’s possible to be both a product-centric company and woo the enterprise at the same time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Slack enjoyed hypergrowth among startups, but it got beat out by Microsoft Teams on the big deals. Microsoft used its enterprise credibility, deep distribution channels and raw muscle to block Slack from signing big companies that had to work within established protocols and existing infrastructure. Teams might not have had the same stellar user experience, but it met enterprises where they were and played by the buying rules they understood.</p>
<p>The result? Slack got acquired by Salesforce for $27.2 billion 12 years after it was founded.</p>
<p>To be clear, Slack’s acquisition — the largest in Salesforce’s history — is not a bad outcome. Lots of startups dream of such an exit, but it&#8217;s probably not the one the company was seeking given its darling status and enormous popularity. It was a catch-up move, a way to use Salesforce’s weight to get a shot at competing with Teams.</p>
<p>The question is, if Slack had considered selling into the enterprise sooner, could it have survived as an independent public company?</p>
<p>A bottoms-up approach to growth, like Slack famously championed, is fantastic, until it’s not enough. Having helped dozens of portfolio companies approach the enterprise at Greylock Partners and now as a startup CEO myself, here’s some advice on how to avoid common missteps:</p>
<h2>Start sooner than you think you should</h2>
<p>Some of the most commercially successful companies in the world today engaged with enterprise customers before they even had a product. The purpose is to gather intelligence about what a customer would want, what they’d value or how they’d evaluate their product. Startups can gain important information that may help shape their trajectory and get the product enterprise-ready much faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-and-audio-up-inc-enter-into-creative-and-strategic-agreement-to-develop-new-original-scripted-podcasts-and-audio-entertainment-concepts-301396824.html?tc=eml_cleartime">partnering with audio entertainment production studio Audio Up</a> to develop new original scripted podcasts. The two companies have entered into a creative programming and strategic agreement, under which Audio Up is expected to create new podcasts for SiriusXM and its platforms, including the SXM app, Pandora and Stitcher.</p>
<p>Audio Up, which was established in 2020, is a podcast content production studio that has created a slate of original scripted audio entertainment featuring marquee names across music, Hollywood and publishing, including Machine Gun Kelly, Garrett Hedlund and Stephen King.</p>
<p>The agreement gives SiriusXM an exclusive first-look option for new Audio Up original podcast concepts and exclusive rights to manage and sell advertising inventory in connection with any podcast produced for SiriusXM. Audio Up is expected to be an additional creative driver for SiriusXM in connecting artists, labels, brands and creators of all types in developing new audio entertainment programming across SiriusXM channels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216150" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Audio Up also announced today that it has completed a $12 million Series B funding round led by SiriusXM. Further, Andrew Moss, SiriusXM&#8217;s senior vice president of business affairs and programming operations, is joining the board of directors of Audio Up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Audio Up is known for creating podcasts that combine music, entertainment, and rich storytelling to create bold new listening experiences, and we&#8217;re thrilled to welcome them to our extended SiriusXM family,” said Scott Greenstein, the president and chief creative officer of SiriusXM, in a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-and-audio-up-inc-enter-into-creative-and-strategic-agreement-to-develop-new-original-scripted-podcasts-and-audio-entertainment-concepts-301396824.html?tc=eml_cleartime"> press release.</a></p>
<p>A variety of original podcasts from Audio Up’s back catalog will also be represented across the SXM app, Pandora and Stitcher, including Halloween in Hell, The Ballad of Uncle Drank, Bedtime Stories of the Ingleside Inn, Sonic Leap and Make It Up as We Go.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the vast reach and wide diversity of listeners that SiriusXM, Pandora and Stitcher together represent, we not only have a massive new multi-platform outlet for our original programming, but in SiriusXM we have a creative ally who shares our ambitions to keep pushing podcasting forward,” said Audio Up CEO and founder, Jared Gutstadt, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The agreement with Audio Up follows SiriusXM’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> last year. The deal meant that thousands of podcasts moved to the SiriusXM roster, after which the company said it now had the “the largest addressable audience” in the United States for digital audio, including music, sports, talk and podcasts, covering 150 million listeners. It has also tried to differentiate Pandora from competitors by offering multiple pricing tiers and unique show formats,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/pandora-expands-its-music-and-podcasts-product-pandora-stories-with-help-from-siriusxms-guests/"> like Pandora Stories</a>, aided by SiriusXM&#8217;s guests.</p>
<p>SiriusXM’s new partnership with Audio Up will further its investments in podcasting and help it continue to compete with others in the audio space, as numerous companies are also looking to expand their podcast offerings. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/spotifys-catalog-tops-a-million-podcasts-consumption-increased-by-triple-digits-over-last-year/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/shonda-rhimes-iheartmedia/">iHeartMedia</a> have made notable acquisitions to acquire original podcasting content, as well as tools for podcasters to help run their businesses. Additionally, Apple is also investing in podcasts and recently made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions live</a> across more than 170 countries and regions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Disney&#8217;s newest digital service, Disney Genie, is launching on October 19 at Walt Disney World Resort.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney&#8217;s newest digital service, Disney Genie, is <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/10/disney-genie-launching-at-walt-disney-world-resort/">launching on October 19</a> at Walt Disney World Resort. The service, first <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/">unveiled</a> in August, is an update to the company&#8217;s earlier line-reservation tools for Disney&#8217;s parks, allowing guests to plan and update their itineraries, book time slots for the most popular attractions, and optionally purchase paid access to the fast lanes&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/genie/lightning-lane/">Lightning Lane</a>&#8221; entrances, either à la carte on top attractions or through the &#8220;Genie+&#8221; add-on.</p>
<p>The service will replace Disney&#8217;s older FASTPASS, FastPass+ and Disney MaxPass services, as Disney Genie will roll out across Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, the company said.</p>
<p>At the core of the Disney Genie experience is a smart trip-planning capability that maps out a personalized itinerary based on which rides, attractions or food and entertainment experiences guests want to make sure to do while at the parks. That means Genie users can customize their day based on not only the top attractions, but also their general interests &#8212; like whether they need to incorporate Princess meet-and-greets into their day, or if they&#8217;d rather seek out the best cocktails at the park&#8217;s bars, for instance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney (choosing your interests in the app)</p></div></p>
<p>Before Genie, guests could make up to three reservations in advance of a park visit through the FastPass+ scheduling system, and could then continue to make reservations through the My Disney Experience app after those first three reservations had been used. But this free system made it difficult to get reservations on top rides, as it favored Disney resort-goers who could book 60 days in advance, while others got a 30-day window. It also didn&#8217;t make all top rides (aka Tier 1 attractions) available for the initial booking.</p>
<p>Disney Genie aims to address some of these issues, but for a fee. That&#8217;s led to quite a bit of <a href="https://blogmickey.com/2021/08/disney-fans-overwhelmingly-dislike-disney-genie-announcement/">backlash</a> from Disney fans who feel they already pay enough for their Disney trips and don&#8217;t want to add more charges. In fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fP50klEPE">the video announcement</a> has a ratio of 12,000 dislikes to just 948 likes, as of the time of writing. However, paid fast-lane access to a park&#8217;s main attractions is a common staple at Disney&#8217;s theme park competitors &#8212; and one that can help those who have tighter schedules ensure they get everything done.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9fP50klEPE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Genie&#8217;s WDW launch on October 19, guests will be able to choose from the two paid options &#8212; either individual access to up to two Lightning Lanes or Genie+&#8217;s broader selection.</p>
<p>Disney says the following rides are available for the à la carte option: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Space Mountain at Magic Kingdom, Remy&#8217;s Ratatouille Adventure and Frozen Ever After at Epcot, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey &amp; Minnie&#8217;s Runaway Railway at Disney Hollywood Studios, and Avatar Flight of Passage and Expedition Everest at Disney&#8217;s Animal Kingdom.</p>
<p>While picking two options could help speed up your wait times, it may not include your must-have ride selections.</p>
<p>Disney Genie+, meanwhile, opens up Lightning Lanes at a total of 40+ attractions across the four parks instead, including many more of the Tier 1 rides. It will be priced at $15 per ticket per day at Walt Disney World Resort and $20 per ticket per day at Disneyland Resort, when available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216161" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216161" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216161" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_3.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216161" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney</p></div></p>
<p>The à la carte pricing will vary by date, attraction and park, Disney says. While Disney hasn&#8217;t announced specific ranges for each ride, it has offered some examples. It says the Lightning Lane entrance to Remy&#8217;s Ratatouille Adventure will be $9 per person on October 19 and $11 per person on October 23. But on those same dates, the Lightning Lane entrance to Expedition Everest &#8211; Legend of the Forbidden Mountain will be just  $7 per person, while Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance will be $15 per person.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s news of the October 19 launch at Walt Disney World Resort, the company is also detailing how the feature is integrated into its My Disney Experience app. This is the app offering access to your tickets, park maps, showtimes, online food ordering and more.</p>

<p>Today, many park-goers turn to third-party apps like those from TouringPlans.com or other indie developers, as well as Disney fan blogs, to get tips about how to plan their route through a given park to ensure they see all the main attractions and events. But Genie promises to help prioritize your trip for you directly in its own My Disney Experience app, using the company&#8217;s understanding of things like wait times and other park changes &#8212; like rides that temporarily closed or other delays. This in-house option could potentially impact the revenue streams from the third-party businesses that have sprung up to address park planning needs.</p>
<p>Plus, unlike static plans, Genie&#8217;s experience will adapt to users&#8217; days and their own unexpected plan changes &#8212; like needing to head back to the hotel to let little kids nap, taking an unplanned snack break or deciding you want to ride something twice. As you adjust your plans, Genie also updates your itinerary. And this aspect of the service is offered for free, even if you&#8217;re not paying for fast-lane entry.</p>
<p>Disney has not yet announced when Disney Genie will launch at Disneyland Resort, but <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/">said</a> earlier that it would arrive this fall.</p>

The city of Los Angeles — eager to introduce zero-emission transportation — wants to ensure the launch of air taxis doesn&#8217;t repeat past mistakes.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">To help prepare Los Angeles for the new tech, a nonprofit organization spun out of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti&#8217;s office is working with air taxi developers and local residents to develop a policy toolkit in advance of commercial operations later this decade.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to be hammered out before then. Foremost, the aircraft must be certified with the Federal Aviation Administration &#8212; a mammoth task in and of itself. But even beyond aircraft certification, companies will also need to plan for infrastructure, namely vertiports, or where the air taxis will take off and land. And these come with real issues like noise pollution and zoning laws that have the potential to affect not only city residents but other transportation networks, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.urbanmovementlabs.com/">Urban Movement Labs</a> was spun out of the mayor’s Office of Economic Development in 2020 to become a standalone 501c(3) nonprofit aimed at shaping the future of mobility in the city. This year, the organization commenced an urban air mobility (UAM) partnership with the mayor’s office and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to drill down into how the city can integrate UAM into existing infrastructure and transportation networks in a way that maximizes equity and accessibility.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2209157" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The partnership is being funded, in part, by Archer Aviation and Hyundai’s Urban Air Mobility division.</p>
<p>“We have a commitment from Hyundai and Archer to actually focus on assisting us in developing this policy toolkit,” Sam Morrissey, UML’s executive director, explained to TechCrunch in a recent interview. “That&#8217;s everything from the policies around where these vehicles will fly, the air routes, where these vehicles may land outside of commercial airports … and other related policies around planning for [vertiports].”</p>
<p>Joby Aviation has coordinated with UML since the organization was formed, and German UAM developer Volocopter joined as UML’s newest partner earlier this month.</p>
<p>“Our role is to really facilitate the new deployment of technology in Los Angeles,” Morrissey said. He added that the city wants to avoid the ex post facto scramble to regulate transportation technologies, like what happened after the launch of Uber, Lyft and scooter rental services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Particularly in 2016, when Uber Elevate started talking about flying taxis in cities, the city of Los Angeles said, ‘We need to have a separate entity that can help focus this.’”</p>
<h2>The infrastructure challenge</h2>
<p>UML fashions itself as a three-way bridge between the city, private industry and, most importantly, Los Angelenos. The three perspectives may not always align. The launch of electric air taxis, in particular, presents unique challenges that need to be solved, everything from fire risk and zoning issues to noise pollution and issues that cause disagreement among stakeholders.</p>
<p>Consider vertiports. While certifying the aircraft is solely in the jurisdiction of the FAA, &#8220;if you want to build new infrastructure on the ground, this is obviously a municipal and a city question,&#8221; <span class="il">Greg</span> Bowles, Joby&#8217;s head of government affairs, explained to TechCrunch. &#8220;The way you want to use that, the access to that, the permitting, those are all municipal [issues].&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey said companies are primarily approaching route planning from a market standpoint — for example, looking at where people currently use Uber Black, the ride-sharing company&#8217;s premium service — while Urban Movement Labs wants to overlay that onto a regional-planning approach that accounts for how UAM would support existing transportation networks in the long term.</p>
<p>Siting and zoning laws are another issue. Beyond the easy-to-imagine NIMBYism that may crop up once potential vertiport sites are located, operational tempo, or flights per hour, could affect how many air taxi operators can use a given site.</p>
<p>While both Archer and Joby have announced private partnerships with REEF Technology to convert assets like parking garages into vertiport sites (and UML recognizes that these locations make a great deal of sense for a number of reasons), the city’s own regulations must still be accounted for before air taxis can start ferrying customers.</p>
<p>“Converting the roof of a parking structure sounds good, but you ultimately still need [the building and safety departments] to come in and say that this deck can support these aircraft, that the fire suppression needs are adequate enough,” Morrissey said.</p>
<p>A major question mark is whether and how many vertiports will be exclusive-use versus shared among the companies. One can imagine air taxi takeoff and landing sites like airport gates (homogenous and shared among all airlines) or more like gas stations (branded, competitive and offering different amenities). This, too, could be another potential point of contention between the city, its residents and the air taxi companies.</p>
<p>At least in the beginning, however, many companies may decide that working together &#8212; to set standards relating to noise and charging, for example &#8212; is the faster route to overall commercialization and adoption than working separately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really look at this as a competitive space,&#8221; Bowles said of Joby&#8217;s work on vertiport standards. &#8220;This is something we have to build, so we&#8217;re working with a lot of the other OEMs and future operators.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160169" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160169" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160169" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.jobyaviation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joby Aviation <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The final question, of course, is the perennial one: Who’s going to pay for it?</p>
<p>“When we think about vertiports in the future, it&#8217;s going to be really a combination of who provides the capital to build and operate that vertiport, and a conversation with the city as far as who can access those vertiports and what the pros and cons might be to a community, of having open-access vertiports versus not open access,” Archer’s head of business development, Andrew Cummins, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Echoing Cummins, UML&#8217;s urban air mobility fellow, Clint Harper, said that while the city of Los Angeles has been clear about its preference for an “OEM-ambiguous” infrastructure, much of the final network will depend on whether vertiports are completely private enterprises or built through public-private partnerships. “They&#8217;re different funding models to bring infrastructure into reality,” he said. “Depending on what that funding model looks like, I think will tell us whether it&#8217;s going to be a multioperator type of facility or a single operator facility.”</p>
<p>Volocopter&#8217;s chief commercial officer, Christian <span class="il">Bauer, told TechCrunch</span> it was the company&#8217;s viewpoint that “we need an open system” for all OEMs. “We do not want to invest into real estate,” he added.</p>
<h2>Working with the city and beyond</h2>
<p>Many of these questions are big and will likely take years to reconcile. In part, that’s because cities are still awaiting guidance from federal regulators. Harper told TechCrunch that UML is staying flexible as recommendations from the FAA, National Fire Protection Association and the International Code Council’s building code continue to evolve.</p>
<p>For their part, air taxi OEMs are also working at the federal level to provide input into developing policies. Archer, Joby and Volocopter are all also working with federal regulators and city municipalities.</p>
<p>Looking to the rest of the year and into next, UML said it’s reaching out to transportation advocacy groups, like pedestrian safety or cyclist organizations, as well as social issue groups that focus on things like homelessness, to understand how to plan for urban air mobility. Equity is particularly important in transportation planning in order to avoid repeating past mistakes: The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, found that California&#8217;s people of color and low-income residents are <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/inequitable-exposure-air-pollution-vehicles-california-2019#ucs-report-downloads">disproportionately exposed</a> to tailpipe emissions.</p>
<p>Much of the work on the city side is simply ensuring that relevant city departments are up to date on the latest developments with vertiports. Some of that comes down to ensuring the building and safety and fire departments, among others, can assign full-time staff to prepare for vertiports and new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Morrissey said UML is trying to be methodical.</p>
<p>“I think the reality is that these vehicles are coming, and we really want to do everything we can to plan for it but stay out of the hype cycle.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Varda Space Industries, a startup that wants to build in-space manufacturing facilities, will be sending its first spacecraft to orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2023.</p>
<p>The actual spacecraft &#8212; the startup’s first to go to orbit &#8212; will be made by SpaceX’s rival launch company, Rocket Lab, which will also make two subsequent space vehicles for Varda. The three vehicles will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: a microgravity manufacturing module and a reentry capsule.</p>
<p>The aim is for each spacecraft to spend approximately three months in orbit, with the reentry module bringing back around 40-60 kilograms of manufactured materials.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gsx1Tib6X3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/embed/#?secret=gsx1Tib6X3" data-secret="gsx1Tib6X3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Varda’s goal is to unlock the benefits of microgravity &#8212; which can only be found for sustained periods in space &#8212; for manufacturing novel materials, like bio-printed organs or specialized semiconductors. The startup’s bet is that the potential market for such materials is high enough to make the effort worth it.</p>
<p>The Torrance, California-based startup has been moving fast since its founding by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov a little less than a year ago. Varda announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/varda-space-industries-closes-42m-series-a-for-off-planet-manufacturing/">$42 million Series A</a> in July, and plans on following an aggressive launch schedule, with two launches in 2023 and a third in 2024.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will be one of many objects aboard the Falcon 9 rideshare mission, a new and lucrative program that spreads the cost of going to space between customers by allowing them to essentially carpool to space. SpaceX promises to slash the cost of launch to as low as $1 million for an individual customer looking to send up to 200 kilograms of payload to sun synchronous orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems as if retailers and Google are playing a game of chicken about who can leak the most information about the company&#8217;s two upcoming flagship phones: the Google Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 6 Pro. Google&#8217;s Pixel line of smartphones has traditionally been the flagship of the Android armada for those of us who like our Android operating systems as un-adorned as possible. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/google-keeps-it-simple-with-the-pixel-5/">a somewhat underwhelming Pixel 5</a>, which meant that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-now-has-three-mid-range-pixel-phones/">the company had a number of mid-range phones</a> and no real flagship to speak of, Google seems to have learned its lesson. With the un-Apple-y approach of <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US">leaking its own device</a> a few weeks before launch, all googly eyes are on the duo of upcoming phones.</p>
<p>As the October 19 launch date crawls closer, the pace of information being pushed on the public hasn&#8217;t exactly slowed. Over the weekend, U.K. phone store <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/">Carphone Warehouse</a> published its sales pages for the two phones. Of course, the retailer yanked the pages as soon as they could, but not before <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889">an eagle-eyed leak-hunter snagged some screen shots</a>. In addition, Google has started advertising the yet-to-be-shipped pocket computers in a variety of media, too, presumably in the hope that some doubters will hesitate for long enough before pressing the buy-it-now button on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-iphone-13-mini-pro-max-keynote-live-stream-livestream/">Apple&#8217;s recently launched iPhone 13</a> series. In the advertising and marketing activities, which started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">all the way back in August</a>, Google is <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">highlighting some of the advantages it has over its Cupertino-conceived cousin, and staking out the competitive landscape. </span></p>
<p>As you might expect, given that this is where a lot of the smartphone war has shifted its bellicose behavior, the leaked pages heavily focus on the quality of the cameras.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Google Pixel 6 continues the Android trend of adding computer vision and AI smarts to the photo-taking process but also introduces some top-shelf hardware to the mix. The Pixel 6 reportedly gets a 50mpx wide-angle camera and a 12mpx ultra-wide. The Pixel 6 Pro gets a trio of cameras &#8212; two with the same spec as its little brother, and an additional 48mpx telephoto lens.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216079" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216079" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?w=680" alt="Google Tensor image" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png 2551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Google-Tensor.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Screenshot from <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a>&#8216;s official Pixel 6 holding page. (Image has been cropped)</p></div></p>
<p>The other big highlight is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-is-building-its-own-chip-for-the-pixel-6/">the already-much-discussed Tensor chip</a> that is making its debut in the new phones</p>
<p>The marketing pages also shed additional light on the claims Google is making about its battery technology. Adaptive battery performance means that the phones&#8217; batteries can charge from flat to 50% charge in just half an hour, and the operating system has a bunch of smarts built-in to further stretch your battery life for those days when you venture too far away from a power socket. The company also highlights high-speed wireless charging for when you&#8217;re hanging on without a thread.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With its main competitors making a bigger deal of security, Google joins the fray on that battlefront as well, claiming &#8220;more layers of hardware security than any other phone,&#8221; reminding users that they are introducing the Titan M2 security chip and a promise of &#8220;five years of updates&#8221; which will ensure it &#8220;gets more secure over time.&#8221; It isn&#8217;t immediately clear whether this refers to firmware updates or updates of the OS, but it&#8217;s encouraging to see Android stand behind its phones even as they age into oblivion.</p>
<p>We expect to learn more about the phones as the launch date crawls closer. We expect preorders to start next week, on October 19.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch events always offer a compelling mix of main stage presentations and smaller breakout sessions that allow more time for lots of questions and deeper discussions. Expect nothing less at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> on October 27.</p>
<p>We want to highlight the sponsored sessions we have on tap for you. Remember, TechCrunch sponsors don’t just cut a check and call it a day. They show up ready to inform, enlighten and take questions in their area of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>A quick reminder from the home office:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> right here. Prices go up at the virtual door.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2212752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before we tell you about the specific sessions, consider this feedback we received from Michael McCarthy, the CEO of Repositax.</p>
<p>“There was always something interesting going on in one of the breakout sessions, and I was impressed by the quality of the people participating. Partners in well-known VC firms spoke, they were accessible, and they shared smart, insightful nuggets. You will not find this level of people accessible and in one place anywhere else.”</p>
<p>And now, a word from our sponsors. You’ll find the exact times (and more presentations) listed in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">event agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Three Easy Steps to Capture Global Opportunities:</strong> As our economy becomes increasingly global, is your business prepared to succeed? KUDO co-founder and CEO Fardad Zabetian shares his insights on how to capture global opportunities. Presented by KUDO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack:</strong> The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Ben Gotfredson, global startup program manager at Snowflake, and Adam Gross, ex-CEO at Heroku, join RudderStack founder and CEO Soumyadeb Mitra to discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like. Presented by RudderStack.</p>
<p><strong>How do High-growth Companies Use Technology to Inform Strategy and Drive Results?</strong> Fast-growing companies are in a constant state of transition, as high performance and growth can lead to ever-changing business priorities and challenges. Hear from a couple of SAP’s hypergrowth customers about how they use technology to inform their strategy and ultimately drive business results. SAP Managing Director, Midmarket and Ecosystem, Greg Petraetis will share how businesses grow from being innovators to disruptors to category leaders and how the technology they choose can impact the future of their business productivity. Presented by SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing SaaS Productivity — Why SaaS Sprawl Prohibits Growth?</strong> SaaS represents an increasing share of the installed software estate — in cloud-born companies, often 100%. If not managed and optimized, an uncontrolled adoption leads to SaaS sprawl, sometimes called “Shadow IT.” Sub-optimized usage of SaaS subscriptions, increased risk and audit exposures will become a headache when scaling a business. André Christ, LeanIX co-founder and CEO, leads this talk illustrating frequent pitfalls and proposes the needed processes, skills and capabilities of the emerging SaaS management discipline for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs. Presented by LeanIX.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Your People from Startup to Scale:</strong> As your business grows, you need to help your people grow with you. And, in a world that is transforming faster than ever, the methods of developing your team don’t cut it. In this session you’ll hear from Max Wessel, chief learning officer at SAP, about how to build a culture and workforce that is flexible, adaptable and fit for a rocket ship. Presented by SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation:</strong> Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, co-founder and CTO of AKASA, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries. Presented by AKASA.</p>
<p>Join us — and the global SaaS community — for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=sponsorsessionposts&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sponsorsessionposts&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> on October 27.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving a satellite’s thruster power and maneuverability can play a vital role in space sustainability. How? Developing and testing new technologies — like electronic propulsion systems (EPS) — can ultimately help better smallsats achieve their correct orbit, avoid collisions with space junk and then de-orbit safely when they become non-operational.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPS and other new technologies can be used in smaller spacecraft without decreasing their capability to perform tasks like maintaining camera imaging, communications and other mission-critical projects.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215981" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s on the thruster horizon? You’ll have ample opportunity to learn about the latest up-and-coming advancements happening in in-space propulsion technologies at the virtual edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space this December 14-15</a>. Case in point:</span><a href="https://accion-systems.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Accion Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — developer of ion propulsion systems for satellites — will be in the virtual house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company aims to redefine the performance, efficiency and scalability of spacecraft propulsion systems to expand what’s possible in space. Or, as Natalya Bailey, the company’s co-founder &amp; CTO said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make space more affordable and accessible by changing what spacecraft can do in and beyond Earth’s orbit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propulsion systems don’t just power space flight; they power possibility and opportunity. Take advantage of your opportunity to learn more about this topic alongside, lunar sampling, orbit servicing and the commercialization of space from barrier-breaking companies at TC Sessions: Space 2021.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/">SkyCell</a>, a Swiss company developing smart containers for transporting medicines and vaccines, is announcing a significant round of funding. On top of a $62 million round that closed last year, the company has now raised a $35 million Series C to improve shipping of temperature-sensitive drugs &#8212; including COVID-19 vaccines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which is a combination of equity and debt financing, lists investors from the Middle East, including DisruptAD and (the VC arm of ADQ, an Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund), and SHUAA (a major UAE asset management and investment banking firm). The investment also includes, per the company, “China-based” and Zurich-based family offices,” and investment from Mobiliar, a major private Swiss insurance company. </span></p>
<p>This round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $133 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, SkyCell has developed a shipping container that maintains temperature, controls vibration and is outfitted with sensors that continuously report the status of the cargo. The idea is to minimize temperature excursions &#8212; harmful fluctuations that can spoil drug products &#8212; and other damage that happens during shipping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An oft-cited number in the vaccine logistics community comes from a </span><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/68463/WHO_VB_03.18.Rev.1_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2005 World Health Organization report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting that as much as 50% of vaccines are wasted &#8212; partially thanks to temperature, logistics and shipping issues. The biopharma industry uses more optimistic numbers. SkyCell co-founder and CEO Richard Ettl says the industry typically factors in about a 4% failure rate for established markets and 12% failure rate for emerging markets when it ships drugs around the world.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, SkyCell’s temperature excursion rate is less than .1%, according to an </span><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/news/new-audit-reaffirms-skycells-high-performance-efficiency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outside audit of the technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/skycell-raises-62m-for-smart-containers-and-analytics-to-transport-pharmaceuticals/">last covered</a> SkyCell back in April 2020, the company had been working with eight major pharmaceutical companies and was in trials with seven more. The company now “works with the majority of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies,” per a PR representative &#8212; though the company wouldn’t provide further details. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before COVID-19, the company was delivering about 250 million vials of pharmaceutical products per year across all customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the technology has moved forward in one big way: It’s been redesigned to be able to transport mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the raw materials needed to make them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly designed containers use dry ice &#8212; a necessity to achieve the temperatures about -80 to -60 degrees Celsius preferred (but </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-allows-more-flexible-storage-transportation-conditions-pfizer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no longer always required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to transport vaccines like Pfizer’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to ultra-cold vaccine shipping, dry ice is basically unavoidable. (UPS Healthcare makes its own dry ice and has been <a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/ups-dry-ice-pfizer-vaccine-coronavirus-stirling-ultracold/589723/">upping production</a> to meet COVID-19 vaccine demand). SkyCell’s tech, says Ettl, uses far less of it than competitors. It uses </span><a href="https://www.skycell.ch/news/skycell-introduces-revolutionary-new-deep-frozen-container-the-1500df/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 kilograms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of dry ice for about 120 hours of use, though it can store vaccines longer, if more dry ice is added upon arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The competition would need 200 kilos or more of dry ice,” he says. “So that was a major feat of engineering.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl says the company is now transporting either raw materials or vaccines for three top COVID-19 vaccine makers (he did not disclose which ones &#8212; though by the ultra cold temperature requirements, you might be able to guess. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two [of the three] we almost exclusively transport the raw material that comes out of the factory,” he says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major step forward is the company’s expansion from flying into trucking services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many vaccines first arrive in countries via plane, it’s often trucks that bring vaccines to central medical warehouses. Ideally these trucks are refrigerated, but those aren’t always available, which means that cold boxes and large-scale hauler trucks get used instead, according to a</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/port-to-patient-improving-country-cold-chains-for-covid-19-vaccines"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2021 McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion into trucking greatly increases the reach of SkyCell’s vaccine distribution network. The company has been involved in European distribution of vaccines for one major vaccine player, Ettl says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before we were not doing trucking,” says Ettl. “Our container is used on trucks to transport these -80 Celsius and very cold temperature [products] around. So this was definitely a big change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl says that COVID-19 vaccine shipping will likely continue to play a role in the company’s future. But it’s not the core of their business. Many pharmaceutical products, from cancer drugs to other vaccines, require cold-chain handling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Air Transport Association’s Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics </span><a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/494bc14afd934b0193735e9a47091d72/iata_ceiv-pharma_how20to20become20ceiv20pharma20certified.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">world sales of cold-chain drugs and biologics will surpass $440 billion by 2024 &#8212; and that doesn’t include COVID-19 vaccine spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that industry, there also appear to be three macro-trends, the report continues. There are an increasing number of container reuse services, and development of more recyclable shipping containers, and finally the use of electronics to track shipments in real time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, SkyCell overlaps with all of these trends. The fact that SkyCell’s container is reusable is a “major driver” that has helped the company obtain pharmaceutical partnerships, Ettl says. The company has also installed sensors within the boxes, and collects a constellation of data points on every shipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ettl believes that SkyCell is poised to respond to industry-level changes and increasing demand for cold-chain products. So far, the numbers seem to be in the company’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have never lost the product in the company&#8217;s history,” he says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As last week came to a close, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001625278/000162828021019876/nerdwallets-1.htm">NerdWallet filed to go public</a>. Given the late hour, our S-1 dive had to wait until today.</p>
<p>The NerdWallet IPO comes at an interesting time. The company provides financial product recommendations to both consumers and SMBs, meaning that it dabbles in the same market that fintech startups play in. And because NerdWallet is essentially a weaponized content play, we get to talk about the value of the written word.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>NerdWallet is pursuing a traditional IPO, meaning that it will raise primary capital in its public debut. Per its filing, the company intends to &#8220;use approximately $29.0 million of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay all outstanding principal amounts and accrued interest under certain promissory notes.&#8221; The rest will go to running and growing the company, or what lawyers like to call &#8220;general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The NerdWallet IPO is a liquidity event for several investing groups, including Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), which owns 17.5% of Class A stock ahead of the company&#8217;s public offering, RRE Ventures (6.5% of pre-IPO shares) and iGlobe Partners (6.0%). (Crunchbase has more regarding the company&#8217;s private fundraising history <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nerdwallet/company_financials">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We want to know how COVID-19 impacted NerdWallet&#8217;s growth, how quickly it is expanding revenues in 2021, its historical profitability and recent trends thereof and how the company manages to stay trustworthy, a question that we&#8217;ll address through the lens of editorial independence. Sound good? Let&#8217;s have some fun.</p>
<h2>COVID-19 and NerdWallet</h2>
<p>The pandemic was not kind to NerdWallet, but because the firm had variable costs it could constrain, wasn&#8217;t disastrous to its overall business.</p>
<p>NerdWallet generated $228.3 million in revenues in 2019, a figure that rose only modestly to $245.3 million in 2020. For a venture-backed company, posting growth of around 7.5% can be lethal. At that pace of growth, who&#8217;d want to back a startup?</p>
<p>More recently, growth has sped back up, with NerdWallet posting $137.3 million in H1 2020 revenues, a figure that expanded to $181.6 in the first half of 2021. The latter figure represents growth of just over 32%, a much healthier number than what the company recorded in 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic is partially to blame for NerdWallet&#8217;s slack 2020 growth. Here&#8217;s the company discussing what COVID-19 did to certain lines of its business:</p>
