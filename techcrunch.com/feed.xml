<p>The tech giant raised the hackles of the VR community this summer when it <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/">announced</a> it would be merging users of the latest Oculus kit onto a single Facebook account &#8212; and would end support for existing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oculus-vr">Oculus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> account users by 2023.</p>
<p>New users were immediately required to have a Facebook account in order to log in and access content for the virtual reality kit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-changes-name-of-its-annual-vr-event-and-its-overall-ar-vr-organization/">August</a> Facebook also announced that it was changing the name of the VR business it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/25/facebook-to-buy-oculus-vr-maker-of-the-rift-headset-for-around-2b-in-cash-and-stock/?_ga=2.118783051.351571251.1607268348-1757155993.1533833482">back in 2014</a> for around $2BN &#8212; and had allowed to operate separately &#8212; to &#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook-reality-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook-reality-labs">Facebook Reality Labs</a>&#8220;, signalling the assimilation of Oculus into its wider social empire.</p>
<p>(Related: The last of Oculus&#8217; original co-founders left the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/facebook-is-losing-its-last-oculus-co-founder/">last year</a>.)</p>

<p>In recent years Facebook has been pushing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/facebook-is-building-a-new-social-layer-for-oculus-headsets/">add a &#8216;social layer&#8217; to the VR platform</a> &#8212; but the heavy-handed requirement for Oculus users to have a Facebook account has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/08/19/oculus-vr-headsets-will-soon-require-a-facebook-account-and-that-sucks/">not proved popular with gamers</a>.</p>
<p>Now antitrust authorities are taking an interest in the move.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2020/10_12_2020_Facebook_Oculus.html">Federal Cartel Office</a> (aka, the Bundeskartellamt) said today that it&#8217;s instigated abuse proceedings against Facebook to examine the linkage between Oculus VR products and its eponymous social network.</p>
<p>In a statement, its president, Andreas Mundt, said: <q>In the future, the use of the new Oculus glasses requires the user to also have a Facebook account. Linking virtual reality products and the group’s social network in this way could constitute a prohibited abuse of dominance by Facebook. With its social network Facebook holds a dominant position in Germany and is also already an important player in the emerging but growing VR (virtual reality) market. We intend to examine whether and to what extent this tying arrangement will affect competition in both areas of activity.</q></p>
<p>The FCO has another &#8216;abuse of dominance proceeding&#8217; ongoing against Facebook &#8212; related to how it combines user data for ad profiling in a privacy-hostile way the authority contends is an abuse of its market dominance.</p>
<p>That case is seen as highly innovative in how it combines privacy and antitrust concerns so is being closely watched.</p>

<p>The latest FCO proceeding against Facebook comes at an awkward time for the tech giant, which has been hit with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 U.S. States</a> &#8212; which accuse it of suppressing competition through monopolistic business practices.</p>
<p>As antitrust regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of Zuckerberg&#8217;s empire in recent years Facebook has responded by announcing a plan to consolidate its messaging products onto a single technical backend, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/facebook-branding/">adding Facebook branding to its acquisitions</a> &#8212; in an apparent bid to make it harder for competition regulators to order a break up.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/05/facebook-is-pivoting/">PR has sought to cloak the move by claiming it will increase user privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Yet the states&#8217; antitrust case against the company includes filings that show an executive discussing using moments of perceived increased competition for Facebook as an opportunity to decrease Facebook user privacy.</p>
<p>So, uh, awkward&#8230;.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last year <a href="https://twitter.com/DinaSrinivasan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DinaSrinivasan</a> theorized that Facebook&#39;s monopoly has allowed it to degrade user privacy.

<p>Reached for comment on the FCO Oculus proceeding, a Facebook spokesperson sent us this statement: “While Oculus devices are not currently available for sale in Germany, we will cooperate fully with the Bundeskartellamt and are confident we can demonstrate that there is no basis to the investigation.”</p>
<p>The tech giant has used a series of legal tactics to block the FCO&#8217;s order against &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; users.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/facebook-succeeds-in-blocking-german-fcos-privacy-minded-order-against-combining-user-data/">Last year</a> Facebook successfully applied to block the order banning it from combining user data. However Germany&#8217;s Federal Court of Justice reversed the decision of the Higher Regional Court &#8212; confirming the FCO&#8217;s decision. Although the hearing on the main proceeding is still pending at the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court &#8212; currently scheduled for March 26, 2021 (after being postponed from a date in November).</p>
<p>Facebook responded to the Federal Court of Justice ruling by filing another emergency appeal against the FCO&#8217;s order &#8212; succeeding for a second time in blocking the order against combining user data.</p>
<p>The FCO says it does not have a route to appeal this preliminary block on points of law &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s had to lodge a complaint with the Federal Court of Justice, which it did on December 2.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mundt criticized Facebook for resorting to &#8220;legal remedies&#8221; to block the order which he said is delaying relief for consumers and competitors against Facebook&#8217;s abusive practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that Facebook has resorted to various legal remedies is not surprising in view of the significance which our proceedings have for the group’s business model. Nevertheless, the resulting delay in proceedings is of course regrettable for competition and consumers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the second time that the Higher Regional Court has preliminarily granted an emergency appeal filed by Facebook. The deadline imposed on Facebook for implementing our demands has again been suspended. As in our view the reasons for this are not sustainable, we have immediately filed a complaint with the Federal Court of Justice. We want the clock to be ticking again for Facebook.”</p>
<p>Facebook using courts to block attempts to hold its business model accountable for violating regional laws is par for the course in Europe.</p>
<p>The tech giant has recently succeeded in blocking a preliminary order from Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission to suspend personal data transfers to the US by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/facebook-seeks-fresh-legal-delay-to-block-order-to-suspend-its-transatlantic-data-transfers/">applying for a judicial review of the regulator&#8217;s process</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/facebook-is-trying-to-block-schrems-ii-privacy-referral-to-eu-top-court/">sought to block</a> Irish courts from referring the Schrems II case, which underpins that decision, to the CJEU in the first place &#8212; though it did not succeed.</p>
<p>In public remarks in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">September</a>, Facebook VP Nick Clegg claimed it&#8217;s taking that legal action not to defend its own business model but to &#8220;try to send a signal that this is a really big issue for the whole European economy, for all small and large companies that rely on data transfers&#8221; &#8212; which he suggested would be &#8220;absolutely disastrous&#8221; for the EU as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than one billion people in India today have a mobile connection, thanks in part to the proliferation of low-cost Android smartphones and the world&#8217;s cheapest mobile data plans in recent years.</p>
<p>This scale was unimaginable just three decades ago, when India had fewer than 2.5 million telephones in the country. One of the earliest and most pivotal efforts that expanded the reach of telephones in the country took place in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>That was when the Indian government backed the idea of setting up telephone booths, or public call offices, across cities and towns. No longer did people need to buy expensive telephones, or pay exorbitant fees and bills. A person could just walk to a nearby mom and pop store, place a call for a couple of cents and move on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Wednesday, India’s cabinet approved a proposal that seeks to replicate the decades old strategy &#8212; and its success &#8212; with democratizing Wi-Fi in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government will launch PM WANI (Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface) to &#8220;unleash a massive network in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The neighborhood stores that served as public call offices could now be public data offices, he said. To make the program a success, the government will not charge any license or registration fee, he said.</p>
<p>These public data offices will work in tandem with public data aggregators that are tasked to collaborate with small and large telecom companies to utilize their optical fibre network.</p>
<p>The program will &#8220;create millions of inter-operable Wi-Fi hotspots in the country and democratise content distribution and broadband access to millions at affordable rates,&#8221; said R.S. Sharma, former chairman of Indian telecom regulator TRAI. He likened the program to UPI, a payments infrastructure built by retail banks, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">become the most popular way Indians pay digitally today</a>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people came online in India for the first time in the last decade. But just as many are still unconnected. The new program from the Indian government, in part, aims to bridge this gap.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is expected to be more business friendly and in line with efforts for ease of doing business.COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated delivery of stable and high speed Broadband Internet (data) services to an increasingly large number of subscribers in the country including areas which do not have 4G mobile coverage. This can be achieved by deployment of Public Wi-Fi,&#8221; the cabinet <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1679342">said in a statement</a>. &#8220;Further, the proliferation of public Wi-Fi will not only create employment but also enhance disposable incomes in the hands of small and medium entrepreneurs and boost the GDP of the country,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s announcement is the latest effort to bring more people online in India. Global giants <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> both of which are counting on emerging markets such as India to sustain their growth, have previously attempted to make internet access more affordable in the country. While Facebook’s marquee effort, Free Basics, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/india-blocks-facebook-freebasics-net-neutrality/">banned in the country over net neutrality violation charges</a>, Google voluntarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">shut down its free Wi-Fi program at 400 railway stations this year</a>.</p>
<p>As mobile data prices got cheaper in many markets, including India, Google Station was no longer necessary, Caesar Sengupta, VP of Payments and Next Billion Users at Google, said at the time.</p>
<p>Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst and founder of consulting firm Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch that the Indian government should have launched this program seven to eight years ago.</p>
<p>He said the launch of Jio Platforms, which has become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/how-reliance-jio-platforms-became-indias-biggest-telecom-network/">largest telecom operator in India in just four years</a> thanks to its cutrate mobile data tariffs, solved much of the challenges that PM WANI seeks to address.</p>

<p>The update makes shopping an even larger focus for Instagram than it already was, and arrives at a time when video-based shopping is seeing increased adoption. In particular, a growing number of startups focused on live-stream video shopping are finding traction. In recent months, investors have backed companies like live shopping platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a>, for example, while major tech companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">Alibaba</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/chinas-top-short-video-apps-and-e-commerce-giants-pally-up/">JD.com</a>, have also joined the video shopping trend in various ways.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085237" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085237" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2085237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Most importantly, perhaps, is that Instagram rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok recently partnered with Shopify </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">on e-commerce</a> and today caters to brands that either advertise directly or work with influencers on its platform, eating into Instagram&#8217;s market. TikTok had also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">fielded interest from Walmart</a>, when the Trump ban had forced the company to enter negotiations around a U.S. exit. And TikTok&#8217;s app in 2020 beat out Instagram as one of the world&#8217;s most downloaded apps, indicating a seismic shift in how younger users interact with social media.</p>
<p>Hoping to not be left behind, Instagram has revamped its app &#8212; to much user criticism when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/">relocated key home screen features</a> &#8212; with the goal of becoming a top online shopping destination, as well. The company generates revenue when customers checkout in the app using Facebook Pay, which will allow it to make money outside of running ads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/">Cleo</a>, the London founded &#8220;financial assistant&#8221; that takes the form of an app and chatbot and now counts the U.S. as its largest market, has raised $44 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round, which I understand actually closed earlier this year, is EQT Ventures. Also participating are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/cleo-meet-balderton/">existing investors</a> Balderton Capital, LocalGlobe and SBI.</p>
<p>They join much earlier investors such as Entrepreneur First, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/taavet-meet-cleo/">Taavet Hinrikus</a>, Matt Robinson, Errol Damelin, Niklas Zennstrom, Alex Chesterman, and Ian Hogarth &#8212; all well-known names in London&#8217;s tech investment community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Targeting &#8220;Gen Z&#8221; and with a rather lofty sounding mission to &#8220;fight for the world&#8217;s financial health,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cleo-communications" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cleo-communications">Cleo&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> AI/machine learning-powered app connects to your bank accounts and gives you proactive advice and information on your finances, including timely nudges, to help you stay on top of your spending. Over time, the idea is that Cleo can help change your financial behaviour for the better.</p>
<p>The broader premise is that Cleo can replace your bank&#8217;s own app, and by speaking to you in a more human and user-friendly way, improve your financial health. In addition, and crucially &#8212; as Cleo founder Barney Hussey-Yeo is fond of arguing  &#8212; the company can do all of this without having the same cost base or misaligned incentives of an actual bank.</p>
<p>The assumption made in 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/emoji-banking/">when Cleo really got off the ground</a>, was that through a combination of data science and machine learning, delivered in a fun and openly gamified way, the company’s financial assistant chatbot could attract and retain gen z and millennial users. Then, after engaging with the app, users would have experienced enough value to upgrade to a paid subscription or various financial services offered through Cleo now or in the future. With 4 million registered users &#8212; 96 percent of whom are in the U.S. &#8212; the first part appears to be panning out.</p>
<p>Hussey-Yeo tells me the new funding round gives him a “mandate” to take some big product bets in order to move forward the financial health of Cleo’s users. “[Those product bets] won’t all work out, but if one or two of them connects, we’ll fundamentally change the game in some of the most broken areas in financial services”.</p>
<p>In addition, the company will expand its operations in the U.S., including building out executive and product teams in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“When we launched in the U.S it became quickly apparent that it would be our dominant market,” says the Cleo founder. “We were signing up about 1,000 users per day in the U.K. at the time. After [just] a week, we were at 10,000 per day in the U.S. and kept growing”.</p>
<p>Hussey-Yeo attributes a lot of the success state-side to better banking APIs in the U.S. with Plaid, which he says “dramatically drove up” conversion rates and lowered customer acquisition costs. “This combined with a much larger market focused us 100% on winning in the U.S. first. This race is far from played out”.</p>
<p>Hussey-Yeo says Cleo will always offer a free version &#8220;because everybody needs the ability to make smarter decisions about their financial lives&#8221;. In contrast, the premium product costs $5.99 per month and is intended for people who &#8220;need a little extra help,&#8221; providing features such as gamified savings, and &#8220;levelled up&#8221; credit scores with coaching. Premium users can also trigger a $100 salary advance designed to stop them dipping into a costly bank overdraft.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WMTx95pk81"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/cleo-meet-triplepoint/">Cleo, the London-based fintech, has quietly taken debt financing from US-based TriplePoint Capital</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cleo, the London-based fintech, has quietly taken debt financing from US-based TriplePoint Capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/cleo-meet-triplepoint/embed/#?secret=WMTx95pk81" data-secret="WMTx95pk81" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Cleo says it has grown revenue by 400 percent in the last twelve months, and Hussey-Yeo tells me the company is now doing $10 million-plus AAR. In a further nod towards stronger unit economics, the cost to acquire a user is now less than $2 with the vast majority of users acquired organically.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we’re definitely not in growth at all costs mode,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We’ve worked hard over the last 12 months to bring our payback period comfortably under 12 months which is an incredibly rare feat at scale for fintech”.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Cleo’s mission and the strong “personality” its chatbot exhibits, is that the problem space the company is tackling is potentially based on behavioural science as much as it is data science. Hussey-Yeo doesn’t disagree.</p>
<p>“This is where the idea of a conversational interface came from,” he says. “I realised you could break the complexity down into a language anyone could engage with, and I mean actually look forward to engaging with it, to ultimately change their behaviour.</p>
<p>“Today we have an outstanding machine learning department but just as importantly is the behavioural researchers and writers at Cleo. We know this is the combination that makes Cleo special and, I hope, will eventually lead to us being the financial advisor for a billion people”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German fintech <a href="https://www.solactive.com/">Solactive</a>, a technology-enabled provider of indices and index solutions to the global financial services industry, has taken a $60.4m / €50 million minority investment from growth investor <a href="https://www.summitpartners.com/">Summit Partners</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based Orbex has raised a new $24 million funding round, led by BGF and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/octopus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="octopus-ventures">Octopus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and including participation from existing investors High-Tech Gründerfonds, Heartcore Capital, and Elecnor S.A. This new investment help &#8220;secure the roadmap&#8221; that Orbex was already working towards regarding its launch vehicle development and deployment, which is currently targeting 2022 for its first commercial launches.</p>
<p>Orbex is set to launch its Orbex Prime rocket from the new <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Hub Sutherland spaceport in Scotland, and has six launch contracts on the books already. Its debut launch vehicle is a small payload rocket, which is unique in the industry in that it makes use of bio-propane, a fuel source that offers 90% emissions reduction vs. the traditional kerosene-based rocket fuels generally used for liquid rockets, and which is a renewable fuel source. Orbex also aims to reduce its impact in other ways, including through recoverability and reusability, and says that Prime&#8217;s design is intended to leave no post-launch debris either in the ocean on Earth, or even in orbit.</p>
<p>The startup is already in the process of building out its first Prime rockets, at two<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heres-the-first-look-inside-orbexs-scotland-rocket-factory/"> factories it operates in Scotland and in Denmark</a>. The company uses 3D-printing heavily in its rocket facbbrication process. It has raised around $63 million to date, with its last round of around $39 million announced in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Productivity software has been getting a major re-examination this year, and human resources platforms &#8212; used for hiring, firing, paying, and managing employees &#8212; have been no exception. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s built what it believes is the next generation of how HR should and will work is announcing a big fundraise, underscoring its own growth and the focus on the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hibob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hibob</a>, the startup behind the HR platform that goes by the name of &#8220;bob&#8221; (the company name is pronounced, &#8220;Hi, Bob!&#8221;), has picked up $70 million in funding at a valuation that reliable sources close to the company tell us is around $500 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to modernize HR technology,&#8221; said Ronni Zehavi, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hibob" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hibob">Hibob&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO, who cofounded the company with Israel David. &#8220;We are a people management platform for how people work today. Whether that&#8217;s remotely or physically collaborative, our customers face challenges with work. We believe that the HR platforms of the future will not be clunky systems, annoying, giant platforms. We believe it should be different. We are a system of engagement rather than record.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B is being led by SEEK and Israel Growth Partners, with participation also from Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Eight Roads Ventures, Arbor Ventures, Presidio Ventures, Entree Capital, Cerca Partners, and Perpetual Partners, the same group that also backed Hibob in its last round (a Series A extension) in 2019. It has raised $124 million to date.</p>
<p>The company has its roots in Israel but these days describes its headquarters as London and New York, and the funding comes on the back of strong growth in multiple markets. In an interview, Zehavi said that Hibob specialises in the mid-market customers and says that it has over 1,000 of them currently on its books across the US, Europe and Asia, including Monzo, Revolut, Happy Socks, Ironsource, Receipt Bank, Fiverr, Gong, and VaynerMedia. In the last year Hibob has had &#8220;triple digit&#8221; year-on-year growth (it didn&#8217;t specify what those digits are).</p>
<p>Human resources has never been at the more glamorous end of how a company works, and it can sometimes even be looked on with some disdain. However HR has found itself in a new spotlight in 2020, the year when every company &#8212; whether one based around people sitting at desks or in more interactive and active environments &#8212; had to change how it worked.</p>
<p>That might have involved sending everyone home to sign in from offices possibly made out of corners of bedrooms or kitchens, or that might have involved a vastly different set of practices in terms of when and where workers showed up and how they interacted with people once they did. But r<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">egardless of the implementations, they all involved a team of people who needed to be linked together and still feeling connected and managed; and sometimes hired, furloughed, or let go.</span></p>
<p>That focus has started to reveal the strains of how some legacy systems worked, with older systems built to consider little more than creating an employee identity number that could then be tracked for payroll and other purposes.</p>
<p>Hibob &#8212; Zehavi said they chose the name after the person who owned the bob.com domain wanted too much to sell it, but they liked bob for the actual product &#8212; takes an approach from the ground up that is in line with how many people work today, balancing different software and apps depending on what they are doing, and linking them up by way of integrations: its own includes S<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lack, Microsoft Teams, and Mercer and other packages that are popular with HR departments. </span></p>
<p>While it covers all of the necessary HR bases like payroll and further compensation, onboarding, managing time off, and benefits, it further brings in a variety of other features that help build out bigger profiles of users, such as performance and culture, with the ability for peers, managers and workers themselves to provide feedback to enhance their own engagement with the company, and for the company to have a better idea of how they are fitting into the organization, and what might need more attention in the future.</p>
<p>That then links into a bigger organizational chart and conceptual charts that highlight strong performers, those who are possible flight risks, those who are leaders and so on. While there have been a number of others in the HR world that have built standalone apps that cover some of these features (for example, <a href="https://www.15five.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15five</a> was early to spot the value of a platform that made it much easier to set goals and provide feedback), what&#8217;s notable here is how they are all folded into one system together.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2085416,2085417,2085418,2085419"]</p>
<p>The end effect, as you can see here, looks less like word salad and more interactive, graphic interfaces that are presumably a lot more enjoyable and at least easier to use for HR people themselves.</p>
<p>The importance for investors has been that the product and the startup has identified the opportunity, but has delivered not just more engagement, but a strong piece of software that still provides the essentials.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly not a Workday,&#8221; said Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer, in an interview. &#8220;Our overall thesis has been that HR is only growing in importance. And while engagement is super important, that opportunity is not enough to create the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The end result is a platform that has a significant shot at building in even more over time. For example, another large area that has been seeing traction in the world of enterprise and B2B software is employee training. Specifically, enterprise learning systems are creating another way to help keep people not only speed on important aspects of how the work, but also engaged at a time when connections are under strain.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Training, a SuccessFactors-style offering, is definitely in our roadmap,&#8221; said Zehavi, who noted they are adding new features all the time. The latest has been compensation, sometimes known as merit increase cycles. &#8220;That is a very complex issue and requires deeper integrations finance and and the CFO&#8217;s office. We streamlined it and made it easy to use. We launched two months ago and it’s on fire. After learning and development the are other modules also down the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two months ago, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> observability platform Pixie Labs launched into general availability and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/pixie-labs-raises-9-15m-series-a-round-for-its-kubernetes-observability-platform/">announced</a> a $9.15 million Series A funding round led by Benchmark, with participation from GV. Today, the company is announcing its acquisition by <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, the publicly traded monitoring and observability platform.</p>
<p>The Pixie Labs brand and product will remain in place and allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/new-relic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="new-relic">New Relic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to extend its platform to the edge. From the outset, the Pixie Labs team designed the service to focus on providing observability for cloud-native workloads running on Kubernetes clusters. And while most similar tools focus on operators and IT teams, Pixie set out to build a tool that developers would want to use. Using <a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a>, a relatively new way to extend the Linux kernel, the Pixie platform can collect data right at the source and without the need for an agent.</p>
<p>At the core of the Pixie developer experience are what the company calls &#8220;Pixie scripts.&#8221; These allow developers to write their debugging workflows, though the company also provides its own set of these and anybody in the community can contribute and share them as well. The idea here is to capture a lot of the informal knowledge around how to best debug a given service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re super excited to bring these companies together because we share a mission to make observability ubiquitous through simplicity,&#8221; Bill Staples, New Relic&#8217;s Chief Product Officer, told me. &#8220;[&#8230;] According to IDC, there are 28 million developers in the world. And yet only a fraction of them really practice observability today. We believe it should be easier for every developer to take a data-driven approach to building software and Kubernetes is really the heart of where developers are going to build software.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that New Relic already had a solution for <a href="https://newrelic.com/platform/kubernetes">monitoring Kubernetes clusters</a>. Pixie, however, will allow it to go significantly deeper into this space. &#8220;Pixie goes much, much further in terms of offering on-the-edge, live debugging use cases, the ability to run those Pixie scripts. So it&#8217;s an extension on top of the cloud-based monitoring solution we offer today,&#8221; Staples said.</p>
<p>The plan is to build integrations into New Relic into Pixie&#8217;s platform and to integrate Pixie use cases with New Relic One as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zr5SV0CryU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/pixie-labs-raises-9-15m-series-a-round-for-its-kubernetes-observability-platform/">Pixie Labs raises $9.15M Series A round for its Kubernetes observability platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pixie Labs raises $9.15M Series A round for its Kubernetes observability platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/pixie-labs-raises-9-15m-series-a-round-for-its-kubernetes-observability-platform/embed/#?secret=Zr5SV0CryU" data-secret="Zr5SV0CryU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Currently, about 300 teams use the Pixie platform. These range from small startups to large enterprises and as Staples and Asgar noted, there was already a substantial overlap between the two customer bases.</p>
<p>As for why he decided to sell, Pixie co-founder (and former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> AI CEO Zain Asgar told me that it was all about accelerating Pixie&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Pixie to create this magical developer experience that really allows us to redefine how application developers monitor, secure and manage their applications,&#8221; Asgar said. &#8220;One of the cool things is when we actually met the team at New Relic and we got together with Bill and [New Relic founder and CEO] Lou [Cirne], we realized that there was almost a complete alignment around this vision [&#8230;], and by joining forces with New Relic, we can actually accelerate this entire process.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Relic has recently done a lot of work on open-sourcing various parts of its platform, including its agents, data exporters and some of its tooling. Pixie, too, will now open-source its core tools. Open-sourcing the service was always on the company&#8217;s roadmap, but the acquisition now allows it to push this timeline forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be taking Pixie and making it available to the community through open source, as well as continuing to build out the commercial enterprise-grade offering for it that extends the New Relic one platform,&#8221; Staples explained. Asgar added that it&#8217;ll take the company a little while to release the code, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same fundamental quality that got us so excited about Lew as an EIR in 2007, got us excited about Zain and Ishan in 2017 &#8212; absolutely brilliant engineers, who know how to build products developers love,&#8221; Bessemer Ventures General Partner Eric Vishria told me. &#8220;New Relic has always captured developer delight. For all its power, Kubernetes completely upends the monitoring paradigm we’ve lived with for decades.  Pixie brings the same &#8212; easy to use, quick time to value, no-nonsense approach to the Kubernetes world as New Relic brought to APM.  It is a match made in heaven.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.candu.ai/">Candu</a>, a software startup that provides no-code web tools for SaaS apps, announced a $5 million funding round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with founder <a href="https://twitter.com/jonaappleseed">Jonathan Anderson</a> and lead investor <a href="https://twitter.com/villi">Villi Iltchev</a>, a partner at Two Sigma Ventures, to chat about the deal.</p>
<p>First thing: This round, a bit like Scotch, has aged. It&#8217;s from March. And while it is very common for venture capital rounds to get announced after the fact, a nearly nine-month delay would normally be a stretch. However, Anderson explained that he wanted to hold off on releasing the news until Candu&#8217;s product was in the market. That&#8217;s a valid reason, so we&#8217;re going to chat about the investment despite its age.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round we&#8217;re discussing today is not Candu&#8217;s first, as the startup previously raised around $1 million after its graduation from <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>, an accelerator with a global footprint.</p>
<p>The $5 million investment began like many venture investments do, with an investor getting in touch with a young company months before a transaction is put together. Iltchev reached out to Candu in September of 2019 after hearing about the startup and liking its effort to allow for far-greater personalization of onboarding experiences inside of SaaS apps.</p>
<p>Anyone who has fired up a new business service, only to be given a walkthrough of how a few of the buttons work &#8212; a set of directions that I am sure you also skip &#8212; knows that the help can be generic, and annoying. Candu wants to work on the problem, offering no-code development tools to help non-engineers at companies build tailored pages to help with onboarding. What does that mean? With Candu, a SaaS app could offer different user cohorts nigh-personalized onboarding experiences.</p>
<p>So what? For SaaS companies big and small, effective onboarding is an important method of driving user engagement, a key metric for any modern software company. Why? Active users are less likely to churn, and more likely to expand spend on a service over time. So getting users activated well is no small task.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.walkme.com/">WalkMe</a> and <a href="https://www.pendo.io/">Pendo</a> have built material business by approaching the issue from a different angle. WalkMe last <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/walkme-raises-90m-for-dap-eyes-latin-american-market/">raised $90 million last December</a>, while Pendo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/pendo-scores-100m-series-e-on-1-billion-valuation/">picked up $100 million last October</a>.</p>
<p>Candu&#8217;s project was interesting, and it had an obvious market, but the deal didn&#8217;t come together for a few months after the investor and startup met each other. Iltchev asked Candu to stay in touch, and toward the end of 2019 Anderson reached out to alert the investor that some of his peers were circling. That call led to the round that was announced today.</p>
<h2>Superpowers</h2>
<p>No-code startups have the potential to empower workers at companies who have to fight for engineering resources. If more groups in a company can build and deploy product, they will be able to move more quickly, and get more done. And they won&#8217;t have to beg the engineering team for help.</p>
<p>For that reason no-code startups &#8212; and other no-code and low-code projects &#8212; are incredibly interesting. In the case of Candu, if its service finds adoption, marketing and customer success teams may be able to create and tweak onboarding experiences without needing help from other teams. That would not only save time, but could lead to better results as more iterations would be possible.</p>
<p>Candu is not done figuring itself out, however. Co-founder Anderson told TechCrunch that his company is still working on solidifying its product-market fit. That is perfectly reasonable for a startup that is still grinding its way through early seed checks.</p>
<p>Asked what the company expects its annual contract value (ACV) to average out to, Anderson said that the market would guide the company, which only launched its service <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/candu">in late October</a>. For now, Candu lists its prices starting from around $200 per month on up. Those targets provide some context about who it expects to sell to.</p>
<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s now up to the startup to scale its customer base, and turn those early customers into both revenue and learnings, which it can furrow back into its operations and product. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with its March-era seed investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The worldwide shift to virtual workplaces has been a blessing and a curse to people with hearing impairments. Having office chatter occur in text rather than speech is more accessible, but virtual meetings are no easier to follow than in-person ones — which is why <a href="https://www.ava.me/">real-time captioning startup Ava</a> has seen a huge increase in users. Riding the wave, the company just announced two new products and a $4.5 million seed round.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ava-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ava-3">Ava <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/ava-gives-the-hearing-impaired-a-more-present-voice-in-group-conversations/">previously made its name</a> in the deaf community as a useful live transcription tool for real-life conversations. Start the app up and it would instantly hear and transcribe speech around you, color-coded to each speaker (and named if they activate a QR code). Extremely useful, of course, but when meetings stopped being in rooms and started being in Zooms, things got a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Use cases have shifted dramatically, and people are discovering the fact that most of these tools are not accessible,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Thibault Duchemin told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while some tools may have limited captioning built in (for example Skype and Google Meet), it may or may not be saved, editable, accurate, or convenient to review. For instance Meet&#8217;s ephemeral captions, while useful, only last a moment before disappearing, and are not specific to the speaker, making them of limited use for a deaf or hard of hearing person trying to follow a multi-person call. And the languages they are available in are limited as well.</p>
<p>As Duchemin explained, it began to seem much more practical to have a separate transcription layer that is not specific to any one service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085271" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085271" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2085271" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg" alt="Illustration of a laptop and phone transcribing audio." width="1024" height="560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg 1163w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2085271" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ava</p></div></p>
<p>Thus Ava&#8217;s new product, a desktop and web app called Closed Captioning, which works with all major meeting services and online content, captioning it with the same on-screen display and making the content accessible via the same account. That includes things like YouTube videos without subtitles, live web broadcasts, and even audio-only content like podcasts, in more than 15 languages.</p>
<p>Individual speakers are labeled, automatically if an app supports it, like Zoom, or by having people in the meeting click a link that attaches their identity to the sound of their voice. (There are questions of privacy and confidentiality here, but they will differ case by case and are secondary to the fundamental capability of a person to participate.)</p>
<p>The transcripts all go to the person&#8217;s Ava app, letting them check through at their leisure or share with the rest of the meeting. That in itself is a hard service to find, Duchemin pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually really complicated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today if you have a meeting with four people, Ava is the only technology where you can have accurate labeling of who said what, and that&#8217;s extremely valuable when you think about enterprise.&#8221; Otherwise, he said, unless someone is taking detailed notes — unlikely, expensive, and time-consuming — meetings tend to end up black boxes.</p>
<p>For such high quality transcription, speech-to-text AI isn&#8217;t good enough, he admitted. It&#8217;s enough to follow a conversation, but &#8220;we&#8217;re talking about professionals and students who are deaf or hard of hearing,&#8221; Duchemin said. &#8220;They need solutions for meetings and classes and in-person, and they aren&#8217;t ready to go full AI. They need someone to clean up the transcript, so we provide that service.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085272" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085272" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2085272" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png" alt="Features of the Ava app." width="1024" height="317" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png 8694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=150,46 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=768,237 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=680,210 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=1536,475 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=2048,633 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2085272" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ava</p></div></p>
<p>Ava Scribe quickly brings in a human trained not in direct transcription but in the correction of the product of speech-to-text algorithms. That way a deaf person attending a meeting or class can follow along live, but also be confident that when they check the transcript an hour later it will be exact, not approximate.</p>
<p>Right now transcription tools are being used as value-adds to existing products and suites, he said — ways to attract or retain customers. They aren&#8217;t beginning with the community of deaf and hard of hearing professionals and designing around their needs, which is what Ava has striven to do.</p>
<p>The explosion in popularity and obvious utility of their platform has led to this $4.5M seed round, as well, led by Initialized Capital and Khosla Ventures.</p>
<p>Duchemin said they expected to double the size of their team with the money, and start really marketing and finding big customers. &#8220;We&#8217;re very specialized, so we need a strong business model to grow,&#8221; he said. A strong, unique product is a good place to start, though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.papercup.com/">Papercup</a>, the U.K.-based AI startup that has developed speech technology that translates people’s voices into other languages and is already being used in the video and television industry, has raised £8 million in funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/localglobe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="localglobe">LocalGlobe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sands Capital Ventures, alongside Sky, GMG Ventures, Entrepreneur First (EF) and BDMI. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/papercup-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="papercup-ai">Papercup <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says the new capital will be used to invest further into machine learning research and to expand its &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; quality control functionality, which is used to improve and customise the quality of its AI-translated videos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Papercup’s existing angel investors include William Tunstall-Pedoe, the founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/sources-say-amazon-acquired-siri-like-evi-app-for-26m-is-a-smartphone-coming/">Evi Technologies</a> &#8212; the company acquired by Amazon to create Alexa &#8212; and Zoubin Ghahramani, former chief scientist and VP of AI at Uber and now part of the Google Brain leadership team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Jesse Shemen and Jiameng Gao while going through EF’s company builder program, Papercup is building out an AI and machine learning-based system that it says is capable of translating a person’s voice and expressiveness into other languages. Unlike a lot of text-to-speech, the startup claims the resulting voice translation is “indistinguishable” from human speech, and, perhaps uniquely, it attempts to retain the characteristics of the original speaker&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>Initially, the tech is being targeted at video producers, including already being used by Sky News, Discovery and YouTube stars Yoga with Adriene, along with DIY content creators. It is pitched as a much more scalable and therefore lower-cost alternative to pure human dubbing.</p>
<p>“Most of the world’s video and audio content is shackled to a single language,” says Papercup co-founder and CEO Shemen. “That includes billions of hours of videos on YouTube, millions of podcast episodes, tens of thousands of classes on Skillshare and Coursera, and thousands of hours of content on Netflix. Almost every content owner is scrambling to go international, but there is yet no simple and cost-effective way to translate content beyond subtitling”.</p>
<p>For “deep pocketed studios,” there is of course the option to employ high-end dubbing via a professional dubbing studio and voice actors, but this is far too expensive for most content owners. And even wealthy studios are often constrained in terms of how many languages they can accommodate.</p>
<p>“That leaves the mid and long tail of content owners &#8212; literally 99% of all content &#8212; stranded and incapable of reaching international audiences beyond subtitling,” says Shemen, which, of course, is where Papercup comes into play. “Our aim is to generate translated voices that sound as close to the original speaker as possible”.</p>
<p>To do that, he says that Papercup will need to tackle four things. First up is creating “natural sounding” voices, i.e. how clear and human-like the synthetic voices sound. The second challenge is retaining emotion and pacing to reflect how the original speaker expressed themselves (think: happy, sad, angry etc.). Third is capturing the uniqueness of someone’s voice (e.g. Morgan Freeman, but in German). Lastly, the resulting translation needs the correct alignment of the audio to the video itself.</p>
<p>Explains Shemen: “We started off by making our voices as human-like and natural sounding as possible, where we’ve made quite a significant leap in terms of quality by honing our technology to the task, and today we have one of the best Spanish speech synthesis systems in production.</p>
<p>“We’re now focusing on better retainment and transfer of the original emotion and expressiveness in the original speaker across languages, and meanwhile figuring out what it is exactly that makes for quality dubbing”.</p>
<p>The next challenge and arguably the toughest nut to crack is “speaker adaptation,” described as capturing the uniqueness of someone’s voice. “This is the last layer of adaptation,” notes the Papercup CEO, “but it was also one of our first breakthroughs in our research. While we have models that can accomplish this, we’re focusing more of our time on emotion and expressiveness”.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Papercup is entirely machine-powered, even if it might be one day. The company also employs a “human-in-the-loop” process to make corrections and adjustments to the translated audio track. This includes correcting for any speech recognition or machine translation errors that come up, making adjustments to the timings of the audio, as well as enforcing emotions (e.g. happy, sad) and changing the speed of the generated voice.</p>
<p>How much human-in-the-loop is required depends on the type of content and priorities of the content owners, i.e. how realistic or perfect they need the resulting video to be. In other words, it isn’t a zero-sum game, as good enough will be more than enough for a swathe of content owners at scale.</p>

<p>Asked about the technology’s beginnings, Shemen says Papercup started with research conducted by co-founder and CTO Jiameng Gao “who is incredibly smart and oddly obsessed with speech processing”. Gao completed two Masters at University of Cambridge (in machine learning and speech language technology) and wrote a thesis on speaker adaptive speech processing. It was at Cambridge that he realised that something like Papercup was possible.</p>
<p>“When we started working together at Entrepreneur First at the end of 2017, we built our initial prototype systems that showed that this technology was even possible despite there being no precedent for it,” says Shemen. “Based on early conversations, the demand was clearly overwhelming for what we were building &#8212; it was just a function of actually building something that could be used in a production environment”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another batch of complaints has been filed with European Union data protection agencies urging enforcement action against the adtech industry’s abuse of Internet users’ information to target ads.</p>
<p>The complaints argue that behavioural ads are both harmful and unlawful.</p>
<p>Earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/">complaints</a> over the same Real-Time Bidding (RTB) programmatic advertising issue were filed across the EU in 2018 and 2019 but have yet to result in any substantive regulatory action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ireland did open a probe into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ad exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">last year</a>. While <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Belgium&#8217;s DPA has been progressing an investigation into a flagship industry tool that&#8217;s used for gathering consents to ad targeting &#8212; making a preliminary finding of non-compliance in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">October</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. But litigation to reach a final verdict on the IAB Europe&#8217;s &#8216;Transparency and Consent&#8217; (TCF) framework won&#8217;t take place until next year.</span></p>
<p>(Related: The UK’s data protection agency is facing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">legal challenge over its failure to act on RTB complaints</a>, despite repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">expressing concern</a> about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">industry’s lawfulness problem</a>.)</p>
<p>Both Google and the IAB continue to deny any problems with their adtech. Last year Google said authorised buyers that use its systems are subject to &#8220;stringent policies and standards&#8221;. While the IAB Europe rejected the Belgium DPA&#8217;s findings &#8212; <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/blog/iab-europe-submits-response-to-preliminary-report-of-the-belgian-data-protection-authority/">saying</a> its preliminary report &#8220;fundamental misunderstand[s]&#8221; the TCF tech.</p>

<p>The latest <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> complaints target how the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rtb-electric-solutions" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rtb-electric-solutions">RTB <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> component of programmatic advertising broadcasts Internet users’ personal data to scores of entities involved in these high speed eyeball auctions &#8212; arguing it runs counter to core security requirements in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as being horrible for people&#8217;s privacy.</p>
<p>A key principle of the GDPR is security by design and default — with the regulation placing legal requirements on personal data handlers to make sure people’s information is properly secured.</p>
<p>The complaints, which target Google and the IAB in their capacity as RTB standard setters, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">have been filed by civil society groups in six European countries &#8212; namely: </span><a href="https://www.apti.ro">Asociatia pentru Tehnologie si Internet</a> (ApTi), Romania; <a href="https://direitosdigitais.pt">D3 &#8211; Defesa dos Direitos Digitais</a>, Portugal; <a href="https://www.gong.hr/en/">GONG</a>, Croatia; <a href="http://ghdfoundation.com">Global Human Dignity Foundation</a>, Malta; <a href="https://www.homodigitalis.gr/en">Homo Digitalis</a>, Greece; and the <a href="https://www.cyi.ac.cy">Institute of Information Cyprus</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;re being coordinated by a consortium led by the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.liberties.eu/en">Civil Liberties Union for Europe</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (Liberties), the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org">ORG</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (Open Rights Group) and the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://en.panoptykon.org">Panoptykon Foundation</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p>“Real-time bidding, which is the bedrock of the online advertising industry, is an abuse of people’s right to privacy,&#8221; said Dr Orsolya Reich, senior advocacy officer at Liberties, in a supporting statement. &#8220;The GDPR has been in place since 2018 and it is there precisely to give people a greater say about what happens to their data online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, more civil society groups are saying enough with this invasive advertising model and are asking data protection authorities to stand up against the harmful and unlawful practices they use.”</p>
<p>The consortium is asking for a joint investigation by their respective national DPAs — and for regulators to join with ongoing adtech investigations in Ireland (into Google’s adtech) and Belgium (into the IAB Europe’s TCF framework).</p>

<p>It’s not clear how far the Irish DPC’s investigation of Google has progressed — but it continues to face criticism for the lack of decisions on cross-border GDPR cases, some 2.5 years after the regulation technically begun being applied.</p>
<p>A mechanism in the GDPR means cross-border cases (basically anything related to mainstream consumer tech) get passed to a lead agency to investigate. However other agencies also remain involved, as interested parties, and must agree with any final decision made.</p>
<p>The system has led to a bottleneck of cases in certain EU locations, such as Ireland, where many tech giants base their European HQ. So the concern is this one-stop-shop mechanism is adding an unworkable level of friction to GDPR investigations &#8212; delaying decisions and enforcement action so much it risks the entire framework.</p>
<p>The Commission has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">acknowledged weakness in GDPR enforcement</a>. Most obviously because it&#8217;s working on a massive package of new digital regulations. Though its strategy for fixing the enforcement problem is less clear as EU Member States look set to remain responsible for the bulk of this additional oversight, just as they&#8217;re responsible for resourcing their own DPAs now. (And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/brave-accuses-european-governments-of-gdpr-resourcing-failure/">yet more complaints</a> have been filed this year accusing European governments of a GDPR resourcing failure.)</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC is slated to issue its first cross-border GDPR decision in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/twitter-could-face-its-first-gdpr-penalty-within-days/">case that relates to a Twitter security breach</a> very shortly. But last year its commissioner, Helen Dixon, suggested it would come with its first such decisions early in 2020 &#8212; so the gap between GDPR expectation and reality is running almost 12 months late at this point.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OQCcwDaOhw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/embed/#?secret=OQCcwDaOhw" data-secret="OQCcwDaOhw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consortium filing the latest RTB complaints writes in a press release that while some of the earlier adtech complaints were referred to lead authorities it has no knowledge of “any meaningful cooperation or joint operations between national authorities and the lead authorities”.</p>
<p>“This suggests that cooperation and consistency mechanisms as envisioned in the GDPR are yet to be implemented fully,” the group adds, calling for a joint investigation into the RTB issue because the technology functions in the same way across borders &#8212; and “produces the same negative effects in all EU member states”, as they put it.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s not clear how extra joint working &#8212; if indeed that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s being called for &#8212; would help to speed up GDPR enforcement. Nor how referring additional complaints to Ireland and Belgium would work to speed up their current investigations.</p>
<p>Most likely, the intent is to keep up pressure on the regulators to act.</p>
<p>Asked about the call for joint working, a Liberties spokesman told us: &#8220;The problem is that Google and IAB are big players, standard-setters in the market, and they affect all Internet users. Given the geographical scope of the issues raised in the complaints, we think it&#8217;s better for supervisory authorities to act in unison, not to be working alone in their corner.  This is why national partners are inviting their national DPAs to refer this complaint to the lead supervisory authorities who are already investigating Google&#8217;s and IAB&#8217;s compliance with the GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in another supporting statement, Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the ORG, added: “These new complaints show that the GDPR is working. Individuals are increasingly aware of their rights, and they demand change. Now, it is up to the authorities to support this process, and make sure these laws are properly and consistently enforced against the widespread abuses of the adtech industry.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the only extant example of enforcement against a tech giant under the updated regulation was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">January 2019</a> decision to fine Google $57M by France&#8217;s CNIL. That investigation was limited to having a national scope, though, rather than being treated as a cross-border case.</p>
<p>Since then Google has shifted its legal base in Europe to Ireland &#8212; so now falls under the lead jurisdiction of the DPC.</p>
<p>This arrangement appears to suit big tech, enabling it to avoid the risk of speedier investigations conducted by single Member State agencies acting faster alone. (So it&#8217;s very interesting to see TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/tiktok-announces-first-data-center-in-europe/">ramping up its business infrastructure </a>and <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2020/1111/1177365-tiktok-ireland-jobs/">headcount in Ireland</a> &#8212; as it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/tiktok-is-being-investigated-by-frances-data-watchdog/">also now on CNIL&#8217;s radar</a>&#8230; )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted earlier, EU lawmakers have conceded GDPR enforcement has been a weakness thus far.</p>
<p>In a review of the two year old regulation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">this summer</a> the Commission highlighted a lack of universally vigorous enforcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Last week</a> the values and transparency commissioner, Vera Jourouv, also raised the problem as she set out the bloc&#8217;s plan to bolster democratic values against a range of online risks, such as algorithmically amplified or microtargeted disinformation and election interference &#8212; acknowledging GDPR alone isn&#8217;t enough to fix myriad intersecting tech-fuelled problems.</p>
<p>“[After the Cambridge Analytica scandal] we said that we are relieved that after GDPR came into force we are protected against this kind of practice — that people have to give consent and be aware of that — but we see that it might be a weak measure only to rely on consent or leave it for the citizens to give consent,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>“Enforcement of privacy rules is not sufficient &#8212; that’s why we are coming in the European Democracy Action Plan with the vision for the next year to come with the rules for political advertising, where we are seriously considering to limit the microtargeting as a method which is used for the promotion of political powers, political parties or political individuals.”</p>
<p>The European Commission is in the progress of drafting an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/">ambitious and interlocking package of digital regulations</a>, that it wants to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">fuel a regional data economy</a> and set <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/europe-eyeing-limits-on-how-big-tech-can-use-data-and-bundle-apps-reports/">firm online rules to engender the necessary trust</a> &#8212; and has said it wants this major digital policymaking effort to serve Europe for decades.</p>
<p>But without effective enforcement of its Internet rulebook it’s not clear how the bloc&#8217;s digital strategy will deliver as intended.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France&#8217;s data protection agency, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cnil" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cnil">CNIL, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has slapped Google and Amazon with fines for dropping tracking cookies without consent.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been hit with a total of €100 million ($120M) for dropping cookies on Google.fr and Amazon €35M (~42M) for doing so on the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.fr domain under the penalty notices issued today.</p>
<p>The regulator carried out investigations of the websites over the past year and found tracking cookies were automatically dropped when a user visited the domains in breach of the country&#8217;s Data Protection Act.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Google&#8217;s case the CNIL has found three consent violations related to dropping non-essential cookies.</p>
<p>&#8220;As this type of cookies cannot be deposited without the user having expressed his consent, the restricted committee considered that the companies had not complied with the requirement provided for by article 82 of the Data Protection Act and the prior collection of the consent before the deposit of non-essential cookies,&#8221; it writes in the <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-sanction-de-60-millions-deuros-lencontre-de-google-llc-et-de-40-millions-deuros-lencontre-de">penalty notice</a> [which we&#8217;ve translated from French].</p>
<p>Amazon was found to have made two violations, per the CNIL <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-sanction-de-35-millions-deuros-lencontre-damazon-europe-core">penalty notice</a>.</p>
<p>CNIL also found that the information about the cookies provided to site visitors was inadequate &#8212; noting that a banner displayed by Google did not provide specific information about the tracking cookies the Google.fr site had already dropped.</p>
<p>Under local French (and European) law, site users should have been clearly informed before the cookies were dropped and asked for their consent.</p>
<p>In Amazon&#8217;s case its French site displayed a banner informing arriving visitors that they agreed to its use of cookies. CNIL said this did not comply with transparency or consent requirements &#8212; since it was not clear to users that the tech giant was using cookies for ad tracking. Nor were users given the opportunity to consent.</p>
<p>The law on tracking cookie consent has been clear in Europe for years. But in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/">October 2019</a> a CJEU ruling further clarified that consent must be obtained prior to storing or accessing non-essential cookies. As we reported at the time sites that failed to ask for consent to track were risking a big fine under EU privacy laws.</p>
<p>Google and Amazon are now finding that out to their cost, it seems.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cEx9bxn4bG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/">Europe&#8217;s top court says active consent is needed for tracking cookies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court says active consent is needed for tracking cookies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/europes-top-court-says-active-consent-is-needed-for-tracking-cookies/embed/#?secret=cEx9bxn4bG" data-secret="cEx9bxn4bG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Amazon and Google for comment on the CNIL&#8217;s action.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Google sent this statement, attributed to a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">People who use Google expect us to respect their privacy, whether they have a Google account or not. We stand by our record of providing upfront information and clear controls, strong internal data governance, secure infrastructure, and above all, helpful products. Today&#8217;s decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn’t account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving. We will continue to engage with the CNIL as we make ongoing improvements to better understand its concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Google&#8217;s case the CNIL also found that when a user selected to deactivate personalized advertising &#8212; via an option that Google&#8217;s cookie notice presented them with &#8212; the mechanism only partially worked, as one advertising cookie remained stored on their machine and continued to process data in clear violation of the consent law.</p>
<p>The CNIL&#8217;s penalty for Google breaks down into a fine of €60M for Google LLC and €40M for Google Ireland Ltd.</p>
<p>It says the size of the fines is justified because of the seriousness of the triple breach of article 82 of the Data Protection Act.</p>
<p>Other factors involved in determining the size of the fine included the reach of Google&#8217;s search engine in France and the fact that its corporate practices affect almost 50M people, as well as the sizeable profits it derives from advertising which are linked to data generated by its tracking cookies.</p>
<p>Per the CNIL&#8217;s investigation, Google stopped automatically dropping the ad cookies on the Google.fr domain after an update in September 2020. However it said a new cookie notice that&#8217;s presenting to arriving users still does not provide adequate information about what the cookies are used for nor inform users they can refuse these non-essential cookies.</p>
<p>Because of this the CNIL has also hit Google with an injunction &#8212; giving it three months to correct the cookie notices so they provide the required information to users or Google is risking further fines of €100,000 per day until the violation stops.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s investigation of Google.fr took place in March 2020, while its checks on Amazon.fr took place between mid December, 2019 and mid May, 2020.</p>
<p>Amazon also updated its local site in September 2020 &#8212; to stop automatically dropping the tracking cookies.</p>
<p>However the CNIL is similarly unhappy with the information it provides to users, finding it does not clearly explain the tracking cookies nor make it plain users can refuse this &#8216;personalized&#8217; advertising, so the ecommerce giant has also been issued with an injunction to make good on the consent notices within three months or face further fines of €100,000 per day.</p>
<p>The top-line penalties are some of the largest tech giants have faced in Europe to date related to the bloc&#8217;s privacy rules. Albeit, the size of the fines still pales in comparison the billions the tech giants rake in globally each year.</p>
<p>The CNIL previously fined Google $57M, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">back in 2019</a> &#8212; also for failing transparency requirements. Though that case was related to complaints filed under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In this instance (for both Google and Amazon) the CNIL points out that cookie consent falls under the EU&#8217;s ePrivacy Directive, which means the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism does not kick in. Which means the French watchdog has legal competence to investigate, rather than needing to refer concerns to a lead EU DPA where each of the companies have their regional legal base.</p>
<p>In Google&#8217;s case that would be Ireland (while Amazon has its European legal base in Luxembourg).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Ireland&#8217;s DPC still hasn&#8217;t issued a single GDPR decision in any of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">scores of open cases relayed to big tech</a> (including into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">various aspects</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">Google&#8217;s business</a>), more than 2.5 years since the GDPR came into application.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the speed of French investigations and decisions continue to impress.</p>
<p>So today&#8217;s cookie fines will likely provide more succour to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">critics of GDPR enforcement</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PHdDXPX4zX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/embed/#?secret=PHdDXPX4zX" data-secret="PHdDXPX4zX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not a like-for-like comparison as the CNIL&#8217;s investigations in these case have been limited in scope (i.e. national), bypassing the administrative complexity attached to GDPR cross-border cases &#8212; which involves some joint working and ultimate agreement between multiple DPAs across the EU.</p>
<p>However, if an older EU directive is shown to be delivering speedy enforcement &#8212; when the &#8216;shiny&#8217;, newer regulation can&#8217;t &#8212; that does raise some major questions for regional lawmakers who have conceded in recent months that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">GDPR enforcement is a weakness</a> of their flagship framework.</p>
<p>Forum shopping, via the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism, is looking like the biggest blocker to EU citizens being able to uphold their much trumpeted fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Returning to the cookie consent issue, the CNIL has made investigating cookie compliance a particular focus &#8212; publishing <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs-la-cnil-publie-des-lignes-directrices-modificatives-et-sa-recommandation">updated guidance</a> for using the tracking tech in October, when it said it would offer a grace period of up to six months to come into compliance.</p>
<p>However the regulator warned it would continue to fully monitor wider compliance issues around cookies and could take action to protect the privacy of Internet users if necessary.</p>
<p>Hence it&#8217;s stepped in with penalties and injunctions for Google and Amazon now.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC also published updated <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2020-04/Guidance%20note%20on%20cookies%20and%20other%20tracking%20technologies.pdf">cookie guidance this year</a>, back in April, saying too that it would give a grace period &#8212; until October &#8212; before it begun taking any enforcement action. But, so far, it hasn&#8217;t made public any such action.</p>
<p>While its first ever GDPR decision in a cross-border case &#8212; against Twitter &#8212; is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/twitter-could-face-its-first-gdpr-penalty-within-days/">expected to land finally this month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise of U.S.-China tensions has accelerated the bifurcation of global technology, with the two superpowers each working on their own tech systems. While the rift might be discouraging cross-border investment and business expansion between the rivals, the countries that are in-between &#8212; like those in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/east-ventures-melisa-irene-on-southeast-asia/">Southeast Asia</a> and Europe &#8212; are still finding opportunities.</p>
<p>Sweden&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dirac" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dirac">Dirac <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is such an example. The 15-year-old firm has been licensing sound optimization technology to mobile, home entertainment, AR/VR, automotive, and other businesses where sounds are critical. The geopolitical complications &#8220;have not impacted&#8221; the company at all, its founder and chief executive Mathias Johansson told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Based in the university city Uppsala of Sweden, Dirac has deep ties to China, offering solutions to the country&#8217;s smartphone leaders from Huawei, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oppo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oppo">Oppo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="xiaomi">Xiaomi, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to Africa-focused Transsion. More than 50% of its revenue come from China today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dirac&#8217;s interest in China stems in part from the founder&#8217;s early fascination with the country. When Johansson visited China for the first time through his PhD program two decades ago, he was impressed by the &#8220;rapid evolution&#8221; in the tech industry there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The audio industry put a lot of manufacturing in China first, but then more and more on development and design. We realized this is a market that&#8217;s absolutely key for the entire consumer electronics ecosystem,&#8221; Johansson said.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur had since been traveling to Asia, especially Japan and China where electronics were flourishing. In 2010, he hired Dirac&#8217;s first China manager Tony Ye, who previously worked for Swedish software firm IAR Systems in Shanghai. At the time, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apples-iphone-4-drives-global-growth-heres-what-it-means-for-a-new-low-cost-iphone-model/">revolutionary iPhone 4</a> was making waves across the world, but Johansson and his team were also bullish about China.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that China is going to be the leader in smartphones eventually. We thought that with Android and with Arm processors [China] is going to be a very different market. So we really went in there and focused on the market. And we thought that [Chinese] would be more hungry, more interested in trying out new things, simply because they were newcomers just like we were pioneers,&#8221; the founder said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turned out to be the right bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the Chinese government has been advocating for technological autonomy, the national efforts are prioritizing strategic areas like 5G and AI. In smaller and less politically charged fields, imported technologies are still seeing demand. These solutions are often cutting-edge and built upon years of research and development, but they are too niched for big corporations to invest the money and time. That is true for certain video enhancement solutions (see TechCrunch&#8217;s profile of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/imint-vidhance-profile/">Imint</a>, also an Uppsala-based company), or advanced sound optimization in the case of Dirac.</p>
<p>Johansson began researching the audio technology behind Dirac some 20 years ago during university, which made it harder for latecomers to catch up, the founder asserted. Dirac fixes audio like how glasses correct vision. Its team would first send out a test signal through the target speaker system, records it with a microphone, generates a digital fingerprint of audio, and measures the acoustic information. It then makes an exact &#8220;mirror universe&#8221; of the distortions created by the system, sends pre-distorted audio back to the speakers and the users will eventually get the distortion-free version of the sound.</p>
<p>The research and development cycle at Dirac is long, but working with Chinese companies has forced the Swedish firm to adapt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It challenged us to come up with new, more efficient ways of doing the same thing and to keep that innovation pace ahead of the competitor, whether it&#8217;s domestic Chinese, or the U.S., or wherever,&#8221; the founder admitted.</p>
<p>Dirac maintains its cashflow by licensing its intellectual property to clients and charges royalty fees per unit of device shipped. It also operates a B2B2C model, whereby the end-user can upgrade the sound system of a device, say, a speaker, by paying a fee, which is then divided between Dirac and its client, i.e. the device maker. Its latest big-name customer is the Chinese electric carmaker BYD, a deal that the company sees as an important step in furthering its automotive ambitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional carmakers are being challenged and the whole ecosystem is changing,&#8221; Johansson observed. &#8220;With software upgrades, cars are becoming something very different. They&#8217;re becoming much more like mobile phones and much more software-centric. The whole entertainment aspect and the audio experience in cars are becoming almost the most important part of the car because the noise is so low, the car is so quiet and you&#8217;re maybe driving a self-driving car. The audio experience you will get from cars will be outstanding in a couple of years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that is improving the way construction and real estate companies in India procure materials and handle logistics for their projects has received the backing of three new investors.</p>
<p>Mumbai-headquartered Infra.Market said on Thursday it has raised $20 million in a Series B financing round. The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/evolvence-india-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="evolvence-india-fund">Evolvence India Fund, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sistema Asia Fund, and Foundamental, while existing investors Accel, Tiger Global, and Nexus also participated in it. The four-year-old startup has raised about $50 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="http://infra.market/">Infra.Market</a> helps small businesses such as manufacturers of paints and cements improve the quality of their production and meet various compliances. The startup adds its load cells to the manufacturing facilities of these small businesses to ensure there is no lapse in quality, and also helps them work with other businesses that can provide them with better raw material and provide guidance on pricing. It also works closely with businesses to ensure that their deliveries are made on time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These improvements, explained co-founder Souvik Sengupta, help small manufacturers land larger clients that have higher expectations from the businesses with which they engage.</p>
<p>“We are bringing a service layer to these small manufacturers, enabling them to grow their business. We don’t own the asset and are creating private label brands,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. Infra.Market today works with over 170 small manufacturers and counts the vast majority of major construction and real estate companies such as giants Larsen &amp; Toubro, Tata Projects and Ashoka Buildcon as its clients. Sengupta said the startup sells to over 400 large clients and 3,000 small retailers.</p>
<p>Sengupta said the startup was on track to hit the ARR (annual recurring revenue) of $100 million before the pandemic, which for at least two months nearly cut its business in half. But the startup has picked up pace again, and is now on track to hit the ARR of $180 million. The startup aims to grow this figure to $300 million by March next year.</p>
<p>Infra.Market is also enabling small manufacturers reach customers outside of India. Some of its clients are in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, and Dubai. Sengupta said Infra.Market will deploy the fresh funds to expand to more markets as well as deepen its penetration in smaller Indian cities and towns. International markets today account for 10% of the revenue Infra.Market clocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an enabler to this sector, Infra.Market has emerged as one of the most disruptive companies through pioneering technological innovation in the procurement and distribution of building materials catering to the infrastructure and construction industry by improving logistics, financing, procurement and project management of large scale projects in key markets across India. The company has very quickly demonstrated remarkable growth backed by a solid business model and deep sector domain knowledge of its founders and management team,&#8221; said Rohit Batra, Partner at Evolvence India, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup, which today runs about half a dozen private label brands, also plans to expand to more categories such as electrical items, Sengupta said.</p>
<p>Sumit Jain, Senior Partner at Sistema Asia Fund, said Infra.Market is increasingly serving as an important institution in the context of India&#8217;s bounce-back in the post-Covid world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Demand for contactless payments and e-commerce has grown in South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is good news for payment service operators, but the market is very fragmented, so adding payment options is a time-consuming process for many merchants. CHAI wants to fix this with an API that enables companies to accept over 20 payment systems. The Seoul-based startup announced today it has raised a $60 million Series B.</p>
<p>The round was led by Hanhwa Investment &amp; Securities, with participation from SoftBank Ventures Asia (the early-stage venture capital arm of SoftBank Group), SK Networks, Aarden Partners and other strategic partners. It brings CHAI’s total funding to $75 million, including a $15 million Series A in February.</p>
<p>Last month, the Bank of Korea, South Korea’s central bank, <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20201103000771">released a report </a>showing that contactless payments increased 17% year-over-year since the start of COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CHAI serves e-commerce companies with an API called I’mport, that allows them to accept payments from over 20 options, including debit and credit cards through local payment gateways, digital wallets, wire transfers, carrier billings and PayPal. It is now used by 2,200 merchants, including Nike Korea and Philip Morris Korea.</p>
<p>CHAI chief executive officer Daniel Shin told TechCrunch that businesses would usually have to integrate each kind of online payment type separately, so I’mport saves its clients a lot of time.</p>
<p>The company also offers its own digital wallet and debit card called the CHAI Card, which launched in June 2019 and now has 2.5 million users, a small number compared with South Korea’s leading digital wallets, which include Samsung Pay, Naver Pay, Kakao Pay and Toss.</p>
<p>&#8220;CHAI is a late comer to Korea’s digital payments market, but we saw a unique opportunity to offer value,&#8221; said Shin. The CHAI Card offers merchants a lower transaction fee than other cards and users typically check its app about 20 times to see new cashback offers and other rewards based on how often they pay with their cards or digital wallet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve digitized the plastic card experience, and this is the first step towards creating a robust online rewards platform,&#8221; Shin added.</p>
<p>In press statement, Hanhwa Investment &amp; Securities director SeungYoung Oh director said, &#8220;I’mport has reduced what once took e-commerce businesses weeks to complete into a simple copy-and-paste task, radically reducing costs. It is a first-of-its-kind business model in Korea, and I have no doubt that CHAI will continue to grow this service into an essential infrastructure of the global fintech landscape.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the largest diagnostics testing companies in the U.S., LabCorp could be a significant competitor to companies like EverlyWell, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/16/everylwell-gains-first-fda-authorization-for-a-standalone-at-home-covid-19-test-sample-collection-kit/">which received approvals for its at-home testing kits in May</a>; MyLab Box, <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2020/12/walmart-partners-with-startup-to-sell-at-home-covid-19-tests/?rf=1">which announced a partnership with Walmart earlier this week to sell COVID-19 test kits with the giant retailer</a>; or LetsGetChecked, which has its own at-home test.</p>
<p>LabCorp was actually the first company to receive approval from the FDA for its test kit, and now the company can sell the product through retail channels without a prescription.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“With the first over-the-counter at-home collection kit ever authorized by the FDA for COVID-19, we are empowering people to learn about their health and make confident decisions,” said Dr. Brian Caveney, chief medical officer and president of LabCorp Diagnostics, in a statement. “With this authorization, we can help more people get tested, reduce the spread of the virus and improve the health of our communities.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty inarguable that anything that reduces the friction consumers face in getting tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a good thing. It&#8217;s also in line with a broader push to increase healthcare access for consumers in an effort to reduce costs.</p>
<p>When customers purchase the COVID-19 test kit, they register the kit on the company&#8217;s website and then follow the instructions given there. Tests results are delivered through a corporate portal and a healthcare provider is available to assist customers who test positive on how to proceed with a course of treatment.</p>
<p>The company said its kit should not be viewed as a substitute for visits to a healthcare professional and is intended for use by adults 18 or older.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the LabCorp PCR test has not been cleared or approved by the FDA and is being authorized under an emergency use authorization.</p>

That figure rises sharply if we included more than 50 million shares that could be added to the mix upon the exercise of vested employee options. The company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation at its IPO price was calculated to be $47 billion.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re separate suits, although the two groups coordinated their investigations. Both suits claim that Facebook has behaved illegally when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, and that it used its monopoly power to suppress competition. The FTC suit also calls for Instagram and WhatsApp to be split off from the company.</p>
<p>In response, Facebook <a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1336764387818950656">tweeted</a>, &#8220;Years after the FTC cleared our acquisitions, the government now wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://arrival.com/">Arrival</a>, the U.K. electric vehicle startup that plans to become a publicly traded company through a merger with special purpose acquisition company CIIG Merger Corp., has picked Charlotte for its North American headquarters.</p>
<p>The company said it will add 150 new employees to support the headquarters and invest about $3 million in office space in the South End neighborhood of Charlotte. Arrival said it will be hiring for a variety of corporate positions, including human resources, marketing, finance and administrative professionals.</p>
<p>Arrival was a secretive electric vehicle startup for nearly five years until January when it announced a $110 million investment from Hyundai and Kia. Over the past year, the company has shared more of its plans and partners, all culminating in its announcement last month to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/"> merge with a SPAC</a>, or shell company, to become a publicly traded company.

<p>Arrival’s aim is to produce electric vehicles that are competitive in price with traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles and lower cost of ownership than other comparable EVs. Arrival says its modular electric “skateboard” platform, which can be used on a range of different vehicle types, along with its use of microfactories set up near major cities are how it will achieve its mission.</p>
<p>Arrival plans to produce commercial electric vehicles, beginning with van and bus models. The plan is to have four vehicles in the market by 2023, Arrival Automotive CEO Mike Ableson has previously said.</p>
<p>Arrival&#8217;s North American headquarters will be located less than 30 miles away from its first U.S. microfactory in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The company employs more than 1,200 people and has five engineering facilities and two microfactories globally.</p>
