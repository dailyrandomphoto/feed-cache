										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap has partnered with ShareChat’s Moj app to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian app as the American social giant looks to accelerate its growth in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>This is the first time Snap has partnered with an Indian firm for its Camera Kit technology, which unlocks a range of augmented reality features, the two companies said. (Snap has partnered with a handful of firms including Triller for Camera Kit collaboration globally.)</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.mohalla.video&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US">Moj</a> creators will be able to use Snap’s AR technology from within the app, while some of the lenses their creators produce will be made available to Snap users, executives with the firms told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wednesday’s move comes amid an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">ongoing fundraise effort by ShareChat</a>, which operates Moj and is a popular social network in India that caters to users in over a dozen local languages, which is in talks with Google, Snap, Twitter and other investors, TechCrunch reported last month.</p>
<p>Ben Schwerin, SVP of Content and Partnerships at Snap, said in an interview that today’s collaboration is the beginning of a relationship between the two firms, but declined to comment on any investment talks.</p>
<p>Schwerin said the collaboration with Moj will enable Snap to expand the reach of its AR technology to more users in India. Snap, which for years struggled to make inroads in India, has seen an impressive growth in the country in recent quarters. Its app had about 80 million monthly active users in India in the month of December (according to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch), up from about 25 million a year ago.</p>
<p>ShareChat has amassed over 160 million monthly active users in India, while its Moj app, which was launched after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">New Delhi banned TikTok in June</a> last year, had about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/indias-sharechat-raises-40-million-says-its-short-video-platform-moj-now-reaches-80-million-users/">80 million users in September last year</a>, according to the startup.</p>
<p>Scores of startups in India are attempting to cash in on TikTok&#8217;s ban in the country. Indian conglomerate Times Internet&#8217;s MX Player has launched MX TakaTak, while news aggregator DailyHunt has also expanded to short-form video with Josh. Their parent firm last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/dailyhunt-and-joshs-parent-firm-raises-over-100-million/">announced a fundraise of over $100 million</a>, two months after Google participated in another over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">$100 million round into the startup</a>.</p>
<p>Global giants are also not shying away from the opportunity. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">launched Instagram Reels in India last year</a>, and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">launched Shorts</a>, which is already garnering over 3.5 billion daily views in India, it said last month.</p>
<p>Moj, which has released 30 Snap-powered lenses for its community at the launch, will develop over 400 lenses in the coming years, some in collaboration with Snapchat Official Lens Creators in India, it said.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be an incredible selection of AR lenses that are customized and localized for Moj’s audience, and we think there’s going to be lots of innovation and usecases that we couldn’t have seen on Snap alone,” said Schwerin.</p>
<p>Gaurav Mishra, SVP of Product at ShareChat, said in an interview the partnership will enable Moj users to engage much more deeply with the community and stand above the crowd. He declined to share the level of resources ShareChat was planning to deploy for the creation of lenses. Both the firms declined to disclose financial terms of the deal.</p>
<p>Hardik Shah, who works at <a href="https://superfan.studio">SuperFan Studio</a>, one of the largest AR creative firms in India, told TechCrunch the proliferation of Snap’s AR tech will improve the quality of lenses and filters most people in India have access to.</p>
<p>“Brands need to realise that ‘What Disney characters are you’ is very 2019 and should be discarded as an idea in 2021. It’s OK not to do an AR Experience than going ahead with outdated and stale production,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.klarna.com">Klarna</a> is turning its mobile app into a banking app in Germany. Customers living there can now open a consumer bank account and get a Visa debit card.</p>
<p>For now, Klarna is launching bank accounts for a limited number of users. The company expects to roll it out more broadly in the coming months.</p>
<p>What you get is a full-fledged bank account with a German IBAN to receive money, set up direct deposits and debits. The debit card works with Google Pay and Apple Pay. You get two free ATM withdrawals per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With today’s launch, Klarna wants to build a financial super app. Klarna started as a payment method for e-commerce websites. It lets you pay for expensive goods over multiple installments. Merchants get paid when the initial transaction occurs, with Klarna transparently managing credit lines for customers.</p>
<p>With the company’s mobile app, you can track your past purchases and your upcoming payments. The app also lets you access a marketplace of stores, track deliveries and set up price-drop notifications.</p>
<p>But you couldn’t get a full overview of your finances with this data. Adding a bank account provides full visibility in everything that lands on your bank account and leaves your bank account.</p>
<p>It could open up some new opportunities for credit lines. For instance, if you pay in store for something really expensive with your Klarna card, you could receive a notification that suggests spreading out your expense over three months.</p>
<p>Klarna also plans to add savings goals and savings accounts. The startup has already launched savings accounts in Sweden. It offers flexible and fixed-term savings accounts.</p>
<p>Klarna has built its own core banking system, which means that it doesn’t rely on a banking-as-a-service partner to manage your bank account. It’ll compete with other digital banks in Germany, such as <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> and <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people who use AI-powered translation tools do so for commonplace, relatively unimportant tasks like understanding a single phrase or quote. Those basic services won&#8217;t do for an enterprise offering technical documents in 15 languages — but <a href="https://www.lengoo.com/">Lengoo&#8217;s</a> custom machine translation models might just do the trick. And with a new $20M B round, they may be able to build a considerable lead.</p>
<p>The translation business is a big one, in the billions, and isn&#8217;t going anywhere. It&#8217;s simply too common a task to need to release a document, piece of software, or live website in multiple languages — perhaps dozens.</p>
<p>These days that work is done by translation agencies, which employ expert speakers to provide translation on demand at a high level of quality. The rise of machine translation as an everyday tool hasn&#8217;t affected them as much as you might think, since the occasional Portuguese user using Google&#8217;s built-in webpage translation on a Korean website is very much a niche case, and things like translating social media posts or individual sentences isn&#8217;t really something you could or would farm out to professionals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In these familiar cases &#8220;good enough&#8221; is the rule, since the bare meaning is all anyone really wants or needs. But if you&#8217;re releasing a product in 10 different markets speaking 10 different languages, it won&#8217;t do to have the instructions, warnings, legal agreements, or technical documentation perfect in one language and merely fine in the other nine.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon launches a Live Translation feature for Echo devices&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazon-launches-a-live-translation-feature-for-echo-devices/embed/#?secret=QNN98ffdcU" data-secret="QNN98ffdcU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lengoo started from a team working on automating that workflow between companies and translators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step to take obviously was automating the translation itself,&#8221; said CEO and founder Christopher Kränzler. &#8220;We&#8217;ll still need humans in the loop for a long time — the goal is to get the models to the level where&#8217;s they&#8217;re actually usable and the human has fewer translations to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>With machine learning capabilities constantly being improved, that&#8217;s not an unrealistic goal at all. Other companies have started down that road — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/deepl-schools-other-online-translators-with-clever-machine-learning/">DeepL</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/lilt-is-building-a-machine-translation-business-with-humans-at-the-core/">Lilt</a>, for instance, which made their cases by showing major improvements over Google and Microsoft frameworks, but never claiming to remove humans from the process.</p>
<p>Lengoo iterates on their work by focusing on speed and specificity — that is, making a language model that integrates all the jargon, stylistic preferences, and formatting requirements of a given client. To do this they make a custom language model by training it not just with the customer&#8217;s own documents and websites, but by continually adding in feedback from the translation process itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have an automated training pipeline for the models,&#8221; said Kränzler. The more people contribute to the correction process, the faster the process gets. Eventually we get to be about three times faster than Google or DeepL.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new client may start with a model customized on a few thousand documents from the last couple years. But whenever the model produces text that needs to be corrected, it remembers that particular correction and integrates it with the rest of its training.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111071" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing how fewer corrections are needed after the AI receives additional feedback." width="450" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png 1587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=282,300 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=768,817 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=639,680 639w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=1444,1536 1444w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lengoo-correction-diagram.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111071" class="wp-caption-text">An exciting bar graph. After 30 iterations, the segments requiring no corrections have doubled, and those requiring few are much increased.</p></div></p>
<p>While the &#8220;quality&#8221; of a translation can be difficult to quantify objectively, in this case there&#8217;s no problem, because working as a human translator&#8217;s tool means there&#8217;s a quality check built right in. How good the translation is can be measured by &#8220;correction distance,&#8221; essentially the amount of changes the human has to make to the model&#8217;s suggested text. Fewer corrections not only means a better translation, but a faster one, meaning quality and speed both have objective metrics.</p>
<p>The improvements have won over customers that were leery of over-automation in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning there was resistance,&#8221; admitted Kränzler. &#8220;People turn to Google Translate for everyday translations, and they see the quality is getting better — they and DeepL have been educating the market, really. People understand now that if you do it right, machine translation works in a professional use case. A big customer may have 30, 40, 50 translators, and they each have their own style&#8230; We can make the point that we&#8217;re faster and cheaper, but also that the quality, in terms of consistency, goes up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although customizing a model with a client&#8217;s data is hardly a unique approach, Lengoo seems to have built a lead over rivals and slower large companies that can&#8217;t improve their products quick enough to keep up. And they intend to solidify that lead by revamping their tech stack.</p>
<p>The issue is that due to relying on more or less traditional machine learning technologies, the crucial translator-AI feedback loop is limited. How quickly the model is updated depends on how much use it gets, but you&#8217;re not going to retrain a large model just to integrate a few hundred more words&#8217; worth of content. It&#8217;s expensive computationally to retrain, so it can only be done sporadically.</p>
<p>But Lengoo plans to build its own, more responsive neural machine translation framework that integrates the various pipelines and processes involved. The result wouldn&#8217;t improve in real time, exactly, but would include the newest information in a much quicker and less involved way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as a segment by segment improvement,&#8221; said applied research lead Ahmad Taie (segments vary in size but generally are logical &#8220;chunks&#8221; of text). &#8220;You translate one segment, and by the next one, you already have the improvements made to the model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making that key product feature better, faster, and easier to implement customer by customer is key to keeping clients on the hook, of course. And while there will likely be intense competition in this space, Kranzler doesn&#8217;t expect it to come from Google or any existing large companies, which tend to pursue an acquire-and-integrate approach rather than an agile development one.</p>

<p>As for the human expert translators, the field won&#8217;t replace them but may extend their effectiveness by, eventually, as much as an order of magnitude, which may shrink the workforce there. But if international markets continue to grow and with them the need for professional translation, they might just keep pace.</p>
<p>The $20M round, led by Inkef Capital will allow Lengoo to make the jump to North American markets as well as additional European ones, and integrate with more enterprise stacks. Existing investors Redalpine, Creathor Ventures, Techstars (out of which program the company originated), and angels Matthias Hilpert and Michael Schmitt all joined in the round, along with new investors Polipo Ventures and Volker Pyrtek.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alexa von Tobel has always felt strongly that too many people are shut out of the stock market. She felt this as a 23-year-old who didn&#8217;t have $5,000 to open a brokerage account. She felt it while building LearnVest, a financial planning startup she launched in 2009 and sold in 2015 to Northwestern Mutual for what she says was ultimately $375 million. In fact, von Tobel &#8212; who two years ago launched her<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/inspired-capital-founded-by-alexa-von-tobel-and-penny-pritzker-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-200-million/"> own venture firm</a> with fellow entrepreneur and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker &#8212;  cares so much about the yawning gap between investors and non-investors that she has written books about how to take control of one&#8217;s money. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, she is also a certified financial planner.)</p>
<p>Little wonder that in late January, for a podcast that von Tobel routinely hosts for Inc., she <a href="https://www.inc.com/alexa-von-tobel/robinhood-continues-its-quest-to-occupy-wall-street.html">interviewed</a> Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev about the company&#8217;s quest to make investing accessible to all. Neither foresaw what would happen days later, when a Reddit community of amateur investors didn&#8217;t try to occupy Wall Street so much as turn it upside down by using Robinhood, in part, to drive up the share price of companies like GameStop and AMC Theatres &#8212; then unwind those positions. As a 21-year-old college student who lost $150,000 over the course of several days told the outlet Vice, &#8220;This whole thing has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5b354/this-whole-thing-has-numbed-me-to-money-gamestop-investors-after-the-crash">numbed me to money</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened? Education, in the view of von Tobel, who says it never became an integrated part of bigger picture. While the GameStop saga has &#8220;brought a lot of new learnings and new things that people have to process and consider,&#8221; paramount among these is the inadequate financial training that Americans receive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want the tools to be democratized, where everyone can get equal access to the financial system,&#8221; said von Tobel in a lively chat with us late last week that you can <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fintech-founder-vc-alexa-von-tobel-on-gamestop-robinhood/id1498270180?i=1000507965151">hear here</a>. &#8220;But I also want equal education, and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re woefully falling behind as a society. It&#8217;s not taught in high schools, colleges, or grad schools. Very few schools even teach the basics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue only grows more important to address each year, she says. People are living longer, and they&#8217;re more responsible than ever for their financial well-being. Meanwhile, because of innovations in fintech, including at Robinhood &#8212; which became wildly popular very quickly precisely because it dispensed with many of the barriers to participating in the stock market &#8212; there is little to keep someone from making lousy decisions with outsize consequences.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s to be done? For starters, she suggests that society begin to place as much emphasis on financial health as physical wellness. &#8220;If you&#8217;re close to having a major health crisis, doctors do a really good job of saying, &#8216;Here&#8217;s all the things that you need to do to protect yourself; here&#8217;s what needs to happen. The same needs to exist in the financial world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will take a number of stakeholders, she believes. One of these is &#8220;platforms &#8211; all of them &#8212; that provide you with [financial] tools and resources, so you can understand the kind of risks you&#8217;re taking on [to the extent] that they can provide it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another, she said, is regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Created in 2010 to safeguard consumers in banking, mortgage, credit card and other financial transactions, the CFPB&#8217;s very constitutionality was called into question by the Trump administration, yet its guidance is sorely needed, suggests von Tobel. (&#8220;Regulation is always a step behind, and that&#8217;s a little bit of what we&#8217;re feeling&#8221; as a society right now.)</p>
<p>Of course, the third and biggest stakeholder of all is the U.S. educational system, says von Tobel, adding that &#8220;you need all three, working in unison&#8221; in order to have real impact.</p>
<p>As for any structural changes in the meantime that von Tobel thinks should happen &#8212; according to CNBC, for example, Robinhood is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/robinhood-lobbying-targets-legislation-that-could-hurt-its-business-model-.html">preparing to lobby against</a> a trading tax that&#8217;s been floated as a way to dampen some of the frenzied activity seen in recent weeks &#8212; she declines to &#8220;pontificate too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, she said she thinks that &#8220;getting a Citadel and everyday Americans on equal footing is where we want to end up,&#8221; and she isn&#8217;t without hope that we&#8217;ll get there.</p>
<p>For example, she thinks crypto is &#8220;here to stay&#8221; and that the infrastructure being created around it will be positive for innovators as well as end users. She&#8217;s also expecting &#8220;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19349/when-will-the-self-driving-wallet-arrive">self-driving wallets</a>&#8221; that pay bills and make investments to become the new normal, and she thinks they could minimize some of the financial distress we might continue to see otherwise.</p>
<p>Considering the chaos of late, the latter almost sounds too easy, but the &#8220;wallet is simply a math equation every day,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If you have so much [money] available free, where should it go? What&#8217;s the most optimal place? It&#8217;s a math equation that updates every single hour, and I do think elements of it will be self-driving based on your goals and what you want to accomplish.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she puts it, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for the day that that actually exists in a way where it automates on its own. I do believe that&#8217;s the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://iroko.ng/">IROKO</a>, a Nigerian-based media company, could file to go public in the next 12 months on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Alternative Investment Market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/jasonnj">Jason Njoku</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/bastian-gotter-733b6340">Bastian Gotter</a> in 2011, IROKO boasts the largest online catalog of Nollywood film content globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/64445/nigeria-nollywood-set-to-hit-the-market-as-iroko-targets-londons-alternative-bourse/">report</a>, the media company will raise between $20 million and $30 million valuing the company at $80 million to $100 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2019, Njoku <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/10/25/irokotv-is-going-public/">hinted</a> that the company was going public either on the London Stock Exchange or a local exchange on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO kept mute about the whole process the following year </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">due to how tumultuous it was for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the company had plans to increase its average revenue per user (ARPU) in Africa for its video-on-demand service, iROKOtv, from $7-8 to $20-25</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through the first four months of the year, it seemed IROKO was set to achieve that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But amid pandemic-induced lockdown fears, consumer discretionary spending reduced in Nigeria and other African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What followed was a 70% drop in subscription numbers, and in May, <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/01/iroko-places-28-of-its-nigerian-staff-on-unpaid-leave/">28% of the company&#8217;s staff</a> went on unpaid leave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But unlike the numbers iROKOtv local markets put up, its international subscribers grew 200% during the lockdown, hitting a $25-30 ARPU range</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more bad news came in August when the CEO announced that the company was laying off 150 people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Njoku cited the naira devaluation, regulatory onslaught by the country&#8217;s broadcast regulator, and a reduced outbound marketing team as reasons behind this decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the company spending $300,000 or more every month on growth, it decided to halt <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/31/why-iroko-done-scaling-africa/">any scaling efforts on the continent</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO instead focused on its international market, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S and the U.K where it has been able to execute a 150% price increase from $25 per year to $60 per year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Njoku said to this decision set the company straight leaving it in a stronger cash position than it had been for years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The costs of pursuing Africa growth is what was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We were so focused on defending Africa and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ended up doing nothing. Zero marketing or anything to drive that,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;We pulled back to focus on where our economics actually makes sense. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our international business </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grew double-digit in 2020 and we expect it to continue this way for the foreseeable future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO isn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> giving up on the African market, instead, think of it in stealth mode. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its dominance over the past eight years as one of the strongest independent SVOD companies in Africa, it is hard not to see the company in pole position to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefit from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any improvements made on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, IROKO makes 80% of its revenue outside Africa and listing on a foreign exchange will help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its efforts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Njoku, the Nigerian Stock Exchange or other local exchanges do not have a history of listing early-stage tech companies; therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the London Stock Exchange makes more sense in the short term</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO is also seeking a market cap of about $100 million, which is small for the primary market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why the media company is choosing to list on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the LSE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A sub-market of the LSE, the AIM </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for small-cap companies. Still, there are plans in the future for IROKO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to progress to the main market as its valuation grows &#8212; something</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.K sports betting company, GVC and online fashion retailer, ASOS have done in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies when going public, tend to raise more money than their private equity days. But it&#8217;s quite different with IROKO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company which secured around $30 million in total with its last priced round (Series E) in January 2016, plans to raise less or a similar amount when going public in 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In what seems like a down round, I asked Njoku why the company isn&#8217;t planning to raise more?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We don&#8217;t need more. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, $10 million to $15 million will be for corporate development; the rest will be secondaries for shareholders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a private company, IROKO&#8217;s valuation was never priced above $70 million so anything in our target range wouldn&#8217;t be a down round at all,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Especially if you consider in that time we exited ROK for close to the total amount of capital we raised for IROKO; we have returned $11 million to early investors and shareholders already</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still have material capital left from the ROK-Canal+ acquisition coming in every 6 months until 2023</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When IROKO sold ROK Studios to Vivendi-owned Canal+ in July 2019, the terms of the deal remained undisclosed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But from the CEO&#8217;s statement, an estimate of the acquisition could be around $30 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s particularly impressive is that the proceeds from the deal likely sustained the company through a rough patch in 2020 and might well do so after its IPO in 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>Joining IROKO in plans to go public within the next two years is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/interswitch-to-revive-its-africa-venture-fund-ceo-confirms/">Interswitch</a>, a Nigerian-based payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">valued at $1 billion</a>. But u<span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike Interswitch, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2002, IROKO has been operating for just 10 years. Within that time, the only internet company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/african-e-commerce-startup-jumias-shares-open-at-14-50-in-nyse-ipo">to have gone public is Jumia</a>, and it did so after seven years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IROKO is expected to achieve this feat in its 11th year of operation and Njoku, who holds an 18% stake in the company, believes it&#8217;s enough time to take the next step</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="etLQFNnicp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">Nigeria’s Interswitch confirms $1B valuation after Visa investment</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we can achieve in private, we can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> achieve as a public company. We will likely open up the IPO to our loyal members too so they can capture the value too, which I am super excited about. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing about IROKO is that we have always been pioneers and we&#8217;re okay being super experimental. I plan to open-source the entire process so any other African company coming behind &#8212; if we&#8217;re successful &#8212; will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefit from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our experience,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said of the journey ahead. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter said on Wednesday it has taken actions on more than 500 accounts and reduced visibility of some hashtags in India to comply with &#8220;several&#8221; orders from the Indian government after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/india-sends-warning-to-twitter-over-lifting-block-on-accounts-and-noncompliance-of-order/">threatened legal action against executives with American social network</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">suspended hundreds of Twitter accounts</a>, several with links to farmers&#8217; protests on agricultural reforms, at the request of New Delhi early last week, but then reversed its decision within hours citing users&#8217; freedom of speech. The company said on Wednesday that it was re-suspending most of those accounts, in some cases, permanently, and preventing certain terms from appearing in the Trends section.</p>
<p>The company said Twitter handles are only being blocked in India and will remain visible outside of the country as it believes orders by the Indian government are inconsistent with local law. It also said that no accounts belonging to news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians were taken down. &#8220;To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law. We informed MeitY [Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology] of our enforcement actions today,&#8221; it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Over the course of the last 10 days, Twitter has been served with several separate blocking orders by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">wrote in a blog post.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Out of these, two were emergency blocking orders that we temporarily complied with but subsequently restored access to the content in a manner that we believe was consistent with Indian law. After we communicated this to MeitY, we were served with a non-compliance notice,&#8221; the San Francisco-headquartered firm added.</p>
<p>Millions of farmers have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farms-protests/tractors-trucks-block-indias-roads-as-farm-protests-widen-idUSKBN2A605V">protesting New Delhi&#8217;s new laws</a> for more than two months. Twitter, which reaches more than 75 million users through its apps in India, has emerged as the single-most important online forum for people seeking to voice their opinion on this subject.</p>
<p>Singer Rihanna, who has more followers on Twitter than any Indian actor or politician, tweeted a CNN news story last week about the protests and asked “why aren’t we talking about this!?” The Indian government maintains that the new laws are aimed at helping farmers and consumers by streamlining the agricultural supply chain. New Delhi also temporarily shut internet services near the protests in and around national capital last month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Several users had also tweeted using the hashtag #modiplanningfarmersgenocide that were aimed at New Delhi&#8217;s agriculture reforms. The company said several accounts and hashtags violated the Twitter Rules, particularly inciting violence, abuse, wishes of harm, and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch that hashtags that were merely supporting farmers or their protests have not been restricted.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">one of its orders to Twitter earlier this month</a>, India had expressed concerns that many users were sharing false and intimidatory statements and provocative messages. During its brief period of compliance with the order last week, Twitter had suspended handles of several high-profile accounts such as The Caravan (a news outlet that conducts investigative journalism), political commentator Sanjukta Basu, activist Hansraj Meena, actor Sushant Singh, Shashi Shekhar Vempati, chief executive of state-run broadcasting agency Prasar Bharti, and at least two politicians with Aam Aadmi Party — Preeti Sharma Menon and Jarnail Singh — that governs the National Capital Territory of Delhi were also blocked.</p>
<p>After Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">lifted the block</a>, New Delhi issued a more serious warning to Twitter and its executives, citing the nation&#8217;s Section 69A, which allows &#8220;punishment with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fines.&#8221; New Delhi said that Twitter cannot &#8220;assume the role of a court and justify non-compliance&#8221; in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to advocate for the right of free expression on behalf of the people we serve and are actively exploring options under Indian law — both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted. We remain committed to safeguarding the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, and strongly believe that the Tweets should flow,&#8221; the company said today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a large win for the Korean startup ecosystem, dating powerhouse Match Group <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/match-group-to-acquire-hyperconnect-301225320.html">announced this afternoon</a> that it would buy social networking company Hyperconnect for a combined cash and stock deal valued at $1.73 billion.</p>
<p>Hyperconnect, which is projected to have $200 million in revenue in 2020 (up 50% from 2019) according to the company, offers two apps — Azar and Hakuna Live — which allow users to connect to each other across language barriers. The two are complementary, with Azar focused on one-to-one video chats and Hakuna Live focused on the online live broadcast market. In their press statement, the companies noted that 75% of Hyperconnect’s revenue originates in Asia.</p>
<p>It’s the largest acquisition to date by Match Group, which also owns the popular dating apps Tinder and Hinge along with many other assorted properties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One theme of the acquisition and Hyperconnect’s story is technology. The company built what it describes as “<a href="https://hyperconnect.com/en/tech/">the first mobile version</a>” of <a href="https://webrtc.org">WebRTC</a>, a now well-developed standard that is designed to offer resilient peer-to-peer connections between users without relying on a company to serve as a middleman server.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r5Psvy0trb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/1123773/">The WebRTC Race Begins Today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The WebRTC Race Begins Today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/1123773/embed/#?secret=r5Psvy0trb" data-secret="r5Psvy0trb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For instance, a video chat between two participants would be transmitted directly between the two of them using WebRTC, without the video being broadcast through Hyperconnect&#8217;s servers. That&#8217;s designed to improve reliability by removing latency while also reducing the cost of bandwidth for the service to Hyperconnect. WebRTC is now a well-deployed open-source standard, with companies <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/webrtc-the-technology-that-powers-google-meet-hangout-facebook-messenger-and-discord-cb926973d786">such as Google using it in products like Google Meet</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its innovative work on WebRTC, Hyperconnect built infrastructure to support two users who speak and text in different languages to interact with each other directly through its apps using real-time translation. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/hyperconnect">In a marketing post on Google Cloud</a>, Hyperconnect is a marquee customer of the cloud service’s speech, real-time translation and messaging APIs.</p>
<p>In the companies’ joint press statement, both sides emphasized R&amp;D and engineering as key wins for the deal. That begs the question then what Match Group is looking to build with its massive new purchase? While the group has largely confined itself to dating, live broadcast and other media verticals may well be in its sights once it acquires the technology from Hyperconnect.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in 2021Q2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://openocean.vc/">OpenOcean</a>, a European VC which has tended to specialise in big data-oriented startups and deep tech, has reach the €92 million ($111.5 million) mark for its third main venture fund, and is aiming for a final close of €130 million by mid-way this year. LPs in the new fund include the European Investment Fund (EIF), Tesi, pension funds, major family offices and Oxford University’s Corpus Christi College.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katya-almasque-vc/?originalSubdomain=uk">Ekaterina Almasque</a> — who has already led investments in IQM (superconducting quantum machines) and <a href="https://jobs.sunrise.io/">Sunrise.io</a> (multi-cloud hyper-converged infrastructure) and is leading the London team and operations for the firm — has been appointed as general partner. Before joining, Almasque was a managing director at Samsung Catalyst Fund in Europe, led investments in Graphcore’s processor for Artificial Intelligence, Mapillary’s layer for rapid mapping and AIMotive’s autonomous driving stack.</p>
<p>The enormous wealth of data in the modern world means the next generation of software is being built at the infrastructure. Thus, the fund said it would invest primarily at the Series A level with initial investments of €3 million to €5 million, across OpenOcean’s principle areas of artificial intelligence, application-driven data infrastructure, intelligent automation and open source.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OpenOcean’s team includes Michael “Monty” Widenius, the “spiritual father” of MariaDB, and one of the original developers of MySQL, the predecessor to MariaDB; Tom Henriksson, who invested in MySQL and MariaDB; as well as Ralf Wahlsten and Patrik Backman.</p>
<p>Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean, commented: “Ekaterina… brings an immense amount of expertise to the team and exemplifies the way we want to support our founders. Fund 2020 is an important step for OpenOcean, with prestigious LPs trusting our approach and our knowledge, and believing in our ability to identify the very best data solutions and infrastructure technologies in Europe.”</p>
<p>Almasque said: “The next five years will be critical for digital infrastructure, as breakthrough technologies are currently being constrained by the capabilities of the stack. Enabling this next level of infrastructure innovation is crucial to realising digitisation projects across the economy and will determine what the internet of the future looks like. We’re excited by the potential of world-leading businesses being built across Europe and are looking forward to supporting the next generation of software leaders.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch she added: “It&#8217;s very rare to find such a VC so deep in the stack which also invested in one of the first unicorns in Europe and really built the open source ecosystem globally. So for me, this was absolutely an interesting team to join. And what OpenOcean was doing since inception in 2011 was very unique among pioneering ecosystems, such as big data analytics… and it remains very pioneering, pushing the frontiers in artificial intelligence and now quantum computing. This is what really attracts me, and I think there is a very, very big future.”</p>
<p>In an interview Henriksson told me: “What we are seeing is that our economy is shifting more and more towards the digital, data-driven economy. It started with few industries, but now we see a larger shift, including new industries like healthcare, like manufacturing.”</p>
<p>Asked about the effects of the pandemic on the sector, he said: “Obviously we see a lot of startups who are plugging into things like the UiPath platform. This is very relevant for the pandemic. Because the companies that had started automating strongly before the pandemic hit… they&#8217;ve actually accelerated and they find benefits for their teams and organisations and actually the people are happier because they have better automation technologies in place. The ones that didn&#8217;t start before [the pandemic hit] they&#8217;re a little behind now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-initial-elements-for-lunar-outpost">announced</a> that SpaceX will take two major parts of the Gateway lunar orbiter that will function as a pit stop for future moon missions. The Power and Propulsion Element and Habitation and Logistics Outpost — which together will form the first usable lunar space station — will go up in 2024 on a Falcon Heavy, with an estimated price tag of $332 million.</p>
<p>The Falcon Heavy, which provides a far larger lift capacity than SpaceX&#8217;s now commonly used Falcon 9, has only had two commercial launches since its successful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bd8lN0gwN0">test launch in early 2018</a> (with Starman and a Tesla Roadster, you may remember). Arabsat-6A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/trifecta-spacex-launches-first-mission-on-falcon-heavy-and-lands-all-three-boosters/">launched in April of 2019</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/spacex-successfully-launches-falcon-heavy-rocket-with-two-flight-proven-booster-cores/">STP-2 a few months later</a>, but since then the Heavy hasn&#8217;t seen any action. (Several missions are planned for the next year, however.)</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s selection of the launch vehicle as the one that will bring these two crucial components to lunar orbit is a huge endorsement, however, and may actually snowball into more work down the line if the agency&#8217;s own Space Launch System continues to be delayed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The PPE and HALO, as the two pieces are called, provide the essentials for a self-sustaining lunar orbital habitat: essentially the pressurized cabin and the power source that keeps it operational and allows maneuvering. So you could say they&#8217;re fundamental.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also big, and can&#8217;t be sent up in 10 different pieces on smaller rockets. But there are precious few heavy launch vehicles available — and it looks like they decided that SpaceX&#8217;s was the best bet, having flown three successful missions already.</p>
<p>This mission is valued at $332 million in launch and related costs, so it&#8217;s a serious investment that will require a lot of collaboration between SpaceX, NASA, Northrop Grumman (which is building the HALO) and Maxar (making the PPE).</p>

Not particularly roomy, but you can&#8217;t beat the view. Image: NASA</p></div></p>
<p>For now launch is set for no earlier than may of 2024, but that date may (and in fact is highly likely to) slip as various delays accrue. The whole Artemis program is experiencing a period of reality alignment, and while new target dates haven&#8217;t been given for all the ambitious plans made during the last four years, few of the old ones have been repeated the way they were as recently as last fall. Nevertheless even a five or six-year plan to return to the moon&#8217;s surface is still quite ambitious, considering — as has become the standard NASA refrain — &#8220;we&#8217;re going there to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely hear more about the new timeline as the agency comes to grips with it itself over the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has upended many aspects of urban life but perhaps the most visible upheaval is to citydwellers&#8217; social lives, with curfews calling time on traditional night life across much of the Western world and social distancing putting a chilly spin on opportunities for getting together with people outside your usual circle. Who knew leaving the house was going to seem like such a mission?</p>
<p>Opportunities to escape the city entirely &#8212; such as by jetting off somewhere &#8212; remain severely limited or even impossible right now, depending on where you live. And for many urbanites COVID-19 may feel as if it&#8217;s turned the advantages of city living on its head, despite lockdowns generally not being as hard-line as they were at times last year and vaccines now (slowly) being rolled out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sharifyapp.com/en/">Sharify</a> is a startup that reckons it can help with the weird flatness of pandemic city living. It&#8217;s a real-time events app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sharify-la-ciudad-está-viva/id1361789529">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.sharifyapplabs.sharify&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>) that wants to bring back a little of the serendipitous joy of urban living by making it easier to discovery things going on around you — maybe even just a few blocks away. To do this it&#8217;s combined real-time event listings with a map view (via the medium of emoji-style icons plus filters) to quickly and cheerfully surround you with stuff that&#8217;s happening in the vicinity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CjcOwQ291U"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/work-trips-are-making-a-5-billion-comeback/">Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/work-trips-are-making-a-5-billion-comeback/embed/#?secret=CjcOwQ291U" data-secret="CjcOwQ291U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though the business idea predates COVID-19, Sharify isn&#8217;t blind to the changes wrought by the pandemic. And the app displays a star icon next to events that are deemed COVID-19 &#8216;safe’ &#8212; a subtle promotion meaning the organizer has measures in place to reduce the risk of contagion, such as controlling venue capacity, providing disinfectant hand gel and ensuring tables/seating are safety spaced. (Which may well be legal requirements for a venue to be open for business, of course.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the app lets users share their own meeting plan with other users &#8212; potentially encouraging a bunch of strangers to meet up to play some music or hang out in the park or whatnot &#8212; so its appropriateness for the pandemic moment in which we find ourselves does depend on how you use it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s open to social swings or roundabouts, you could say. (And limits on when/how clubs and bars can open may well be pushing a socially oriented and app-savvy demographic toward alternative ways (and tools) to mingle with strangers.)</p>
<p>More broadly, Sharify invites users to rethink the concept of travel and trips &#8212; asking them to refocus their attention and energy on discovering entertaining things to do without having to go far or plan far ahead. Because, well, what else can anyone really do right now? Apart from stay at home ofc.</p>
<p>The app does have two &#8216;view&#8217; modes: One for events geared towards locals and/or a dedicated &#8216;tourist&#8217; view to cater to those wanting to do more typical sightseeing &#8212; though content for the latter is obviously thinner on the ground at the moment. (And, well, &#8216;tourism&#8217; as a concept is starting to feel rather quaint and old-fashioned vs properly exploring your own backyard.)</p>
<p>Officially Sharify is launched in Barcelona, Madrid and New York City &#8212; but says it&#8217;s &#8220;expanding quickly&#8221; and touts being &#8220;present&#8221; in 25+ cities around the world (presumably with a lighter events cadence vs those three).</p>
<p>I tested the app in Barcelona and quickly found a bunch of local events that looked interesting &#8212; at least compared to another night of thumbing through the Netflix catalogue &#8212; from a Banksy art exhibition, to a stand up comedy show (in English!), lots of theatre, a bunch of markets, yoga classes and a skateboarding event all going on within, at most, a couple of miles and days from where I&#8217;ve been spending the vast majority of my time for, like, almost a whole entire year.</p>
<p>Just the act of seeing stuff <em>still going on</em> in a city which, frankly, hasn&#8217;t felt very familiar or open for much of anything for close to 12 months was a bit of an eye opener.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2111138,2111139,2111137,2111136"]</p>
<p>After so much time locked down indoors maybe we all need a bit of a nudge/visual reminder that life is still going on &#8212; and socializing is still possible (with appropriate safety measures and distancing) &#8212; beyond the front door and away from the Zoom screen (or any other screen tbh). Even if I&#8217;m not about to sign up for everything I spotted in the app. But feeling like I <em>could</em> is almost exciting enough.</p>
<p>As well as providing key details about each event (when, where, any website etc), Sharify lets you signal an intent to go that&#8217;s visible to other users by &#8216;joining&#8217; an event. It also hosts per event chat where those who have joined are invited to &#8220;talk to people who join the plan&#8221; &#8212; which is another neat little nudge to get users excited about going to a local thing, maybe without their usual friend group in tow.</p>
<p>Sharify isn&#8217;t disclosing how many users it has but it says it has 100,000+ monthly event views (3K+ daily), and 5,000+ events every month. (On Google Play the app has had 10,000+ installs.)</p>
<p>Where users create their own plans to advertise to others it touts an impressively high &#8220;join&#8221; rate of 95%. (Albeit saying you&#8217;re going to something you found via an app isn&#8217;t the same as actually turning up.)</p>
<p>To encourage users to discover and attend others&#8217; events, Sharify displays a smilie face on the map in locations where several people are up for &#8216;sharing plans&#8217; &#8212; listing the number of people theoretically up for joining in stuff around there and nudging you to &#8216;create a plan in this area&#8217; to tap into that potential guest pool.</p>
<p>It also lets you drill down to check out micro profiles of these (public) socially interested locals &#8212; displaying a first name, perhaps a photo and any &#8216;interests&#8217; if they&#8217;ve chosen to select some from its curated lists of culture, hobbies, sports and social activities etc. (Happily there&#8217;s no option to message individual users via their profile so no fear of stupid in-app spam.)</p>
<p>Location-based and social sharing is not new, of course. Indeed, it’s an idea that&#8217;s been around the tech block so many times the sound of a &#8216;real-time events map&#8217; probably triggers a fuzzy feeling of &#8216;haven&#8217;t I seen this before somewhere?’ The deja vu may be real but context is ever shifting, is the point. Or, to put it another way, here and now, in an open-ended pandemic, going about finding something to do probably looks and feels quite a bit different to how you did it, pre-March 2020.</p>
<p>Put simply: Best laid plans are toast. Friends who don&#8217;t live in the same city are likely reachable only on Zoom or by text. And at very least you’re dealing with hard limits on how far you can range for your entertainment in time and space.</p>
<p>Local and/or virtual is the new global, all of a sudden. So Sharify reckons its real-time events map is just the ticket/tonic in this curtailed context &#8212; by cheerfully surrounding you with nearby stuff to do. The 2017-founded startup says it&#8217;s been growing &#8220;despite&#8221; the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stuck at home, and we saw all the Netflix series. Is there any plan near my home for this afternoon? Event agendas simply don&#8217;t work in this user case. That&#8217;s why we built a real-time map,&#8221; says co-founder and CEO Gemma Prenafeta. &#8220;And the problem we will face in some months from now: I&#8217;m not stuck at home anymore. Where do I find new events easily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Sharify is a collaborative platform, we let people share their own events for free, we scrape different event sources such as Google and Tiqets, and we highlight those businesses that want to promote themselves,&#8221; she adds, giving a succinct explainer on how the app populates the map view with stuff to do.</p>
<p>Social maps aren&#8217;t new, of course &#8212; and features like Snap Map, which was added to Snap&#8217;s social network via its acquisition of Zenly, certainly has a bit of overlap (while Sharify&#8217;s smiley octopus logo on a yellow background has more than a little of Snap&#8217;s ghost in look and feel), though Snap Map is more obviously focused on friends&#8217; location and social sharing vs Sharify being about event discovery, first and foremost. (Friends may follow from this real-life socializing, is the suggestion.)</p>
<p>There are also event discovery network startups (like calendar-focused IRL). But, again, with such a glance-friendly map view, Sharify is paying closer attention to immediacy/hyper-local event discovery vs IRL &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/streaming-events-calendar/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2ZAgydUaVguFCdskQ8rbG150y3A">pivoted to helping people surface virtual events</a> as the pandemic shuttered lots of real world events last year and has since focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/">building out its own social network</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Now with over 10M monthly users, IRL turns its events website into a social network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/now-with-over-10m-monthly-users-irl-turns-its-events-website-into-a-social-network/embed/#?secret=gIU6tzq8Mm" data-secret="gIU6tzq8Mm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;immediacy&#8217; factor is key at Sharify, as you can see what&#8217;s happening, in real-time,&#8221; says Prenafeta. &#8220;We say going to a local event is a kind of &#8216;Local Trip&#8217;. Traveling before was about taking flights, now it&#8217;s about taking a Bird or a eCooltra to an event nearby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether mapping real-time events is a standalone business or a feature/tool that could just be added to a dominant platform/social network is perhaps a more pressing question for this fledgling startup. And it&#8217;s notable that tech (and mapping) giant Google added a &#8216;Community Feed&#8217; to Maps late <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-with-its-own-news-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-with-its-own-news-feed/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvMhNyTTXE8I0LwcjFbb4BXX__JQ">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has also had an &#8216;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/events/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612983354970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeY3dtzOSQTWT1x__S1Q5FpMimIw">Events Near Me</a>&#8216; feature on its platform for years. Albeit, anything listed inside its walled garden has to contend with all the baggage Facebook brings with it. So an indie app with a fresh approach should have a chance to attract users who wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead on Facebook (even in a pandemic).</p>
<p>Sharify has certainly come up with a really effortless way to spark a sense of possibility &#8212; to <em>feel</em> like you can cut through the monotony of lockdown life &#8212; just by firing up a super simple overview of stuff going on around you.</p>
<p>It then layers on some more powerful tools that are designed to help you find others to do stuff with, which adds a subtle but maybe deeper hook in these socially distanced times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is still pretty locked down, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s more important than ever to know what&#8217;s open and what isn&#8217;t, close to our house,&#8221; suggests Prenafeta. And, well, it&#8217;s pretty hard to argue with that.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s looking beyond the pandemic too &#8212; back to more normalcy and anticipating helping local businesses announce their reopenings, once that&#8217;s possible. The team is &#8220;currently working on a seed investment round to prepare for the post-pandemic momentum&#8221;, she says.</p>
<p>So far the Barcelona-based startup has raised a pre-seed and an angel round led by IESE Group, per Prenafeta &#8212; with a total of €501,000 (~$600k) invested to date into what has turned out to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/23/location-vs-communication/">contextually fresh twist</a> on the old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/24/die-solomo-die/?_ga=2.181080743.1271714929.1612696774-1757155993.1533833482">SoMoLo</a> trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai Motor Group is back with a new &#8220;walking car&#8221; robot that can use its wheels to roll along a path or stand up and navigate tougher terrain on its legs. This time, the concept is designed to carry cargo and is small enough to be carried by a drone.</p>
<p>The TIGER robot — short for transforming intelligent ground excursion robot — is the first &#8220;uncrewed&#8221; ultimate mobility vehicle (UMV) concept to come out of New Horizons Studio, the Mountain View, California facility that is home to Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s UMV development. Tiger follows in the wheeled-footsteps of Elevate, a larger concept vehicle designed to carry people that the company unveiled in 2019 at the CES tech trade show.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111210" style="width: 1182px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111210" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111210 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg" alt="Hyundai walking elevate robot" width="1172" height="649" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111210" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Hyundai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While concepts don&#8217;t always translate into real products, New Horizons Studio head John Suh told TechCrunch that his aim is to bring Tiger to life &#8220;as soon as possible,&#8221; adding that it would likely be a five-year process.</p>
<p>Suh said the team will spend the next two years focused on solving some core technical problems to establish a baseline design. In 2023 and 2024, the team will get to the beta-product stage and advanced testing will begin before finally becoming a product customers can buy.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s version of the Tiger is based on a modular platform architecture, just like its larger cousin. The robot has a leg and wheel locomotion system, 360-degree directional control, a storage bay that can carry goods and a range of sensors for remote observation. It&#8217;s also designed to connect to a drone, which can charge the robot while flying it to its destination.</p>
<p>The Tiger has two modes that are deployed depending on the terrain. On smoother, less complex surfaces, the robot&#8217;s legs retract and the vehicle uses all four wheels to move. If the vehicle gets stuck or faces an obstacle like a small wall, berm or log, it can stand up, lock the wheels and then walk.</p>
<p>This is the first version of Tiger — known as X-1 for experimental — suggesting New Horizons will be bringing out more variants in the future. This one was created in partnership with engineering design software company Autodesk and concept design firm Sundberg-Ferar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What, you are no doubt asking, is a worm a blob? Well, it’s a blob of worms, obviously. More specifically, it’s a blob of California blackworms. It’s not a flock, nor a swam nor a school. It’s a big, undulating mass of a Lumbriculus variegatus tangled up, but somehow moving as one.</p>
<p>Roboticists, of course, have a long, storied history of drawing inspiration from nature. This time out, a team <a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/collective-worm-and-robot-blobs-protect-individuals-swarm-together?ta=home">at Georgia Tech</a> studied the aforementioned worm blob in hopes of learning gaining insight into its unusual form of locomotion. The researchers believe they can apply some of the learnings to rethink the way robots move.</p>
<p>The team published its findings in an academic journal earlier this month. According to the research, the blobs &#8212; which range from 10 to 50,000 individual organisms &#8212; are a kind of survival mechanism to adapt to things like changing temperatures. A few individuals are capable of moving the larger group, with around two or three being required to move a group of five.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/510314087" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The researchers set up a series of six 3D-printed robots with two arms and two light sensors a piece. Mesh and pins on the arms allowed the robots to become entangled with one another.</p>
<p>“Depending on the intensity, the robots try to move away from the light,” researcher Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin said in a release tied to the news. While there was no direct communication between the robots, they effectively operated as a group. “They generate emergent behavior that is similar to what we saw in the worms.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111163" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111163" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smarticle_2917.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Georgia Tech</p></div></p>
<p>The scientists think that sort of collective action can be applied to make individual robots more collaborative and cohesive units. “Often people want to make robot swarms do specific things, but they tend to be operating in pristine environments with simple situations,” Professor Daniel Goldman says of the research. “With these blobs, the whole point is that they work only because of physical interaction among the individuals. That’s an interesting factor to bring into robotics.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have each elevated people who ran their cloud divisions to the CEO role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Amazon announced last week that founder and CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Jeff Bezos planned to step back</a> from overseeing operations and shift into an executive chairman role, it also revealed that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/"> AWS CEO Andy Jassy</a>, head of the company&#8217;s profitable cloud division, would replace him.</p>
<p>As Bessemer partner Byron Deeter <a href="https://twitter.com/bdeeter/status/1356806032836628483?s=20">pointed out on Twitter</a>, Jassy&#8217;s promotion was similar to Satya Nadella&#8217;s ascent at Microsoft: in 2014, he moved from executive VP in charge of Azure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/">to the chief exec&#8217;s office</a>. Similarly, Arvind Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">who was promoted to replace Ginni Rometti</a> as IBM CEO last year, also was formerly head of the company&#8217;s cloud business.</p>
<p>Could Nadella&#8217;s successful rise serve as a blueprint for Amazon as it makes a similar transition? While there are major differences in the missions of these companies, it&#8217;s inevitable that we will compare these two executives based on their former jobs. It&#8217;s true that they have an awful lot in common, but there are some stark differences, too.</p>
<h2>Replacing a legend</h2>
<p>For starters, Jassy is taking over for someone who founded one of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations. Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer, who had taken over for the company&#8217;s face, Bill Gates. Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says this notable difference could have a huge impact for Jassy with his founder boss still looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of similarity in the two situations, but Satya was a little removed from the founder Gates. Bezos will always hover and be there, whereas Gates (and Ballmer) had retired for good. [ … ] It was clear [they] would not be coming back. [ … ] For Jassy, the owner could [conceivably] come back anytime,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>

<p>But Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research, says it&#8217;s not a coincidence that both leaders were plucked from the cloud divisions of their respective companies, even if it was seven years apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;In both cases, these hyperscale business units of Microsoft and Amazon were the fastest-growing and best-performing units of the companies. [ … ] In both cases, cloud infrastructure was seen as a platform on top of which and around which other cloud offerings could be developed,&#8221; Bartels said. The companies both believe that the leaders of these two growth engines were best suited to lead the company into the future.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://matefertility.com/">Mate Fertility</a>, the new Los Angeles startup launching today with $2.8 million in financing, has a mission to create a more inclusive network of family planning services for people struggling with the high cost and low availability of fertility clinics around the country.</p>
<p>Founded by serial entrepreneur Oliver Bogner and his brother Gabriel, Mate was born from both brothers&#8217; struggles with trying to start a family. For Oliver, that was when he and his partner were looking at IVF as a way to screen for the BRCA1 gene from her embryos after she found out that she was a carrier. Meanwhile, Gabriel, an IVF baby who is a member of the LGBTQ community, felt that the services for family planning weren&#8217;t always accepting of the gay community.</p>
<p>&#8220;IVF<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and surrogacy were the only options for me to have kids,&#8221; the younger Bogner said. &#8220;And the queer community has been locked out of these services. It became my mission to democratize healthcare for my community.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once Oliver started doing research into the market and discovered that there were only 460 fertility clinics in the U.S. and that over 80% were concentrated in five major metropolitan areas, he knew there was an opportunity for a new business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111177" class="wp-caption-text">Mate Fertility co-founders Gabriel and Oliver Bogner. Image Credit: Mate Fertility</p></div></p>
<p>The Bogner brothers enlisted famed reproductive endocrinologist Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, who trained under the British doctors that pioneered In Vitro Fertilization, to come on board and together the three men launched Mate Fertility.</p>
<p>The co-founders have enlisted an impressive array of financiers to back their business, boasting an investor base that includes Andy Dunn, the founder of Bonobos; Peter Pham, the co-founder of the LA-based consumer-focused company incubator, Science; Patrick Schwarzenegger; Brian Schwartz; the investors behind Roman, Allbirds and Caspar, Rosecliff Ventures; Pure Imagination Brands; Mana Ventures; and Maschmeyer Group Ventures.</p>
<p>Mate is launching first in Oklahoma City, where two legacy providers are charging anywhere from 10% to 15% above the national average for family planning services. &#8220;We&#8217;re going in at anywhere from 50% to 60% lower costs than they are,&#8221; said Oliver Bogner.</p>
<p>The company said it would offer egg freezing services for as low as $5,000 and IVF for $9,400*, while the national average for IVF cycle costs ranges from $15,000 to $18,000, including medication.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re still making healthy margins that allow us to operate the business. It’s not a matter of these procedures costing more. These 460 clinics are allowed to radically mark up the process,&#8221; said the elder Bogner. &#8220;One of these clinics is making approximately 1,000% profit margin on every procedure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Given the fact that the company estimates roughly 18% of the U.S. population will face some fertility issue, the need for more clinics &#8212; setting aside the lower costs &#8212; would be enormous.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need 3,000 clinics to properly serve our population; today we have 460. There’s a huge gap in care,&#8221; said Bogner. </span></p>
<p>The company is working with the architects behind Dry Bar, Heitler Houstoun, to design its clinics in an effort to popularize and destigmatize the services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were really intrigued by Oliver and Gabe. In terms of what the biggest risks are… you’re not playing around. You’re not creating software, you’re creating life,&#8221; said Adam Struck, the founder of Mate Fertility&#8217;s lead investment firm, Struck Capital. &#8220;The ultimate KPI which is success rate for our patients is top tier. There’s a lot that Mate is doing to ensure that some of the best medical personnel in the world are part of the Mate mission.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Mate Fertility offers modern EHR platforms, an e-pharmacy, proven protocols, payment assistance and digital patient and provider portals for services that include IVF, genetic screening, egg freezing, surrogacy and LGBTQ family building treatments, the company said.</p>
<p>Its first locations will be clinics in Oklahoma City, Anchorage, Alaska; Bakersfield, California; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>*An earlier version of this story cited the company&#8217;s IVF price as $8,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Although the popular audio chat platform <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> today includes a way to share your upcoming hangouts and events across social media, the resulting link that displays is fairly boring. A new link-sharing tool called <a href="https://clublink.to/">ClubLink</a> can help. The tool allows hosts to better promote their events by offering a more customized social media preview featuring a photo that includes the room name, who&#8217;s attending, the date and time (using the host&#8217;s time zone) and even profile icons of the hosts themselves.</p>
<p>The tool was built by two Germany-based colleagues, online marketer <a href="https://twitter.com/Jens_Polo">Jens Polomski</a> and coder and digital marketer, <a href="https://twitter.com/spekulatius1984">Peter Thaleikis.</a></p>
<p>Polomski says he came up with the idea last month because he kept seeing Clubhouse links shared on Twitter and thought they just didn&#8217;t look that good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I noticed many people share &#8212; especially on Twitter &#8212; because Clubhouse has this built-in sharing feature,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But the preview image is not well-optimized and lacks any relevant information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polomski reached out to Thaleikis and convinced him to help build a better version.</p>
<p>Their resulting <a href="https://clublink.to/">ClubLink</a> tool is simple to use. You just paste in your Clubhouse event link on the ClubLink website, and it automatically generates the ClubLink you can use. It&#8217;s a similar process as to how URL shorteners like tinyurl.com work, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111124" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111124" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111124" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg 2186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1120 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1493 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-5.26.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111124" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClubLink</p></div></p>
<p>In ClubLink&#8217;s case, though, it&#8217;s doing a bit more than just returning a shorter URL. The tool visits the Clubhouse link provided and takes a screenshot to help create the image &#8212; but it&#8217;s not scraping data from Clubhouse, Polomski says. The tool also renames the image file it creates to include the host&#8217;s name for better discoverability and, perhaps, for better search engine optimization in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, the SEO aspects of the ClubLink URLs were considered when the tool was built, given its creators have digital marketing backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking care that the technical SEO background from the links are as good as possible &#8212; and that&#8217;s something Clubhouse, right now, didn&#8217;t do,&#8221; notes Polomski. However, he notes that it&#8217;s too soon to tell how well those efforts have paid off, as the first ClubLink URLs were just launched last week and only a few have been indexed by Google so far.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve created the link on the ClubLink website, you&#8217;re directed to a page where you have the option to immediately share it out to Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Being able to publicize your rooms in advance is a important way to build a following on the audio-based social network, so likely many hosts will begin to put this new tool to use in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one example of a ClubLink in action:</p>

<p>Of course, sharing a link while you&#8217;re in a room is useful too &#8212; especially if you&#8217;ve landed in a great room you think others should know about. Clubhouse, in its most recent update, noted that you&#8217;re now able to click the &#8220;+&#8221; sign while in a room to get a link that you can post to social media. Unfortunately, these &#8220;room&#8221; links don&#8217;t work yet in the ClubLink tool, but the team said they&#8217;re already discussing a solution for that.</p>
<p>ClubLink is one of now several small tools that&#8217;s popped up in recent days to offer expanded functionality and new features for Clubhouse power users.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also come across the Clubhouse Bio Creator at <a href="https://clubhousebio.xyz/">clubhousebio.xyz</a>, which helps people perfect their profile bio on the desktop, then copy it over to Clubhouse on their phone. Other popular tools help users make their profile picture stand out, like <a href="https://www.clubhouseglow.com/">Clubhouse Glow</a>, <a href="https://avatar.lvwzhen.com/">Clubhouse Avatar Maker</a> and <a href="https://www.thriveepic.com/clubhouse">Thriveepic</a>&#8216;s Canva template.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Last year, in the midst of a particularly spiky U.S. presidential election campaign, a startup called <a href="http://sentropy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentropy</a> emerged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/sentropy-emerges-from-stealth-with-an-ai-platform-to-tackle-online-abuse-backed-by-13m-from-initialized-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from stealth with an AI-based platform</a> aimed at social media and other companies that corralled people together for online conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy had built a set of algorithms, using natural language processing and machine learning, to help these platforms detect when abusive language, harassing tendencies and other harmful content was coming around the bend, and to act on those situations before they became an issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, the startup is unveiling a new product, now aimed at consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Using the same technology that it originally built for its enterprise platform, <a href="https://protect.sentropy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentropy Protect</a> is a free consumer product that detects harmful content on a person&#8217;s social media feed and, by way of a dashboard, lets a person have better control over how that content and the people producing it are handled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Starting initially with Twitter, the plan is to add more social feeds over time, based initially on which services provide APIs to let Sentropy integrate with them (not all do.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy CEO John Redgrave said the consumer product launch is not a pivot but an expansion of what the company is building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea is that Sentropy will continue to work with enterprise customers &#8212; its two products in that department are called <span class="il">Sentropy</span> Detect, which provides API-based access to its abuse detection technologies; and <span class="il">Sentropy</span> Defend, a browser-based interface that enables end-to-end moderation workflows for moderators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But at the same time, the Protect consumer product will give people an added option &#8212; whether or not Sentropy is being used by a particular platform &#8212; to take the reins and have more hands-on control over their harassment graph, as it were.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We always had deep conviction of going after the enterprise as a start, but Sentropy is about more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cyber safety has to have both enterprise and consumer components.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s refreshing to hear about startups building services that potentially affect millions of people also being cognizant of how individuals themselves want to keep an element of self-determination in the equation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your choice if you use service X or not,&#8221; but a grasp of the concept that when someone chooses to use a service, especially a popular one, there should be and can be more than just a hope that the platform will always be looking out for that user&#8217;s best interests, by providing tools to help the user do that, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And it&#8217;s not a problem that is going away, and that goes not just for the hottest platforms today, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continuing to look for ways to handle complex content</a> &#8212; but also on emerging platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The recent popularity of Clubhouse, for example, highlights not just new frontiers in social platforms, but how, for example, those new models &#8212; with Clubhouse based on &#8220;rooms&#8221; for conversations and a reliance on audio rather than written text for interactions &#8212; are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/as-tech-darling-clubhouse-grows-so-does-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handling issues of harassment and abuse</a>. Some striking examples so far point to the problem being one that definitely needs addressing before it grows any bigger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protect is free to use today, and Redgrave said that Sentropy is still working on deciding how and if it will charge for it. One likely scenario will be that Protect might come in freemium tiers: a free and limited product for individuals with &#8220;pro&#8221; services featuring enhanced tools, and perhaps a tier for companies who are managing accounts on behalf of one or several high-profile individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, services like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and many others have made a big point over the years &#8212; and especially recently &#8212; to put in more rules, moderators and automated algorithms to help identify and stop abusive content in its tracks, and to help users report and stop content before it gets to them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But if you are one of the people who gets targeted regularly, or even occasionally, you know that this is often not enough. Sentropy Protect seems to be built with that mindset in mind, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Indeed, Redgrave said that even though the company had consumers on its roadmap all along, its strategy was accelerated after the launch of its enterprise product last year in June. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We started getting pinged by people saying, &#8216;I get abused online. How can I get access to your technology?'&#8221; He recalled that the company realized that the problem was at once bigger and more granular than Sentropy could fix simply by working its way through a list of companies, hoping to win them over as customers, and then successfully integrating its product.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We had a hard decision to make then,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;Do we spend 100% of our time focused on enterprises, or do we take a portion of our team and start to build out something for consumers, too?&#8221; It decided to take the latter route.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the enterprise side, Sentropy is continuing to work with social networks and other kinds of companies that host interactions between people &#8212; for example, message boards connected to gaming experiences or dating apps. It&#8217;s not publicly disclosing any customer names at the moment, but Redgrave describes them as primarily smaller, fast-growing businesses, as opposed to larger and more legacy platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentropy&#8217;s VP of product, Dev Bala &#8212; who has previously been an academic, and also worked at Facebook, Google and Microsoft &#8212; explained that bigger, legacy platforms are not outside of Sentropy&#8217;s remit. But more often than not, they are working on bigger trust and safety strategies and have small armies of engineers in-house working on building products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While larger social networks do bring in third-party technology for certain aspects of their services, those deals will typically take longer to close, even in urgent cases such as around working with online abuse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I think abuse and harassment are rapidly evolving to be an existential challenge for the likes of Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and the rest,&#8221; Bala said. &#8220;These companies will have a 10,000 person organization thinking <em>just</em> about trust and safety, and the world is seeing the ills of not doing that. What&#8217;s not as obvious to people on the outside is that they are also taking a portfolio approach, with armies of moderators and a portfolio of technology. Not all is built in-house.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe there is value from Sentropy for these bigger guys but also know there are a lot of optics around companies using products like ours. So we see the opportunities of going earlier, in cases where the company in question is not a Facebook, and having a less sophisticated approach.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a sign of the changing tides and sentiment in the market. It seems that the tackling of abuse and content is starting to get taken seriously as a business concept. And so Sentropy is not the only company tackling this opportunity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two other startups &#8212; one called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum Labs</a>, and another called <a href="https://l1ght.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">L1ght</a> — have also built a set of AI-based tools aimed at various platforms where conversations are happening to help those platforms detect and better moderate instances of toxicity, harassment and abuse.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="X9piSctN3D"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/">Spectrum Labs raises $10M for its AI-based platform to combat online toxicity</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spectrum Labs raises $10M for its AI-based platform to combat online toxicity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/embed/#?secret=X9piSctN3D" data-secret="X9piSctN3D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">Another, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block Party</a>, is also looking to work across different social platforms to give users more control over how toxicity touches them, and has, like Sentropy, focused first on Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Protect, after content is detected and flagged, users can set up wider, permanent blocks against specific users (who can also be muted through Protect) or themes, manage filtered words, and monitor content that gets automatically flagged for being potentially abusive, in case you want to override the flags and create &#8220;trusted&#8221; users. Tweets get labelled when they are snagged by Sentropy by the type of abuse (for example, threat of physical violence, sexual aggression or identity attacks).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since it&#8217;s based on a machine-learning platform, Sentropy then takes all of those signals, including the tweets that have been flagged and uses them to teach Protect to identify future content along those same lines. The platform is also monitoring chatter on other platforms all the time, and that too feeds into what it looks for and moderates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;re familiar with Twitter&#8217;s own abuse protection, you&#8217;ll know that all this takes the situation several steps further than the controls Twitter itself provides.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">This is still a version one though. Right now, you don&#8217;t see your full timeline through Protect, so essentially it means that you toggle between Protect and whatever Twitter client you are using. Some might find that onerous, although on the other hand Bala noted that a sign of Sentropy&#8217;s success is that people will actually let it work in the background and you won&#8217;t feel the need to constantly check in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Redgrave also noted that the service is still exploring how to add in other features, such as the ability to also filter direct messages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audi revealed Tuesday the 2022 e-tron Quattro GT and its higher-performing sibling the RS e-tron GT — flagships of the German automaker&#8217;s growing electric vehicle portfolio and its first departure from the crossovers and SUVs that have so far dominated the lineup.</p>
<p>The Audi e-tron GT and RS are the third and fourth all-electric vehicles in the company&#8217;s U.S. portfolio, following the 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/the-audi-e-tron-suv-is-an-electric-shot-at-tesla/">e-tron SUV</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/audis-next-all-electric-vehicle-the-e-tron-sportback-is-a-coupe-suv/">e-tron Sportback</a> that debuted in 2019. The Audi Q4 e-tron — another SUV — will be the automaker&#8217;s fifth electric vehicle. All of these e-tron models are part of Audi&#8217;s plan to launch more than 30 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;This car is a new, very progressive interpretation of the classical GT,&#8221; <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Marc Lichte, head of Audi design, said in Tuesday&#8217;s presentation.</span> &#8220;That means proportions like a super sports car, and the usability of a real four-seater. And that&#8217;s something completely new.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111035" style="width: 4971px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111035" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111035 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg" alt="audi gt" width="4961" height="3310" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audi-gt.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4961px) 100vw, 4961px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The e-tron GT, which goes into production this spring and will hit the U.S. market this summer, packs in performance and luxury in its sporty package. The base e-tron GT has two motors that produce the equivalent of 469 horsepower — or 522 hp with &#8220;overboost&#8221; — and can travel an estimated 238 miles on the 93.4-kilowatt battery. Under the European WLTP standard, the e-tron GT range is 298 miles.</p>
<p>The RS e-tron has the same front motor as the entry-level GT, but has a more powerful rear motor. Together, the motors can produce 590 horsepower and up to 637 horsepower with overboost. As a result, the RS e-tron GT can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.1 seconds and has a 155 mph top track speed, the company said. The RS has an estimated EPA range of 232 miles.</p>
<p>The company has yet to receive an official EPA estimate for either variant.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The vehicles also have an 800-volt electrical architecture — the same that is in the Porsche Taycan. That architecture allows the e-tron GT, like the Taycan, to replenish its battery from 5% to 80% in 22.5 minutes, one of the quickest charging rates in the industry. </span></p>
<p>The e-tron GT shares more than just the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">800-volt electrical architecture with Porsche. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Audi and Porsche, which are both </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">VW Group companies, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">co-developed the e-tron GT and the Taycan. The two vehicles also have the same chassis and J1 EV battery platform. </span></p>
<p>Inside, the e-tron GT comes standard with a 12.3-inch Audi virtual cockpit digital instrument cluster and a central 10.1-inch touchscreen, where drivers can control music, navigation and other controls as well as electric vehicle-specific features such as searching for charging stations. Owners can opt for an upgrade and add a head-up display as well.</p>

<p>The vehicle also comes standard in a leather-free interior featuring recycled materials, including an artificial suede called Dinamica, although a Nappa leather option is also available as an upgrade.</p>
<p>All of this performance and luxury comes at a price. The base model of the e-tron GT quattro starts at $99,900, followed by a higher trim level priced at $107,100. The RS e-tron GT starts at $139,900. Those prices push even higher for those that opt for the additional features, notably the company&#8217;s Matrix LED headlights, which are only available in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aerion has been working on ushering in a new era of commercial supersonic flight for nearly a decade now, and the company just revealed that it has signed a new partnership with NASA to put that experience to use in the pursuit of supersonic point-to-point travel &#8212; the technical name for putting to use the kind of high-speed flight typically associated with space launches for helping people move very quickly from one place on Earth to another.</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes via the Space Act Agreement, which basically allows NASA to enlist the aid of private companies to help it achieve its various goals. NASA has been developing high-Mach, supersonic aircraft technologies for some time now, in particular through its arrangement with Lockheed Martin to build and fly the X-59 QueSST, a demonstrator aircraft that will show how supersonic craft can also operate relatively quietly, with so-called &#8220;low-boom&#8221; capabilities that avoid the loud sonic booms produced by most supersonic vehicles when they break the sound barrier.</p>
<p>NASA announced a similar partnership under the Space Act Agreement with Virgin Galactic last year, with the goal of helping the agency develop technologies that will assist in the eventual deployment of sustainable supersonic commercial flight. Aerion&#8217;s team-up with the agency will focus specifically on studying commercial flight capabilities in speeds ranging between Mach 3 and Mach 5, with a focus on propulsion and thermal management systems, power generation and technologies for use in the passenger and crew cabins.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Aerion&#8217;s own high-speed commercial aviation efforts are currently on track to see its AS2 private jet for business customers enter production in 2023, which will set the stage for its AS3 commercial supersonic passenger aircraft to follow after that.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t Aerion&#8217;s first team-up with NASA: The two have collaborated twice previously on similar projects, with the first collaboration begun way back in 2012. Now that Aerion&#8217;s closer to actual production, it&#8217;s likely that both partners will gain a lot toward their mutual goals of helping the U.S. develop commercially viable and sustainable supersonic passenger flight technologies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a popular misconception that the cryptocurrency industry is a realm of rogue tech-bro cowboys. But the reality is many of the most ambitious entrepreneurs in fintech are betting big on institutional bitcoin adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the case with Lebanese-American venture capitalist Soona Amhaz of Volt Capital, whom </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/soona-amhaz/?sh=d61d1ae1bd2f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently listed as one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley. She discovered bitcoin through Reddit, back when she was an engineering student at the University of Michigan. Now her firm has invested in 11 crypto startups and is working alongside institutional players like TD Ameritrade, Cumberland and CMT Digital as part of the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chicagos-trading-firms-look-to-defi-with-new-alliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago DeFi Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CDA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where institutions are at now is they&#8217;re looking to back quality founders in the space early on. They&#8217;re looking to be market makers for a lot of these [crypto] projects, and they&#8217;re looking to help with integrations and partnerships between decentralized finance [DeFi] projects and more established financial firms,” Amhaz said. “They see where the puck is going and the smart ones are getting ahead of the curve.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to “DeFi,” Amhaz said the term includes bitcoin and the variety of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain-based systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gaining popularity among day traders during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific DeFi projects that are gaining more traction now include automated market makers (AMMs), stablecoins and platforms for decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation, lending and derivatives,” Amhaz said. “Recent DeFi projects simply offer more avenues to use bitcoin as a productive asset, not just a reserve asset.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, most institutions have preferred indirect exposure to cryptocurrency. Goldman Sachs alum </span><a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/juthica-chou-on-the-first-physically-settled-bitcoin-futures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juthica Chou</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who co-founded the derivatives exchange LedgerX back in 2013, pioneered the physically settled bitcoin futures that are now mainstay offerings among firms like </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-goes-live-with-options-cash-settled-futures-products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakkt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/bitcoin/cme-bitcoin-futures-frequently-asked-questions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CME Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Futures contracts and bitcoin options offer a way for institutions to bet on the price of bitcoin without actually owning bitcoin directly. A cash-settled product means the buyer is paid in dollars, such as getting $10,000 when the option to buy at $10,000 expires, instead of getting paid in bitcoin. Rumor has it the asset management giant</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/54787/blockrock-to-start-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures-trading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BlackRock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will soon become the next player offering bitcoin futures products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, many institutions are willing to forgo some profits in exchange for lower risk. One of the most popular institutional product providers, </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1588489/000156459021001769/gbtc-8k_20210115.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reportedly saw $1.2 billion in fresh investor funds in January 2021. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/embed/#?secret=NbRkg4Rlf4" data-secret="NbRkg4Rlf4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m still bullish on options and derivatives,” Chou said, adding there’s enough demand from institutions for trust shares like GBTC, bitcoin options and even prospective exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to all generate substantial wealth in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The environment has way more infrastructure than we had back in 2013,” Chou said. “There’s security infrastructure and best practices for custodians, auditing infrastructure &#8230; banking is another great example. Compared to 2013, the difference between where we were and where we are today is night and day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regards to GBTC, in particular, insatiable demand for shares with lower risks than custodying bitcoin leads to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/08/30/grayscale-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-and-crypto-asset-manager-has-a-massive-premium-problem/?sh=35f6e26d46a2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sky-high premiums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes up to </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/market-intelligence/osprey-bitcoin-trust-gbtc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">more expensive than buying cryptocurrency directly. That’s why Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald launched her own Texas-based asset management firm in 2020. According to </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she was one of roughly 800 women founders who raised capital last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really difficult to raise during a pandemic&#8230; not being able to organically expand my network,” Wald said. “I couldn’t have a meeting with someone even if I wanted to. And so much of seed investing is trusting in the team; trust built through high-quality, in-person conversations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet by January 2021, her startup had raised an undisclosed seed round from angel investors like Coinbase alum Charlie Lee, then applied to the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713121001118/valkyrie-s1_012221.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities and Exchange Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for permission to launch a bitcoin ETF. Chou said such a bitcoin ETF would boost the whole ecosystem because it would “open access for people who are already users brokers or securities services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/more-bitcoin-futures-etf-proposals-withdrawn-after-sec-pushback"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been rejected over the years, starting with a proposal by </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7938cc88-911e-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2013. However, Wald says now she believes there’s never been better timing for an ETF to get approved. Among futures and options, trust shares and ETFs, all these products have different regulatory shapes that allow them to be redeemed faster, or traded in different ways, than the underlying asset, bitcoin, could be at-scale. Generally speaking, institutions seek indirect ways to gain exposure to these nascent, and often lucrative, crypto markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin’s market cap has grown large enough that it may have finally surpassed an important threshold in the minds of the regulators,” Wald said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the biggest reason the regulators were nervous about approving a bitcoin ETF in 2017 was concerns around custodial solutions and security. And I agree with that. We’re much closer to better security and custody now with institutional-grade options.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wald added that both Valkyrie&#8217;s bitcoin trust shares and prospective ETF are structured to reduce volatility and premiums.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to create a more transparent product. I wanted our product to trade closer to the net asset value [NAV],” Wald said. “We’re the only bitcoin trust launching an ETF fund so everyday investors can buy exposure to bitcoin.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This propensity among women entrepreneurs using cryptocurrency isn’t restricted to American tech bubbles. According to Toya Zhang, head of marketing at the Hong Kong-based crypto and futures exchange </span><a href="https://www.aax.com/en-US/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women make up 25% of her platform’s users and a third of the top users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our biggest market is in Russia. Other than Russia, our biggest markets are Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia and India,” Zhang said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian women are more often the one to take care of finances. If you look at stock investment user groups in China and Hong Kong, women are more than half of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highly specialized crypto landscape is quickly gaining diversity, compared to other financial sectors. At India’s Coinswitch.co exchange, women reportedly make up </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/why-bitcoin-bulls-are-betting-on-explosive-growth-in-india"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of around 25,000 users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the specific region. Women also make up at least </span><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gemini-survey-finds-over-40-of-uk-crypto-investors-are-women-2021-01-29"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of British cryptocurrency users, according to a survey by the crypto exchange </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/state-of-uk-crypto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across borders, the clear gender disparity may be associated with net worth rather than any lack of interest. In 2018, the World Bank estimated women only held </span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender/publication/unrealized-potential-the-high-cost-of-gender-inequality-in-earnings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of capital wealth. Plus, Crunchbase tallied just </span><a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Funding-To-Female-Founders_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,379 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies, less than 20% of startups that raised capital, that had women founders from 2009-2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond startups, there are also several companies like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG), where women executives took the helm in order to innovate on established brokerage models.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2020, the insurance company </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/169-year-old-insurer-massmutual-invests-100-million-in-bitcoin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchased $100 million in bitcoin and acquired NYDIG equity, a move that signaled a bullish outlook on institutional demand for bitcoin exposure in 2021. Then, on February 8, 2021, Elon Musk’s publicly traded car company Tesla validated the institutional thesis by buying </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of bitcoin. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GQJEdGyp3t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/embed/#?secret=GQJEdGyp3t" data-secret="GQJEdGyp3t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2021, the greater acceptance of bitcoin by traditional investors and allocators is really exciting,” said NYDIG president Yan Zhao. “We’ll give banks and wealth managers the ability to offer bitcoin products and exposure. We’ll handle the back end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao said her bitcoin-focused firm has roughly $4 billion under management, including derivatives, and is currently courting prospective clients like private banks and various asset managers. Her firm is open to exploring ideas like a bitcoin ETF or trust shares, she said, but isn’t interested in Ethereum-based DeFi products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve made a conscious decision to focus on bitcoin,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Chou was skeptical about many of the Ethereum-based DeFi options available today, while remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of DeFi derivative options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crypto-native products are important because that’s how you can really harness the power of not having centralized authorities involved to facilitate the transaction,” Chou said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, now traditional options offer indirect access to cryptocurrency gains. At the same time, cryptocurrency itself is experimentally being used to offer comparable, yet more accessible, financial products. These DeFi products are designed for new functionality, not just price exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile in California, from network scaling crusader Elizabeth Stark, CEO of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE5w4MrN3UQLWMn8PlG-ApRxDhOCX3C1snTwHUUrBsAezZq31nU8quwq43TqAuWgdHM9q9XITBzxypKIs-Cmnp_K0iF8JAMH3O3PWEu4GTQizdJwpiHMhCmFq0Rx-AIL0WmBh4gmUSH12VdCaRP_m0k-SnmfTZ6yQzi9WH67XdaO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to Amhaz at Volt Capital, the next generation of bitcoin whales may look remarkably different from Silicon Valley’s past unicorn-building bros. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The face of our industry looks different than how the tech industry looked in the early 90s or how finance has looked since forever,” Amhaz said. “We&#8217;re starting at a higher, more informed baseline. So, although there&#8217;s still work to be done here, I&#8217;m optimistic.&#8221;</span></p>
