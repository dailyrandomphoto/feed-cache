										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/">who alleged racial and gender discrimination</a> at the company, is co-leading new legislation with California State Senator Connie Leyva and others to empower those who experience workplace discrimination and/or harassment. Introduced today, the Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination—whether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic,&#8221; Leyva said in a statement. &#8220;SB 331 will empower survivors to speak out—if they so wish—so they can hold perpetrators accountable and hopefully prevent abusers from continuing to torment and abuse other workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This proposed bill would expand the current protections workers have through the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, also authored by Leyva, that went into effect in 2019. Ozoma, along with former co-worker Aerica Shimizu Banks, came forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination last year. They eventually settled with Pinterest, but the STAND Act technically only protected them for speaking out about gender discrimination. This new bill would ensure workers are also protected when speaking out about racial discrimination.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a legal gamble,&#8221; Ozoma told TechCrunch about coming forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination, despite having signed an NDA. Pinterest could&#8217;ve decided to sue both Ozoma and Banks, Ozoma said, but that would&#8217;ve required the company to admit wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, we weren&#8217;t [supposed to talk about racial discrimination] and that&#8217;s what most companies bank on,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long road ahead for the bill, which needs to be passed by the legislature and ultimately signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom, but it would represent a monumental shift in the tech industry, if passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be huge and not just for tech, but for your industry as well,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;I believe that we don&#8217;t have real progress unless we approach things intersectionally and that&#8217;s the lesson from all of us.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This group of companies are what we're calling our $50 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) group, though we're not too strict on that revenue figure.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost amongst <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">all the IPO chatter</a> of the mega-unicorns are a crop of companies reaching their stride, often flush with capital, ready with big plans, and still with some time before they go public. This group of companies are what we&#8217;re calling our $50 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) group, though we&#8217;re not too strict on that revenue figure.</p>
<p>Close enough will do.</p>
<p>A little bit ago we kicked off the series by looking at  <a href="https://www.ownbackup.com/">OwnBackup</a> and <a href="https://www.withassembly.com/">Assembly</a>. Today we&#8217;re continuing the series, digging into <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> and <a href="https://picsart.com/">PicsArt</a>. Next up is and <a href="https://www.synack.com/">Synack</a>, and we have an interview with <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/">Kaseya</a> on deck. The latter company is a bit oversized for our cohort, but we&#8217;ll figure out what to do with our notes from that chat in due time.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we&#8217;re looking at startups that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">around the $50 million ARR mark</a> because our 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">exploration of $100 million ARR companies</a> wound up merely taking looks at companies, like Lemonade, that were going public in short order. We&#8217;ll still do the occasional piece on the group, but we&#8217;re focusing on smaller firms this year.</p>
<p>So, into the breach with notes on SimpleNexus and PicsArt, drawing on public information concerning their fundraising history and product, and interviews with both companies. Let&#8217;s see what we can learn from their growth!</p>
<h2>SimpleNexus</h2>
<p>SimpleNexus is a Utah-based technology company that provides digital mortgage software. The company most recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/simplenexus-secures-108m-to-transform-the-homeownership-journey-into-a-seamlessly-connected-experience-301200675.html">raised $108 million in January of this year</a>, a Series B that we sadly lack a valuation for.</p>
<p>The company is growing quickly, with founders Matt Hansen and Ben Miller telling TechCrunch that they expect to scale from $30 million to $58 million in the next 12 months. That puts the the company comfortably into our new group.</p>
<p>SimpleNexus&#8217;s product is sold to banks and other financial institutions, helping provide a hub &#8212; a simple nexus, if you will &#8212; providing consumers a single login to manage their home-buying process from search to purchase. The software itself is sold on a SaaS basis, often white-labeled to banks.</p>
<p>But while SimpleNexus has seen success with its current model, claiming to touch around one in every eight mortgages, its founders told TechCrunch in a video call that they have bigger aspirations. Hansen, who is also the company&#8217;s CEO, said that in the future its service could stick with customers after they buy a home, perhaps helping them connect utilities, find appraisers, and manage their home.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about the company&#8217;s recent capital raise, and how it may impact SimpleNexus&#8217;s ramp to nearly $60 million in revenue by January 2021. Per the company, it wasn&#8217;t looking for capital, but after receiving some inbound offers to sell its entire business, which weren&#8217;t what its founders wanted, it decided to raise more external capital instead. Insight, which led the round, was excited about their company, the founders said, thanks to its customer growth and revenue expansion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> &#8212; the programming language, not the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/">survival game</a> &#8212; now has a new home: the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/">Rust Foundation</a>. AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla banded together to launch this new foundation today and put a two-year commitment to a million-dollar budget behind it. This budget will allow the project to &#8220;develop services, programs, and events that will support the Rust project maintainers in building the best possible Rust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rust started as a side project inside of Mozilla to develop an alternative to C/C++. Designed by Mozilla Research&#8217;s Graydon Hore, with contributions from the likes of JavaScript creator Brendan Eich, Rust became the core language for some of the fundamental features of the Firefox browser and its Gecko engine, as well as Mozilla&#8217;s Servo engine. Today, Rust is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most-loved language</a> among developers. But with Mozilla&#8217;s layoffs in recent months, many on the Rust team lost jobs and the future of the language became unclear without a main sponsor, though the project itself has thousands of contributors and a lot of corporate users, so the language itself wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>A large open-source project often needs some kind of guidance, which the new foundation will provide &#8212; and it takes a legal entity to manage various aspects of the community, including the trademark, for example. The <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/">new Rust board</a> will feature five board directors from the five founding members, as well as five directors from project leadership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Mozilla incubated <span class="il">Rust</span> to build a better Firefox and contribute to a better Internet,&#8221; writes Bobby Holley, Mozilla and <span class="il">Rust</span> Foundation Board member, in a statement. &#8220;In its new home with the <span class="il">Rust </span>Foundation, <span class="il">Rust</span> will have the room to grow into its own success, while continuing to amplify some of the core values that Mozilla shares with the <span class="il">Rust</span> community.”</p>
<p>All of the corporate sponsors have a vested interest in Rust and are using it to build (and rebuild) core aspects of some of their stacks. Google recently said that it will fund a Rust-based project that aims to make the Apache webserver safer, for example, while Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3605551/microsoft-forms-rust-language-team.html">formed a Rust team</a>, too, and is using the language to rewrite some core Windows APIs. AWS recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/announcing-the-general-availability-of-bottlerocket-an-open-source-linux-distribution-purpose-built-to-run-containers/">launched</a> Bottlerocket, a new Linux distribution for containers that, for example, features a build system that was largely written in Rust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank’s earnings always leads to a bonanza of news. One storyline that has dominated the company’s earnings over the past few years that has all but disappeared though is WeWork.</p>
<p>The co-working company, which saw its scorching-hot flame dim a few years ago and which has been parlayed into such books as <a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/reeves-wiedeman/billion-dollar-loser/9780316461368/">Billion Dollar Loser</a>, is all but invisible in SoftBank’s presentations these days. The company, despite being one of the largest investments in SoftBank’s $98.6 billion Vision Fund, is <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/investor-svf_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">not mentioned in the firm’s quarterly update</a>, and the <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/earnings-presentation_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">company’s investor presentation also has no mention of the company</a>. (Its logo does appear on the portfolio page, although it is buried with all the other logos.)</p>
<p>Yet, for all the doom that has been emanating from WeWork, from its financial shenanigans to dealing with the workplace in a post-COVID-19 world, results apparently are better than what might be expected.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Buried in the footnotes of SoftBank’s earnings report today is some good news related to WeWork. The Japanese telco conglomerate recognized improvements of $1.36 billion in various credit facilities for WeWork compared to its figures in the first three months of 2020.</p>
<p>Given WeWork’s instability, SoftBank had set aside large sums of capital to cover the rent and mandatory loan payments of WeWork in order to shore up the company’s financial picture. However, “mainly due to the improvement in the credit risk of WeWork” according to SoftBank, the risk profile of those loans has improved quite a bit, and the company no longer feels the need to offer as much of a financial buffer as it did nine months previous.</p>
<p>Now, that could just be some innovative accounting engineering, but that improvement in WeWork’s performance mirrors rumors heard in recent weeks that the company is expected to once again attempt to head to the public markets.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-combine-with-spac-or-raise-money-privately-11611857306">The Wall Street Journal reported that WeWork was looking to go public via SPAC</a> for a rumored price of $10 billion. No deal has yet been announced, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/softbank-files-for-a-double-scoop-of-spac/">while SoftBank is in the process of raising two more SPACs</a> for a grand total of three, it is unlikely to merge WeWork through its own vehicles.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>While that $10 billion market cap is far below some of the most bullish prices that WeWork was pumping investors on back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/wework-delays-ipo/">during its roadshow in September 2019</a>, it nonetheless shows that the company may not be the financial albatross it was two years ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash is expanding its robotic footprint into the kitchen. The delivery service is set to acquire Chowbotics, a Bay Area-based robotics best known for its salad-making robot, Sally. TechCrunch has confirmed the acquisition, which was first noted by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-is-buying-robotics-startup-chowbotics-11612805441">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>“We have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,” DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in a comment offered to TechCrunch. &#8220;At DoorDash, we are always working to innovate and continue improving how we support our merchant partners and their success &#8212; and are excited to leverage this technology to do so in new ways. With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Chowbotics has raised around $21 million to date, including an $11 million round back in 2018. The company’s vending machine-style salad bar robot was already well-positioned for the pandemic, removing a human element from the food preparation process &#8212; not to mention the fact that salad bars and buffets tend to be open air affairs. In October, the startup added a contactless feature to the robot, letting users order ahead of time, via app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Joining the DoorDash team unlocks new possibilities for Chowbotics and the technology that this team has built over the past seven years,” CEO Rick Wilmer said in a statement. “As the leader in food delivery and on-demand logistics, DoorDash has the unparalleled reach and expertise to help us grow and deploy our technology more broadly, so together, we can make fresh, nutritious food easy for more people.”</p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear how the company’s technology will fit into the delivery service’s current offering, though DoorDash notes it will “improve consumer access to fresh and safe meals, and enhance our robust merchant offerings and logistics platform.” It also remains to be seen whether Chowbotics will continue to operate as its own entity within the broader DoorDash. We’ve reached out for more insight.</p>
<p>“At DoorDash, we strive to become a merchant’s first call when they want to grow their business,” Tang said. “What excites us most about Chowbotics is that the team has developed a remarkable tool for helping merchants grow. Bringing Chowbotics’ technology into the DoorDash platform gives us a new opportunity to help merchants expand their current menu offerings and reach new customers in new markets &#8212; which is a fundamental part of our merchant-first approach to empowering local economies.”</p>
<p>DoorDash has been working with robotics companies for a number of years now. Perhaps the most prominent example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/18/postmates-and-doordash-are-testing-delivery-by-robot-with-starship-technologies/">is a partnership with Starship Technologies</a> to explore food delivery robots. Though that technology has seen a fair number of roadblocks among local officials not eager to turn their sidewalks over to robots. The delivery company likens Chowbotics’ kiosk-style technology to its work with ghost kitchens, effectively serving as a conduit to help expand food options at local merchants – be it in store or through delivery. The former will likely be of more interest once the current pandemic is in the rear view.</p>
<p>Details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is there so much M&#038;A action in the container security space now?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, another container security startup came off the board when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/rapid7-acquires-kubernetes-security-startup-alcide-for-50m/">Rapid7 bought Alcide</a> for $50 million. The purchase is part of a broader trend in which larger companies are buying up cloud-native security startups at a rapid clip. But why is there so much M&amp;A action in this space now?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">Palo Alto Networks was first</a> to the punch, grabbing Twistlock for $410 million in May 2019. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/vmware-to-acquire-kubernetes-security-startup-octarine-and-fold-it-into-carbon-black/">VMware struck a year later</a>, snaring Octarine. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/">Cisco followed with PortShift</a> in October and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/">Red Hat snagged StackRox</a> last month before the Rapid7 response last week.</p>
<p>This is partly because many companies chose to become cloud-native more quickly during the pandemic. This has created a sharper focus on security, but it would be a mistake to attribute the acquisition wave strictly to COVID-19, as companies were shifting in this direction pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that security startups that cover a niche like container security often reach market saturation faster than companies with broader coverage because customers often want to consolidate on a single platform, rather than dealing with a fragmented set of vendors and figuring out how to make them all work together.</p>
<p>Containers provide a way to deliver software by breaking down a large application into discrete pieces known as microservices. These are packaged and delivered in containers. Kubernetes provides the orchestration layer, determining when to deliver the container and when to shut it down.</p>
<p>This level of automation presents a security challenge, making sure the containers are configured correctly and not vulnerable to hackers. With myriad switches this isn&#8217;t easy, and it&#8217;s made even more challenging by the ephemeral nature of the containers themselves.</p>

<p>Yoav Leitersdorf, managing partner at YL Ventures, an Israeli investment firm specializing in security startups, says these challenges are driving interest in container startups from large companies. &#8220;The acquisitions we are seeing now are filling gaps in the portfolio of security capabilities offered by the larger companies,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company has now seen 18 investments exit, including 10 fully exited and eight that are now trading on the public markets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Yet, tucked away deeply in the company’s earnings statement was a note that the company has cut in half the performance incentive earmarked for the Vision Fund’s leadership, from $5 billion to $2.5 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That $5 billion incentive scheme was controversial when news of it was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec8628a8-73ef-11e8-b6ad-3823e4384287">first reported by publications like Financial Times</a> back in April 2018. In the model, SoftBank essentially loaned its employees money to buy into the Vision Fund, a structure that was designed to accelerate the closing of the fund’s $100 billion fundraise. The company first added language about the incentive scheme in its 2018 Q2 earnings, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>On October 19, 2018, SoftBank Vision Fund completed an interim closing with additional committed capital of $5 billion. This brought the total committed capital of the Fund to $96.7 billion. The additional committed capital is intended for the installment of an incentive scheme for operations of SoftBank Vision Fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the company has had consistent language about the $5 billion figure in every quarterly earnings report. However, in today’s latest earnings for fiscal 2020 Q3, the company noted that the incentives are now “$2.5 billion (decreased from the previous $5.0 billion).”</p>
<p>The incentive scheme for SoftBank has been a huge point of discussion for industry observers. Four top executives at SoftBank — Rajeev Misra, Marcelo Claure, Katsunori Sago and Ken Miyauchi have collectively been loaned $600 million to buy into the Vision Fund, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/54b67d4c-fb3c-489c-ac58-418f0f5c739f">according to a report two weeks ago in Financial Times</a>. Some of that money was derived from the $5 billion (now $2.5 billion) incentive scheme, although it isn’t clear if all that money was earmarked exclusively from this particular pool.</p>
<p>SoftBank’s pullback on incentives for the Vision Fund is seemingly a response to the fund’s overall lackluster performance and the fund’s disastrous investment in WeWork, which led to wide losses at the telecom group. While more recent performance has been much better for the fund, eliminating some of those incentives should improve overall performance of the fund and ultimately SoftBank’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Vision Fund I has stopped investing in new companies as of last year. A second fund has $10 billion in capital — all from SoftBank itself — and has been making regular investments. The Vision Fund has also been raising SPACs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/softbank-files-for-a-double-scoop-of-spac/">including two new ones it announced late last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The French government and the government-backed initiative La French Tech <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/fr/la-france-aide-les-startups/french-tech-120-2/">unveiled</a> the new indexes that identify the most promising French startups. The 40 top-performing startups are called the Next40, and the top 120 startups are grouped into the French Tech 120.</p>
<p>The Next40 and French Tech 120 are somewhat new as this is only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">the second version</a> of those indexes. Out of the 120 startups that were in last year’s French Tech 120, 90 of them are still in this year’s index — 30 are newcomers as there were 123 startups in last year’s French Tech 120.</p>
<p>Combined, they generate close to €9 billion in revenue and provide a job to 37,500 people. Revenue in particular is up 55% compared to last year’s French Tech 120.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a list of the French Tech 120 — the red logos are part of the Next40:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110214" style="width: 948px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110214" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png" alt="" width="938" height="626" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sans-titre.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> La French Tech</p></div></p>
<p>There are two ways to get accepted in the Next40:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have raised more than €100 million over the past three years ($120 million at today’s rate) or you are a unicorn, which means your company’s valuation has reached $1 billion or more.</li>
<li>You generate more than €5 million in revenue with a year-over-year growth rate of 30% or more for the past three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the remaining 80 startups in the French Tech 120:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 of them have raised more than €20 million in a funding round over the past three years.</li>
<li>40 of them are selected based on the annual turnover and growth rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, those indexes are limited to private French companies. For the French Tech 120, there are at least two startups per administrative region.</p>
<p>Based on those metrics, only a handful of the startups in the French Tech 120 have a female CEO and the French government thinks tech startups should do more when it comes to diversity and inclusion. That’s why a small group of people are going to work on a roadmap and some recommendations to improve those numbers.</p>
<p>Representatives of six different startups in the French Tech 120, as well as people from <a href="https://www.wearesista.com">Sista</a>, <a href="http://www.techyourplace.fr">Tech Your Place</a> and <a href="https://www.futurepositivecapital.com">Future Positive Capital</a>, will get together to work on those topics.</p>
<p>In addition to a cool logo for your website, being part of the French Tech 120 comes with some perks. Those companies can access a network of French Tech representatives in different public administrations.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s easier for your company if you want to get visas for foreign employees, obtain a certification or a patent, if you want to sell your product to a public administration, etc.</p>
<p>There are two new additions to the French Tech network. Someone from the <em>Conseil d’État</em> can help you when it comes to legal compliance. The government has also signed a partnership with Euronext to educate entrepreneurs about going public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank had some good data to report overnight <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/financial_reports/financial-report_q3fy2020_01_en.pdf">with its third-quarter earnings</a>, which covers the last quarter of 2020 through December 31. The company’s first Vision Fund reported large gains driven by DoorDash, where the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/">$680 million investment blew up to just shy of $9 billion</a> — a 13.2x return in SoftBank’s math. While not the first exit from the fund nor the first high-returning exit SoftBank has had, it <i>is</i> the first exit that meaningfully shakes up the prognosis for the Vision Fund’s returns.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The VC and founder winners of DoorDash’s IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/embed/#?secret=cWwsjHqN3U" data-secret="cWwsjHqN3U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now seems as good a time as any to ask a question we first started pondering when SoftBank launched the Vision Fund way back in 2017: What does a return profile look like at such a late stage of investment?</p>
<p>Early-stage venture capital has a return profile dubbed the “J-curve.” Given a cohort of startups in a venture portfolio, the failures of that cohort tend to materialize quite quickly. Those startups can’t raise money, and thus, they run out of runway and either die or are sold off. That means that the losses from those investments are recognized by investors right away. Meanwhile, the successful startups keep growing and raising venture capital, but funds won’t realize their gains for potentially a decade or more. Thus, the J-curve describes the early years of a fund where the losses are visible but the future gains have not yet materialized.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2110212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=768,658 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=680,583 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=1536,1317 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=2048,1755 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/j-curve-model.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The Vision Fund pioneered a much more muscular form of traditional mezzanine (pre-IPO) capital, where it would barge into a company’s cap table with big dollars and high valuations with the dream that these companies would go big. While not true of all of the Vision Fund’s investments, many of these startups were quite mature with serious revenues where the alternative to mezzanine capital was an IPO.</p>
<p>That brought up an interesting fund construction question: The sort of immediate failures that create the J-curve for early-stage investors shouldn’t presumably exist at later stages, where startups are less-risky investments. Sure, some startups may grow more slowly than other companies and exit for a middling return, but few startups should actually fail entirely.</p>
<p>So what does the SoftBank data look like today and what can it tell us about late-stage fund performance?</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund I made a total of 92 investments from summer of 2017 to mid-2020, of which 10 have fully exited, and eight are now traded on the public markets. According to SoftBank, 25 of its Fund I portfolio companies received another venture capital round in calendar year 2020 as well, giving the firm some upticks in its fair-market valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inevent.com">InEvent</a>, a startup powering virtual and hybrid events, is announcing that it has raised $2 million in seed funding from Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a tiny fraction of the $125 million that online events platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">Hopin raised last fall</a> — in fact,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/"> a recent Equity episode</a> suggested that Hopin might be the fastest growth story of the current startup era.</p>
<p>CEO Pedro Góes told me that even in a world of more established and better-funded platforms, his team sees an opportunity to break out by focusing on business-to-business events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an opening in the space for us to be the leader that we want on B2B,&#8221; Góes said. &#8220;We don’t intend to compete with platforms in the B2C market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Put another way, InEvent is less focused on replicating giant consumer events and more on helping businesses hold virtual events where they can connect with clients and partners. Góes said this is something that he and his co-founders Mauricio Giordano and Vinicius Neris saw in their previous work running a digital agency, where they were often asked to help with events in this vein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we had a lot of experience with events, we could see where the industry was broken and how to fix it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110193" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110193" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110193" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?w=680" alt="InEvent screenshot" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-17.32.09.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110193" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> InEvent</p></div></p>
<p>Góes suggested that two of the big needs for B2B events are customization and support, so InEvent has created what he described as a &#8220;really beautiful&#8221; product that can still be customized with the organizer&#8217;s branding, and the company also offers 24-hour support.</p>
<p>The platform is a virtual lobby where participants can browse all the programming, a video player, a registration system, the ability to create a conference mobile app and more. Góes said the goal was to build something that was &#8220;really flexible,&#8221; allowing organizers to run everything from within InEvent while also allowing them to incorporate outside tools, whether that&#8217;s video platforms like Zoom or CRM software like Salesforce, Marketo and HubSpot.</p>
<p>InEvent&#8217;s founders are from Brazil, but the startup is headquartered in Atlanta and has employees in 13 countries. It says it&#8217;s been used by more than 500 customers for global events, including DowDupont, Coca-Cola and Santander.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Góes told me the startup will be able to expand the team (he was proud to note the team&#8217;s diversity — 50% of its managers are women, and 50% of its managers come from a Latinx background). It also will continue to develop the product, for example by improving the video player and adding more marketing automation.</p>
<p>And when the pandemic ends and large-scale, in-person conferences become possible again, Góes predicts there will still be plenty of appetite for what InEvent can do, because more events will bring online and in-person elements together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have different clients where we have a website, we have a mobile app, but we also have hardware [to] connect with in-person,&#8221; he said. After all, if you&#8217;re at a sprawling conference like CES, it might still be convenient to chat with another attendee through the mobile app, rather than traveling two miles to see them face-to-face. &#8220;For us, what we are building, the technology for virtual and in-person, is the same thing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is continuing to explore the addition of subscription services and other paid features to supplement its advertising revenues, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content">Bloomberg</a> this morning. The company is considering a range of ideas, the report said, including tipping, paid consumer-facing features like profile customizations or an &#8220;undo send&#8221; option, or subscription-based access to Twitter&#8217;s Tweetdeck app. Twitter confirmed the company is researching and experimenting with new models, but declined to provide details.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s interest in paid features, including subscriptions, was already public knowledge.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/">last summer ran a survey</a> that asked users which options they were willing to pay for &#8212; including things like custom colors, the ability to publish longer and more high-def videos, profile badges, auto responses, an &#8220;undo send&#8221; (an alternative to the &#8220;edit&#8221; button users actually want) and, for brands, things like the ability to run brand surveys and added &#8220;social listening&#8221; analytics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, during its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/twitter-q2-misses-on-sales-of-683m-loss-per-share-of-0-16-as-covid-19-takes-its-toll/">Q2 2020</a> earnings, Twitter CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/">Jack Dorsey told investors</a> it’ll likely run subscription tests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uDo7H3rapA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/">After ad revenue drop, Twitter tells investors it&#8217;s eyeing subscription options</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After ad revenue drop, Twitter tells investors it&#8217;s eyeing subscription options&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/after-ad-revenue-drop-twitter-tells-investors-its-eyeing-subscription-options/embed/#?secret=uDo7H3rapA" data-secret="uDo7H3rapA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We do think there is a world where subscription is complementary. We think there is a world where commerce is complementary,&#8221; Dorsey said at the time. &#8220;You can imagine work around helping people manage paywalls, as well, that we believe is complementary. So that’s what we’re looking for. We have a small team who is exploring our options, obviously we’re hiring for those teams,&#8221; he had noted.</p>
<p>And last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing">a Twitter job posting was spotted</a> that referenced a team &#8220;building a subscription platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal during its Q3 2020 earnings confirmed those plans, noting &#8220;you will see tests from us&#8221; on the subscription front. But he also warned these wouldn&#8217;t be things that impacted Twitter revenue in the near-term.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s report added just a couple of new details to our earlier understanding of these efforts. It noted that one of the research projects around subscriptions was code-named &#8220;Rogue One,&#8221; and another involved the idea of &#8220;tipping&#8221; for exclusive content.</p>
<p>This latter item could perhaps reference an idea of how Twitter could monetize its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">recent acquisition</a> of newsletter platform Revue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">now rolled out</a> on the web. That is, users could possibly &#8220;tip&#8221; (pay) to read someone&#8217;s newsletter. But Twitter could also be considering a tipping feature inside Twitter&#8217;s audio-based networking feature and Clubhouse rival, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>. Or it could be something else &#8212; <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-people-with-power-at-twitter">The Information</a> had also previously reported a tipping feature was being looked into, last month, but Twitter told them nothing was yet in development.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VohoGyfxNP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">Twitter quietly rolls out Revue newsletters shortcut on web</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter quietly rolls out Revue newsletters shortcut on web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/embed/#?secret=VohoGyfxNP" data-secret="VohoGyfxNP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter today declined to offer any further clarifications about its plans on this front.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the company confirmed it was still considering new monetization models in order to grow its revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasing revenue durability is our top company objective. You will see us continue to research and experiment with ways to further diversify our revenue beyond ads in 2021 and beyond,&#8221; said Bruce Falck, Revenue Product Lead, in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;These may include subscriptions and other approaches that will give people and businesses of all sizes on Twitter access to unique features and enhanced opportunities for content creation, discovery, and engagement. While we&#8217;re excited about this potential, it’s important to note we are still in very early exploration and we do not expect any meaningful revenue attributable to these opportunities in 2021. Given the massive opportunity to build upon our strengths, our main focus continues to be on growing our ads business,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Twitter in Q3 2020 had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/twitter-revenue-rises-14-but-user-growth-fails-to-impress/">beat analyst expectations</a> on revenue and net income, but investors are still stuck on Twitter&#8217;s inability to substantially grow its user base. The company reports its Q4 2020 earnings on Tuesday, where its plans for new revenue models may again be discussed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Additive manufacturing has proven an ideal solution for certain tasks, but the technology still lacks more traditional methods in a number of categories. One of the biggest is the requirement for post-printing assembly. 3D printers can create extremely complex components, but an outside party (be it human or machine) is required to put them together.</p>
<p>MIT’s CSAIL department this week <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/fabricating-fully-functional-drones-0208">showcased “LaserFactory,”</a> a new project that attempts to develop robotics, drones and other machines than can be fabricated as part of a “one-stop shop.” The system is comprised of a software kit and hardware platform designed to create structures and assemble circuitry and sensors for the machine.</p>
<p>A more fully realized version of the project will be showcased at an event in May, but the team is pulling back the curtain a bit to show what the concept looks like in practice. Here’s a breakdown from CSAIL’s page:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say a user has aspirations to create their own drone. They’d first design their device by placing components on it from a parts library, and then draw on circuit traces, which are the copper or aluminum lines on a printed circuit board that allow electricity to flow between electronic components. They’d then finalize the drone’s geometry in the 2D editor. In this case, they’d use propellers and batteries on the canvas, wire them up to make electrical connections, and draw the perimeter to define the quadcopter’s shape.</p></blockquote>
<p>Printing circuit boards is certainly nothing new. What sets CSAIL’s machine apart here is the breadth of functionality that’s been jammed into the machine here. An accompanying video lays it out pretty well:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzCAqVwZYCc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, this is early days &#8212; we’re still months out from the official presentation. There are a lot of questions, and more to the point, a lot of potential points of failure for a complex machine like this &#8212; especially one that seems to have non-experts as a target audience.</p>
<p>“Making fabrication inexpensive, fast, and accessible to a layman remains a challenge,” PhD student and lead author Martin Nisser says in the release. “By leveraging widely available manufacturing platforms like 3D printers and laser cutters, LaserFactory is the first system that integrates these capabilities and automates the full pipeline for making functional devices in one system.”</p>
<p>The software appears to be a big piece of the puzzle &#8212; allowing users to view a version of the product before it’s printed. By then, of course, it’s too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.felicis.com/team/aydin/">Aydin Senkut</a> is a Swiss Army knife of an investor. He has been on the Midas List for the past seven years, with early investments in companies like Shopify, Rovio, Fitbit, Ayden, Credit Karma, SoundHound and more.</p>
<p>One such investment is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/guideline/">Guideline</a>, an enterprise tech company focused on giving small businesses a simplified way to offer affordable 401ks to employees. Guideline has raised nearly $140 million from investors such as Tiger Global Management, Greyhound, Generation Investment Management, Propel and, of course, Felicis.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Senkut and Guideline <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinbusque/">founder and CEO Kevin Busque</a> join us for this week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">new and improved Extra Crunch Live</a> pairs founders and the investors who led their earlier rounds to talk about how the deal went down, from the moment they met to the conversations they had (including some disagreements) to the relationship as it exists today. Hell, we may even take a peek at the original pitch deck that made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll turn our eyes back to you, the audience. That same founder/investor duo (in this case, Guideline founder and CEO Kevin Busque and Felicis&#8217; Aydin Senkut) will take a look at your pitch decks and give their own feedback. (If you haven’t yet submitted a pitch deck to be torn down on Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can do so here</a>.)</p>
<p>The hour-long episode is sandwiched between two 30-minute rounds of networking. From start to finish, it goes from 11:30 a.m. PST/2:30 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST. And Extra Crunch Live will come to you at the same time, every week, with a new pair of speakers.</p>
<p>In this case, we&#8217;ll be talking to Senkut and Busque about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/guideline-15-million/">$15 million Series B investment</a> that Felicis led in the startup: How did they meet, what attracted them to one another, and ultimately, what made them decide to be financially bound together for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For now, let&#8217;s learn a bit more about Senkut and Busque, shall we?</p>
<p>Before starting Felicis Ventures (and serving as managing partner), Senkut was a senior manager at Google responsible for strategic partner development and account management in Asia Pacific. He joined the search giant in 1999 as its first product manager to launch Google&#8217;s first international sites. He then became the company&#8217;s first international sales manager.</p>
<p>Alongside an impressive portfolio of both angel and institutional investments, Senkut is about as well-rounded as a tech leader can be.</p>
<p>Kevin Busque, meanwhile, founded <a href="https://www.guideline.com/">Guideline</a> in 2015 and has since amassed more than 17,500 small businesses on the platform with nearly $4 billion in assets under management. Before Guideline, Busque spent seven years at TaskRabbit where he was a co-founder and VP of Technology. Busque deeply understands what it takes to go from idea to MVP to product market fit to hypergrowth.</p>
<p>This episode of Extra Crunch Live airs at 3 p.m. EST/12 p.m. PST on Wednesday, February 10.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=felicisguideline">Extra Crunch members only</a>. We’re coming to you with a new pair of speakers every week, and you can catch everything you missed on demand if you can’t join us live. It’s worth the cost of the subscription on its own, but EC members also get access to our premium content, including market maps and investor surveys. Long story short? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=felicisguideline">Subscribe, smarty.</a> You won’t regret it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethena co-founders Roxanne Petraeus and Anne Solmssen began their company with a clear goal: There needs to be a more modern, and effective, way to deploy anti-harassment training to employees. Ethena’s solution is to send employees bite-sized monthly “nudges” or pings with five-minute lessons, replacing the usual one-hour annual workshop with more flexible learning.</p>
<p>The startup raised $2 million off of that vision in June, and today has announced it has raised follow-on funding with the same exact amount, led by GSV. The startup currently has $5 million in venture capital, with investors including Homebrew, Neo and Village Global.</p>
<p>The follow-on capital comes right after Ethena has had some solid growth itself. The startup closed a couple major contracts with companies including Netflix, Zoom and Zendesk, and tells TechCrunch that more than 20,000 active employees complete its monthly training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solid growth and new cash is where the story could stop for now, but Petraeus tells TechCrunch that early momentum has also inspired a shift of sorts in what Ethena is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>“When we initially launched in Feb 2020, we thought that for our first year, we’d focus entirely on scaling companies because only startups would be interested in an innovative approach to compliance training,” she said. “What’s changed is we’ve learned that even large enterprises want a better approach, deeper impact and are willing to be innovative in a space historically dominated by lawyers and legacy e-learning providers.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v20qYVlzAA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/">Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/embed/#?secret=v20qYVlzAA" data-secret="v20qYVlzAA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup is expanding its offering from anti-sexual harassment training to a wide variety of training courses focused on compliance, from financial compliance to code of conduct measures. The shift wasn’t because of a lack of interest from customers, the co-founder said, but instead demand from existing enterprise customers to offer more than just a singular topic.</p>
<p>“We think taking a specific sector-based approach can actually narrow the impact we’re having,” Petraeus said. “So we are trying to take a really inclusive approach,” from the start on what kind of topics should be treated as more than “just checking off a box.”</p>
<p>Petraeus, an army veteran, says that Ethena’s confidence in effectiveness and outcomes comes from military data on how adults learn.</p>
<p>“We know that traditional training just isn&#8217;t effective at behavior change, and there are some studies that show that it&#8217;s a pretty big backlash with increased unconscious bias after training versus before.” The startup differentiates from other micro-learning plays in its curriculum.</p>
<p>The curriculum is designed to be consumed over the course of a year instead of in an annual hour-long session. This tiny iteration is enough to give employees a repetitive way to understand the content. “We&#8217;re experimenting with things like graphic novels and podcasts to present training,” Petraeus said. “Just making sure whatever we’re doing yesterday is important tomorrow, because I think it’s important for us to be agile content creators.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2110167" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png 3428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=1536,1027 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=2048,1369 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ethena-Training-Center-2021.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>But Ethena’s biggest differentiation, Petraeus says, is its content. The pandemic has boasted a whole new sort of situation that employees need help, or proactive guidance, navigating. Petraeus says that Ethena’s monthly cadence gives it flexibility to adopt “modern” scenarios like Slack culture and Zoom etiquette. Ethena’s top performing training nudges in 2020 included lessons on online harassment prevention and mental health inclusivity.</p>
<p>The micro-learning approach has long been popular among edtech companies as a way to sneak or gamify small lessons into a workflow. So far, Ethena says over 90% of 150,000 in-app learner feedback notes are positive, saying the information is engaging and relevant. In Q4, Ethena saw learner growth of more than 250% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>GSV&#8217;s Deborah Quazzo, who led Ethena&#8217;s seed and now this follow-on financing, said that it&#8217;s &#8220;not a coincidence that they&#8217;ve picked up some of the best logos in the world at an early stage,&#8221; referring to Ethena&#8217;s big customers. Quazzo thinks the compliance market has had very limited innovation so far, even though it&#8217;s a massive opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are seeing such strong product market fit and customers are pulling them into areas of content extension, so having more room to run faster made total sense,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past two decades, there has been a complete revolution in software engineering driven by the rise of open source. Proprietary tools and libraries have widely given way to open-source libraries and editors shared on sites like GitHub. The result has been an explosion of new software engineers who can both learn from and contribute to the most cutting-edge software in the world.</p>
<p>That open model remains mostly a pipe dream in the silicon world. The pipeline and tooling for designing and engineering chips remains almost entirely proprietary, and while new architectures like <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> and new specifications like <a href="https://telecominfraproject.com/openran/">OpenRAN</a> have made some headway in recent years, the industry is still almost hermetically sealed to open innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://chipsalliance.org">CHIPS Alliance</a> was started in March 2019 with the mission to open that ecosystem and encourage the development of open-source practices throughout the hardware silicon world. It’s hosted as a member of the Linux Foundation, and shares a similar ethos of using openness to spur further innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Alliance announced today that it has hired Rob Mains as its new executive director. Mains joined the organization last month as general manager; he previously had a multi-decade career across the silicon industry at companies like Qualcomm, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and IBM.</p>
<p>Mains sees those experiences as being formative for understanding the current ecosystem, but understands that the silicon world has to change. “Obviously, it’s a very different mindset from silicon companies have had in the past,” Mains said. CHIPS Alliance is “creating a platform that different companies and members can contribute to … and bridge us to the next stage of innovation.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109059" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109059" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2109059" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg 2039w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109059" class="wp-caption-text">New CHIPS Alliance executive director Rob Mains. Photo via CHIPS Alliance.</p></div></p>
<p>Currently, the organization has more than two dozen corporate and university members, including Intel, Google, Alibaba and RISC-V darling SiFive.</p>
<p>Compared to the RISC-V Foundation and other orgs focused on specific open-source technologies, Mains sees CHIPS Alliance trying to create a more open ecosystem holistically. “There are a number of different areas where we can promote standards and examples,” he said, pointing to examples like bus protocols and interfaces between chiplets. CHIPS Alliance hosts the <a href="https://github.com/chipsalliance/omnixtend">OpenXtend protocol</a> first developed at Western Digital, which is designed to provide a consistent interface between processor caches and memory controllers, and it is <a href="https://chipsalliance.org/announcement/2020/07/16/aib-2-0-draft-specification/">also backing the Advanced Interface Bus (AIB) standard</a> first developed at Intel to connect multiple semiconductor dies.</p>
<p>Mains has a particular background in electronic design automation (EDA) tools, which help chip designers translate their models into actual transistors on physical silicon. He sees a real opportunity to further expand open-source tools in the EDA space. In addition, the organization is interested in further exploring progress on Open PDK (process design kit) infrastructure such as a <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">recent experimental preview offered by Google and Skywater</a>.</p>
<p>Mains hopes that by being a community and a champion for open-source methodologies in hardware, this cloistered industry can open up and expand the range and efforts of innovation happening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The IPO frenzy is not letting up, Bumble informed the world this morning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The IPO frenzy is not letting up, Bumble informed the world this morning.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521031442/d20761ds1a.htm">new SEC filing</a>, the dating company raised its target IPO price range, indicating that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">its previous attempt</a> to quantify its per-share value was an undershoot. This means we&#8217;ll need to calculate a host of new valuations and revenue multiples for the company.</p>
<p>But more than that, we have a question to answer: Is Bumble aiming for a Match.com price, despite not being as profitable as its already-public rival? The last time we covered the pair, Bumble&#8217;s implied revenue multiples were discounted compared to Match, but with this new price, has the smaller company gained ground?</p>

<hr />
<p>And if so, does it mean that we&#8217;re seeing more public market enthusiasm for private companies? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>
<p>When it comes to the frenetic demand for IPO shares from public investors, I am reminded <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/1994-10-01">of a particular Dilbert</a>. In this particular strip, Wally gets fired and is then hired back as a consultant. People outside the company appear smarter, he said, so he&#8217;s now back and getting paid more money than before.</p>
<p>This, but for private companies going public. Some companies appear to have huge promise while private, only to fizzle slowly while public. Or they manage huge price gains during their IPO process, only to cede those wins after they have a few trading months under their belt.</p>
<p>Is that what&#8217;s going to happen with Bumble?</p>
<h2>Bumble&#8217;s new IPO pricing range</h2>
<p>Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">targeted a $28 to $30 per-share IPO price</a> when it first set a range, implying a greater than $1 billion raise. Now the company is selling more shares at an even higher price. From 34.5 million shares to 45 million, and at a new $37 to $39 per share price range, Bumble could raise $1.66 billion to $1.76 billion in its IPO.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not counting its underwriters&#8217; option of 6.75 million shares, which might bring its total raise to $2.02 billion at the top end of its new pricing interval.</p>
<p>What is Bumble worth at those new prices? Using its simple, shares-outstanding post-IPO count of 112,745,301 &#8212; inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option &#8212; the company would be worth $4.17 billion to $4.4 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Chicago-based startup, <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/">Jiobit</a>, wanted to make a better child location tracker than the bulky smartwatches and other insecurely designed products already on the market. So in 2018, it launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/jiobit-launches-its-more-secure-modular-child-location-tracker-starting-at-99/">own modular kid tracker</a> &#8212; a small dongle of sorts that could be tied to shoelaces, belt loops or school backpacks, for example. Today, the company is out with a new generation of this device, the Jiobit Next, which aims to improve accuracy, battery life, reliability and more.</p>
<p>The company says it took its two years&#8217; of learning and customer feedback into account when developing the new design, which is today used not only by parents, but also by pet owners.</p>
<p>The updated version of the Jiobit, now $129.99, is a small device that weighs less than four quarter coins, and includes a combination of radios &#8212; Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular and GPS &#8212; as well as sensors, including an accelerometer/pedometer, temperature sensor and barometer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The upgraded version now includes a new antenna system designed to increase performance inside schools, stores, high rises and other challenging signal environments, the company claims.</p>
<p>It also leverages the reach of low-power, wide-area (LPWA) wireless networks in order to better serve rural regions where cellular coverage is limited and spotty. This allows the device to still be tracked when outside of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth mesh networks.</p>
<p>The new Jiobit is also waterproof (IPX8) up to five feet of water for up to 30 minutes and includes an alert button that instantly notifies loved ones that the user is lost or in danger. This button can be customized through the Jiobit app as to which family members will receive the alert, or it can even be turned off &#8212; which may be useful if the child is too young to understand how to use it.</p>

<p>Jiobit owners can continue to monitor the device through the app or now, a web app that includes alerting and notification controls. This opens up the service to more than just families &#8212; it could be used by organizations to deploy Jiobit into the field.</p>
<p>Like some software-based tracking apps, the device supports features like &#8220;Trusted Places,&#8221; which are geofenced areas where you expect the device to be at certain times, like school or maybe a doggie day care. When the device is not in a Trusted Place, you can enable &#8220;Live Mode&#8221; to watch its movement in real time.</p>

<p>Another improvement focuses on battery life. The upgraded version offers 50% longer battery life than the prior version, the company says. Under typical use cases, the Jiobit will last up to 10 days between charges, though it lasts longer when on standby and not in active use. (That may be why pet owners are seeing slightly longer battery life of 10-20 days, for instance.)</p>
<p>The original idea for Jiobit had come about because founder John Renaldi, a previous VP at Motorola, was shocked to find that most child trackers on the market were storing their certificate keys in the clear and were hackable. He wanted to build a more secure alternative, and brought on co-founder and CTO Roger Ady, a previous director of engineering at Motorola, to help.</p>
<p>Today, the Jiobit has its own dedicated security chip to communicate with the company&#8217;s servers, and uses its AES-256 <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/blog/kickstarter-gadget-crowdfunded-hacked-iot-security-jiobit">&#8220;Jiobit TrustChip&#8221; technology</a> to encrypt data both at rest and in transit with TLS1.2 encryption. It also refuses to download any software that&#8217;s not cryptographically signed by Jiobit in order to prevent malware or other &#8220;rogue&#8221; software from being installed.</p>

<p>The service itself, meanwhile, is compliant with U.S. children&#8217;s privacy regulations (COPPA).</p>
<p>The new Jiobit Next will work only within the U.S., while the first generation works internationally across 146 countries. But both will continue to be supported by way of <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/product">subscriptions</a>. Users can choose between a two-year subscription plan ($8.99/month), a six-month subscription plan ($12.99/month) or a month-to-month subscription plan ($14.99/month). These don&#8217;t require a cellular plan or SIM card from your existing carrier, like other child trackers and smartwatches.</p>
<p>To date, the startup says it&#8217;s raised $12 million in outside investment, including from Netgear and other Midwest VC firms. Jiobit isn&#8217;t disclosing how many devices it has sold to date, specifically, but says it&#8217;s in the &#8220;mid-five-figure range.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new device is on pre-order starting today and will be sold later this month on its website, and then Amazon, Chewy and Target. It has also partnered with family tracking app Life360 to offer special pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlanta-based <a href="https://www.bip-capital.com/">BIP Capital</a> has a new name for its venture capital operations (<a href="https://panoramic.vc/">Panoramic Ventures</a>); a new partner (Paul Judge); and is launching a $300 million new fund in its bid to plant a flag as the premier venture fund among the rising startup cities across the country.</p>
<p>Miami may have grabbed headlines recently as a new hub for venture capital and technology startups, but like other cities across the Southeast it has lacked venture funds of a significant size since the early days of the dot-com bubble. Panoramic wants to be the fundraising destination for entrepreneurs outside of traditional tech hubs like Boston, Silicon Valley and New York as these new tech hubs emerge.</p>
<p>Atlanta, which already boasts several startup companies that have achieved billion-dollar valuations, including Greenlight Financial and Calendly, has an equally burgeoning startup scene and an opportunity to become the central hub for venture capital investment in a region that encompasses several other rising tech hubs in the Southeast, like Birmingham, Miami, Nashville and New Orleans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a strategy similar to the one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">Drive Capital has employed</a> to become a leading fund in the Midwest and across the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/embed/#?secret=ryhokvXMPq" data-secret="ryhokvXMPq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the new partnership, which will include famed early-stage Atlanta investor Paul Judge, BIP Capital&#8217;s venture activities will operate under the Panoramic Ventures brand.</p>
<p>Should the firm manage to raise the $300 million it has targeted for Panoramic&#8217;s inaugural investment vehicle it would become the largest venture fund in the Southeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to have a fund at that scale,&#8221; said Mark Buffington, a co-founder of BIP Capital and Panoramic Ventures. &#8220;You see the venture activity that is increasing in the region [and] one thing that&#8217;s been missing is a really active venture fund that can scale up as companies grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Panoramic intends to be active at the seed stage while having the capacity to make investments in later-stage venture-backed companies as well, according to the two co-founders. And the firm will also try to focus on a more diverse group of entrepreneurs, thanks to the addition of Paul Judge.</p>
<p>Judge, a Black serial entrepreneur and investor, was the co-founder of the Atlanta-based voice recognition tech developer <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/">Pindrop</a>, the Wi-Fi startup Luma Home and security tech developer Purewire. He&#8217;s also an investor in several startups across the Southeast through his own venture initiatives, including <a href="https://techsquare.co/about/">Techsquare Labs</a>, and Judge sits on the investment committee for the SoftBank Opportunity Fund, focused on Black, Hispanic and Native American founders. His portfolio includes companies like LeaseQuery, Cove.tool, OncoLens and Eventeny.</p>
<p>About $125 million has already been soft-circled for the new Panoramic Ventures fund, which expects to work closely with some of the other investment firms that have cropped up or established a presence in the Southeast. That includes firms like <a href="https://www.outlanderlabs.com/">Outlander Labs</a>, founded by the husband and wife investment team of Paige and Leura Craig, and the LA-based firm Mucker Labs, which has an investment partner working out of Nashville.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;There’s been an absence of this type of energy and this type of heft in a venture fund in Atlanta,&#8221; said Judge. &#8220;That’s the hole that we’ve been aiming to fill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panoramic will invest in seed, Series A and Series B funding rounds, the company said in a statement. Investment areas will focus on business-to-business software-as-a-service companies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare software, financial technologies, digital media, cybersecurity and frontier technologies. </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and be sure to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/a-lake-house-architect-a-miami-vc-and-homeowner-walk-into-a-wine-bar/">last week&#8217;s main ep</a> that dug into Robinhood, Miami and a host of other topics.</p>
<p>This morning we had a pile of news to get through. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/07/pony-ai-raises-100-million-more-to-advance-its-autonomous-vehicle-tech/">Pony.ai raised another $100 million</a>, which underscores our growing thesis that there is no amount of money yet that will produce the tech required for self-driving cars to work. Perhaps we will get there, but it is going to cost a pretty penny or two.</li>
<li>Sticking to cars, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/hyundai-kia-say-they-aren-t-in-ev-discussions-with-apple?sref=gni836kR">the Apple-Kia tie-up is kaput</a>, which we should have known the moment it became known. Apple previously bought startup Drive.ai back in 2019, of course.</li>
<li>Vroom, a 2020 IPO, bought a Super Bowl ad. Who would have expected that? Its shares are up, however, after the ad.</li>
<li>Still on the car beat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin</a>, and may accept the stuff as tender to buy its vehicles in the future. The move sent the price of bitcoin higher.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">Clubhouse got banned in China</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/indian-healthtech-startup-phable-raises-12-million-to-serve-patients-with-chronic-conditions/">Phable raised $12 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/nexthink-nabs-180m-series-d-on-1-1b-valuation/">Nexthink raised $180 million</a> and Bumble is targeting a higher share price in its impending IPO.</li>
<li>And we may have figured out the ∆ between what investors are saying about the seed market, and what data has largely said.</li>
</ul>
