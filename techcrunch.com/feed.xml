										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making the choice to adopt, or to find an adopting family, is a legally complex, emotionally taxing, expensive and time-consuming process. <a href="https://pairtreefamily.com">PairTree</a> aims to make one part at least considerably easier and faster with its online matching platform where expectant mothers and hopeful adopters can find each other without the facilitation of an agency or other organization. The company has just raised a $2.25 million seed round, a rarity in the industry.</p>
<p>The path to adoption is different for everyone, but there are generally some things they have in common: Once the process is started, it can take upwards of $50,000 and over a year-and-a-half to organize a match. While some of this comprises the ordinary legal hurdles involved in any adoption, a big part of it is simply that there are limited opportunities for adoption, and compatibility isn&#8217;t guaranteed. As many people considering adoption are doing so on the heels of unsuccessful fertility treatment, it can be a lot to take on and a dispiriting wait.</p>
<p>Erin Quick, CEO and co-founder (with CTO Justin Friberg) of PairTree, said that the modern adoption landscape is marked by the fact that nearly 95 percent of adoptions are open, meaning there is ongoing contact between a biological mother and adopting family.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be working together forever, and that makes finding a highly compatible match that much more important,&#8221; Quick, herself a happy adopter, told TechCrunch in an interview. But because of the way adoption is generally done — through agencies licensed by states — there are limitations on how far anyone involved can reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so bound by geography,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s regulated at the state level and has been facilitated by state level, not because of state laws — there&#8217;s no rule saying you can&#8217;t adopt out of state — but because the facilitators are small nonprofits. They bind themselves to their geographic region because that&#8217;s what they can serve. We&#8217;re building a platform that makes what people are already doing much easier and more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>That platform is in many ways very much like a dating app, though of course the comparison is not exact and does not reflect the gravity of choosing to adopt. But like in the dating world, in adoption you have a cloud of people looking to connect over something highly dependent on personality and individual needs.</p>

<p>PairTree onboards both expectant mothers and adopters with personality tests — not the light-hearted stuff of OkCupid but a broader, more consequential set of Jungian archetypes that signal a person&#8217;s high-level priorities in life. Think &#8220;wants to travel and learn&#8221; versus &#8220;wants to provide and nurture&#8221; (not that these are necessarily incompatible) — they serve as important indicators of preferences that might not be so easily summarized with a series of checkboxes. That&#8217;s not the only criterion, of course. Other demographic and personal details are also collected.</p>
<p>The adopters are added to a pool through which expectant mothers can sift and, if desired, contact (in this, Quick suggested, PairTree mirrors Bumble, where women must message first). PairTree also does basic due diligence stuff like identify verification and confirmation of other important steps like home studies.</p>
<p>If a likely match is found, all the relevant information is passed to the adoption facilitator, who will be coordinating the other legal and financial steps. PairTree isn&#8217;t looking to replace these agencies — in fact Quick said that they have been huge proponents of the platform, since it can shorten wait times and improve outcomes. She said based on their existing successful adoptions that the wait can be cut by half or even two-thirds, and thus the cost (which involves recurring payments as the agency searches and does the legal work) by a similar amount.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are small nonprofits; they don&#8217;t have a lot of tech chops. When we launched we went to attorneys first, actually, and we were surprised when agencies started reaching out,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>Agencies have been referring their adopters to PairTree, which has led to a lot of early traction, Quick said. And importantly, they&#8217;ve seen great diversity in their early success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adoption has historically been denied by faith-based systems — LGBTQ families and single women have been subject to discrimination,&#8221; she noted. And in fact just last week a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/supreme-court-sides-with-catholic-adoption-agency-that-refuses-to-work-with-lgbt-couples.html">Supreme Court decision</a> held up the right of religious adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples. Quick was proud to say that they have already facilitated adoptions by same-sex couples and single parents.</p>
<p>The company will also set aside 5 percent of its net profits, which hopefully will manifest in volume, for the Lifetime Healing Foundation, which offers counseling and support to birth mothers who have gone though the adoption process.</p>
<p>The $2.25 million seed round was led by Urban Innovation Fund, with Founder Collective, Female Founders Alliance and Techstars participating. It will surprise few to hear that adoption is not a particularly hot industry for venture capital, but rising interest and investment in fertility tech may have shed light on opportunities in adjacent spaces. Adoption is one where significant improvements can be enabled by technology, meaning startups can grow fast while having a positive impact.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the money to expand its product portfolio, pursue more partnerships, and perhaps most importantly for its users, build a native mobile app, since 90 percent of the service&#8217;s viewership is mobile.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful to our expert and diverse group of investors who share our vision that adoption should be a viable path to parenting for more people,&#8221; said Quick in the release announcing the raise. &#8220;Like us, our investors believe in the importance of supporting Biological and Adopting Families along with the Adoptees, because adoption is not a single transaction but a journey they’re taking over the course of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a> founder Amir Nathoo has a message to the edtech sector, which recently found itself under a spotlight thanks to the pandemic: Add your voice, and don’t try to always appear neutral.</p>
<p>The founder of the unicorn business penned a statement, co-signed by other edtech leaders, promoting the continuance of teachers being allowed to teach critical race theory in classrooms across the country. The learning framework, which has been the subject <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/22525983/map-critical-race-theory-legislation-teaching-racism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of recent legislative debate,</span></a> covers the acknowledgement of institutional, and systemic racism in the United States. Critics of critical race theory say that CTR can add more divisiveness to an already polarized world, while supporters see the framework as key to understanding the role that racism plays in society and how current systems perpetuate inequality.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we must take a stand that teaching the wrongs of racism is not &#8216;divisive&#8217;; it is imperative,” the statement reads. “Many of these new laws will require teaching &#8216;both sides&#8217; of a lesson about race or current events, if permitted at all,&#8221; a nuance that would make it difficult for teachers to condemn history like lynching or Jim Crow&#8217;s legacy.</p>
<p>It goes on to pledge that, “as CEOs and Board Members of education technology companies, we are taking a stand to say that any new law that restricts teaching racism in a lesson is unacceptable.”</p>
<blockquote><p>We stand with the thousands of teachers who have come together to protest these laws restricting racism lessons.<br />
We stand with the millions of learners they will impact.<br />
We are signing this letter today so that teachers and students can openly discuss the experiences of Black youth today in the context of the George Floyd protests of 2020.<br />
Above all, we are signing this letter today to say racism is wrong and that hatred based on the color of someone’s skin, religious beliefs, gender, or sexual orientation is wrong, unequivocally wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Signatures on the statement include a number of notable founders and investors in edtech, giving weight to the statement: </span></p>

<h2>Mission-oriented politics</h2>
<p>There is a growing perspective in Silicon Valley that companies should only get involved in politics when it is related to their mission and can impact their business.</p>
<p>The conversation began with Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publishing a memo</span></a> that banned the debate of causes and politics internally that are unrelated to work. Coinbase has since been joined by Basecamp, and there’s a pseudonymous Twitter account, Mission Protocol, dedicated to helping other startups adopt a code of conduct that “follows in Brian Armstrong’s footsteps.”</p>
<p>“We started this project because existing codes of conduct and conversations around social responsibility didn&#8217;t have a voice for what is most important: staying focused on the good we actually deliver for society through our missions,” a tweet from the account reads.</p>
<p>In an interview, Nathoo said that critical race theory “is clearly related” to its mission, but that his company is also taking an “expansive view of how our community can be impacted.” The company says it intends to engage, and add their voice, to issues around race and inequality.</p>
<p>“Ideally, companies would stay out of politics but that&#8217;s not the reality that we live in,” he said. “We think it’s an abdication of corporate responsibility to try and pretend that there&#8217;s both sides to every argument. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s right, and we intend to take a different path on corporate responsibility than other startups might have taken.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.allhere.com/">AllHere</a> CEO Joanna Smith, who signed the statement, told TechCrunch that the statement is tied heavily to her mission. Her company developed a 24/7 chatbot to help families and kids that have issues with absenteeism at schools. The company focuses on supporting families, through two-way text and in-person intervention, to get better outcomes and lessen learning gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think every startup has to be aware of the environment within which they operate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think specifically in education technologies, it would be very difficult to scale a company that&#8217;s directly interfacing and interacting with families and kids, if the company itself is not aware of, or reflective of the needs and priorities of those who they are attempting to serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the luxury of putting on blinders to the realities that families and kids live in, which, for AllHere, includes transportation, health care, absenteeism, mental health and, of course, how families see the world,&#8221; she added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SLCj4OuxsF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/what-the-non-political-startup-leader-teaches-us-about-company-culture/">What the &#8216;nonpolitical&#8217; startup leader teaches us about company culture</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What the &#8216;nonpolitical&#8217; startup leader teaches us about company culture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/what-the-non-political-startup-leader-teaches-us-about-company-culture/embed/#?secret=SLCj4OuxsF" data-secret="SLCj4OuxsF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The debate is more complex than pro-Coinbase and anti-Coinbase. For example, both companies present an alternative to how startups should address politics: Tie it to the mission, and view the mission as wide-ranging and inclusive.</p>
<p>Nathoo said that a small number of edtech leaders were invited to sign the edtech statement to start. Of those who didn’t sign, the main reasons were disagreement with messaging, or worry about getting involved in politics.</p>
<p>Edtech startups are in a unique spot to address racism because of the content and mission that many have. Quizlet has a number of free, downloadable lessons for educators to address topics like mass incarceration and policing, the fight for women’s suffrage, and the coronavirus in Black America, for example. Outschool has a number of classes offered about anti-racism, including <a href="https://outschool.com/classes/be-the-rainbow-in-somebodys-cloud-anti-racism-and-empathy-for-kids-4-6-dKHKOA7r?sectionUid=5f6da1d2-1582-41d4-b1c1-a99bbfd9a5d4#abkosjggxe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an $11 one-time class for kids ages 4-6. </span></a>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>Nathoo expects that Outschool’s business, which was recently valued at over $1 billion, will benefit from this choice because of “greater trust and connection” with the community and staff. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium, for example, recently lost more employees</span></a> after CEO Ev Williams published a culture memo, in the wake of a failed unionization attempt.</p>
<p>Even with this perspective, Nathoo admits that the company “is not where it wants to be&#8221; on diversity, and thinks that there is work left to be done. It’s up to future employees on if today’s effort, rallying against the diminishment of critical race theory and for more conversations of racism, will either be an attractive, or dissuasive, reason to join the team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The days of a scrolling to the end of your Instagram feed look to be coming to an end. After adding algorithmic suggestions<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/"> to the bottom of the app last year</a>, Instagram is running a test that would splice more recommended posts from accounts you don&#8217;t follow into the feed with those you do.</p>
<p>In the next few days, the company will begin testing an expansion of &#8220;Suggested Posts&#8221; which would sprinkle that content through the regular feed. As it stands now, Suggested Posts appear at the bottom of Instagram after you&#8217;ve scrolled through all of the content from people you follow and hit the &#8220;You&#8217;re all caught up&#8221; message that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">app implemented in 2018</a>. Depending on how many accounts you follow, it&#8217;s possible to not run into that message or Instagram&#8217;s recommendations very often, if at all.</p>

<p>In addition to boosting the prominence of Suggested Posts, Instagram will test an option that lets users &#8220;snooze&#8221; the feature, removing it from the feed for 30 days. Anyone in the test will be able to offer feedback when a specific post doesn&#8217;t interest them, but it sounds like you won&#8217;t be able to disable Suggested Posts in the feed in a permanent way.</p>
<p>The Suggested Posts expansion will be accompanied by a way for users to shape what they see through managing their interests — stuff like cats, makeup or basketball. If you&#8217;ve seen enough cats, you can toggle that interest off or tell Instagram that you never wanted to see those damn cats to begin with when it shows you the next one.</p>

<p>A Facebook spokesperson described the expansion of Suggested Posts to TechCrunch as an &#8220;extension&#8221; of the Instagram feed, noting that the ratio of these algorithmic recommendations to posts from followed accounts will be variable based on how someone uses the app.</p>
<p>The test will roll out to a small number of users in English-speaking countries only, though the company declined to specify how many accounts will be involved.</p>
<p>The experiment might not make it into the final product, but from the way the winds over at Facebook have been blowing lately it looks pretty likely. Like we mentioned, Instagram and parent company Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">introduced some tools</a> to give people more control over their own behavior on the notoriously addictive-by-design apps back in 2018, including the &#8220;You&#8217;re all caught up&#8221; message and a way to track time spent.</p>
<p>Those tools weren&#8217;t a sea change for a company that generally values keeping people glued to its services (and its ads) at all costs, but they showed that Facebook was at least mildly self aware of the conversation about social media addiction sweeping through the tech world at the time.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YI73QvuIWx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">Facebook and Instagram now show how many minutes you use them</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook and Instagram now show how many minutes you use them&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/embed/#?secret=YI73QvuIWx" data-secret="YI73QvuIWx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2020, it sounds like Facebook is done humoring those concerns. The new way Suggested Posts work is just a test for now, but mixing algorithmic suggestions into the feed with posts from accounts you follow would be a pretty big change to the core way the app works. As it stands, if people want a truly endless Instagram experience they could turn to the Explore tab or scroll past the &#8220;caught up&#8221; message. Many doubtless did to stave off boredom, to the likely<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/facebook-addiction-research/"> detriment of their mental health</a>.</p>
<p>But under the test, it will be less possible to use Instagram to only keep up with just the accounts that you&#8217;ve got a personal interest in, whether they&#8217;re friends, local businesses or influencers of your choosing. Instagram wants to inject more of what it wants you to see into that experience, or what the company believes you&#8217;d want to see but you just don&#8217;t know it yet.</p>
<p>The end result might not be that noticeable for people who follow huge swaths of accounts already and rarely meet the end of their feed, but it strays even further from the original product — a distant memory at this point — while giving Instagram a way to keep people on the app for longer while serving them more ads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five-year old self-driving truck startup Embark Trucks Inc. said Wednesday it would merge with special purpose acquisition company Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II in a deal valued at $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>Embark takes a different approach to autonomous trucking: As opposed to manufacturing and operating a fleet of trucks themselves, which is the route rival TuSimple is taking, Embark offers its AV software as a service. Carriers and fleets can pay a per-mile subscription fee to access it. The company includes carriers Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport, and companies Anheuser-Busch InBev and HP Inc., amongst its partners.</p>
<p>Carriers purchase trucks with compatible hardware directly from OEMs, so Embark says it has designed its system to be “platform agnostic” across multiple components and manufacturers. The company says its software can simulate up to 1,200 60-second scenarios per second, and make adaptive predictions using those scenarios for the behaviour of other vehicles on the road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Embark said in an investor presentation for the SPAC deal that it was targeting “driver-out,” or operating on roads without a safety driver, by 2023 and launching at a commercial scale across the American sunbelt the following year. However, Embark still has technical milestones yet to achieve, noting in the presentation that the software still needs to accomplish actions such as interactions with emergency vehicles, and responding to blown tires and other mechanical failures.</p>

<p>Upon closing, the transaction will inject Embark with around $615 million in gross cash proceeds, including $200 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from investors including CPP Investments, Knight-Swift Transportation, Mubadala Capital, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>Embark also said former Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was joining its board, likely a boon for a company operating in the autonomous trucking industry, which is still only authorized for commercial deployment in 24 states.</p>
<p>Embark was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak, who worked together on autonomous driving while completing engineering degrees from Canada&#8217;s University of Waterloo. After launching out of Y Combinator, the company quickly went on to raise $117 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series B led by Sequoia Capital and a $70 million Series C led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021. The company joins competitor AV trucking developer Plus in going public via a SPAC merger. TuSimple opted for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">traditional initial public offering</a> in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk/status/1407711650442924033">this Hunter Walk tweet</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1407711957449334789">the ensuing chatter</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong> recently sat down with <strong>Leading Investor</strong> from <strong>Well Known Firm</strong> to chat about their investing theses, the state of today&#8217;s venture capital market, and why prices are so high for early-stage startups.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been hunting down Leading Investor for some time, so it&#8217;s great to get their thoughts on today&#8217;s startup market and the larger venture capital industry. Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TechCrunch:</strong> To kick things off, the early-stage startup market has been super active lately. How has the accelerating cadence of deal-making impacted how you and Well Known Firm invest?</p>
<p><strong>Leading Investor:</strong> We&#8217;ve made no changes to our process. Everyone who has is weak of conviction and poor of wallet.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Got it, got it. The rapid-fire, early-stage market, though, does seem expensive at times. At least compared to historical norms. Are you worried about overpaying for nascent startup shares?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Every deal that we&#8217;ve been a part of has been fairly priced. Every deal that we didn&#8217;t win was overpriced. Every deal we didn&#8217;t see was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Cool. Sure. Let&#8217;s talk about the technology market more generally. Where are you seeing the most startup opportunity? Or perhaps more simply, where are you paying the most attention today for future deals?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Please consult our portfolio page. Here is a name of a startup we&#8217;ve backed. Here&#8217;s another. Those are the hot areas and the hot companies. All other areas are ice-cold, overpriced, and generally over-hyped.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Let me cut you off there to name drop Eric from Zoom, with whom I have a great relationship. Salesforce. Snowflake. On-demand pricing. Historical Twilio reference. Also have you read Recently Published Book? Someone gave me a copy and I read the dust cover. Books are good. I read them.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Right. Turning to the venture capital market, how competitive is Well Known Firm these days? Other firms are offering more services in addition to capital than you are. Does that impact your win rate in competitive deals?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Our firm&#8217;s services are real and impactful and accretive. Other VCs offer services but don&#8217;t deliver. You have to deliver. Delivery is key. We&#8217;re like the AWS of service delivery. Except free. We only demand the right to profit from founder success while enriching ourselves as the cost of our fine, free services.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> All right. Let&#8217;s talk about the exit market. We&#8217;ve seen a pretty active IPO market, and TechCrunch has heard that SPACs are getting incredibly frisky, even pinging Series B-funded companies in case they want to go public. What&#8217;s your take on that?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Here&#8217;s a generic answer that doesn&#8217;t answer your question but ensures that my portfolio companies continue to receive all possible inbound in case we need to float a company that won&#8217;t make it as a venture-backed, private company. Public investors are dumb and will happily hold our bags. They are the valets of the investing world.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Last question, how are returns at your firm? You&#8217;ve raised successively larger funds over the years. Is your IRR holding up as you&#8217;ve taken more capital under management?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Recall that Well Known Firm invested in Very Old Company, so our returns have historically been strong. Regarding Every Deal Since Then, it&#8217;s a bit too soon to tell. But recall Very Old Company that did well. That&#8217;s how we do things at Well Known Firm.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Sorry one more before we let you go. Your firm still only has male partners and nearly all of them are white. Why has progress been so slow in building a more diverse team at Well Known Firm?</p>
<p><strong>LI:</strong> Sorry, I have a hard stop that started 15 second ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The notorious Clop ransomware operation appears to be back in business, just days after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-ransomware-gang-suspects/"> Ukrainian police arrested six alleged members of the gang</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a law enforcement operation conducted by the National Police of Ukraine along with officials from South Korea and the U.S. saw the arrest of multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> It&#8217;s believed to be the first time a national law enforcement group carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group.</span></p>
<p>The Ukrainian police also claimed at the time to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang. But it doesn’t seem the operation was completely successful.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the Clop operation fell silent following the arrests, the gang has this week published a fresh batch of confidential data which it claims to have stolen from two new victims — a farm equipment retailer and an architects office — on its dark web site, seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If true — and neither of the alleged victims responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment — this would suggest that the ransomware gang remains active, despite last week’s first-of-its-kind law enforcement sting. This is likely because the suspects cuffed included only those who played a lesser role in the Clop operation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">Cybersecurity</a> firm Intel 471 said <a href="https://twitter.com/Intel471Inc/status/1405292359286358019">it believes</a> that last week&#8217;s arrests targeted the money laundering portion of the operation, with core members of the gang not apprehended.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not believe that any core actors behind Clop were apprehended,&#8221; the security company said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;The overall impact to Clop is expected to be minor although this law enforcement attention may result in the Clop brand getting abandoned as we&#8217;ve recently seen with other ransomware groups like DarkSide and Babuk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clop appears to still be in business, but it remains to be seen how long the group will remain operational. Not only have law enforcement operations dealt numerous blows to ransomware groups this year, such as U.S. investigators&#8217; recent recovery of millions in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> they claim was paid in ransom to the Colonial Pipeline hackers, but Russia has this week confirmed it will begin to work with the U.S. to locate cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Russia has until now taken a hands-off approach when it comes to dealing with hackers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-security-chief-says-moscow-will-cooperate-with-us-against-hackers-report-2021-06-23/">Reuters reported Wednesday</a> that the head of the country’s Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov was quoted as saying it will co-operate with U.S. authorities on future cybersecurity operations.</p>
<p>Intel 471 previously said that it does not believe the key members of Clop were arrested in last week’s operation because “they are probably living in Russia,&#8221; which has long provided safe harbor to cybercriminals by refusing to take action.</p>
<p>The Clop ransomware gang was first spotted in early 2019, and the group has since been linked to a number of high-profile attacks. These include the breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/">U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm</a> in April 2020 and the recent data breach at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a>, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider’s software to steal data from dozens of its customers including the University of Colorado and cloud security vendor Qualys.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video game giant Electronic Arts is continuing to make M&amp;A moves as it looks to bulk up its presence in the mobile gaming world.</p>
<p>Fresh off the $2.4 billion acquisition of Glu Mobile this past April, their biggest purchase to date, Electronic Arts announced Wednesday that they are buying Warner Bros. Games’ mobile gaming studio Playdemic for $1.4 billion in an all-cash deal. The Manchester studio is best known for its release &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/golf-clash/id1089225191">Golf Clash</a>&#8221; which the studio boasts has more than 80 million downloads globally.</p>
<p>The rather ominously-named startup is being jettisoned to its new home ahead of the $43 billion WarnerMedia-Discovery deal where the rest of the Warner Bros. Games division will live post-merger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Electronic Arts is the second-largest Western video games company with a market cap around $40 billion. Their success has largely come from desktop and console titles including titles in their most popular franchises like Battlefield, Star Wars and Titanfall. Mobile dominance hasn&#8217;t come easy to the company which has spent much of the past decade or so trying to keep pace with competitors like Activision Blizzard which struck gold with its 2016 King acquisition. <i></i></p>
<p>Electronic Arts has been on a studio buying spree as of late &#8212; in 2021 they&#8217;ve announced three major acquisitions worth some $5 billion combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s become increasingly obvious over the last few years, as Vladimir Putin has tightened his grip on his country, that Russian entrepreneurs who want to engage properly with the rest of the world have had to leave their mother country. Gone are the days when a startup in Russia might attract attention from many Western investors. The same, alas, is true of Russian-speaking Belorussians, many of whom have left the country after brutal crackdowns there. Ukraine’s economy also remains sub-par due to the ongoing Russian aggression in the East of the country. So it’s fallen to enterprising Russian-speaking investors in and outside Russia to work out the best ways to harness the obvious talent out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.leta.vc/">Leta Capital</a> makes a play of investing in Russian-speaking entrepreneurs based just about anywhere. It’s now launching its third and largest fund to date and says it will invest over $100 million in UK, European, and US-based growth-stage tech companies over the next three years. Its focus will be Seed/ Round A / Round B investments. It intends to invest in the range of $2-5 million and will be  focused on software, IT, and internet technologies</p>
<p>The new fund will to hone in on East European and Russian-speaking entrepreneurs. Particularly those operating out of international hubs such as London and New York.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leta’s founder and former tech entrepreneur Alexander Chachava says Russian-speaking startups based abroad are often &#8211; these days &#8211; over-looked and under-valued by Western VCs and investors, and I dare say he’s right. Prejudice isn’t just about skin color, as we all know.</p>
<p>Chachava says his fund has invested over $45 million to date since 2012, going into 30 technology companies including Synthesis AI, Unigine, InDriver,  NovaKid (which I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/">covered last year</a>) and 365Scores.</p>
<p>Exits include the sale of Bright Box HK to Zurich Insurance Group in 2017, and WeWork’s acquisition of sales and marketing platform Unomy.</p>
<p>Chachava said: “While we are significantly broadening our geographic focus towards key global hubs,  our strategy effectively remains the same: to identify exciting, high-potential technology start-ups and entrepreneurs, and support them in realizing their international ambitions.”</p>
<p>Chachava says his own research suggests there are in excess of 17,000 Russian-speaking and East European tech entrepreneurs and start-ups active in the UK, Europe, and US.</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows they continue to be undervalued and overlooked for funding, despite often generating significant cash when it comes to ARR. These entrepreneurs are some of the most dynamic and technically skilled in the world, and for investors, they represent a massive untapped opportunity.”</p>
<p>He has a point. Significant businesses such as Telegram, Revolut, TradingView, PandaDoc, and Preply were all started by Russian speakers who are emigres from their respective Russian-influenced countries.</p>
<p>Leta says its first “evergreen” fund of $15 million was fully deployed in early 2020, delivering a gross IRR of 27% per annum to investors. Its second $50 million fund had its first closing in September 2018 and has committed about 60% of its capital, says the company.</p>
<p>Leta will invest out of an entity in the Cayman Islands, but doesn&#8217;t plan to have an office right now, and nor will it need it to invest.</p>
<p>As Chachava told me over a Zoom call: &#8220;The last two years, we have not been not traveling too much, our work has been downgraded to Zoom calls. But before that, we spent a couple of months in the US, a couple of months in Western Europe. I was a frequent visitor to London but I don&#8217;t think we need space anymore in our modern world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turning the page from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">the early-stage venture capital market</a> to the super late-stage exit market, this morning we&#8217;re talking about endpoint security company SentinelOne&#8217;s IPO in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/sprinklr-raises-200m-on-2-7b-valuation-three-years-after-last-investment/">context of Sprinklr&#8217;s own</a>.

<hr />
<p>SentinelOne&#8217;s IPO, expected to price on June 29 and trade June 30, is a fascinating debut. Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat check for the IPO market. Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else. And this week, the company gave us an early dataset regarding its market value in the form of an IPO price range. This means we can do some unpacking and thinking.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>A reminder regarding why we dwell on the exit market for unicorns: We care because the value of late-stage startups when they reach a liquidity point helps set valuation comps for myriad smaller startups. Furthermore, the level of public-market enthusiasm for loss-making, growth-focused companies will determine the scale of returns for many a venture capitalist, founder and early employee.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s talk about SentinelOne&#8217;s cybersecurity IPO price range; Sprinklr&#8217;s social-media software debut will play foil.</p>
<h2>The price of growth</h2>
<p>It can make good sense to pay up for a quickly growing company&#8217;s shares. This is why you may hear of a startup raising an early-stage round at a very high revenue multiple.</p>
<p>Why put a $50 million price tag on a startup that just crossed the $1 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold? If it&#8217;s growing sufficiently quickly, the math can pencil out. If that startup was growing at 300% per year, say, the revenue multiple that you paid in the round valuing the startup at $50 million would fall sharply over the next year, at which point other investors would probably scramble to put more capital into the firm at a higher price.</p>
<p>Bingo! You just got a markup on your initial investment, and the company has found someone else to lead their next round at a higher price, giving it even more capital to keep its growth game going and make your early investment appear prescient. See? Venture capital is easy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The same general idea applies to companies going public. Growth matters, and the more rapidly a company is adding revenue, the more money it will be worth because investors can anticipate its future scale (within reason). Some companies that sport quick growth can have other issues that impact their value. Extensive debt, for example, a history of uneven growth, or deteriorating economics could come into play. Or simply very high losses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, LinkedIn&#8217;s engineering team <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/data-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> DataHub, a metadata tool it had built to help it organise, search and discover insights from its vast data trove. In 2020, LinkedIn <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/open-sourcing-datahub--linkedins-metadata-search-and-discovery-p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open sourced it</a>. Now, a startup co-founded by one of the creators of DataHub and by a former senior engineer from Airbnb who helped build the latter company&#8217;s Dataportal, is coming out of stealth &#8212; backed by LinkedIn, among others &#8212; to usher the DataHub platform into its latest chapter: commercialization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acryldata.io/company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acryl Data</a>, as the company is called, is launching today with $9 million led by 8VC, with LinkedIn and Insight also participating, to help other companies use the tools for their own big data needs.</p>
<p>The impetus for Acryl Data comes from the salient fact that big data, and specifically being able to organize, understand, make the most of fragmented big data troves (with information coming from and living in multiple places, be it Snowflake, or Databricks, or Looker, or something else altogether), is a challenge that impacts any organization that has a large digital component in its operations. Traditionally, big tech companies have been some of the more innovative in addressing that issue, with a number of them also open sourcing their technology to make it usable by others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The breakthrough for the founders of Acryl &#8212; discovered before they started the company, when they were still working at their respective big tech companies &#8212; was the realization that metadata held the key to organizing that big data information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting part about metadata is actually that it has become a big data problem,&#8221; said Shirshanka Das, the LinkedIn alum who is CEO and co-founded the company with Swaroop Jagadish (the Airbnb alum who is CTO). &#8220;And so all of the data infrastructure DNA that we have, in terms of building large-scale data collections, streaming, indexing, searching &#8212; those all need metadata management solutions that can actually scale to the demands of the modern enterprise. That, I think, is really our secret sauce, that we&#8217;ve been able to build a metadata platform that takes in all the best practices of doing data infrastructure right, and applied it to doing metadata infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an open source project, DataHub has picked up some significant traction. In addition to LinkedIn itself, Expedia, Saxo Bank, Klarna and many others are using the framework &#8212; essentially a generalized metadata search and discovery tool &#8212; to build their own metadata graph to connect their various data entities together. Altogether the project has racked up <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/datahub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 3,200 GitHub stars</a> and has more than a 100 contributors.</p>
<p>Acryl Data, like other open source commercialization efforts, is setting out to build a toolset that will make that framework easier to scale and apply in more use cases, particularly at those companies that might lack the resources to build these implementations on their own. The first of these, it says, will be a data catalogue that is based on design learnings from Airbnb&#8217;s Dataportal. LinkedIn will be collaborating with Acryl Data, along with the wider open source community, on future products.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn’s unique view of the global economy provides us with the opportunity to improve economic outcomes for hundreds of millions of people around the world through data-driven insights and AI-powered products. To discover the right data, navigate the tens of thousands of derived datasets that our researchers and engineers use every day and manage them well, we rely on DataHub,&#8221; said Igor Perisic, Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Acryl Data to continue to advance DataHub with them.”</p>
<p>The opportunity is a big one. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collibra</a>, a competitor in the same space, last year raised a round at a $2.3 billion valuation. Another, Alation, was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/snowflake-backed-data-startup-alation-valued-at-1-2-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1.2 billion</a> earlier this month. But with a lot of space for innovation left, it&#8217;s interesting to see the people who built some of the most foundational tools in the space getting stuck in as entrepreneurs themselves to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>“The modern data stack needs a fundamental rethink in how metadata is managed,&#8221; said Insight Partners MD George Mathew, in a statement. &#8220;We believe a next-generation, real-time metadata platform is needed, and Acryl Data is the best team to lead this transformation based on their groundbreaking work with DataHub.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin, Ford&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary, has launched its first custom designed and built electric scooter. The company says the S-100T scooters are its safest and longest lasting, two qualities that it hopes will attract the attention of cities as it aims its strategy at exclusive partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company launches its service in Sacramento in July, it&#8217;ll deploy 25 of the new S-100T scooters along with its existing fleet. Spin hopes to scale to 350 S-100Ts by August and have more than a few thousand in the market by the end of the year, according to a spokesperson for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S-100T joins Spin&#8217;s other vehicles, the original S-100, the three-wheeler S-200 and a new e-bike, which are manufactured in partnership with Segway-Ninebot and Okai. Spin will continue these partnerships in order to maintain a diverse fleet.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin has been working on its own scooter since 2019, when many of the scooters on the road came off-the-shelf and fell apart fast. A Los Angeles Times report found </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA-area Bird scooters lasted only 126 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that time, the founders decided to really set a new standard not only for Spin itself, but also for the industry on what e-scooter durability should be,” Maxime Veron, VP of product at Spin, told TechCrunch. “So we really set out to create the toughest scooter out there, and that has been the north star for the design, build and testing of the S-100T.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘T’ stands for ‘tough,’ Veron added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we really tested it, tortured it, I should say, way beyond the expectation of the industry, and that’s why we expect it to last twice as long as other e-scooters,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin expects the S-100T to last over three years, compared to about 18 months for its S-100. The company reached this estimated lifespan after performing 400 different safety and durability tests, many of which involved pulverizing the vehicle and making it withstand temperatures from -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 149 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low life expectancy of scooters is one of the main reasons why it’s been so hard for companies to achieve profitability, which is why Spin is focusing its scooter design around durability. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Durability is the biggest lever we have in terms of profitability,” said Veron. “It’s gonna help both our bottom line in terms of making sure that the scooters last longer, and our top line of attracting customers who will love the ride.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veron says the S-100T is designed to be modular, with a single frame design that’s durable and allows for easy repairs and parts replacements, which should help with lifespan and sustainability of the vehicle. Perhaps one day, both the design and Spin’s ownership of the vehicles will also help the company come up with a good end-of-life strategy and design for recyclability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Durability has been the number one, but we will be able over time to improve on all the key checkpoints including end-of-life because we control it all,” said Veron.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoughtful and high-quality product design is no longer optional. Gone are the days that a startup could launch with a bare-bones app or website. The demand side of the design equation has only grown — consumers are used to beautiful, intuitive products — while the supply side is struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>How are startups supposed to educate themselves in product design, hire the right people for those positions and think about product design as a core piece of their business?</p>
<p>A good starting point is an upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising session</a> with Scott Tong on July 8 &amp; 9.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tong was a principal designer at IDEO, a co-founder at IFTTT, head of product design at Pinterest, an EIR at IMO Ventures and is now a startup advisor at Design Fund.</p>
<p>When it comes to thoughtfully crafting products, and ensuring that those designs fit in line with the company&#8217;s broader short and long-term goals, there is perhaps no one better suited to show us how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Tong joins a long list of experts in a variety of startup core competencies who will be speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage in July</a>. That list includes <strong>Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal</strong> (Product Market Fit Is All About Tempo), <strong>Coatue&#8217;s Caryn Marooney</strong> (formerly Facebook&#8217;s head of comms) and <strong>Superhuman&#8217;s Rahul Vohra</strong> (Growth Hacking). You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">check out the agenda here</a>.</p>
<p>The coolest part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage</a> is that all sessions are designed with plenty of time for audience Q&amp;A, so founders can get specific, tailored advice about their own business challenges.</p>
<p>These mini-bootcamps kick off in just two weeks so we hope you&#8217;ll be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage</a>&#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">Grab your ticket here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all that&#8217;s said about fundraising and working alongside investors, rarely do we get to see founders and their investors in candid conversation with one another. Extra Crunch Live is changing that. On the weekly live show, we sit down with founders and the VCs who funded them to talk about how they came together on the deal, what stood out about the other party that led to their commitment and how they operate today. We also (usually) take a walk through their early pitch decks to get a feel for how success starts.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Emergence&#8217;s Lotti Siniscalco and Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong to discuss all that and more. The event goes down on Wednesday, June 23 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">You can register to attend right here.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco is a principal at Emergence Capital, investing in early-stage enterprise software companies. She currently serves on the board of directors at Whistic and High Alpha. Prior to Emergence, she was an investor in financial services and technology at Advent International, a PE firm, and led diligence for Ribbit Capital (also fintech focused) before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, she&#8217;s an expert in fintech and can bring a wealth of wisdom to our conversation around fundraising and startup growth.</p>
<p>Melissa Wong, on the other hand, has spent 10 years in retail communications at Old Navy. It was here that she realized a problem that Zipline Retail, a retail communication and store execution platform, could solve and set out on her own venture.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members can access the content on demand. We do these every week, so there are scores of episodes across a wide variety of startup sectors in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL Library</a>. It&#8217;s but one of many reasons to become an Extra Crunch member. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working on an H-1B in the U.S. for nearly two years. While I’m grateful to have made it through the H-1B lottery and to be working, I’m feeling unhappy and frustrated with my job. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I really want to start something of my own and work on my own terms in the United States. Are there any immigration options that would allow me to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Seeking Satisfaction</strong></p>
<p>Dear Seeking,</p>
<p>Job dissatisfaction and frustration while on H-1B is normal, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardgorbis/">Edward Gorbis</a>. He is the founder of <a href="https://www.careermeetsworld.com/">Career Meets World</a> and a performance coach who specifically works with immigrants and first-generation professionals to help them find fulfillment and thrive in their careers and life. I recently spoke with him for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/076-coaching-immigrant-leaders-with-edward-gorbis/">my podcast</a>, “Immigration Law For Tech Startups.”</p>
<p>He says that “once immigrants reach stability, they start to think, ‘Who am I, what do I value, what’s my core identity?’” He partners with people to help them to gain a better understanding of why they think the way they do, teach them how our brain really works, and then reshape and retrain the brain for success.</p>
<p>Gorbis says that imagining overcoming the hurdles that stand in the way of doing the work that will fulfill you is the first step. So, here are some options that can help you imagine how to move toward building the life of your dreams.</p>

<h2>Raise $250,000 and be the CEO</h2>
<p>A great new option for aspiring entrepreneurs is <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a>, a new immigration program in the United States that allows CEOs, CTOs and others to obtain a 2.5-year immigration status. You can live in the U.S. and run your company. Your spouse can work and you could be eligible for a 2.5-year extension.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Entrepreneur-Parole.pdf?7fd8bf&amp;7fd8bf">How to qualify?</a> You’ll need to own at least 10% of a U.S. company, such as a Delaware C corporation registered in California. Ideally, you’ll want to show that your company bank account has at least $250,000 raised from qualifying U.S. investors prior to applying, but you can demonstrate other evidence to show that your company has the potential to grow rapidly and create jobs in the U.S.</p>
<h2>See yourself at another company</h2>
<p>There is technically no limit on how many <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> employers you can have or how many hours you work — or how few hours you work — in an H-1B position. So, think about other companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security compliance is precisely three things: incredibly boring, time consuming, and entirely necessary to run a business in the modern age. Compliance isn&#8217;t going away, but startups like Drata are making it slightly easier to bear.</p>
<p>Drata helps companies get their SOC 2 compliance quicker by using automation. SOC 2 is a certification used to show that a company can store customer data in the cloud securely, but the process is notoriously complex and can take months to complete — and you have to do it all over again every year. That&#8217;s particularly burdensome for startups and smaller firms.</p>
<p>Drata says it can get companies SOC 2-compliant faster and keep them in compliance for longer by integrating with popular business tools and cloud services to get a better picture of a company&#8217;s security posture.</p>
<p>Now with a new round of $25 million at Series A in the bank, Drata said it&#8217;s expanding its compliance platform to also include ISO 27001, another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-bug-bounty-programs-with-katie-moussouris/">core security standard</a> used all over the world to help companies protect their systems and safeguard data.</p>
<p>The round landed six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/drata-raises-3-2m-for-its-compliance-audit-platform/">its $3.2 million seed round</a> in January, and was led by GGV Capital, with participation from Silicon Valley CISO Investors, Okta Ventures, Cowboy Ventures, Leaders Fund, and SV Angel.</p>
<p>Drata CEO and co-founder Adam Markowitz told TechCrunch that the company is growing on average 100% month-over-month since it launched out of stealth and is serving hundreds of customers, including three-person startups to publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The startup joins several other companies in the compliance space. Secureframe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/secureframe-series-a-cybersecurity-compliance/">raised $18 million</a> at Series A in March to offer SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications. Strike Graph raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/strike-graph-raises-3-9m-to-help-automate-security-audits/">a $3.9 million seed round</a> last year to help companies automate security audits and get FedRamp certification needed to provide technology to the federal government. And, Startup Battlefield participant Osano in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/osano-series-a/">raised $5.4 million</a> at Series A to build out its risk and compliance platform.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this article misstated the company&#8217;s location. It is based in San Diego, not Boston.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> represent the two most successful cloud companies in their respective categories. Over the last few years the two cloud giants have had an evolving partnership. Today they announced plans for a new set of integration capabilities to make it easier to share data and build applications that cross the two platforms.</p>
<p>Patrick Stokes, EVP and GM for Platform at Salesforce, points out that the companies have worked together in the past to provide features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-to-bring-amazon-connect-to-service-cloud/">like secure sharing</a> between the two services, but they were hearing from customers that they wanted to take it further and today&#8217;s announcement is the first step towards making that happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The initial phases of the partnership] have really been massively successful. We&#8217;re learning a lot from each other and from our mutual customers about the types of things that they want to try to accomplish, both within the Salesforce portfolio of products, as well as all the Amazon products, so that the two solutions complement each other really nicely. And customers are asking us for more, and so we&#8217;re excited to enter into this next phase of our partnership,&#8221; Stokes explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;The goal really is to unify our platforms, so bring [together] all the power of the Amazon services with all of the power of the of the Salesforce platform.&#8221; These capabilities could be the next step in accomplishing that.</p>

<p>This involves a couple of new features the companies are working on to help developers on both the platform and application side of the equation. For starters that includes enabling developers to virtualize Amazon data inside Salesforce without having to do all the coding to make that happen manually.</p>
<p>&#8220;More specifically, we&#8217;re going to virtualize Amazon data within the Salesforce platform, so whether you&#8217;re working with an S3 bucket, Amazon RDS or whatever it is we&#8217;re going to make it so that that the data is virtualized and just appears just like it&#8217;s native data on the Salesforce platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, developers building applications on Amazon will be able to access Salesforce data and have it appear natively in Amazon. This involves providing connectors between the two systems to make the data flow smoothly without a lot of coding to make that happen.</p>
<p>The companies are also announcing event sharing capabilities, which makes it easier for both Amazon and Salesforce customers to build microservices-based applications that cross both platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can build microservices-oriented architecture that spans the services of Salesforce and Amazon platforms, again without having to write any code. To do that, [we&#8217;re developing] out of the box connectors so you can click and drag the events that you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies are also announcing plans to make it easier from an identity and access management perspective to access the platforms with a guided setup. Finally, the companies are working on applications to build Amazon Chime communications tooling into Service Cloud and other Salesforce services to build things like virtual call centers using AWS machine learning technology.</p>
<p>Amazon VP of Global Marketing Rachel Thorton says that having the two cloud giants work together in this way should make it easier for developers to create solutions that span the two platforms. &#8220;I just think it unlocks such possibilities for developers, and the faster and more innovative developers can be, it just unlocks opportunities for businesses, and creates better customer experiences,&#8221; Thornton said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce also has extensive partnerships with other cloud providers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/salesforce-announces-its-moving-marketing-cloud-to-microsoft-azure/">including Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/salesforce-deepens-data-sharing-partnership-with-google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p>As is typically the case with Salesforce announcements, while all of these capabilities are being announced today, they are still in the development stage and won&#8217;t go into beta testing until later this year with GA expected sometime next year. The companies are expected to release more details about the partnership at Dreamforce and re:Invent, their respective customer conferences later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://frumtak.is/english/">Frumtak  Ventures</a>, one of the few VCs in Iceland, has raised its third fund, Frumtak III. The $57 million (ISK 7b, €48m) fund will focus on post-seed and Series A startups.  The firm says its typical ticket size will range from $1-5 million (€850k-4.2m).</p>
<p>Frumtak was a somewhat lesser-known European VC until it popped up on our radar as the backers behind the Controlant real-time supply chain monitoring startup, the technology from which was pictured beside Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, when he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/icelands-controlant-with-50m-backing-emerges-as-key-player-in-cold-chain-for-covid-19-vaccine/">held up a box containing the first-ever shipment</a> of the COVID-19 vaccine to the city. Controlant has been a key player in the global distribution cold chain associated with vaccines.</p>
<p>However, the fund has also backed digital banking solutions provider Meniga, digital therapeutics scaleup Sidekick Health, travel CRM and travel booking system provider Kaptio, live event and fan engagement data analytics company Activity Stream, and Data Market, which was acquired by Qlik in  2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Svana Gunnarsdottir, managing partner of Frumtak Ventures said: “We are proud of the accomplishments of our portfolio companies and their teams, as well as the investment decisions we made through our first two funds. We look forward to continuing our support of high-potential startups and brilliant founders with Frumtak III.  We are also grateful  for the confidence shown to us by our LP’s, many of whom have been with us since our first fund in 2009.”</p>
<p>Concurrently, Asthildur Otharsdottir has joined the firm as partner and Frumtak III’s lead investment manager.  Otharsdottir was previously Frumtak’s Chairman for 6 years and has been on the board of Marel and Icelandair Group.</p>

<p>It’s now raised $240 million in a round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 to expand its trade shipments between China and Europe. Forto manages shipping containers from origin to destination. Softbank is also hedging its bets after investing in China&#8217;s Full Truck Alliance (YMM.N), which plans a $20 billion IPO.</p>
<p>That means Forto’s valuation close to $1.2 billion, after it’s raised a total of $360 million. Also participating in the round were new investors Citi Ventures and G Squared. Existing investors including Northzone, Cherry Ventures and Unbound also took part, Forto said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>German logistics startups are proliferating. Trucking specialist Sennder, a digital road freight forwarder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/digital-road-freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-160m-series-plans-european-expansion/">raised</a> $160 million in Series D financing earlier this year.</p>
<p>Forto says it has 2,500 clients, including Home 24 and German supermarket chain Edeka, and ships up to 10,000 containers a year by sea, rail and air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.planetscale.com/">PlanetScale</a>, the company behind the open-source <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> database clustering system for MySQL that was first developed at YouTube, today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B funding round led by Insight Partners, with participation from a16z and SignalFire. With this, the company has now raised a total of $55 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/planetscale">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes only a few weeks after PlanetScale launched its new hosted database platform, also dubbed PlanetScale. The company had previously offered a hosted version of Vitess, but with this new service, it is going a step further and offering what it calls a &#8220;developer-first database&#8221; that abstracts away all of the infrastructures to ensure that developers won&#8217;t have to think about cloud zones, cluster sizes and other details.</p>
<p>Indeed, PlanetScale CEO and co-founder Jiten Vaidya was quite open about the limitations of this earlier product. &#8220;What we had built last year was pretty much hosted Vitess, which was no different than how a lot of cloud providers today give you databases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So none of this ease of use, none of this elegance, none of these state-of-the-art experiences that the developers want and expect today, we had built into our product.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But a few months ago, the company brought on former GitHub VP of Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isamlambert/">Sam Lambert</a> as its Chief Product Officer. Vaidya noted that Lambert brought a lot of developer empathy to PlanetScale and helped it launch this new product.</p>
<p>&#8220;People come to you because they&#8217;re not database experts, but they have data, they have problems,&#8221; Lambert said. &#8220;And too many companies, especially in the database world, do not think about the daily lives of their users like we do. They don&#8217;t think about the complete journey of what the user is actually trying to do, which is to provide value to their customers. They&#8217;re just very impressed with themselves for storing and retrieving data. And it&#8217;s like, yep, we&#8217;ve been doing that. We&#8217;ve been doing that since the 60s. Can we do something else now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s users today include the likes of Slack, Figma, GitHub and Square, so it&#8217;s clearly delivering value to a lot of users. As Lambert noted, PlanetScale aims to offer them a product that is simple and easy to use. &#8220;Just because it is simple and easy to use, and beautiful, honestly &#8212; like just beautiful, well-designed tooling &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s inferior. It doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s missing anything. It means the others are missing the poetry and the additional elements of beauty that you can add to infrastructure products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>PlanetScale plans to use the new funding to scale its team globally and accelerate the adoption of its platform. Insight Partners Managing Director Nikhil Sachdev will join the company&#8217;s board, with the firm&#8217;s Managing Director Praveen Akkiraju also joining as a board observer.</p>
<p>&#8220;PlanetScale is setting a new bar for simplicity, performance and scalability for cloud-based databases in the serverless era,&#8221; said Sachdev. &#8220;The developer experience for databases has been painful for too long. PlanetScale is breaking that chain, solving longstanding problems related to scalability and reliability in an extremely elegant, tasteful, and useful way.&#8221;</p>
