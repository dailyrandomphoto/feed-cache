										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of the problems we face today in biology and agriculture have been faced before — but not by humans. Somewhere in nature there is a microscopic creature that accomplishes naturally and efficiently what chemists and bioengineers are struggling to do at all — and <a href="https://www.plutonbio.com">Pluton Biosciences</a> claims to have pioneered a way to find that creature, and others like it. They&#8217;ve already demonstrated anti-mosquito and carbon sequestering methods, and more are on the way.</p>
<p>All over the planet, inside and outside of plants and animals, embedded in the soil, are bacteria and other microorganisms totally unknown to science. Yet the few that humans have learned to culture and control, such as lactobacilli and E.coli, have been transformative, allowing all kinds of new foods, discoveries, and industrial processes. But however useful they are, they&#8217;re only a handful out of a near-infinite variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a trillion species of microbes, and we only use a couple of them,&#8221; said Pluton founder and CTO Barry Goldman, who spent nearly two decades at Monsanto looking into similar ideas. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to use that huge reservoir of biodiversity out there to solve big problems. Nature spent 2 billion years trying to solve them, so let&#8217;s let nature tell us the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pivot Bio rakes in $430M round D as modified microbes prove their worth in agriculture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pivot-bio-rakes-in-430m-round-d-as-modified-microbes-prove-their-worth-in-agriculture/embed/#?secret=JKmiuBqMqE" data-secret="JKmiuBqMqE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course Goldman is not the first to try to crack the planet&#8217;s untapped intellectual property holdings, if you will, and in fact Pluton&#8217;s approach is remarkably old-school. Basically, you grab a handful of soil or another medium rich in microbes, and test it to find whether it does anything interesting.</p>
<p>If that sounds a bit vague, well, it is — but done systematically it&#8217;s a huge source of new material. The problem, as Goldman explained, was simply that back when people were (literally) mining the earth to find the next penicillin, &#8220;they could never bring it down to a single organism and sequence it.&#8221; They knew that somewhere in this cubic centimeter of soil was a critter producing an antibiotic, or nitrogen-fixing, or insulin-producing effect — they could measure it! — but they didn&#8217;t have the tools to isolate it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That missing next step, where researchers left of decades ago, is what Pluton claims to have solved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core tech is creating small populations of organisms that no one knows how to grow individually, but you can still test their effect,&#8221; said CEO Steve Slater. &#8220;It allows us to access and grow the 99.999 percent of microbes that are not currently culturable, and sequence them of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Goldman and Slater were understandably reticent to talk about the specifics of their platform, their early successes speak to the efficacy of the approach, and <a href="https://www.plutonbio.com/post/pluton-biosciences-raises-6-6-million-in-seed-round-funding">a $6.6 million seed round</a> shows investors are convinced as well. (Another win for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/illuminas-accelerator-has-an-impressive-93-percent-follow-on-funding-rate-herere-its-latest-picks/">Illumina&#8217;s accelerator picks</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Illumina&#8217;s accelerator has an impressive 93 percent follow-on funding rate &#8212; here&#8217;re its latest picks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/illuminas-accelerator-has-an-impressive-93-percent-follow-on-funding-rate-herere-its-latest-picks/embed/#?secret=A1anX1BFrd" data-secret="A1anX1BFrd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The key is knowing how to select or screen for whatever phenotype [i.e. measurable characteristics of an organism] it is you care about, whether it&#8217;s sequestering carbon or killing insects or fungi, then rapidly getting down to the set of organisms or genes that are performing that particular function,&#8221; said Slater. By a unique process they are able to perform this isolation process and get the sequencing done on organisms of interest.</p>
<p>To prove the validity of this &#8220;Micromining engine,&#8221; they explained that they decided to search for a natural pesticide that acts on mosquitoes, which are of course a serious threat in many regions. As Slater put it: &#8220;We asked, can we find novel, uncharacterized microbes that have the ability to kill mosquitoes? Yes, and it was actually pretty straightforward — we literally did it in months, and they came out of Barry&#8217;s backyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it seems remarkable that such a discovery was just lying in wait literally under the founder&#8217;s nose, you may be underestimating the extent of biodiversity in microorganisms. It&#8217;s one of those &#8220;surprising science facts&#8221; we don&#8217;t pay much attention to, but that sounds familiar — that a shovel full of soil contains a gazillion organisms, or a million species never seen by science, etc. We all absorb that and think, &#8220;Yes, life is everywhere, very inspiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>But these aren&#8217;t just organisms differing by a fraction of a percent in their genome — bacteria and other microbes are amazingly diverse and change quickly, and instantly fill niches we had no idea existed, finding a way to live off the castoff molecules of fructose production in a plant or a bit of warmth and decaying matter below the surface. Any one of these vastly different organisms may very well have developed on its own a novel chemical pathway that could transform food production, drug manufacturing, or agriculture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latter that Pluton is concerned with. The agriculture sector, like many others, is (driven by several motives) looking at how to reduce its carbon emissions. Pluton is working with Bayer AG on a microbe-based soil additive that could accomplish a number of things all by simply amplifying the effects of organisms likely already present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our proof-of-concept research predicts that the right grouping of microbes, applied in a spray at planting and harvest, can scrub nearly two tons of carbon from the air per acre of farmland per year, while replenishing nutrients in the soil,&#8221; the company says.</p>

<p>And the mosquito treatment could be commercialized as well as a naturally derived pesticide that&#8217;s more effective than many out there today that the insect has developed a resistance to.</p>
<p>Other companies are working along parallel lines. On one hand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pivot-bio-rakes-in-430m-round-d-as-modified-microbes-prove-their-worth-in-agriculture/">Pivot Biosciences</a> has raised an enormous amount of money to in essence make microbes in soil produce their own fertilizer. And <a href="https://www.hexagonbio.com/news/hexagon-bio-to-advance-novel-small-molecule-medicines/">Hexagon Bio</a> also recently raised on a similar proposition of locating naturally occurring molecules for use in drug development. In other words, Nature&#8217;s vault is being raided — but it&#8217;s not about to run dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the hardest thing to explain to investors,&#8221; said Goldman. &#8220;How do you explain the scale of a trillion species?&#8221;</p>
<p>All the same they seem to have had some success, as evidenced by the $6.6M seed. It was led by Oakland&#8217;s Better Ventures, with participation from the Grantham Foundation, Fall Line Capital, First In Ventures, Wing Venture Capital and Yield Lab Institute. The money should allow Pluton to start operating like a real company — moving part time staff to full time, building out the lab, and so on. They might even consider moving beyond the biodiversity of Goldman&#8217;s backyard.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Let’s be really generous to Facebook and assume that 50% of what Frances Haugen just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">testified</a> to before Congress was misconstrued in some way.</p>
<p>Regardless, Facebook will argue their case (as they always do), deny everything (as they always do) and claim that no one really understands them (as they always do). Everyone will view whatever they say with extreme skepticism, and nothing will change.</p>
<p>Maybe Facebook doesn’t care. Maybe the possibility of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/section-230-health-misinformation-act/">repeal of their liability</a> protection from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the threat of antitrust prosecutions, the implementation of a U.S. privacy framework akin to what exists in Europe and the inability to get Washington to authorize Libra (Facebook’s digital payment system) all don’t matter.</p>
<p>Facebook is rich and powerful. They may think they can handle anything that comes their way. But the United States government and the media combined are a lot more powerful. And that’s why Facebook needs to change their strategy on just about everything related to politics, regulation and media.</p>
<p>While Facebook’s lawyers and lobbyists dig in for the next phase of an epic, costly confrontation, they should instead be charting an alternative course of humility, introspection and transparency as their best and only strategy for sustaining growth.</p>
<p>What does this look like? Well, it starts with an apology.</p>
<p>It’s incredible that someone as smart as Mark Zuckerberg can have so much difficulty expressing genuine contrition when it’s called for. Not every mistake will obligate the CEO to drag himself over the coals. But right now? He’s got to change his posture and start accepting responsibility and then actually implement real change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, take Haugen’s testimony about an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">internal study</a> finding that Instagram has a negative impact on teenage girls’ mental health.</p>
<p>That’s a problem Facebook <em>has</em> to own. They should <em>want</em> to own it. Because even if the federal government is unlikely to step in and censor Instagram, parents probably will. As much as my wife and I try to let our teenage daughter make her own decisions, the more we know about Instagram, the more convinced we are that its negative effects vastly outweigh any useful purpose it serves in her life. And we’re not alone. At some point soon, we could be the majority.</p>
<p>Second, it’s time for Facebook to be a lot more straightforward about its underlying business model. Consumers aren’t stupid; we know we don’t get something for nothing. So rather than pretend they don’t monetize people’s data in every way possible, Facebook should just be honest about it.</p>
<p>“If you want to keep using Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp for free, we’re going to sell ads based on your data.” And then give the public an alternative: “If you want your data protected, then you have to pay the platform a monthly fee to make up for the lost revenue.” People may not like that at first, but they’ll understand it and they’ll appreciate being treated like adults.</p>
<p>Third, Facebook needs to admit the truth about content moderation: “We thought we knew better than everyone else about everything; we dug in when we should have been honestly examining and changing our practices and policies. We’re genuinely, truly sorry for it. We’re willing to change.”</p>
<p>Some of that may mean sharing oversight responsibilities with third parties like regulators and academics. It probably means eliminating some content that generates clicks and ad revenue. It may even mean removing some of the top executives responsible for doggedly implementing the deny-reality strategy over the past 10 years. Of course, that will hurt. They still need to do it.</p>
<p>Finally, if Facebook is going to engage in federal legislation around issues like privacy restrictions, new antitrust standards or the repeal of Section 230, they should stop trying to outsmart and outspend everyone.</p>
<p>Instead, Facebook should engage with their critics &#8212; in both parties and in both chambers of Congress &#8212; to work toward a solution that embraces the ideals of existing privacy frameworks like Europe’s GDPR and California’s CCPA and recognizes that having full immunity from anything said on your platform has to change. Be part of the change, not the roadblock to it.</p>
<p>This isn’t China. Our government won’t just one day outlaw Facebook or Instagram. But that doesn’t mean Facebook won’t be subjected to new laws, regulations, standards and social norms.</p>
<p>Facebook has alienated the media. They’ve lost the progressives. They’ve lost the conservatives. They’ve infuriated the center. And even if revenue keeps growing, they’ve lost the faith and trust of the public, too.</p>
<p>Executives may worry that once the legislative flywheel starts turning, it will never stop. But we’re way beyond that point. If Facebook doesn’t start expressing remorse, accountability and openness to change, they’re at risk of losing everything else they’ve built, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced several <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en">new audio features</a> on Thursday, some of which have already ready rolled out while others will launch in the coming months. Starting today, creators have the ability to enable live auto-captions for any live streams in English to make streams more accessible. This feature was previously only available to creators with more than 1,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>YouTube plans to expand live auto-captions to all 13 supported captioning languages in the coming months. The supported languages include Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The company is also currently testing the ability to add multiple audio tracks on videos to help provide multi-language audio for international audiences along with descriptive audio for people with vision impairments. The feature is currently available to a small group of creators. YouTube plans to roll out the feature more widely in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>YouTube is also rolling out auto-translation for captions in supported languages on Android and iOS later this year. The feature is currently only available on the desktop version of the platform. Further, YouTube plans give users the option to search through transcripts on Android and iOS. Later this year, YouTube will test the ability for users to search for specific keywords within transcripts on mobile.</p>
<p>Additionally, YouTube is working on new channel permissions in YouTube Studio that allow creators to delegate caption and subtitle creation on their videos to someone they trust. The company previously announced this feature under the name ‘Subtitle Editor&#8217; and has acknowledged that the rollout of the feature is taking longer than expected. YouTube notes that it’s actively working on the feature and plans to keep creators updated in the coming months.</p>
<p>“Improving accessibility is a top priority for YouTube, and we hope these updates will help creators reach a wider audience,” the company stated in a community blog post.</p>
<p>YouTube first launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/04/youtube-launches-auto-captions-for-all-videos/">auto-captions in 2010</a> and has since worked to improve them and make them more widely available. The company brought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/26/youtube-live-gains-automatic-captions-chat-replay-and-more/">auto-captions to YouTube Live</a> in 2018. YouTube is among many other platforms working to launch more features geared towards improving captions in order to make their platforms more inclusive and accessible. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok added auto-captions</a> to its videos earlier this year while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/instagram-adds-a-captions-option-for-stories-and-soon-reels/">Instagram added a captions option</a> for Stories around the same time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose high-profile antitrust lawsuit against Apple<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/"> is now under appeal,</a> is today <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1445896711679840265">calling out</a> the iPhone maker for giving itself access to an advertising slot its competitors don&#8217;t have: the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen. Some iOS 15 users noticed Apple is now advertising its own services at the top of their Settings, just below their Apple ID. The services being suggested are personalized to the device owner, based on which ones they already subscribe to, it appears.</p>
<p>For example, those without an Apple Music subscription may see an ad offering a free six-month trial. However, current Apple Music subscribers may instead see a prompt to add on a service they don&#8217;t yet have, like AppleCare coverage for their devices.</p>
<p>Sweeney suggests this sort of first-party advertising is an anticompetitive risk for Apple, as some of the services it&#8217;s pushing here are those that directly compete with third-party apps published on its App Store. But those third-party apps can&#8217;t gain access to the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen, of course &#8212; they can only bid for ad slots within the App Store itself.</p>
<p>Writes Sweeney: &#8220;New from the guys who banned Fortnite: settings-screen ads for their own music service, which come before the actual settings, and which aren’t available to other advertisers like Spotify or Sound Cloud.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New from the guys who banned Fortnite: settings-screen ads for their own music service, which come before the actual settings, and which aren’t available to other advertisers like Spotify or Sound Cloud. “It’s all about the customers!” <a href="https://t.co/p9FNpXT1Rx">https://t.co/p9FNpXT1Rx</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1445896711679840265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sweeney had been retweeting another post by Mobile Dev Memo analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_seufert">Eric Seufert</a>, who himself was sharing an image credited to Glassfy co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/zuck_fredo">Francesco Zucchetta</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zucchetta tells TechCrunch he spotted the ad on an iPhone 8 he owned which was running iOS 15. But others have seen the ads on newer devices, as well. And some respondents noted they <a href="https://twitter.com/simoarcher/status/1445989349548560384">were receiving</a> Apple&#8217;s promotions as push notifications, too.</p>
<p>The issue here is tricky because the promotion isn&#8217;t always a situation where Apple is disadvantaging a rival to its own benefit.</p>
<p>For example, on an iPhone 13 Pro Max we have which is running iOS 15.1, the prompt was used to inform us we still had a certain number of days left to add AppleCare+ coverage. (We already have most of Apple&#8217;s other subscriptions.). But in this case, there aren&#8217;t third-party apps offering a direct competitor to AppleCare, in the same way that Spotify directly competes with Apple Music. Instead, warranty companies like Asurion<a href="https://twitter.com/eric_seufert"> partner with mobile carriers</a> like AT&amp;T and Verizon to sell their iPhone insurance plans, instead of selling direct to consumers through the App Store.</p>
<p>Some might even argue that a reminder to add warranty coverage is a useful feature, not an unwanted intrusion.</p>
<p>While Sweeney&#8217;s tweet has raised awareness of the first-party promotions in Settings, they are not new.</p>
<p>Apple has often used the iPhone&#8217;s Settings screen to market its services to its customers in much of the same way as it&#8217;s doing now.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, it was spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1327979418954977283">running promotions for Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyrodgersis/status/1420152172939857923">AppleCare</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/austinnotduncan/status/1243343916398592000">Apple TV+ </a><a href="https://twitter.com/robleathern/status/1230173595579498496">in Settings</a>. Outside of this screen, Apple has also promoted its own services in other unusual ways, including through the use of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/16/apple-music-referral-notifications-disable/">push notifications</a>. And it has cross-promoted its services inside its own apps for years &#8212; like <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250837726">prompts to subscribe to Apple Music</a> while using <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-hide-apple-music-itunes-2941858">iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>But regulators today are taking a closer look at platforms and how they&#8217;re using or abusing their market power. Google is currently <a href="https://twitter.com/simoarcher/status/1445989349548560384">appealing a record penalty in the EU</a> for its requirement that device manufacturers preinstall Google&#8217;s suite of apps with the phones they sell. Samsung, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed">said it would stop</a> running ads in its first-party apps on Galaxy devices. (It had displayed ads for other companies and those that <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/09/samsung-galaxy-ads-turn-off/">promoted its own products</a>, at times.)</p>
<p>Epic Games didn&#8217;t have any further comments on Sweeney&#8217;s tweet, including whether or not the company would be using this latest bit of information in its upcoming appeal. Apple has been asked for comment but has not responded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> announced today that it has acquired <a href="http://Ally.io">Ally.io</a>, a software service that helps companies measure their progress against OKRs (objectives and key results), a common way the management measures both individual and company progress. The two firms did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to incorporate Ally into its Viva family of employee experience products. Microsoft says the idea behind Viva and the Ally acquisition is to provide a more transparent way to communicate company goals and objectives to employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aligning employee work to the company’s strategic mission and core priorities is top of mind for every organization. To do this, leaders need to invest in tools that communicate transparency around big company bets and create ways to cascade aspirational goals and report results at all levels of an organization,&#8221; Kirk Koenigsbauer, chief operating officer &amp; corporate vice president in charge of experiences and devices wrote <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/07/microsoft-acquires-ally-io-to-improve-employee-experience-by-aligning-peoples-work-with-team-goals-and-company-mission/">in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="s1XLiovL0X"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/embed/#?secret=s1XLiovL0X" data-secret="s1XLiovL0X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As for Ally, CEO and founder Vetri Vellore says that this will enable his company to grow the product much more quickly as part of Microsoft than he could have on his own. &#8220;As a part of Microsoft Viva, Ally.io will continue to give leaders, teams and individuals the ability to align and focus everyday work to the company’s most important objectives. We will help bring goals and purpose to wherever the team is doing work including Teams, Outlook, Slack and the other systems you use every day,&#8221; Vellore wrote <a href="https://ally.io/blog/microsoft-acquires-ally-okrs/">in a blog post</a> on the Ally website.</p>
<p>Understanding your work objectives and how they fit with the broader company goals has become even more important in an age when many more people are working at home and aren&#8217;t sitting in face-to-face meetings with management. Having those goals and expectations laid out and incorporated into the work tools people are using as remote employees should help keep everyone on track and pointed in the same direction.</p>
<p>While Microsoft declined to share the price of the transaction, <a href="http://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data indicates</a> that Ally last raised capital at a $345 million post-money valuation. That price was set when the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ally-io-rasies-50m-series-c-as-the-okr-software-market-stays-explosive/"> raised $50 million earlier this year</a> for a total of $76 million raised.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The exit of Ally to Microsoft could signal the start of a round of consolidation in the OKR-focused software market. There are many players competing for the lead, including WorkBoard, Koan, Gtmhub, Perdoo and WeekDone.</p>
<p>As a startup cohort, they have done incredibly well in terms of attracting venture capital and growing early-stage revenues. And now with an exit under their belt, the collection of companies will have to choose to keep their venture-funded approach to growth intact or shift to dual-tracking private rounds with possible exits to mega-tech companies.</p>
<p>With Microsoft buying Ally, which is also headquartered in Washington state, it could set the stage for other major platform players to buy and offer similar tooling. It’s not impossible to imagine any of the other usual acquisitive suspects &#8212; from Salesforce to ServiceNow to SAP &#8212; considering making a similar move and plucking one of these properties off the market.</p>
<p>For now though, just Ally is off the board, and we will have to watch to see how the rest of the market develops as a result of this move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Throughout its history as a public company, Box has had a bit of a bumpy ride. The company was founded back in 2005 as a simple consumer file sharing service, but shifted a few years later to focus on enterprise and build a modern content management system for the still-developing cloud and mobile world.</p>
<p>Once a Silicon Valley startup darling, Box fell hard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/box-files-for-250m-ipo-on-full-year-revenue-of-124m-net-loss-of-168m/">after filing its S-1</a> to go public in 2015 as people questioned its cash burn rate. That led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/why-is-box-taking-so-long-to-pull-ipo-trigger/">its IPO being delayed for months</a>, perhaps a sign of the struggles it would have finding traction in the market in later years. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">Box had a proxy battle</a> with one of its larger shareholders, Starboard Value, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/box-wins-proxy-board-battle-with-activist-investor-starboard-value/#:~:text=Box%20wins%20proxy%20board%20battle%20with%20activist%20investor%20Starboard%20Value,-Ron%20Miller%40ron_miller&amp;text=A%20battle%20between%20Box%20and,of%20directors%20easily%20defeated%20Starboard's.">the company eventually won</a>.</p>
<p>It is now a pivotal moment for the cloud content management company. Box has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">$500 million investment from KKR</a>, which means it has funds to buy some small companies, fill in the product road map and perhaps fuel some inorganic growth, as it did when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">it bought e-signature company SignRequest</a> in February.</p>
<p>Box has been on a bit of a revenue roll as well, in recent quarters. After posting 13.6% growth in in the third quarter of FY20, it began a downward trend that saw growth drop to 8.3% in the fourth quarter of FY21. That was when Starboard decided to pick its proxy fight. But Box came off the mat from that nadir, beginning a slow upward trajectory that its management is projecting will continue for the next few quarters.</p>

<p>This chart doesn’t detail huge growth, but it shows growth all the same. Co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie has faced down trouble before, and he took a mostly conciliatory tone when it came to his detractors, admitting that there was much to learn and he&#8217;s always been about improving the company.</p>
<p>We spoke to Levie about his trials and tribulations and where he expects to take his company from here.</p>
<h2>Onward through it all</h2>
<p>The last year hasn&#8217;t been easy for Levie as leader of a company in the midst of a proxy battle, but the CEO says he has not lost his optimism or his enthusiasm for the job. That is impressive when you consider he started the company in a dorm room at USC in 2005 — he&#8217;s been working on Box his entire adult life.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s one thread that runs through any difficult situation we&#8217;ve ever been in, it&#8217;s actually just my sheer excitement and optimism for the future. And I have that optimism about technology in general and its impact on the world, and what it can do for us. I have that even more so for Box, specifically, and the opportunity around what we&#8217;re building,&#8221; Levie told TechCrunch.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a record-breaking second quarter, venture capitalists around the world stayed busy in Q3, investing astronomical sums into global startups.</p>
<p>Since the back half of 2020 kicked off and the venture capital and startup worlds discovered that COVID and its related economic impacts were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">largely set to miss the upstart technology market</a>, investors have been busy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">stuffing ever-larger amounts of cash into new companies around the world</a>. The acceleration of capital deployment has generated more unicorns, more mega-rounds and simply more available dollars than ever before in the history of startups.</p>
<p>The deluge of record venture capital data points can be difficult to put into context at times. In the coming weeks, TechCrunch will explore the global Q3 venture capital market’s results in detail, by business genre (fintech, edtech, etc.) and geography, along with notes on stage-by-stage data and more.</p>
<p>Today, however, we’re taking a high-level look. Thanks to a <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">fresh report from CB Insights</a>, we have a sheaf of numbers to unpack. To start, we’re looking at the third quarter from four perspectives: <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> will look at aggregate numbers, <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> will provide an overview of unicorn results, <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> is looking into geographic outliers and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlawler">Ryan</a> has notes on fintech.</p>
<p>Lots to come, but this is the first look. Let’s get into the data!</p>
<h2>All-time record venture capital activity</h2>
<p>After some $156 billion was invested into global startups in the second quarter, the third quarter managed to just top the record by $2 billion, as investors put $158 billion to work in the last three months. The numbers are effectively a tie, meaning that we’ve just lived through the two strongest periods for investment into private companies in the history of startups.</p>
<p>This year is looking simply superlative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re building a startup to the stars, you’ll find an un-earthly amount of opportunity waiting for you at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=earlypricingsunsetpost&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> on December 14-15. This virtual two-day conference focuses on all aspects of a sector — both public and private — that’s thrilling, complex and expanding at an incredible pace.</p>
<p>You won’t find a better or more targeted platform to showcase your space technology. Global in its reach, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=earlypricingsunsetpost&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> is expected to increase attendance by 30% over last year’s inaugural event. We’re talking the top CEOs, founders, scientists, engineers and investors determined to expand humanity’s reach into and far beyond our orbit.</p>
<p>Only a very limited number of space startups will be allowed to exhibit this year, which means you’ll receive more access to investors, aerospace primes and government entities that can cut through mountains of red tape.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t space out:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=earlypricingsunsetpost&amp;display=true">Buy a Space Startup Exhibitor Package</a> ($345 &#8211; prices increase next week!) and get your space startup in front of the industry’s leading movers and shakers.</p>
<p>Bring your team and connect with opportunities; the exhibitor package includes full event access for four people, virtual booth space, lead-generation capabilities, breakout sessions, networking and video on demand. Exhibitors will also take part in a pitch feedback session with TC staff over both days.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to space than blasting billionaires into it and, when you’re not networking, you’ll hear major players on the TC Sessions stage talking about commercial launches, data-gathering satellites and human space flight missions. You’ll also hear from space-happy VCs like Tess Hatch, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.</p>
<p>She knows her stuff when it comes to frontier tech — from space commercialization, drones and autonomous vehicles to the future of agriculture and food technology. You don’t want to miss her insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’re accepting speaker applications until October 15, so if you’d like to toss your space helmet into the ring or have a recommendation, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/KUFW2e?typeform-source=techcrunch.com">fill out this submission form</a>. We’ll notify applicants by October 31.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15, and it’s a huge opportunity for space startups to receive invaluable visibility in front of a highly targeted audience.

					<description><![CDATA[Developer marketer Adam DuVander explains why education should be the focus for companies that market directly to developers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Most of the technical content published misses the mark with developers. I think we can all do a better job,&#8221; author and developer marketing expert <a href="https://www.adamd.org/">Adam DuVander</a> says.</p>
<p>That was the very realization that led DuVander to share what he had learned about marketing to developers in two ways: He recently launched a book, <a href="https://everydeveloper.com/developer-marketing/book/">&#8220;Developer Marketing Does Not Exist,&#8221;</a> and also works through his consultancy, <a href="https://everydeveloper.com/">EveryDeveloper</a>, which helps its clients, including Algolia, HelloSign and Stoplight, with technical content strategy and production.</p>
<p>DuVander was recommended to us by Karl Hughes, the CEO of Draft.dev, which specializes in content production for developer-focused companies. When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/draft-dev-ceo-karl-hughes-on-the-importance-of-using-experts-in-developer-marketing/">interviewed him last July</a>, Hughes explained that he would refer leads to EveryDeveloper when they needed to sort out their content strategy.</p>
<p>Hughes was therefore happy to recommend DuVander via our experts survey. (You can share your own recommendations <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">here</a>!) &#8220;Adam draws from deep experience as a developer and developer advocate to make sure his clients set a winning strategy in motion,&#8221; he wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This made us curious, so we got ourselves a copy of DuVander&#8217;s book and reached out to him for additional insights. The main takeaway? If you are reaching out to developers, you&#8217;ll absolutely want to avoid coming across as too promotional or too generic.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Why did you write a book titled “Developer Marketing Does Not Exist”?</b></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212518" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212518" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2212518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?w=300" alt="Adam DuVander" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/adamd-sign-500x500-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212518" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adam DuVander</p></div></p>
<p>Developer marketers certainly exist, because I work with them every day. The book title is a call to these marketers to treat their technical audience differently. To reach more developers requires more education and less promotion. Your “marketing” should not feel like marketing.</p>
<p>The idea for this book dates back to my time at <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> (2009-2014). Every press release looked the same. A company has a new API, but they haven’t bothered to explain why developers should care.</p>
<p>After ProgrammableWeb, I spent five years on the provider side in developer marketing roles. The book is a compilation of the philosophy I learned and created along the way. I hope the book helps anyone who wants to reach developers directly in an authentic way.</p>
<p><b>You mentioned reaching &#8220;the right developers.&#8221; What does that mean?</b></p>
<p>Every developer (the origin of our name) has a few basic needs, like clear documentation, help getting started and use cases to spark creativity.</p>
<p>The educational and inspirational content you use to attract developers will depend on who is the best fit for your product. If you provide a mobile SDK, the right developer is building iOS and Android apps. If your customers are data engineers, it probably won’t make sense to discuss front-end web technologies.</p>
<p>If the most common developer marketer mistake is being too promotional, the second is being too generic. Be specific with the best developer match for your product.</p>
<p><b>What are some arguments in favor of getting external help for developer marketing?</b></p>
<p>It’s tough for companies to see their own products the way someone outside that company does. Also, they may not have the development background within their marketing team to fully understand the audience.</p>
<p>In addition, hiring a full-time, experienced developer marketer can be difficult and expensive. An outside partner can provide better results, often for less than a full-time salary.</p>
<p><b>And what should startups keep in mind when picking these partners?</b></p>
<p>Look for that magical combination of technical skill and communications. The &#8220;education, not promotion&#8221; ethos should be obvious in the work they do.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>This brings us to EveryDeveloper — can you tell us more about it?</b></p>
<p>EveryDeveloper helps attract the right developers to our clients’ technical products. Our content strategy plans remove the guesswork and enable companies to produce content developers want to read.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen of us, split between content strategy and production. Most of the team can write code but prefer to write words about code.</p>
<p>Once we have jointly created a developer content strategy with a client, we’ll typically deliver two to four pieces a month.</p>
<p><b>What type of clients are best suited for the help you provide?</b></p>
<p>Anyone can benefit from fresh eyes on their developer experience and an objective plan to attract developers.</p>
<p>Those with a full staff of developer advocates or experienced developer marketers are best set up to execute on the plan we deliver. We sometimes work with unlaunched products, but usually there’s some initial success they are looking to amplify and improve. We also advise clients on how to build internal expertise.</p>
<p>All in all, we’ve helped companies from seed stage to Fortune 50 create better developer content strategies. The difference is whether it’s a product or an entire company that needs to reach more developers.</p>
<p><b>Do you have some recommendations for content and activities that you encourage companies to come up with?</b></p>
<p>EveryDeveloper focuses on content, which I believe is the most scalable way to reach developers. Blog articles are certainly core, but you want to make sure you’re covering the right topics in the right way. Don’t just publish to check a box. Make sure what you write has a strategic purpose and is something a developer wants to read. I think most developer-focused companies publishing multiple times per week would be better off with fewer, deeper pieces.</p>
<p>Other types of content include deep subject matter guides that barely mention the product (see the <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/blog/the-developer-content-mind-trick-for-signature-content/">Developer Content Mind Trick</a>) and all sorts of documentation.</p>
<p>Outside content, there’s events (in-person and virtual), advertising, sponsorships, open source and tools. I cover all of these in the book and the philosophy is the same: You’re more likely to attract developers when you aim to educate and inspire first.</p>
<p><b>What are some good targets for developer-oriented startups to sponsor? What should they keep in mind when it comes to sponsorship?</b></p>
<p>You want to use the same &#8220;education over promotion&#8221; philosophy even when you’re paying for the message. Developers are always skeptical, but especially with advertising.</p>
<p>Look for where your developers are already learning and getting their development news. If your sponsorship can feel as naturally helpful as other content from that source, you’ll be doing well.</p>
<p>I encourage developer marketers to think broadly about the sites, podcasts, events and tools they sponsor. Your best partner may not do any sponsorship yet.</p>
<p><b>In your book, you mention Netlify as an example others might want to follow when it comes to using tools as developer marketing. Could you sum that up? And why are acquisitions a good option in this context?</b></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212519" style="width: 205px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212519" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2212519 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?w=195" alt="Book cover - Developer Marketing Does Not Exist - Adam DuVander" width="195" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=768,1183 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=442,680 442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-marketing-does-not-exist-cover.png?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212519" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adam DuVander</p></div></p>
<p>There are dozens of technology choices for content management and static site generation. That leads to hundreds of potential combinations and can be overwhelming for a developer that wants to build something new. Netlify recognized that problem and built filtered galleries to help developers choose the right tools.</p>
<p>It goes to show that developer-focused companies can recognize a problem their audience wants solved and build a tool to address it.</p>
<p>Better yet, look for existing tools that already have traction. Sponsor or even acquire them. I write about &#8220;the Runscope playbook&#8221; in the book, because they executed this strategy fabulously.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any final piece of advice to share with developer-focused companies?</b></p>
<p>Developer experience is foundational for developer-focused companies. They should continually look to improve the experience — both initial and ongoing. It takes a lot of effort and resources to reach the right developers, and too many companies send them directly into a poor experience.</p>
<p>You want to make it clear you have a product for developers, show what’s possible and get them started quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">RoboTire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/your-next-tire-change-could-be-performed-by-a-robot/">crossed our radar in February of last year</a>, just before much of the world was brought to a complete standstill courtesy of the pandemic. Things were still fairly early stages for the Detroit-based startup, which was founded by former Spark Robotics CEO Victor Darolfi.</p>
<p>The company has clearly picked up some good, strategic interest in the intervening year and a half, as more and more industries are looking to embrace the benefits of automation. Today it announced that it has raised a $7.5 million Series A round, led by The Reinalt-Thomas Corporation, the major tire retail brand behind Discount Tire and America’s Tire. The latter, funnily enough, got a bit of a mixed shout-out when we spoke to Darolfi last year.</p>

<p>“I sat at America’s Tires for three hours and thought, hey, we use robots to put tires on at the factory,” he told us. “Why don’t we bring robots into the service industry?” Clearly Reinalt-Thomas was listening. The company was joined by Automotive Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners and 640 Oxford Ventures in the round. RoboTire says the funding will go toward expanding its operations in Detroit.</p>
<p>The underlying technology is capable of changing a set of tires in less than 15 minutes, by the company’s count. From the sound of things, Discount Tire will be among the first to adopt the automated tech.</p>

		Henry Mahncke has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCSF and is the CEO of Posit Science, developers of the <a href="https://www.brainhq.com/">BrainHQ</a> brain training program.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The war is over now. Our troops have come home, many after years of service across multiple tours of duty. And as they return, their next phase of service begins — to their families, where they are parents to children and caregivers to parents, and to their communities, where they will return to school or launch new careers.</p>
<p>But for far too many, the battle continues. Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) — considered to be the signature injury of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — were sustained by more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/military/index.html">430,000 U.S. service members</a>. The most common type of TBI is the somewhat misleadingly named “mild” TBI (mTBI, or concussion), <a href="https://www.brainline.org/article/how-many-service-members-have-sustained-tbi">affecting more than 82% of service members diagnosed with TBIs</a>.</p>
<p>Many were able to recover from those injuries, but thousands are plagued by persistent cognitive issues affecting speed, attention and memory — years after their injury — that make it challenging to return to work, school and family roles. People with a history of TBI are also at higher risk for complications from other conditions, notably pre-dementia and dementia.</p>
<p>That’s a burden on those service members and their families &#8212; and it’s also a burden on our nation because the talents and experience of these citizens aren’t being used to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense recognized this problem more than 10 years ago and called for academic and industry researchers to find new kinds of treatments for this new kind of war injury. A number of research groups answered the call. At Posit Science, where I am a scientist and the CEO, we responded with a team including leading clinicians from military hospitals and VA medical centers from around the country with a proposal to put a new kind of computerized brain training to the test.</p>
<p>We recognized we had to solve two problems to help service members with TBI.</p>
<p>First, the brain training program needed to work. Fortunately, we built a brain training program, <a href="http://www.brainhq.com/">BrainHQ</a>, shown to improve cognitive function in older adults through multiple studies funded by the National Institutes of Health — we just needed to adapt it for use by younger service members. The brain training exercises in BrainHQ work differently than traditional cognitive training because they are designed to improve the fundamentals of information processing in the brain using brain plasticity — the ability of the brain to rewire itself through learning and experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, the brain training program needed to reach people where they were. Many active duty service members and veterans don’t have the ability to come into a clinic several times a week for several months for in-person treatments — they’re about to be deployed, or they’re going back to school or work, or they’re located in areas outside of big cities with top clinics. Computerized brain training can be helpful here: Because it’s delivered over the internet, it can reach people in their own homes on their own schedules — wherever they are and whenever they have time.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1994/6328669">BRAVE Study, which was published this summer in the journal Brain</a>, five U.S. military and veterans hospitals enrolled 83 patients diagnosed with a history of cognitive impairment and mTBI in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The average participant in the study had experienced persistent cognitive issues for more than seven years before this intervention.</p>
<p>The BRAVE study pitted the intervention of BrainHQ plasticity-based exercises against attention-demanding video games, used as an active control. The researchers found significant improvements in overall cognition among those who used BrainHQ compared to the video game control. While the intervention did not make each patient a genius, it did result in an average gain equal to about 24 percentile points (like moving from the 50<sup>th</sup> to the 74<sup>th</sup> percentile). This was the first scalable intervention of any kind to achieve a significant gain in a gold standard study of mTBI.</p>
<p>Those results were confirmed and extended in<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34420987/"> a second study from NYU, which was recently published in the journal NeuroRehabilitation</a>. That study was of 48 civilians with a mix of mild, moderate and severe TBIs. These researchers found a significant gain in an objective measure of overall cognition in patients using BrainHQ. They also used a self-rated assessment of cognitive function, which showed that the patients noticed a significant improvement in their own cognitive health.</p>
<p>We weren’t the only ones to show success. Several other academic and military research groups using cognitive compensation techniques delivered in person by a trained clinician (notably <a href="https://brainhealth.utdallas.edu/programs/smart-curriculum/">SMART</a> training, developed at the Center for Brain Health at UT Dallas, and <a href="http://www.cogsmart.com/">CogSMART</a> training, developed at UCSD and the VA San Diego Healthcare System, showed good results.</p>
<p>But right now, much of this science is sitting on the shelf. Congress and the Department of Defense have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on basic science and clinical trials for TBI — but when I visit military hospitals and VA medical centers, I find dedicated health care providers who are committed to helping people but lacking the staff, space, technology or other resources to put the results of research into practice. We need a concerted effort from the Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs Administration to move this proven science out of the lab and into the world to help people in need.</p>
<p>As the wars abroad end, we cannot forget our obligation to ensure that our nation&#8217;s warriors benefit from the research that’s been done on their behalf. We need to unleash the discoveries of that research so that they — and our entire nation — can benefit from everything they have to offer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you&#8217;re exploring a city &#8212; whether one you&#8217;re visiting on your travels or your own &#8212; there are a number of tools that can help you find out where to go, what to see and what to do, like Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor and others. But a startup called <a href="https://welco.me/">Welcome</a> thinks that today&#8217;s set of tools could be smarter and more personalized to the individuals who use them. Its new app instead uses &#8220;real-time&#8221; technologies to make recommendations that take into account a user&#8217;s preferences as well as other details about their current context &#8212; like the weather, season, traffic and the popularity of the place at the current time of day &#8212; in order to provide a better-curated set of recommendations.</p>
<p>The end result is meant to be a city guide that&#8217;s more like &#8220;a concierge in your pocket,&#8221; says Welcome co-founder Matthew Rosenberg.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214225" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214225" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2214225" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=2048,1249 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Artwork-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214225" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p>
<p>Rosenberg says he was inspired to build Welcome after traveling, pre-pandemic, with his then-girlfriend, now-wife, following the acquisition of his first company, a mobile video creation app called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/cameo-vimeos-video-editing-platform-ditches-social-networking-functionality/">Cameo</a>,<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2014/03/18/vimeo-buys-cameo/"> by Vimeo</a>. During this time, the couple explored parts of Europe, Latin America, and the U.S., which was an amazing experience he says, and one that ultimately brought them closer together, as it turned out.</p>
<p>&#8220;But something I found myself doing in those moments &#8212; we&#8217;re in all these beautiful places&#8230;we&#8217;re in an incredible museum or at a wonderful lunch &#8212; and I found myself hunched over my phone, trying to figure out where to go next,&#8221; Rosenberg explains. He was sifting through Google Maps, recommendations from friends and trying to read reviews to make a decision about what was next on their journey.</p>
<p>This led him to wonder: &#8220;why isn&#8217;t there a tool that like can be smart and go beyond just place [recommendations] &#8212; that can really look at what&#8217;s going on in my life and in the world around me, and make smarter recommendations?&#8221; he recalls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214220" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214220" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2214220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=2048,1249 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-2.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This led to the development of what&#8217;s now become <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-smart-travel-companion/id1447252527">Wonder</a>, a city guide app that combines intelligence, recommendations, personalization, and even media, like photos and videos, to help users find things to do.</p>
<p>The startup is co-founded by fellow Vimeo employees Peter Gerard, Mark Armendariz and Mark Essel, who together with Rosenberg launched an early version of Welcome back in 2019 as something of a market test. Their idea landed them some seed money from Accel, which gave them enough runway to build the version of the app they had in mind.</p>
<p>That version has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-smart-travel-companion/id1447252527">now arrived on the App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Upon first launch, you&#8217;ll give Welcome some input about your interests and you&#8217;ll have the option to pick from a series of publishers to follow &#8212; like Condé Nast, Lonely Planet, Eater, Culture Trip, Food &amp; Wine and others &#8212; whose content is used to help inform Welcome&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214222" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214222" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2214222" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=2048,1249 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Welcome-Screenshots-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214222" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p>
<p>You can then scroll through the app&#8217;s home feed to see relevant articles for the city you&#8217;re currently researching or browse the map, where suggestions are marked with icons related to the place &#8212; like a cheeseburger for a restaurant, martini glass for a bar, tree for an outdoor place (like a farmers&#8217; market), and so on.</p>
<p>As you tap into each place, you&#8217;ll be presented with photos and videos, and links to get directions, the website, the phone number, as well as a button to order an Uber or Lyft, and more. You can also leave your own tips for fellow Welcome users, mark the list as a favorite and add tags.</p>
<p>As you browse the map, buttons at the top let you filter to see only a subset of places, like food, drinks, activities, arts and more.</p>
<p>The app itself is well-designed in terms of the look of its user interface, but it&#8217;s perhaps not as simple to use as an app that&#8217;s more heavily focused on collecting user-generated content &#8212; like business ratings and reviews.</p>
<p>It was not immediately obvious, for example, how you could contribute your own photos and videos to a place, as some listings offered a prominently placed &#8220;Add&#8221; button for uploading your media, while it seemed others did not. In reality, the &#8220;Add&#8221; button wasn&#8217;t missing &#8212; you just had to scroll over to the right to see it. But it wasn&#8217;t clear that the row was scrollable. It looked like the Add button simply wasn&#8217;t there. (See below examples.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214239" style="width: 519px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214239" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2214239" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="509" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/row-in-welcome.jpeg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214239" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshots from Welcome</p></div></p>
<p>Still, Welcome&#8217;s underlying data and parsing engines are interesting. The team developed custom tools that pick up keywords in the articles from publishers and turn them into tags. Eventually, it wants to expand this technology to any site &#8212; like local blogs, for instance &#8212; which users could click and save, perhaps via a web browser extension. The team is even thinking about offering a way to ingest the travel lists and tips people collect in less obvious places &#8212; like spreadsheets, notes and emails.</p>
<p>In time, Welcome would also like to better integrate suggestions and guides from travel content creators to enhance its recommendations further. This could also later aid its business model, where premium travel guides from specific creators or publishers could be made available for a fee. The company also plans to add more ways to transact in-app, like booking tickets or other activities where a revenue share would be involved.</p>
<p>Before its public debut, Welcome grew to over 50,000 beta users across more than 350 cities worldwide and now has over 6.5 million places its database. It&#8217;s offering over 300,000 curated recommendations globally, at launch.</p>
<p>The startup is backed by a $3.5 million seed round led by Accel, with Lakestar Ventures participating. The round closed in 2020 but hadn&#8217;t yet been announced. Including pre-seed funding, Welcome has raised $4.2 million to date.</p>
<p>Welcome&#8217;s app, for the time being, is available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-smart-travel-companion/id1447252527">on iOS only</a> as a free download.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Justice has said it will launch civil legal action against federal contractors if they fail to report cyberattacks or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breaches</a>.</p>
<p>The Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative, introduced by Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco this week, will leverage the existing False Claims Act (FCA) to “pursue cybersecurity-related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients.”</p>
<p>The initiative will hold entities, such as federal contractors or individuals, accountable when they put U.S. cyber infrastructure at risk by knowingly providing flawed cybersecurity products or services, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-new-civil-cyber-fraud-initiative">according to a DOJ press release</a>. Similarly, government contractors now also face penalties for &#8220;violating obligations&#8221; to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest response by the Biden administration following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">a spate of hacks</a> targeting federal agencies, including the Treasury, the State Department and Homeland Security. The DOJ later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">blamed</a> hackers working for Russia&#8217;s foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for the espionage campaign. The Russian hackers broke into SolarWinds’ network and planted a backdoor in its Orion software, which helps companies monitor their networks and fleets of devices, and pushed it directly to customer networks with a tainted software update.</p>
<p>The initiative will help it build “broad resiliency” against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> intrusions across the public sector and will help government efforts to identify, create and publicize patches for vulnerabilities in commonly used products and services, according to the DOJ. It will also help the government reclaim losses from the companies if found to have failed to meet the government&#8217;s security standards.</p>
<p>“For too long, companies have chosen silence under the mistaken belief that it is less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and to report it,” said Monaco. “Well that changes today. We are announcing today that we will use our civil enforcement tools to pursue companies, those who are government contractors who receive federal funds, when they fail to follow required cybersecurity standards — because we know that puts all of us at risk. This is a tool that we have to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and guard the public fisc and public trust.”</p>
<p>The timing of the unveiling of the initiative coincides with the creation of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, which has been set up to tackle complex investigations and criminal cases of cryptocurrency misuse.</p>
<p>Also this week Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Deborah Ross <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a-new-us-bill-would-force-companies-to-disclose-ransomware-payments/">proposed a new bicameral bill, the Ransom Disclosure Act</a>, which would require ransomware victims to disclose details of any ransom amount paid within 48 hours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over 24 hours into its open beta, <a href="https://app.visionrare.com/dealflow">Visionrare</a>, which launched an NFT marketplace for &#8220;fantasy startup investing,&#8221; is temporarily shutting down and refunding users who purchased shares, saying it will relaunch soon as a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>The platform allowed users to bid on auctions of fake NFT shares of real startups, building up a quasi-portfolio that they could compete in a fantasy sports-styled league around who could build the most &#8220;profitable&#8221; portfolio. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/fantasy-equity-nft-game-wants-you-to-spend-real-money-buying-fake-shares-of-real-startups/">As we noted in our coverage of the startup&#8217;s launch yesterday</a>, they didn&#8217;t have the permission of most of the startups that they were selling synthetic shares in.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://app.visionrare.com/dealflow">note</a> posted to the company&#8217;s auction marketplace this morning, the founders noted that they had &#8220;underestimated the legal complexities&#8221; with selling novelty NFT shares in real startups and were temporarily shutting down the marketplace and refunding users as they planned out a pivot. In a message on the company&#8217;s public Discord channel, the team noted it had already processed all of the credit card refunds to buyers, though some refunds may still be pending due to Stripe processing.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The platform and its founders had received some substantial pushback after Visionrare&#8217;s launch yesterday, with various tech entrepreneurs and investors questioning whether the platform was legal, whether it was a security, whether the NFT platform was taunting the SEC and/or whether this was finally the sign of the market&#8217;s &#8220;top&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Visionrare&#8217;s founders say they aren&#8217;t done with the idea of &#8220;fantasy startup investing&#8221; quite yet, but that they are going to have to rethink how the platform is fundamentally structured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the coming days, we will re-launch Visionrare as a completely free-to-play game. All players start with a fixed amount of credits that they can use to build their startup portfolio, and they can compete in leagues based on how well their portfolios perform in the real world. Down the line, we&#8217;ll figure out if and how we can add a financial element again,&#8221; the founders&#8217; blog post reads.</span></p>

As teased in March, the Tinder app <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-and-tinder-first-impression" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">now includes</a> an Explore hub that lets you buy a Lyft ride for your date.

<p>The credit is only useful for dropoffs within a half-mile of a set destination, and you&#8217;ll get a refund for any unused credit. You don&#8217;t have to worry that your would-be beau will travel to the other end of town, in other words.</p>
<p>The motivations are fairly obvious here.

<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise expects to leap from a limited commercial robotaxi and delivery service that will start in earnest in 2022 to a business of &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of its purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p>
<p>The eye-popping projections will be reached, according to CEO Dan Ammann, through a combination of regulatory approvals, capital from investors and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion credit line from GM Financial</a> and technological breakthroughs, including a 90% reduction in compute costs over the next four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the next 12 to 24 months, you will be able to push a button and get a ride with a very short ETA in a couple of major cities in the United States,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;If you look at the next three to four years, we will be deployed in multiple cities, multiple markets around the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are seriously bold claims, but the company appears to be laying down some of the groundwork to back them up. Just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received its driverless deployment permit</a>, which allows the company to begin charging for autonomous services, from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. It just needs one more permit from the California Public Utilities Commission to operate a commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco. Cruise says that reality is only months away.</p>
<p>The $5 billion line of credit from GM Financial, which Cruise secured this summer, will be used to pay for the production of the Origin without having to give away more equity to investors. Separately, GM has invested a total of $6 billion in Cruise, including the initial acquisition cost, operating costs for 2015 to 2016, and further investments, according to the company.</p>
<p>The question is whether all this is enough to help Cruise scale up into the thousands of vehicles at a lower cost per mile than a human driver service over the next half a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<p>Cruise laid out its plan to go from a limited commercial AV service to tens of thousands of vehicles in a short span during GM&#8217;s Investor Event on Wednesday. Let&#8217;s dive into the claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>From product-market fit to rapid scaleup</h2>
<p>Ammann broke down Cruise&#8217;s path to market into three phases. The first was the R&amp;D phase, which took the company to the beginning of driverless testing at the end of last year and into this year. Phase two, which will begin next year, will be early commercialization via the retrofitted Chevy Bolt EV-based fleet of Cruise vehicles, which are currently on the roads in San Francisco and Phoenix, Arizona. During this time, Cruise wants to demonstrate product-market fit with a minimum viable product.</p>
<p>Phase three, the &#8220;rapid scaling phase,&#8221; begins in 2023, when production of the Cruise Origin will begin at GM&#8217;s Zero Assembly Plant, a factory dedicated to the production of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that first year, we&#8217;ll be building what can be measured in thousands, and in 2024 we&#8217;ll be thinking about things measured in tens of thousands,&#8221; said Ammann.</p>
<p>Having GM as a backer for OEM-level production of vehicles will be a huge advantage for Cruise, said the CEO. The Origin will be built off the same Ultium platform that GM has built to support a wide range of products across its brands, which should enable faster production.</p>
<p>The company also invested in the technology and software tools needed to ramp up the rate of improvement of Origin&#8217;s autonomous system, which is ultimately a platform that allows AI and robotics to develop together in a closed-loop system.</p>
<p>Part of that investment went into Cruise&#8217;s simulation software, through which the Origin will largely be validated. It&#8217;s already begun virtual autonomous testing, even though it has not gone out onto public roads yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal in the medium to longer term for everybody working on this is to get to low-cost generalized autonomy,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;We want fully autonomous driving, we want it to work everywhere and we want it to be really inexpensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throwing obvious shade at Tesla, Ammann said that while some companies are trying to solve the autonomy problem by working their way up from a low-cost Level 2 autonomous system, which translates to an advanced driver assistance system, Cruise&#8217;s approach is to solve the hardest problem first: getting the human out of the loop and doing so in one of the most complex driving environments – downtown San Francisco.</p>

<h2 class="p-rich_text_section">Driving costs down with technological advancements</h2>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">It might seem counterproductive, but Cruise says it has thrown a lot of money into the compute power of the Origin to get it to a place where it&#8217;ll be able to commercialize and scale profitably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though the technology carries a higher cost, we&#8217;re able to amortize that cost over a high-utilization fleet, high-mileage vehicle, and do that at a compelling cost point,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;The cost advantage of the Origin relative to a retrofitted vehicle, even including a Bolt AV, is about 60% to 70% lower cost per mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, Cruise has plans to bring down the cost of that compute power over the next four generations by 90%. One way to do this is to start manufacturing custom silicon, which Cruise says will help it both scale compute use and cut costs. Ammann didn&#8217;t go into detail about what it will use the silicon for &#8212; a tidbit that will be touched upon further at the company&#8217;s &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; recruitment event in November &#8212; but at the very least, the company is signaling a move toward vertical integration.</p>
<p>Considering the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">damage the semiconductor shortage has done to GM&#8217;s production lines</a> and the fact GM has just announced a supplier agreement with Wolfspeed to provide silicon carbide semiconductors for GM&#8217;s EV program, it&#8217;s probably safe to say Cruise has put chips on the menu. Others in the industry, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-tesla-designing-chips-train-self-driving-tech/">Tesla,</a> are also securing the supplies and production of their own silicon chips.</p>
<h2>Cheaper than a human by nature</h2>
<p>The Origin is purpose-built to provide excellent customer service at a low cost for both ride-hail and delivery, said Ammann. The vehicle itself is only as long as a Chevy Cruze, but the inside will be optimized to provide plenty of space to make for a pleasant ride-hail experience. It&#8217;ll also be able to convert from passenger mode to delivery mode, complete with a delivery unit that can slide in and out multiple times within a 24-hour operating cycle to make the most use of each vehicle.</p>
<p>Cruise thinks within just a few years, its Origin will be able to outstrip Uber and Lyft with cheaper prices and higher revenues. In some cities, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/07/1025534409/lyft-and-uber-prices-are-high-wait-times-are-long-and-drivers-are-scarce">Uber and Lyft prices are up almost 80%</a> from pre-pandemic prices, but the companies are still &#8220;not materially profitable today,&#8221; said Ammann. That&#8217;s due to their business model, he claimed. In San Francisco today, a rider is paying about $5 per mile, three-quarters of which probably goes to the driver and the rest gets spent on funding expenses and other costs, which results in companies just breaking even.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two fundamental differences in our model, the first being that we don&#8217;t split the revenue &#8212; we get all the revenue,&#8221; said Ammann. &#8220;Because we have a lower cost structure, we&#8217;re able to charge less and make a profit. It&#8217;s as simple as that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Can Cruise scale as rapidly as it hopes?</h2>
<p>Cruise didn&#8217;t share its revenue projections, but it did compare itself to other companies that have brought breakthrough products to very large markets and within a decade or so have gotten to &#8220;say $50 billion in revenue.&#8221; Ammann did say that Cruise conservatively expects to make about $100,000 in revenue per vehicle per year.</p>
<p>The company plans to own everything to do with its services, from the vehicles and autonomous software to the ride-hailing app and customer service. It hopes that by bringing more services in-house, it&#8217;ll be able to scale quickly and save money in the long run through constantly improving software that will allow it to begin to ditch sensors along the way.</p>
<p>Ammann even went so far as to say that it&#8217;ll be able to get its autonomous system&#8217;s cost curve so far down that it&#8217;ll be at a price point where it can be deployed into retail vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go to your local dealer and buy a car that has Cruise L4 system capability inside of it, and with a partnership with GM, that obviously gives us a huge opportunity to turn that into a reality, and to do that at a really large scale,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That reality is likely many, many years off, but Cruise isn&#8217;t shy about dreaming big.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look out eight to 10 years from now, <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we&#8217;ll look back and we&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;ve started to actually bend the curve on road safety in the United States and around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;C</span>ities will be given back to the humans &#8230; our cities will be cleaner and less congested. And people will have access to transportation that don&#8217;t have access to transportation today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data observability &#8212; necessary to keep tabs on infrastructure performing as it should; to see if apps are returning errors; and to ensure that critical business data is getting to where it needs to go &#8212; is becoming an evermore complicated task as organizations&#8217; cloud-native data demands and data usage grow. Today a startup that&#8217;s built a scalable platform to manage that is announcing a big round of funding to continue its own scaling journey. <a href="https://chronosphere.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chronosphere</a> &#8212; a cloud-native monitoring platform co-founded by two former Uber engineers &#8212; has raised $200 million, a Series C that values the company at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Chronosphere is also announcing a new set of tools specifically for distributed tracing, which will help make more granular observations and respond quicker to issues on the network as they arise.</p>
<p>General Atlantic led the round, with Addition, Greylock, Lux Capital and new backer Founders Fund also participating. In yet one more example of how the most promising companies are fundraising with increasing frequency these days, General Atlantic, Addition&#8217;s Lee Fixel, Greylock and Lux Capital all backed Chronosphere in its Series B, which was only nine months ago, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/chronosphere-nabs-43m-series-b-to-expand-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>As with its previous round, this one was opportunistic, not because it was needed. &#8220;We are in the same spot as a year ago: more than 85% of our Series B is still in our bank account and we didn’t need the cash,&#8221; said Martin Mao, Chronosphere&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;But this was a response to our growth this year.&#8221; The company has been making regular updates to its tech and its revenues have grown tenfold in the last year, a reflection of what is also happening with data in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demand has risen 10x, too,&#8221; he said, adding that the size of the Chronosphere team has not, so it will be hiring. &#8220;This is indicative of the product providing value to customers and shows how quickly the market is adopting cloud. So we are trying to capture the market as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which is 2.5 years old, has now raised $255 million to date.</p>
<p>Mao and co-founder Rob Skillington (CTO) founded Chronosphere on the back of early work that they started at Uber, where they built an observability platform very specific to Uber&#8217;s needs as a business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The underlying large-scale metrics storage technology they built was <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually open sourced as M3</a>. The two then left Uber to build Chronosphere to take their ideas and concepts for cloud-native monitoring technology to a wider market.</p>
<p>Specifically, they saw an opportunity to address a particular gap: Uber built its own observability platform from the ground up to handle its particular mix of microservices and containers because, as Mao described it, the Googles of the world had built their own, &#8220;so we followed the same path.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he added, &#8220;there was nothing on the market designed for this type of architecture&#8221; that others could equally use, so they wanted to tackle the more general challenges of cloud-native complexity by building that platform themselves.</p>
<p>Since being widely released in GA in January, Chronosphere has found early traction with companies that operate at the same &#8220;horsepower&#8221; (Mao&#8217;s word) as Uber &#8212; other on-demand businesses like DoorDash that may also deal in a similar architecture involving multiple cloud applications, on-demand services and real-time analytics.</p>
<p>Other customers include those whose business models are equally banked on moving and analyzing large amounts of data, such as cryptocurrency mining platform Cudo, sports data company Genius Sports and Tecton, an enterprise-focused &#8220;store&#8221; for machine learning applications.</p>
<p>The distributed tracing tools also being announced today speak to how Chronosphere will be, going forward, looking for further applications of its monitoring tech. It will give users more detailed notifications around workflows, with root cause analysis, and it will also give engineers, whether or not they are data science specialists, more tools to run analytics on their data sets.</p>
<p>While the two co-founders continue to maintain M3, Mao points out that Chronosphere&#8217;s platform can work independent of it; it&#8217;s aimed at companies whose data needs have outgrown <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>, another monitoring and alerting solution that works well with M3. In terms of competitors, Mao describes Datadog as &#8220;the 800-pound gorilla in the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>(That is another reason to continue building fast and taking market share &#8212; and investment &#8212; where it can.)</p>
<p>“Chronosphere is purpose-built to address the needs of large modern cloud-native enterprises,&#8221; said Anton Levy, co-president, MD and head of technology investing at General Atlantic, in a statement. &#8220;Sitting at the intersection of the major trends transforming infrastructure software – the rise of open-source and the shift to containers – Chronosphere has quickly become a transformative player in observability. We’re excited by the team’s ambitious vision, with distributed tracing as yet another solution that differentiates Chronosphere as a next generation leader and paves the way for its continued growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech giants have gotten worse at removing illegal hate speech from their platforms under a voluntary arrangement in the European Union, according to the Commission&#8217;s latest assessment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_21_5106">sixth evaluation report</a> of the EU&#8217;s Code of Conduct on removing illegal hate speech found what the bloc&#8217;s executive calls a &#8220;mixed picture&#8221;, with platforms reviewing 81% of the notifications within 24 hours and removing an average of 62.5% of flagged content.</p>
<p>These results are lower than the average recorded in both 2019 and 2020, the Commission notes.</p>
<p>The self-regulatory initiative kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/facebook-twitter-youtube-and-microsoft-agree-to-remove-hate-speech-across-the-eu/">back in 2016</a>, when Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube agreed to remove in less than 24 hours hate speech that falls foul of their community guidelines.</p>
<p>Since then Instagram, Google+, Snapchat, Dailymotion, Jeuxvideo.com, TikTok and LinkedIn have also signed up to the code.</p>
<p>While the headline promises were bold, the reality of how platforms have performed has often fallen short of what was pledged. And while there had been a trend of improving performance, that&#8217;s now stopped or stalled per the Commission &#8212; with Facebook and YouTube among the platforms performing worse than in earlier monitoring rounds.</p>

<p>A key driver for the EU to establish the code five years ago was concern about the spread of terrorist content online, as lawmakers sought ways to quickly apply pressure to platforms to speed up the removal of hate-preaching content.</p>
<p>But the bloc now has a regulation for that: In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">April</a> the EU adopted a law on terrorist content takedowns that set one hour as the default time for removals to be carried out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MCuK3De8zs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">EU adopts rules on one-hour takedowns for terrorist content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU adopts rules on one-hour takedowns for terrorist content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/embed/#?secret=MCuK3De8zs" data-secret="MCuK3De8zs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>EU lawmakers have also proposed a wide-ranging update to digital regulations that will expand requirements on platforms and digital services in a range of areas around their handling of illegal content and/or goods.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) has not yet been passed, so the self-regulatory code is still operational &#8212; for now.</p>
<p>The Commission said today that it wants to discuss the code&#8217;s evolution with signatories, including in light of the &#8220;upcoming obligations and the collaborative framework in the proposal for a <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">Digital Services Act</a>&#8220;. So whether the code gets retired entirely &#8212; or beefed up as a supplement to the incoming legal framework &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>On disinformation, where the EU also operates a voluntary code to squeeze the tech industry to combat the spread of harmful non-truthful content, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">Commission has said</a> it intends to keep obligations voluntary while simultaneously strengthening measures and linking compliance with it &#8212; at least for the largest platforms &#8212; to the legally binding DSA.</p>
<p>The stalled improvement in platforms&#8217; hate speech removals under the voluntary code suggests the approach may have run its course. Or that platforms are taking their foot off the gas while they wait to see what specific legal requirements they will have.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that while some companies&#8217; results &#8220;clearly worsened&#8221;, others &#8220;improved&#8221; over the monitored period. But such patchy results are perhaps a core limitation of a non-binding code.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers also flagged that &#8220;insufficient feedback&#8221; to users (via notifications) remains a &#8220;main weakness&#8221; of the code, as in previous monitoring rounds. So, again, legal force seems necessary &#8212; and the DSA proposes standardized rules for elements like reporting procedures.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest report on the hate speech code in a statement, Věra Jourová, the Commission&#8217;s VP for values and transparency, looked ahead to the incoming regulation, saying: &#8220;Our unique Code has brought good results but the platforms cannot let the guard down and need to address the gaps. And gentlemen agreement alone will not suffice here. The Digital Services Act  will provide strong regulatory tools to fight against illegal hate speech online.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The results show that IT companies cannot be complacent: just because the results were very good in the last years, they cannot take their task less seriously,&#8221; added Didier Reynders, commissioner for Justice, in another supporting statement. &#8220;They have to address any downward trend without delay. It is matter of protecting a democratic space and fundamental rights of all users. I trust that a swift adoption of the Digital Services Act will also help solving some of the persisting gaps, such as the insufficient transparency and feedback to users.”</p>
<p>Other findings from the illegal hate speech takedowns monitoring exercise include that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal rates varied depending on the severity of hateful content; <strong>69%</strong> of content calling for murder or violence against specific groups was removed, while <strong>55%</strong> of the content using defamatory words or pictures aiming at certain groups was removed. Conversely, in 2020, the respective results were <strong>83.5%</strong> and <strong>57.8%</strong>.</li>
<li>IT companies gave feedback to <strong>60.3%</strong> of the notifications received, which is lower than during the previous monitoring exercise (<strong>67.1%)</strong>.</li>
<li>In this monitoring exercise, <strong>sexual orientation</strong> is the most commonly reported ground of hate speech (<strong>18.2%)</strong> followed by xenophobia (<strong>18%)</strong> and anti-Gypsyism (<strong>12.5%)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission also said that for the first time signatories reported &#8220;detailed information&#8221; about measures taken to counter hate speech outside the monitoring exercise, including actions to automatically detect and remove content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Avatar startups have come and gone over the past few years, but the future that many of the entrepreneurs behind them originally imagined has proven more or less accurate. Apple is increasingly interested in avatar representations through Memoji, Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook to be a metaverse company and platforms like Roblox, where users enter a virtual world and buy accessories for their character, have never been more popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://facemoji.co/">Facemoji</a> is building a plug-and-play tech platform to help game and app developers put avatar systems into their apps with the startup&#8217;s SDK. Facemoji has raised a $3 million seed round led by Play Ventures, with participation from Twitter and Roosh Ventures, alongside some angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s lightweight solution leans on its own rendering pipeline, with the team noting that most other players in the space lean on Unity plugins that many developers don&#8217;t want to deal with. They also already have a full, diverse system of avatar art that developers can lean on out of the box if they so desire.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2214149" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2214149" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2214149" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png 1420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-8.13.31-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2214149" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facemoji</p></div></p>
<p>Facemoji believes that more game-makers want to easily build their own avatar systems but don&#8217;t necessarily want to plug into other networks. The Achilles&#8217; heel of most early avatar platforms has often been the ambition to build a consistent cross-platform avatar system that functioned as its own metaverse. It makes sense for the startup building the product and users, but for game-makers, leaving that slice of the platform opportunity on the table was a waste.</p>
<p>Facemoji says they don&#8217;t anticipate Apple opening up Memoji to the developer community and that Snap is a more salient competitor. Facemoji&#8217;s startup competitors have been getting acquired at an increasingly rapid pace. In 2020, Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/roblox-buys-digital-avatar-startup-loom-ai/">bought</a> Loom.ai and Epic Games acquired HyperSense.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founders are still heavily intrigued by the metaverse hype and the latest NFT craze and have been working on plug-and-play NFT storefronts that developers can integrate to let their users buy accessories for their avatars. Facemoji sees some of the early crypto Twitter profile pic usage as a sign that regular consumers are going to be excited about tricking out their avatars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, it boils down to ego,&#8221; Facemoji CEO Robin Raszka tells TechCrunch. &#8220;How you show off that you have a Birkin bag, avatars on Twitter is the prime real estate for this, people just want to show off.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a particularly interesting investment for Twitter, which is an infrequent corporate investor. Facemoji&#8217;s team said they had some conversations with the team at screen-sharing social app Squad about integrating their avatars before that startup was bought by Twitter. Twitter has also detailed a number of NFT projects in the works and CEO Jack Dorsey has been a major cheerleader for startups in the space.</p>
<p>In addition to gaming, Facemoji&#8217;s team hopes that soon people have the option of easily dialing into their next Zoom as an avatar or attending a class as one and that that live-action avatar overlays lose some of their silly reputation in favor of being treated as a healthy medium between having your camera on and off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve been working on a big project the past several days (more on that soon), which means, unfortunately, I’ve been away from the daily breaking news. That means, in turn, that I really haven’t been on top of the big robotics news this week. So let’s use this column as an opportunity to play a little catch-up.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, however, I did have the opportunity to sit down with an interesting robotics company that had a unique pandemic experience.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say the world was a different place when <a href="https://www.diligentrobots.com/">Diligent Robotics</a> announced its Series A. March 2020 wasn’t all that long ago, of course, but the worlds of healthcare and hospitals have seen tremendous strain amid a pandemic whose scope and length few could have predicted. Demand for the company’s nurse assisting robot Moxi has spiked as hospital staffs have grown increasingly overworked and understaffed, accelerating trends that existed prior to COVID-19.</p>
<p>While last year’s $10 million cash infusion has no doubt helped Diligent grow, the company has faced the difficult task of accelerating production while dealing with the familiar challenges of moving to remote work.</p>
<p>Andrea Thomaz, the associate professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech who co-founded Diligent in 2017 with Vivian Chu, joined us this week to discuss the unique challenges and opportunities the last year has held.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2191371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>

<p><strong>How profound an impact is the pandemic having on both robotics generally and Diligent specifically?</strong></p>
<p>It is really just a dramatic shift in labor markets across a lot of different industries. It seems to be related both to people kind of having a great resignation, where people are deciding that they want to do different things. And a lot of people shifting jobs. We’re seeing that all across tech work, a lot in our industry and healthcare. A lot of people are just deciding to do something else. There were already workforce challenges pre-pandemic, and now those are reaching crisis levels.</p>
<p><strong>This is kind of a perfect storm, in a sense, because you have fewer people wanting to do the job, and more people needed to do the job all at the same time.</strong></p>
<p>And that trend was starting before the pandemic. The pandemic just added fuel to the fire. But the trend kind of started with the Affordable Care Act. More people having access to healthcare means more people are going to hospitals and getting care. That together with an aging population, and you just have more care needing to happen with fewer and fewer people.</p>
<p><strong>Are you able to quantify that demand, in terms of how many hospitals you were in initially, and how that demand has spiked subsequently?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not really sharing that. I think towards the early half of next year, we&#8217;ll be sharing more specific announcements around scale numbers, but I can say that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re doubling the number of robots that are deployed every quarter.</p>
<p><strong>What is that process like in terms getting one of these robots up and running?</strong></p>
<p>I think that’s what’s really interesting about hospital markets. It’s different than traditional warehouse or manufacturing automation. There’s people in the environment and they’re nurses and clinicians. The robot has to work within that environment and alongside the people. The first thing we do is workflow assessments. How does work currently happen in that environment?</p>

<p><strong>How has the pandemic impacted your own growth?</strong></p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, we were still proving out product market fit. We were keeping the R &amp; D team pretty small, making small tweaks to the product, but really, it was all about getting it out in front of customers and showing that they were really seeing value. And Now it&#8217;s all about execution and delivery, how do we make it as fast as possible to implement and as robust as possible. On the hardware side, in particular, it&#8217;s around design for manufacturing and reliability. Now that we&#8217;ve had robots out in the field for over a year, you&#8217;re starting to see some of the pieces and parts that we could get more reliability around, so we’re getting to that fun longtail of robotics.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any surprising features or demands that people had of the robots that are a result of the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>I think that across all of our customer sites, the one request that we get, from every single nurse is, “is that robot gonna be able to bring me coffee?” They want Moxi to go to the Starbucks in the lobby and bring coffee for everyone. They try to justify that as a time savings, because then I wouldn&#8217;t have to go and stand in line at Starbucks. It&#8217;s not out of the question. But we&#8217;re not actively piloting that one.</p>
<p><strong>So, you’re not going to build an espresso machine into Moxi?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you anticipate seeking additional funding at some point in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>We are making plans for growth capital. They&#8217;re still working it out. But with the huge uptick in demand from customers, I think we&#8217;re ready to sort of accelerate some of our team and get more robots out.</p>
<p><strong>Are you focusing on the U.S. for the time being?</strong></p>
<p>For the time being. We are starting to consider what an international strategy would look like. I wouldn’t expect that we’ll have any international deployments next year, but we’ve started to have a lot of interest. We’re deciding what the right distribution partners would look like. We get several inquiries a month from international clients. At this point, we’re not actively in any project with them.</p>

<p>So, more on funding rounds and coffee deliveries at a later time. There are, however, a couple of delivery stories worth noting this week. First off, Tortoise (which we’ve covered a bunch in the past), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/tortoise-expands-remote-operated-robotic-delivery-to-convenience-stores-across-the-us/">is getting a big boost</a> for its team of remote-controlled delivery bots. A deal with Idaho-based King Retail Solutions will bring more than 500 of its robots to U.S. sidewalks for last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s waking up to this new reality that same-day is the new normal, and it’s just not sustainable on every possible front to have that consumer expectation be met with people making $20 an hour doing those deliveries,” CEO Dmitry Shevelenko said of the deal. “The math just doesn’t work.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wing-prod.blogspot.com/2021/10/check-out-worlds-first-rooftop-drone.html">Google’s Wing announced its own partnership</a>. Teaming with Australian retail property group Vicinity Centres lets the drone-based delivery program expand its footprint. Following the recent announcement of its 100,000<sup>th</sup> delivery, the Wing team says it’s already launched 2,500 deliveries from the roof of Logan, Australia’s Grand Plaza shopping center over the past month.</p>
<p>Residents can get bubble tea, juice, sushi and now health and beauty products. Says Wing, &#8220;Because almost every business has a roof, our new rooftop delivery model opens up the possibility for more businesses to offer drone delivery services with little additional cost or added infrastructure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking of juice (not a segue I get to use very frequently in this roundup), Bay Area-based smoothie robot maker Blendid this week announced that it will be powering Jamba’s second mall kiosk. The location opened this week at a mall in Downey, California, a city in LA County that’s also home to the oldest operating McDonald’s (thanks, Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Wave of the future or gimmick? Yes and yes.</p>
<p>“After a successful launch of our first Jamba by Blendid kiosk, we’re excited to open a second test kiosk at the Stonewood Center, bringing freshly blended smoothies to mall shoppers,” Jamba president Geoff Henry, <a href="https://www.blendid.com/jamba-and-blendid-announce-the-opening-of-second-robotic-smoothie-kiosk-at-the-stonewood-center-in-downey-california/">said in a release</a>. “Jamba by Blendid provides an opportunity for our local franchisees to make smoothies more accessible to Jamba fans, while leveraging the latest in technology to deliver contactless food.”</p>

<p>On the orchard side of the fruit business, <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/wavemaker-labs-acquires-ip-from-agtech-startup-abundant-robotics/">The Robot Report this week notes</a> that Wavemaker Labs has acquired the IP for Abundant Robotics, which shuffled off this mortal coil over the summer. Unfortunately, this likely doesn’t mean the return of Abundant’s apple-picking robots, but rather the integration of its technology into the robotic systems from Future Acres, a Wavemaker portfolio startup.</p>

<p>And finally, a quick bit of robotic <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/robot-finds-items-camera-antenna-1005">search out of MIT</a> that uses an RF antenna and camera mounted to an arm to find lost objects. Per the school:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using machine learning, the robotic arm automatically zeroes-in on the object’s exact location, moves the items on top of it, grasps the object, and verifies that it picked up the right thing. The camera, antenna, robotic arm, and AI are fully integrated, so RFusion can work in any environment without requiring a special set up.</p></blockquote>
