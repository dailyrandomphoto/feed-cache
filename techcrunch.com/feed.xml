										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zero Motorcycles has been around for over a decade and in that time it’s consistently improved its fleet of electric bikes. With the new FXE, the northern California company has taken the thoroughly enjoyable FXS supermoto and transformed it into something a bit more futuristic looking with a new easier-to-parse display.</p>
<p>The FXE likely isn’t a great pick for two-wheeled beginners or for folks that want a weekend cruiser, but for the experienced rider who needs a daily commuter that packs agility and power into a fun package, the 100-mile range FXE might be the best way to get to and from work. Watch our first ride video for the full story.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the past year, many of the conversations around autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been dominated by the same question: When will self-driving cars be the norm on public roads?</p>
<p>While industry leaders talked a big game on AVs monopolizing our roads <a href="https://mashable.com/article/autonomous-car-timeline-and-tech">back in 2016</a>, today some experts have put widespread <a href="http://workofthefuture.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Research-Brief-Leonard-Mindell-Stayton3.pdf">Level 4 adoption over a decade away</a>. However, even that timeline only works if automakers overcome significant barriers — both technical and behavioral. The challenge of bringing AVs to consumers will be tougher than anticipated, with a central part of the effort being focused on earning the public’s trust.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence and mass adoption of AVs go hand in hand. To meet the projected timelines and start building this critical trust today, automakers should accelerate the adoption of autonomous capabilities into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The challenges facing current ADAS technologies</h2>
<p>The truth is that consumers do not yet trust the ADAS capabilities in their vehicles. A 2021 <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/users-trust-in-and-concerns-about-automated-driving-systems/">AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety survey</a> found that 80% of drivers wanted current vehicle safety systems, like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance, to work better, noting the lack of confidence consumers feel around current offerings.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While consumers seem to be aware that AV technologies are advancing quickly, this lack of trust from users will be a major barrier to full adoption and can pose a threat to the industry — no matter how far along the technology develops.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite significant recent advancements in the industry, including announcements from Cruise <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF">gaining permission</a> to give rides in driverless test vehicles to passengers in California, AAA <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/users-trust-in-and-concerns-about-automated-driving-systems/">studies</a> indicate that still only one in 10 drivers would be comfortable riding in a self-driving car. While consumers seem to be aware that AV technologies are advancing quickly, this lack of trust from users will be a major barrier to full adoption and can pose a threat to the industry — no matter how far along the technology develops.</p>
<p>To aid in building the public’s confidence, the industry must focus today on more advanced and reliable ADAS to meet consumer demands. However, current offerings face major challenges that must be resolved before the majority of consumers will get on board:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of reliability in common adverse conditions: </strong>Technologies including lidar and camera are limited to what they can “see” around them. These systems can be easily obstructed by snow, dirt and debris covering the vehicle’s sensors. Additionally, without clear, crisp lane markings — in the event of snow, heavy rainfall or off-road conditions — or strong GPS signals, the typical sensors tracking vehicle location will not function properly.</li>
<li><strong>Poor detection: </strong>There have been several cases where ADAS technologies have been unable to detect degraded lane markings, pedestrians, other vehicles or common on-road objects, resulting in injury and even death for drivers and pedestrians.</li>
<li><strong>Low understanding by the general public: </strong>While some ADAS features are designed to operate independently, there is still a consistent lack of public knowledge when it comes to understanding how to best utilize the systems’ abilities to maximize safety. This lack of awareness poses an unnecessary threat to drivers who inadvertently misuse the technology as well as to those with whom they share the roads.</li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing these challenges and creating better automated driving experiences for consumers is a critical step to mass adoption of future AV technology. The most immediate opportunity to move the needle with consumer acceptance in this area is to target improving reliability and user experience — especially with dynamic vehicle safety systems. To do so, automated and autonomous vehicles need improved sensors and software that enhance today’s systems and, as a result, boost consumer confidence in the safety of automated capabilities.</p>
<h2>A fresh perspective on vehicle positioning</h2>
<p>In the last decade, the industry has made various advancements in positioning systems, which locate a vehicle to the centimeter on roadways and are critical additions to traditional hardware stacks. As a result, experts have been placing bets on technologies such as ground-penetrating radar and novel mapping techniques as the final missing piece to robust vehicle positioning due to their ability to operate in adverse driving conditions and navigate highly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>While it is clear there are different avenues AVs can take to increase their reliability on the road, automakers are still trying to determine which approach can unlock the change in performance required for broad adoption.</p>
<p>When taking a closer look at the differentiators that make these technologies stand out, a common thread is how they address three critical issues: the absence of roadside features such as on open highways, within parking lots or when a car is boxed in by trucks and vision is limited; the reliance of camera-based systems on clear, consistent lane markings; and quickly changing environments in which the scene on the surface looks different from one moment to the next and HD maps quickly become unusable. These common challenges have left consumers frustrated with inconsistent and unreliable ADAS features.</p>
<p>One way to overcome these critical gaps is to explore other avenues for reliable vehicle positioning such as ground-penetrating radar — which allows vehicles to determine their precise location in adverse weather or in rough terrain, amid poor GPS availability and other common barriers faced by automated systems today — to show improved autonomy is possible. By adding these novel approaches into vehicles, automakers can create more reliable and accurate ADAS features — safeguarding the automated driving experience.</p>
<h2>Leaning on ADAS as a vehicle for consumer confidence and mass AV adoption</h2>
<p>A recent study from Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE) found that consumers familiar with ADAS technology were more likely to feel positive about autonomous cars and that 75% who currently own a vehicle with ADAS features say they are excited about future safety technology. This shows consumer engagement in today’s ADAS features can lead to more positive attitudes on tomorrow’s AV adoption.</p>
<p>As an industry, where do we go from here? Many are finding that there is a unique opportunity to resolve the future issues of autonomous vehicle operations by attacking them head-on in present-day ADAS systems &#8212; where they will otherwise be a future problem that will block mass adoption.</p>
<p>We need to address these critical issues with ADAS technologies and create better driving experiences to earn the public&#8217;s trust. By using higher-performing ADAS as a pathway to mass AV adoption, we can arrive at the destination safely.</p>
<p>The industry, along with consumers, can build a safe autonomous future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal, said it will double the number of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The commitment, if successful, means 1,800 fast charging stations — or 10,000 individual chargers — will be installed and operational by that time. The vast majority (some 1,700 stations) will be installed in the United States with the remainder in Canada. This will build off of EA&#8217;s plans to have about 800 charging stations and about 3,500 individual chargers in the U.S. by the end of 2021.  As of today, Electrify America has installed 635 charging stations in the United States.</p>
<p>The plan is part of parent company VW Group&#8217;s announcement Monday to increase public charging infrastructure in North America, Asia and Europe. The expansion aims to increase the number of 150 and 350 kilowatt chargers, or fast chargers. VW nor EA disclosed how much money would be spent to meet this new plan. However, an EA spokesperson did confirm that the company would be spending more than the $2 billion it previously committed to invest into clean energy infrastructure over a 10-year period that kicked off in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decision to double its charging infrastructure in North America was prompted by the rapid growth expected of electric vehicles by virtually all the auto manufacturers, according to a statement by Electrify America president and CEO Giovanni Palazzo.</p>
<p>The EV market was once the primary domain of Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and GM&#8217;s Chevrolet Bolt EV. And while the majority of vehicles on the road today are gas and diesel-powered, an increasing number of other EV models have, or are about, to come to market, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Porsche Taycan and the Cross Turismo variant, Hyundai Kona Electric, Jaguar I-Pace, Rivian R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV and the VW ID. 4.</p>
<p>Electrify America&#8217;s initial plan was to invest more than $2 billion over a 10-year period into clean energy infrastructure and education. Of that funding, some $800 million was earmarked for California, the largest EV market in North America. This latest boost will be used to increase chargers in established EV regions in the U.S. such as California as well as push into new states, including Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and Vermont.</p>
<p>The company is also adding chargers to a stretch of highway in the upper Midwest, following similar efforts to promote cross-country travel. The subsidiary Electrify Canada will expand its network to nine provinces, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Electrify Canada will also add more stations to British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, the four provinces where it already has a presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The addition of MagSafe to the iPhone 12 line introduced all manner of fun avenues for accessory makers, but there’s a strong case (so to speak) to be made that a snap on battery pack might be the most useful of all. A number of third-parties (notably Anker and Mophie) have introduced their own versions, and now <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJWY3AM/A/magsafe-battery-pack">Apple’s getting in on the action</a>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2176873,2176872,2176871,2176870"]</p>
<p>The simply-named MagSafe Battery Pack went up for pre-order on Apple’s site today for $99, with an estimated arrival of July 19. The new pack comes in white (with a subtly gray Apple logo on the back to let people know you went first-party) and provides up to 15W of wireless charging, per the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other details are scarce at the moment, including  precisely how many phone charges you’ll get out of the pack. Eagle-eyed viewers noticed on the rear of the device, fine-print noting the 1,460 mAh size. The pack itself charges via Lightning port, and users can plug it in with the phone attached to get a quicker charge to both the pack and battery at once.</p>
<p>The price is a premium, compared to Anker and Mophie’s products, which run around the $45-50 range for a 5,000 mAh battery.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a reason startup compensation packages usually include equity, or stock options. For one, it’s a way for startups to remain competitive in the job market and attract top talent. But it’s also a way to reward those employees who join early and give them a tangible reason to stay incentivized to grow the company.</p>
<p>The problem is that while many employees do understand that their equity compensation could mean a big payday in the future — and, in 2021, that’s more likely than ever — they don’t often understand the inevitable complexities of their stock options. That puts employees at risk of not getting the most value after an IPO or, worse, losing them.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been confused about your equity, or haven’t thought much about it, you’re not alone. That’s why I’m going to share three things all employees joining a startup should do with their equity:</p>
<h2>Understand how to value your equity — and when it can change</h2>
<p>While many startups are getting better at proactively communicating the value of your equity package upfront, some are still figuring out the best way to do it. That’s because, unlike the more straightforward number of a salary, stock options are more nuanced — they’re a living, breathing type of compensation.</p>
<p>The most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.</p>
<p>The 409A valuation is based on your company’s valuation. This is also referred to as the fair market value (FMV). The 409A valuation can, and does, often change &#8212; they have to be updated at least once a year by a third-party valuator in order to meet tax rules. The 409A also changes during a fundraising event. Investors involved in the funding round determine how they value the company and are given options, at that valuation, in exchange for cash.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Since the company has now been valued higher, the 409A changes for everyone. It’s also possible for the 409A to go down if, for any reason, the company is now valued at a lower amount. This is known as a “down round.” Airbnb had a notable down round during the pandemic, though it eventually recovered and went public.</p>
<p>Your strike price is the price at which you can buy your stock options (also known as exercising). Yes, buy. You are given the option to buy them, which is why they are called stock options. But know that your strike price will likely never change. However, if you’re ever given more stock options (perhaps as a future bonus), this would be a separate grant and the strike price could be different. Companies are legally required to issue stock options at the most recent 409A price (or higher).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite studies, statistics and oh-so-many pledges, a vast number of companies continue to struggle with recruiting diverse talent. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Some say that it’s not the pipeline problem</a>, it’s an issue with how recruitment rounds and technical interviews are conducted. Others point to success with hiring entry-level diverse talent, but then companies fail to retain and reinvest in those individuals as they progress through their career.</p>
<p>While entrepreneurs continue to poke at the gap between talented, diverse individuals and scaled recruiting, a new merger today between two venture-backed companies paints an ambitious picture of what a promising solution could look like.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.wayup.com/">WayUp</a>, a sourcing platform for diverse candidates, announced that it is merging with <a href="https://yello.co/">Yello</a>, a recruitment software company. The two HR tech companies will operate under Yello as a legal entity but continue to keep their independent branding with a now combined 200 employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We can send all the diverse applicants into applicant tracking systems or CRMs, but if companies don’t have the automation workflow, and the tools and analytics that they need to make sure that those candidates are truly making their way through, then these candidates are sitting in a black hole,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwessel">Liz Wessel</a>, co-founder and CEO of WayUp, said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Wessel’s realization of the &#8220;black hole&#8221; that candidates fell into soon turned into conversations with Yello, which she describes as the “most robust [candidate relationship management solution] in the market for early career.”</p>
<p>Now, by combining forces, the startups will be able to create an end-to-end recruitment tool that helps aggregate a group of diverse candidates who have varied backgrounds from across core and non-core schools, ethnicity, majors, location, gender and ethnicity, and then place them with recruiters into a software-powered job funnel.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K1ggDZgGJb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/as-the-economy-reopens-startups-are-uniquely-positioned-to-recruit-talent/">As the economy reopens, startups are uniquely positioned to recruit talent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As the economy reopens, startups are uniquely positioned to recruit talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/as-the-economy-reopens-startups-are-uniquely-positioned-to-recruit-talent/embed/#?secret=K1ggDZgGJb" data-secret="K1ggDZgGJb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Data-driven diversity</h2>
<p>Wessel has spent the past seven years building up WayUp around the concept of “data-driven diversity.” The platform differentiates from other sourcing and job platforms by asking candidates to self-report race, ethnicity, gender and veteran status. As a result, employers, which are WayUp’s clients, can prioritize diversity when hiring, while early-career professionals can explore curated opportunities based on their profiles.</p>
<p>More recently, WayUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/wayup-diversity-dashboard/">launched a dashboard</a> to help employers see where their recruiting process loses diverse candidates. While that dashboard was WayUp’s first foray into the world of candidate recruitment management, today’s merger with Yello suggests it was just foreshadowing the partnership to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://yello.co/">Yello</a> handles recruitment processes for companies, from top of funnel events such as career fairs through virtual candidate engagement and interview scheduling. The company has landed clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Tableau, eBay and Adobe for its sourcing, engaging and placing software.</p>
<p>“They provide a ton of automation workflow to make it so that companies can significantly, quickly, efficiently and easily get applicants through in a fair and equitable way,” Wessel said. “Companies often don’t struggle with, ‘how do I get more applicants’ at the early career stage, it’s really, ‘how do I get the most qualified, diverse talented candidates hired’.”</p>
<p>Yello’s been working on a sourcing arm for years in its campus recruiting solution. Now, with WayUp, the database will grow to over 6 million candidates across 7,000 campuses. Candidates, while self-reported, are 71% Black, Hispanic or female, along with “tens of thousands” of veterans, a statement about the merger disclosed.</p>
<p>“In addition to offering a powerhouse of data, recruiters will benefit from the automation opportunities of two solutions from a single company,” said<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-ferengul-70b1/"> Corey Ferengul,</a> CEO, Yello, in a statement announcing the merger.</p>
<p>Yello, which didn’t previously have an explicit diversity angle in its software product, is now adding WayUp’s database of talent to its suite of services. And WayUp, which didn’t previously have a candidate relationship management tool, now can offer one to its talent.</p>
<h2>Handshakes</h2>
<p>Even with 6 million early market professionals in its sphere, the companies have a billion-dollar competitor worth paying attention to. Handshake, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/handshake-raises-80m-at-a-1-5b-valuation-as-its-diversity-focused-recruitment-network-for-grads-passes-18m-users/">which last raised money at a $1.5 billion valuation</a>, is a networking and recruitment platform for college students. The job recruiting tool recently passed 18 million users across thousands of universities, including some 120 minority-serving institutions, which include Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions in the U.S., as well as community colleges. Handshake’s focus on diversity isn’t as marketed as WayUp’s, but its footprint, as well as a curated network that brings HBCUVs into conversations with its 550,000 employer clients, shows its commitment to underrepresented groups. Canvas, another venture-backed startup in the HR tech world, similarly offers a recruiting platform that is based on self-reported data, aimed at helping diverse candidates land jobs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RScJqAPiic"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/canvas-lands-20m-so-techs-biggest-companies-can-find-diverse-talent/">Canvas lands $20M so tech&#8217;s biggest companies can find diverse talent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canvas lands $20M so tech&#8217;s biggest companies can find diverse talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/canvas-lands-20m-so-techs-biggest-companies-can-find-diverse-talent/embed/#?secret=RScJqAPiic" data-secret="RScJqAPiic" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With WayUp joining Yello’s brand, it is strengthening its competitive advantage over Handshake, Canvas and other competitors by adding software services to its recruiting tool. It’s been almost four years since both Yello and WayUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/wayup-gets-18-5-million-more-to-help-college-grads-find-jobs/">last raised</a> venture capital money, but the move to merge doesn’t appear to be a lifeboat, as Wessel pointed out that her company beat sales expectations four quarters in a row.</p>
<p>“Yello isn&#8217;t competitive to Handshake at all,” Wessel said over e-mail. “I’ve never heard of one of them winning a deal over the other and we only compete with Handshake if a company isn&#8217;t prioritizing D&amp;I as their main goal. [For what it’s worth], we’ve yet to lose an RFP for D&amp;I sourcing.”</p>
<p>Long-term, it&#8217;s unclear what’s stopping more companies from combining CRM tools with talent tools, Handshake included.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s really hard,” Wessel said. “We have both an Enterprise-grade software that took a decade to build to get it where it is today.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AttackIQ, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> startup that provides organizations with breach and attack simulation solutions, has raised $44 million in Series C funding as it looks to ramp up its international expansion.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/atlantic-bridge/">Atlantic Bridge</a>, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures (SAEV), and Gaingels, with existing vendors — including Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Telstra Ventures — also participating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The round brings the company&#8217;s total funding raised to date to $79 million. </span></p>
<p>AttackIQ was founded in 2013 and is based out of San Diego, California. It provides an automated validation platform that runs scenarios to detect any gaps in a company’s defenses, enabling organizations to test and measure the effectiveness of their security posture and receive guidance on how to fix what&#8217;s broken. Broadly, AttackIQ’s platform helps an organization&#8217;s security teams to anticipate, prepare, and hunt for threats that may impact their business, before hackers get there first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its Security Optimization Platform platform, which supports Windows, Linux, and macOS across public, private, and on-premises cloud environments, is based on the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</a>, a curated knowledge base of known adversary threats, tactics, and techniques. This is used by a number of cybersecurity companies also building continuous validation services including FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/cymulate-nabs-45m-to-test-and-improve-cybersecurity-defenses-via-attack-simulations/">Cymulate</a>.</p>
<p>AttackIQ says this latest round of funding, which comes more than two years after its last, arrives at a “dynamic time” for the company. Not only has cybersecurity become more of a priority for organizations as a result of a major uptick in both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">supply-chain attacks</a>, the company also recently accelerated its international expansion efforts through a partnership with technology distributor Westcon.</p>
<p>The startup says it’s planning to use these new funds to further expand internationally through its newfound partnership with Atlantic Bridge, which will also see Kevin Dillon, the company’s co-founder and managing director, join the AttackIQ board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“AttackIQ has established itself as a category leader with a formidable enterprise customer base that includes four of the Fortune 20,” said Dillon. “We believe deeply in the company’s vision and potential to become the next billion-dollar cybersecurity software company and look forward to helping the company turn early traction in Europe and the Middle East into robust, long-term expansion.”</p>
<p>Brett Galloway, CEO of AttackIQ, said the round &#8220;reaffirms the strength&#8221; of its platform.</p>
<p>As well as enabling organizations to review the robustness of their security defenses, the startup also runs the AttackIQ Academy, which provides free entry-level and advanced cybersecurity training. It has accumulated 17,200 registered students to date across 176 countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to big SaaS products, few are bigger than Google Workspace (formerly known as GSuite). So it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that one of the first people we contacted to speak at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=javiersoltero&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=javierpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS conference on October 27</a> was Google&#8217;s Javier Soltero.</p>
<p>Today, Puerto Rico-born Soltero is Google&#8217;s VP and GM in charge of Workspace, which has well over 2 billion users. Today, it consists of products like Gmail and Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slide Meet, Chat and Drive. Currently, Workspace is going through what may be one of its most important periods of change, too, with extensive new collaboration features and, for the first time, a <a href="https://workspace.google.com/individual/?utm_source=the_keyword&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY21-Q3-GWSforeveryone&amp;utm_content=signup#individual-pricing-card">paid individual plan</a>. All of this, of course, is happening against the backdrop of the pandemic, which made remote collaboration tools and video chat services like Meet more important than ever.</p>
<p>All of that would be enough to make Soltera a good conversation partner for a SaaS event, but his background goes much further than that. He actually started his career as a software engineer at Netscape in the late 90s and after a few other engineering positions, co-founded launched his first startup, the monitoring service Hyperic, in 2004. Hyperic then merged with SpringSource, which was acquired by VMware, landing Soletro in the position as VMware&#8217;s CTO for its SaaS and Application Services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s likely his next startup, the mobile-centric email startup Acompli, though, that you remember. Founded in mid-2013, Microsoft quickly acquired Acompli in late 2014 and then essentially turned into Outlook Mobile. At Microsoft, Soltero rose through the ranks to become a corporate VP for its Office group and Cortana, before decamping to Google in 2019. Since then, he&#8217;s become the public face of GSuite/Workspace and we&#8217;ll use our time with him to talk about the joys and challenges of managing a massive SaaS product, but also about what he learned from building products from the ground up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is tinkering around with a new test feature that changes the way users reshare content they like to their Stories.</p>
<p>The test, which will only appear for a subset of users, lets users see a collection of content they&#8217;ve viewed recently when they&#8217;re in the Stories section of the app. That content will be collected under a new reshare sticker, which can be found in the sticker tray when creating a Story. Posts and Reels viewed in the last hour will appear here along with recently created posts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that people sometimes find reshared content less engaging, personal, and fun,&#8221; an Instagram spokesperson said of the test. &#8220;We hope that with this new test experience, people are encouraged to be more intentional and deliberate when sharing things that matter to them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Content reshared through the sticker will appear against the backdrop of an existing Story, which could encourage more personalization. As it stands now, when users add a post of Reel to their Story, that content generally stands alone against a plain background. The new reshare Sticker adds a new way for people to contextualize content they&#8217;re resharing and makes those posts feel a bit less static (think retweets with comment rather than straight up retweeting a stranger into your feed).</p>
<p>The test isn&#8217;t guaranteed to make it into the full app, but Instagram will use feedback from the new reshare feature to see if it ups the quality of reshared posts. By letting people review what the&#8217;ve seen after the fact rather than just sharing on the fly, the feature could also encourage users to reshare more through their Stories — or at least reshare more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Instagram tests new features all the time. And while test features don&#8217;t always make it into the final product, they do give an indication of what the company is thinking about when it comes to reshaping the app — and the behavior of the more than one billion people who use it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Other recent Instagram tests have toyed with the idea of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">hiding Like counts</a> and experimented <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics/">with mixing algorithmic recommendations into the app&#8217;s main feed.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph</a>, a late stage startup that wants to bring the power of search to code, announced a $125 million Series D investment today on a $2.625 billion valuation, a 3x growth from its previous valuation in December 2020, according to the company.</p>
<p>The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Insight Partners, Geodesic Capital and other existing investors. The company has now raised almost $225 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Quinn Slack says that we know by now that every company is building software, and as they do, they are generating tons of code. &#8220;They&#8217;re all drowning in code, and we help solve that. Our product is universal code search, which helps developers search, understand and automate code,&#8221; Slack explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that companies use Sourcegraph to find problems and vulnerabilities they might not otherwise see. Developers and site reliability engineers may see that there&#8217;s a problem, but getting to the specific part of the code where it&#8217;s happening requires a specialized tool, he says. Some of the large companies might build their own tools for this purpose, but most companies don&#8217;t have the resources and this puts code search within reach of many more developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universal code search that we built &#8212; and we spent a lot of time building it &#8212; is the first kind of code search that actually understands code as code and all the connections, that graph of code. And that means that if you&#8217;re a developer, you can get to that answer of how do I do this thing or how do I fix this or if I change this what&#8217;s going to break, in way less time and that&#8217;s why you need a purpose-built code search tool,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He says that the company was founded in 2013, but it took almost five years to build a product of this sophistication. The startup was able to get funding initially based on the potential of a tool like this. Now investors are seeing the traction they envisioned early on.</p>
<p>Today they have 800,000 developers using the product over the last 12 months and Slack says that they have indexed over 54 billion lines of code. Paying customers include Plaid, Uber, GE and Atlassian. The company has around 160 employees and expects to increase that to 250 by the end of the year with all of this new capital.</p>
<p>The company made the fortunate decision to go fully remote in January of 2020 just a couple of months before offices shut down in the U.S., and his plan is to continue to be remote even after offices fully reopen.</p>
<p>Slack doesn&#8217;t shy away from the IPO question, saying it&#8217;s definitely something they think about. &#8220;We want to be a public company eventually, so that we can show that we&#8217;re going to be around forever. This funding certainly shows that we are growing, and that we are going to stick around and we&#8217;re going to be vendor independent, so you know that&#8217;s that&#8217;s definitely an important part of our strategy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland-based </span><a href="http://mightybuildings.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Buildings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is on a quest to build homes using 3D printing, robotics and automation, has raised a $22 million extension to its Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional capital builds upon a $40 million a raise the company announced earlier this year, bringing its total funding since its 2017 inception to $100 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Building’s self-proclaimed mission is to create “beautiful, sustainable and affordable” homes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be able to 3D print structures “two times as quickly with 95% less labor hours and 10-times less waste” than conventional construction. For example, it says it can 3D print a 350-square-foot studio apartment in just 24 hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Execs say the new capital will go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">making supply chain improvements and moving up research and development timelines. The money will also go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping it achieve a new goal of achieving Net-Zero carbon neutrality by 2028 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– which it says is 22 years ahead of the construction industry overall. </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>“As a founding team, we have long been passionate about solving productivity for construction in a sustainable way,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Slava Solonitsyn. &#8220;We have spent four years figuring out what it takes to achieve that. We believe that we have a master plan now that can work.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, the company has produced and installed a number of accessory dwelling units (ADUs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Ruben, co-founder and Chief Sustainability Officer of Mighty Buildings, said the new funds will also go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kicking off development of the startup’s multi-story offering. The multi-story efforts will likely initially focus on 2-3 story single family homes and townhouses with an eye towards expanding into low-rise apartment buildings.  The company hopes to have at least a prototype multi-story offering in late 2022 or early 2023, according to Ruben.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Along with the sustainability improvements already captured by our new formula, this will allow us to develop our next generation material to get us even closer to our goal of being carbon neutral by 2028,” Ruben said. “It will also give us opportunities to implement improvements in our existing design by reducing the impact of our foundations and other, non-printed elements.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Mighty Buildings plans to speed up its carbon neutrality roadmap by building “high-throughput, sustainable” micro factories, forming strategic supply chain partnerships, accelerating ”blue skies” technology research and developing new composite materials produced from recycled or bio-based feedstock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The micro factories, according to the company, will be able to produce 200 to 300 homes per year in locations where housing gaps exist. Mighty Buildings plans to create single family residential developments with its panelized “Mighty Kit System.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Buildings has seen quarter over quarter growth in sales, Ruben said, with the company seeing a record of over $7 million in total contracted revenue in the second quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also excited about its new fiber reinforced printing material, which is currently undergoing testing with certification expected to be completed later this year. Mighty Buildings claims that its new formula shows “over 50% improvement” in embodied carbon from its original material and a strength profile similar to reinforced concrete, with more than 4 times less weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round extension was supported by a few new and existing investors including ArcTern Ventures, Core Innovation Capital, Decacorn Capital, Gaingels, Khosla Ventures, Klaff Realty, MicroVentures, Modern Venture Partners, Polyvalent Capital, Vibrato Capital and others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to bug bounties, Facebook lags behind the likes of Microsoft and Google in terms of overall payouts and volume of tips received: last year, Microsoft and Google respectively paid out <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/07/08/microsoft-bug-bounty-programs-year-in-review-13-6m-in-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13.6 million</a> and <a href="http://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/vulnerability-reward-program-2020-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.7 million</a>; Facebook meanwhile paid out just $1.98 million as of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November</a>.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, Facebook&#8217;s a younger company and is working on improving its system to keep it on bounty hunters&#8217; radar. In the latest development, Facebook today said that it would be adding a new set of bonus rewards when it pays out on a report if more than 30 days have passed since Facebook first received it.</p>
<p>The Payout Time Bonus, as Facebook is calling it, will work on a sliding scale, where payouts made between 30-59 days will get a 5% bonus; payouts made between 60-89 days will get a 7.5% bonus; and payouts made after 90 days or more will get a 10% bonus. Facebook doesn&#8217;t specify what the base amount is, but in its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of bounties</a>, its highest payouts per bug were as much as $80,000 and $60,000 with some $40,000 paid out in its existing bonus program. But payments might be as low as $500.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The extra money will work as a kind of incentive to bounty hunters who make a living from these tips, so that when delays happen with Facebook paying out for legitimate tips, the bug hunters know they&#8217;ll get a more lucrative reward for their work in the end — rather than get turned off from working on Facebook-property bugs altogether.</p>
<p>Bug hunting has become a big business for security researchers, with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/oversecured-mobile-app-security-bug-bounty/">making upwards of $1 million annually</a> from the programs. But bounty hunting is a double-edged sword: it definitely focuses top minds on to specific platforms, but in doing so, they spend more time there than looking for vulnerabilities in some places than others. That leads the biggest platforms to ensure that they are making their bug-ridden environments more, or as, &#8220;attractive&#8221; as others to get people to contribute to their work.</p>
<p>Facebook says that it determines&nbsp;bounty&nbsp;amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) impact, ease of exploitation, and quality of the report. &#8220;If we pay a&nbsp;bounty, the minimum reward is $500,&#8221; they told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;We reward researchers based on the maximum possible impact of their report that we find during our own internal investigation of each&nbsp;bug, rather than based on the impact reported initially by the researcher,&#8221; they continued. &#8220;Sometimes our impact investigations can lead tosignificantly higher&nbsp;bounties&nbsp;for researchers, but they can also sometimes take more time to complete. The Payout Time Bonus is meant to also reward our researchers for their patience during this process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ongoing&nbsp;payout guideline series, shares more details to help external researchers better understand our payout decisions. We have published three guidelines so far and will publish more in the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brooklyn-based Looking Glass Factory today announced the release of a pair of second-gen holographic displays. Following up on late-last year’s release of the entry-level Portrait, the startup is offering new versions of the Looking Glass 4K and 8K systems, which sport 15.6- and 32-inch displays, respectively.</p>
<p>In addition to sizes, there’s a pretty massive gulf in pricing here. Joining the $299 Portrait is the $3,000 4K and $17,500 8K. The pricing difference is all the more pronounced given that the tech essentially offers the same underlying technologies for producing and consuming 3D content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2176398" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176398" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2176398" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4k___t-rex-by-Ashkan-Azarmi.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176398" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Looking Glass</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Volume is a part of it,” CEO Shawn Frayne tells TechCrunch. “There are actually very few 8K displays out in the world at this size that folks are driving. While we expect the sale of that to be quite profound over the next few years, in the early phases we’re just not making the same scale as the Portrait.”</p>
<p>The company considers the Portrait a kind of ambassador for its technology &#8212; especially over the past year, when getting the systems in front of potential buyers was next to impossible. Having seen a number of Looking Glass’ older systems in person, I can attest to the fact that the effect really isn’t the same over Zoom. Looking Glass says it has sold 11,000 units and is shipping “thousands” a month as it works to fulfil demand and navigate global supply chain issues.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2176400" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176400" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2176400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8k___medical.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176400" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Looking Glass</p></div></p>
<p>“I think of it as their first opportunity to get their own holographic display without needing their boss’s approval,” said Frayne. &#8220;Someone is curious about it and they get it, and it lives up to or exceeds expectation and they go from there. The quality level is very high for the Portrait, and the bigger units are a bigger format version of that quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new models will be replacing their predecessors, which were effectively developer units, rather than mainstream consumer products (though the company will continue to offer support). In addition to lower cost, the second-gen units are lighter and offer improved visual fidelity over their processors &#8212; particularly around the edges, where holographic displays can encounter issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been almost exactly a year since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/announcing-the-techcrunch-list/">we launched The TechCrunch List</a>, a curated directory of venture capitalists designed to guide founders to the VCs most relevant to their startups. We had nearly 4,000 recommendations from founders — often with extensive documentation that in some cases exceeded 1000 words. From our initial edition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-techcrunch-list-update/">several extensive updates</a>, we ultimately selected 531 investors.</p>
<p>It was a great experiment used by hundreds of thousands of people with surprisingly deep engagement (people <i>really</i> love reading lists, apparently). Nonetheless, we are officially retiring the product today.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: the venture capital industry has radically changed over the past year, and the central thesis we used in constructing the list no longer applies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When we designed the list — which, to be clear, was never a ranking — we organized experienced investors across three main axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Specialization</b>: We believed that investor specialization mattered. We wanted to match biotech founders with biotech investors and ecommerce companies with ecommerce VCs. The bulk of our work reading through all those founder recommendations was identifying the brilliant investors in 31 different market categories who could offer differentiated strategic advice.</li>
<li><b>Stage</b>: We wanted to match founders with investors who would invest at the stage their companies were at, ranging from pre-seed to growth.</li>
<li><b>Geography</b>: We believed that local investors would have an edge over distant investors for founders, particularly at the earliest stages where regular counseling would be useful to reaching product-market fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, we took a very strong view that capital wasn’t a commodity, and that the right investor could radically change the trajectory of a founder’s ambitions.</p>
<p>When we started putting together the plans for The TechCrunch List in January 2020, the pandemic was just starting to spread around the world, and many of these assumptions still held true. However, as I think we have all seen, those assumptions have been completely upended over the past year.</p>
<p>The reality today is that capital has never been cheaper or more commodity. VCs invest rapidly, in all geographies, at all stages, in all industries, constantly, rapidly, and all the time.</p>
<p>I constantly heard this feedback over the past few months from both founders and investors. For founders, the focus on terms and price seem to consistently outrank nearly any other factor in building a relationship with an investor. Few founders would ever countenance lowering the valuations of their companies for a more experienced or specialized investor or an investor who was located locally. At the same price, these factors could differentiate one investor from another, but otherwise, price prevails, pretty much every single time.</p>
<p>Commensurately, VCs (and this applies most heavily at big funds of course) no longer care about any guidelines or theses around investing. Any stage, any geography, any market — if there is a deal to be done, they get it done and quickly. Tiger Global and SoftBank’s Vision Fund dominate this narrative, but there are at least a good dozen other firms that have similar styles these days. And given these are some of the largest firms by assets under management, they also just dominate the term sheets flying around the startup world.</p>
<p>If The TechCrunch List was about bringing signal to the noise of fundraising in order to save founders serious time and work, the reality is that the market today is just complete noise and frenetic chaos, and there truly isn’t much to be done to clarify that. The upshot is that VCs make decisions with more alacrity than ever before, so the good news is that the chaos should be short-lived for founders today.</p>
<p>So what’s next? We’ll continue experimenting with ways to help founders fundraise and find the best investors for them. That’s the premise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/?tpcc=ecleftnav">Extra Crunch</a>, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">Early Stage events</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">the Extra Crunch stage at Disrupt</a> (which is coming up in just a few weeks — so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your tickets</a> now!) as well as our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/">Extra Crunch Live series</a> of discussions. Who knows, maybe we’ll introduce The TechCrunch List in another form in the future. But for today, it’s burned out and taking a nice, long, post-pandemic vacation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What’s driving the venture capital market in the United States to be as hot as it has proven to be? FOMO, plus the constituent belief that trying to time the market is a mistake.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now in the opening weeks of the third quarter, The Exchange is taking a look back at the Q2 2021 venture capital market. Data indicate that it was incredibly active, with global and regional records shattered during the three-month period.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021">data from CB Insights</a>, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">The Exchange reported</a> that global venture capital activity shot to $156 billion in the second quarter, up 157% from the year-ago Q2 result of just under $61 billion. More unicorns were born in the second quarter than any similar period to date, and valuations ticked higher.</p>
<p>The only data that seemingly didn’t come back in superlative fashion was round counts, which failed to set all-time highs in some cases. But the general vibe of Q2 venture capital data was clear: It’s a great time for startups looking to raise capital.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span>To better understand what’s going on, we talked to investors from different regions to get a grip on how they view their market.</p>
<p>Today we’re discussing the U.S. startup world, including notes from Costanoa Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham">Amy Cheetham</a>, MaC Venture Capital’s <a href="https://twitter.com/marloncnichols">Marlon Nichols</a>, NEA’s <a href="https://twitter.com/veelarco">Vanessa Larco</a>, and EY U.S. venture capital lead <a href="https://twitter.com/grabow">Jeff Grabow</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are investors writing so many checks? Let’s find out.</span></p>
<h2>A boom in venture-ready startups?</h2>
<p>Given the record capital deployed in the quarter, the fact that deal volume failed to reach all-time highs had us wondering <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">if the market lacked venture-backable startups.</span></p>
<p>If so, the lack of possible investments would help explain both rising deal size and resulting valuations. With lots of capital provided to venture investors themselves in recent quarters, a lack of startups that fit the venture model would force investors to compete with one another fiercely, possibly leading to larger rounds and higher prices.</p>
<p>That’s not the case. Instead, according to NEA&#8217;s Larco, “there are more than enough venture-ready startups to fund,&#8221; adding that “the pace of innovation across all industries and geographies has been astounding.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cadoo.io">Cadoo</a>, a US-startup that&#8217;s gamifying fitness by turning it into a betting opportunity, using the prospect of winning (or losing) cold hard cash to motivate people to get off the couch, has collected $1.5 million in seed funds from Sam &amp; Max Altman’s Apollo VC and the student-focused Dorm Room Fund.</p>
<p>The app itself has been around since 2018 but in March 2020 it launched a &#8220;challenge model&#8221; that lets users stake money to join a challenge related to a specific fitness goal &#8212; be it running 10 miles in 10 days, or walking three miles in three days.</p>
<p>Participants who achieve the challenge goal get their stake back and a pro-rata share of losers&#8217; staked entry fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A range of fitness levels are catered to by Cadoo&#8217;s challenges (&#8220;from daily steps to marathon training&#8221;), with some 50 public challenges hosted per week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also adding private challenges this month &#8212; which will enable users to host and configure fitness challenges for themselves/family and friends, or larger groups, such as companies, clubs, or schools.</span></p>
<p>Challenge-related activity is verified by <span class="il">the app</span> via API data from activity trackers and fitness apps. (Which hopefully means Cadoo is smart enough to detect if someone has attached their Fitbit to their dog&#8230; )</p>
<p>The app has support for a number of third party fitness services, including Strava, Fitbit and Apple Health.</p>
<p>CEO and founder <span style="font-weight: 400;">Colm Hayden describes the startup as &#8220;DraftKings for your own fitness goals&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our audience consists of 25-50 year old fitness fanatics&#8217; who use <span class="il">Cadoo</span> to stay committed to their monthly/weekly fitness goals,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span> told TechCrunch, adding: <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When people are serious about a goal they are trying to reach, they want intense motivation to back their ambitions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>He says the app has attracted around 7,000 wager-loving users so far.</p>
<p>Cadoo&#8217;s business model is based on taking a fee from challenge losers before their entry fee stakes are distributed to challenge winners &#8212; which does potentially give the business an incentive to set harder challenges than users are able to complete.</p>
<p>But of course it&#8217;s up to users to pick which challenges to enter and thereby commit their hard earned cash to.</p>
<p>It also claims that 90% of users who sign up for Cadoo challenges successfully complete them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayden says it has future plans to expand monetization potential by offer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ing winners fitness products &#8212; and taking a margin on those </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">products. And also by expanding into other types of verifiable goals, not just running/walking. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are working to build a motivation platform that enables anybody to reach their goals,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Financial incentives is an intense motivator, and 90% of users who sign up for Cadoo challenges reach their fitness goals. We are making Cadoo much bigger than just running goals, and in the future incentivizing almost any goal verifiable on the internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the app is US-based payments are processed by PayPal and <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayden says it&#8217;s able to support participation internationally &#8212; at least </span>everywhere where PayPal is available.</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed raise in a statement, Apollo VC&#8217;s Altman brothers added: <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cadoo makes it easy to motivate users to stay active with financial incentives. We believe the motivation industry that Cadoo is pioneering will be an important digital money use-case.”</span></p>
<p>Before the seed round, Cadoo says it had raised<span style="font-weight: 400;"> $350,000 via </span>an angel round from Tim Parsa’s Cloud Money Ventures Angel Syndicate, Wintech Ventures, and Daniel Gross&#8217;s Pioneer.</p>
<p>Of course gamification of health is nothing new &#8212; given the data-fuelled quantification and goal-based motivation that&#8217;s been going on around fitness for years, fuelled by wearables that make it trivially easy to track steps, distances, calories burned etc.</p>
<p>But injecting money into the mix adds another competitive layer that may be helpful for motivating a certain type of person to get or stay fit.</p>
<p>Cadoo isn&#8217;t the only fitness-focused startup to be taking this tack, either, though &#8212; with a number of apps that pay users to lose weight or otherwise be active (albeit, sometimes less directly by paying them in digital currency that can be exchanged for &#8216;rewards&#8217;). <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Others in the space include the likes of </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/tc50-healthywage-pays-you-to-get-in-better-shape/">HealthyWage</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (a TC50 company we covered all the way back in 2009!); Runtopia and StepBet, to name a few.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium-sized businesses in Latin America can find it difficult to get the funds they need to export their goods to the United States. It’s a gap <a href="https://www.marcofi.com/">Marco Financial</a> is looking to bridge through its tech-enabled risk assessment platform that can provide better insight on who should receive loans.</p>
<p>To continue its mission, the Miami-based trade finance company raised $7 million in seed funding and $75 million in a credit facility, led by Arcadia Funds LLC and Kayyak Ventures, to increase its credit line to $100 million. Marco was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/miami-based-marco-is-offering-revenue-based-lending-for-latin-american-companies/">backed last September by a small seed round</a> from Struck Capital and Antler and over $20 million in a credit facility underwritten by Arcadia Funds.</p>
<p>Additional investors in the newest seed round and expanded credit facility include Village Global VC, Flexport Ventures, Tresalia Capital, 342 Capital, Struck Capital, Antler LLC, Antler Elevate, Florida Funders, Fox Ventures and Arpegio – Venture Capital. Strategic angel investors include Phil Bentley, CEO of Mitie, and Naman Budhdeo, co-founder and CEO of TripStack and FlightNetwork.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jacob Shoihet, Marco’s co-founder and CEO, says not only is there a roughly $350 billion trade finance market to go after, but cited data learned from Javier Urrutia, director of Foreign Investments at PROCOLOMBIA, an organization that promotes foreign investment and nontraditional exports in Colombia, that for every 1% increase in export productivity, 500,000 new jobs can be created.</p>
<p>“For small and medium businesses in trade, this is important for companies creating a high level of job growth and lowering the poverty rate,” Shoihet told TechCrunch. “By making it easier for businesses to transcend the 30, 60, 90 and now even 120 days they wait to be paid for supplies, we can solve that gap and unlock billions in value so that companies can scale.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Miami-based Marco Financial is launching a revenue-based lending service for Latin American SMEs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/miami-based-marco-is-offering-revenue-based-lending-for-latin-american-companies/embed/#?secret=NNYVSNtKRv" data-secret="NNYVSNtKRv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Shoihet met his co-founder and COO Peter D. Spradling through the Antler accelerator, a Singapore- and New York-based early-stage investment and advisory services program that connects entrepreneurs and tech operators to launch new businesses. They started Marco in 2019 and now have offices in New York, Dallas and across Latin America.</p>
<p>Spradling was born in Uruguay and knows firsthand about the challenges of importing and exporting from working in his family’s slaughterhouse and later founding three of his own companies. In fact, one of his businesses imported e-cigarettes — his mother was a lifelong smoker, and he wanted to help her quit. He recalls pre-selling his inventory at a discount in order to get the money to import the goods.</p>
<p>“Banks don’t like risk, which means businesses spend most of their time trying to get financing rather than increasing sales,” Spradling told TechCrunch. “Banks in Latin America have a saying that ‘they lend money to people who don’t need it.’ Families with money can access the banks, but you can’t launch a business without capital, and many owners lack that access to banks.”</p>
<p>Marco’s factoring product enables new companies to get started without having to put up the significant amount of collateral that banks are asking. Banks typically look at financial statements for the past two years of the business and give a line of credit accordingly. Not needing as much collateral also enables more women in Latin America to become business owners because they often don’t have collateral, Spradling said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Marco reduces risk by basing its lines of credit on an analysis of the future potential of the business, thereby freeing up cash so that small and medium exporters can continue their operations and invest in their growth. The company is able to show what kind of financing can be obtained based on the amount of data customers provide. Marco also said it can reduce the loan origination process from over two months to one week and provide funding to approved exporters within 24 hours.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How tech can build more resilient supply chains&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/how-tech-can-build-more-resilient-supply-chains/embed/#?secret=qTXbm9W76i" data-secret="qTXbm9W76i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cristóbal Silva Lombardi, general partner at Kayyak Ventures, told TechCrunch that Marco is providing an alternative for small and medium exporters to access capital that they previously had to get from friends and family.</p>
<p>In countries like Chile, electronic invoicing innovation has enabled the factoring industry to grow, and in turn, companies like Marco tend to become leaders in supply chain financing and shrink the high interest rates spread between small businesses and large firms.</p>
<p>“Marco wants to take that worldwide,” Silva Lombardi said. “There is a lot of value to tackle. Factoring is one of the corners in the financing market that hasn’t been tackled, and by using technology, Marco is building and creating value for the whole society. This is where venture capital firms should be putting their dollars — in companies where technology and talent unleash a lot of value.”</p>
<p>Since launching its product in January 2020, the company has processed thousands of invoices across 20 countries, amounting to more than $18 million.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t easy in the beginning, according to Shoihet. Starting during the global pandemic, Marco initially had challenges accessing the market due to exports and supply chains being strained.</p>
<p>Today, Marco has found its groove and is lending as little as $25,000 per month and as much as $10 million, Shoihet said.</p>
<p>As such, the new funding will go toward simplifying cross-border payments, assessing risk and productizing ways to take unstructured data, processes and work to create a better experience for the customer. The company also said it aims to give large logistics providers the ability to finance exports on their own.</p>
<p>Marco was also able to attract new leadership, including Prajwal Manalwar, chief product officer, and Sabrina Teichman, chief growth officer. Manalwar worked for 13 years at PayPal, where he most recently was a product lead focused on debit card authorization rates and in-store payments. Teichman joins after 11 years with the U.S. government, most recently serving as managing director for the U.S. International Development Finance Corp.</p>
<p>“Now we can work on how to solve the problem at a larger scale by building infrastructure and information through the underwriting process and through partnerships from larger players in shipping, trade services and insurance — all incumbent industries that have clients with working capital,” Shoihet said. “By innovating the underwriting process, we can come to better conclusions and be the trade finance-as-a-service provider to clients in emerging markets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask any employee and they’ll tell you one of their least favorite things to do is file expenses. And for companies, the process of managing corporate spend is one of their biggest challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate credit cards help ease that pain, so it’s no surprise that the competition between startups in the space is heating up by the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the fastest growing players in the space is <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, a fintech company that earlier this year secured a $150 million debt facility with Goldman Sachs after having </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a $30 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in late December 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the New York-based company is announcing a new feature that it says will give its corporate customers greater control and flexibility over the way their cards are used. Specifically, Ramp said it now offers its customers the option to approve or block merchants on the cards they offer to their employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Ramp co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the move was in response to customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was one of our most requested features, especially from companies with over 100 employees,” he told TechCrunch. “They said, ‘I can block a spam call. It’s crazy I can&#8217;t do this with my credit card.’ ”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2176514" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176514" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2176514 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg 2916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=1536,1011 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=2048,1348 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Merchant-Restrictions.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2176514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ramp</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new feature, Ramp says companies “have complete control” over how their employees use their corporate cards, down to the vendor level. It allows companies to outline specifically who employees can spend with, which vendors can be charged on what card and how much they can charge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why is this a big deal? Glyman said this means that merchant-specific cards greatly reduce the risk from stolen or compromised cards. It also helps keep employees from inflating expenses or filing false reimbursement claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gives security and control back to finance teams in a way that was never before possible,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps companies in their quest to save money by using corporate credit cards in the first place, Glyman added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, they can restrict spending to businesses or companies that they have discounts or preferential pricing with,” he said. “It’s another layer of enforcement for finance teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process was not an easy one since understanding and clustering unique identifiers to be able to identify merchants was “technically complex,” according to Glyman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Ramp counts “thousands” of businesses as customers, with well into the tens of thousands of individuals using its cards.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen will ramp up its software, mobility as a service and battery tech to stay competitive in the coming decades, as it and other automakers prepare for the largest transition in personal mobility since the invention of the car.</p>
<p>Laying out the company strategy Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess emphasized a top-to-bottom transformation in everything from manufacturing to revenue streams. If revenue was historically driven by sales of internal combustion engine vehicles, Volkswagen CFO Arno Antlitz said the rest of the decade bring income derived not only from electric vehicle sales, but also software, autonomous driving and even ridesharing.</p>
<p>To that end, the company has been busy, planning six battery Gigafactories in Europe and an €800 million ($944 million) hardware platform research and development facility in West Berlin. The company’s also beefing up its in-house automotive software arm Cariad, which VW said could generate as much as €1.2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in revenue by 2030, via subscriptions and other sales.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Volkswagen also has big plans for autonomous driving. The company wants to take a chunk of the market share from ridesharing and car rental, and it sees an integrated AV platform as the way to do it. Executives painted a vivid picture of customers being able to request a Volkswagen electric AV taxi or shuttle by the end of the decade, one that may not even include a steering wheel or driver’s seat, according to renderings shown during the presentation.</p>
<p>“Imagine that your grandmother or your eight-year-old son can hop in a Volkswagen cab to visit one another, whenever they want, without mom or dad behind the wheel,” Diess suggested. “You can use one of our mobility apps, and an ID Buzz will pick you up and your friends.”</p>
<p>Personal vehicles will be powered by Cariad, which the OEM said will have “level 4 readiness” by 2025. Shared mobility vehicles, like shuttles or taxis, will also be VW-owned and operated, and run on tech developed by AV company Argo AI. Volkswagen closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/self-driving-vehicle-startup-argo-ai-completes-2-6b-deal-with-volkswagen-expands-to-europe/">$2.6 billion investment</a> in the startup last June.</p>
<p>Europe’s largest automaker anticipates its investments in MaaS will pay off: The company expects annual revenues of over $70 billion in the five largest European markets alone by 2030, Christian Senger, CTO of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, said. The autonomous rideshare ID Buzz, which is being tested in a pilot project in Munich, will be rolled out as a commercial service in Hamburg in 2025, followed shortly by the U.S.</p>

<p>In line with these estimates, the automaker anticipates BEV sales will account for 25% of sales by 2025 and 50% by 2030. ICE margins will likely come under increased pressure due to declining demand, tighter emissions regulations and comparative tax disadvantages, so Volkswagen plans to decrease its number of ICE models by 60% in Europe by 2030. Cost parity between ICE and BEV should be achieved within two to three years, Antlitz said, thanks to economies of scale and lower factory costs.</p>
<p>It’s an optimistic future, but one in which Volkswagen is fully confident: The company upped its profit target for 2025 to 8-9%, from 7-8%.</p>
<p>“Until 2030, the world of mobility will have seen the greatest transformation since the transition from horses to cars at the beginning of the 20th century,” Diess said. “The future of cars, the future of individual mobility, will be bright.”</p>
