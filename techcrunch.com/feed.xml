										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Myanmar&#8217;s new military government has <a href="https://twitter.com/waiwainu/status/1357720557421268992">ordered</a> local telecom operators, internet gateways, and other internet service providers to block Twitter and Instagram in the South Asian country days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/myanmar-orders-telecom-networks-to-temporarily-block-facebook/">imposing a similar blackout on Facebook</a> service to ensure &#8220;stability&#8221; in the Southeast Asian nation.</p>
<p>Several users from Myanmar <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/myanmar/">confirmed</a> that they were unable to access Twitter. NetBlocks, which tracks global internet usage, further reported that multiple networks in the country had started to block the American social network.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s Transport and Communications alleged in its order, dated February 5, that Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram were being abused to spread propaganda and misinformation to the public and this posed threat to stability of the nation. The ministry offered the same explanation when it ordered to temporarily block Facebook until February 7th midnight earlier this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friday&#8217;s order comes as thousands of Myanmar citizens joined Twitter this week to protest the new military government that seized power by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2A00VK">detaining civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi</a> and other democratically elected leaders of her National League for Democracy, which won by landslide last year.</p>
<p>Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week on Extra Crunch Live, the duo explained how they came together for Grafana's Series A — and eventually, its Series B. We've included highlights as well as the full video of our conversation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before he was a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Gaurav Gupta had his eye on Grafana Labs, the company that supports open-source analytics platform <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/">Grafana</a>. But Raj Dutt, Grafana&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, played hard to get.</p>
<p>This week on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo explained how they came together for Grafana&#8217;s Series A — and eventually, its Series B. They also walked us through Grafana&#8217;s original Series A pitch deck before Gupta shared the aspects that stood out to him and how he communicated those points to the broader partnership at Lightspeed.</p>
<p>Gupta and Dutt also offered feedback on pitch decks submitted by audience members and shared their thoughts about what makes a great founder presentation, pulling back the curtain on how VCs actually consume pitch decks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve included highlights below as well as the full video of our conversation.</p>
<p>We record new episodes of Extra Crunch Live each Wednesday at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST/8 p.m. GMT. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Check out the February schedule here.</a></p>
<h2>Episode breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li>How they met — 2:20</li>
<li>Grafana&#8217;s early pitch deck — 12:25</li>
<li>The enterprise ecosystem — 26:00</li>
<li>The pitch deck teardown — 33:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>How they met</h2>
<p>As soon as Gupta joined Lightspeed in June 2019, he began pursuing Dutt and Grafana Labs. He texted, called and emailed, but he got little to no response. Eventually, he made plans to go meet the team in Stockholm but, even then, Dutt wasn&#8217;t super responsive.</p>
<p>The pair told the story with smiles on their faces. Dutt said that not only was he disorganized and not entirely sure of his own travel plans to see his co-founder in Stockholm, Grafana wasn&#8217;t even raising. Still, Gupta persisted and eventually sent a stern email.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one point, I was like &#8216;Raj, forget it. This isn&#8217;t working&#8217;,&#8221; recalled Gupta. &#8220;And suddenly he woke up.&#8221; Gupta added that he got mad, which &#8220;usually does not work for VCs, by the way, but in this case, it kind of worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they finally met, they got along. Dutt said they were able to talk shop due to Gupta&#8217;s experience inside organizations like Splunk and Elastic. Gupta described the trip as a whirlwind, where time just flew by.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons that I liked Gaurav is that he was a new VC,&#8221; explained Dutt. &#8220;So to me, he seemed like one of the most non-VC VCs I&#8217;d ever met. And that was actually quite attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this day, Gupta and Dutt don&#8217;t have weekly standing meetings. Instead, they speak several times a week, conversing organically about industry news, Grafana&#8217;s products and the company&#8217;s overall trajectory.</p>
<h2>Grafana&#8217;s early pitch deck</h2>
<p>Dutt shared Grafana&#8217;s pre-Series A pitch deck — which he actually sent to Gupta and Lightspeed before they met — with the Extra Crunch Live audience. But as we know now, it was the conversations that Dutt and Gupta had (eventually) that provided the spark for that deal.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[In a single week, Robinhood raised more money than all startups in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russia combined last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood has shown an impressive ability to raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">enormous amounts of capital</a> in the past few weeks to ensure it has the funds needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">allow users to trade</a> and, presumably, provide it with enough cash until it goes public. Raising $3.4 billion so quickly is an extraordinary feat.</p>
<p>But how the company managed to get investors to wire money with such alacrity has been a curiosity; what about Robinhood was <em>so</em> compelling that giving it a multibillion dollar injection was such an obvious decision?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>We got a whiff of it when we parsed Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020 payment for order flow (PFOF) data, which showed the discount trading service growing nicely from its Q3 results. Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF revenue growth had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">slowed in sequential terms in the third quarter of 2020</a>, but the final quarter iced near-term concerns that the unicorn&#8217;s growth days were behind it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But then the company gave us a little more, a few charts that I think better explain why Robinhood was able to raise so much money so quickly.</p>
<h2>Equities and options volumes go up</h2>
<p>The reason why Robinhood was able to raise lots more cash very quickly was because the company&#8217;s PFOF revenue driver likely went into overdrive during the mess that was the GameStop period, This is somewhat obvious, as many people were trading.</p>
<p>But thanks to a new chart from the company <a href="https://robinhood.engineering/reflections-on-robinhoods-growth-4f117e75adc5">posted on its own blog</a>, we now know that Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF incomes were likely spiking to all-time highs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the chart the company published, which I have loosely marked with quarterly intervals. Per Robinhood, the green line is &#8220;Robinhood equities and options trading volumes over a longer time horizon, through last week:&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tickr.co.uk/">Tickr</a>, an app that allows U.K. consumers to make financial investments based on their impact on society and the environment, has secured £2.5 million ($3.4 million) in funding lead by <a href="https://www.adaventures.com/">Ada Ventures</a>, a VC which focuses on &#8220;impact&#8221; startups. The cash will be used for product development, expanding the user base, and eventually taking Tickr into other European countries from its current U.K. base.</p>
<p>As well as investing, the platform allows customers to spend their cash via partnerships with impact-oriented compares, and offset their carbon footprint through a subscription. The core business model is £1 p/m per customer, plus 0.30% on assets above £3,000. Additional products, like carbon offsets, for example, are charged as a separate additional subscription depending on the tier selected.</p>
<p>The startup says it is approaching 100,000 users in the U.K. and is reaching a millennial audience, 90% of which have &#8220;never invested before&#8221; (they say) and these users are investing £250 per month on average.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The app is not billed as a trading app, with quick &#8220;in and outs&#8221;, but is about building wealth whilst investing in a diversified portfolio of high-impact companies. Its competitors include <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/">MoneyBox</a>, but Tickr says it is “100% pure impact focus” by contrast. The vast majority of Europeans don&#8217;t invest in markets, so this could be a good opportunity for the product.</p>
<p>Founders Tom McGillycuddy and Matt Latham spent eight years working in investment management, but say they became disillusioned by the jargon, high fees and indifference to causes such as the environment.</p>
<p>Over text interview, McGillycuddy told me: “We also realized there was zero consideration for the underlying impact of the investments people were making; it was purely about the return. Coming from Wigan and Liverpool, we were the first people in our families to be exposed to this world, and it didn&#8217;t seem right.” The pair moved into impact investing and subsequently went on to launch Tickr in 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India is restoring 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, a senior government official said Friday evening, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/india-gets-more-aggressive-with-internet-shutdowns-to-curb-protests/">18 months after imposing a sweeping communications blackout</a> in the Muslim-majority region in an attempt to curb the spread of potential backlash over New Delhi&#8217;s decision to revoke Kashmir&#8217;s semiautonomous status in August of 2019.</p>
<p>Rohit Kansal, principal secretary of the Jammu and Kashmir government, said 4G internet services were being restored in the entire region.</p>
<p>India partially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/india-restores-social-media-access-in-kashmir-for-2-weeks/">lifted the ban on internet</a> in two districts &#8212; out of 20 &#8212; of the state last year but maintained speed restrictions (2G internet), after a ruling from the Supreme Court that found an indefinite shutdown of the internet in the state <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/internet-shutdown-supreme-court-india-kashmir/">unwarranted, and demonstrated “abuse of power”</a> by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lifting of restrictions at the time had applied to 301 &#8220;whitelisted&#8221; services that included entertainment platforms such as Netflix and Amazon and some news outlets including The New York Times. Many Indian news outlets remained blocked, along with all social media. Many residents complained that the slow 2G speeds barely allowed them to check their emails and WhatsApp messages.</p>
<p>The internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir, home to more than 13 million people, has been by far the longest by any democracy.</p>
<p>In August, New Delhi told Supreme Court that it will start offering high-speed internet in one district of Jammu and one of Kashmir Valley on a &#8220;trial basis.&#8221; Late last year, the government resumed broadband service in the region. Critics have said that ban on internet has cost citizens of Jammu and Kashmir hundreds of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dublin-based <a href="https://www.frontline.vc/">Frontline Ventures</a> has released details of its new €70 million ($83.8 million) Frontline Seed Fund III, which will be aimed at European B2B startups. The new fund will bring Frontline&#8217;s total funds under management to €250 million, deployed out of its offices in London, Dublin and San Francisco. Backers of the fund include the European Investment Fund (EIF), Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Irish banking giant AIB, along with 10 tech angels, largely post-exit entrepreneurs, from Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>The new fund has already begun to invest in early-stage companies, and is aiming at investing in up to 45 companies over the next four years. Investments will range from €250,000 to €2.5 million. It follows Frontline’s recent new U.S.-based growth-stage fund, Frontline X, which is geared to U.S. startups wanting to expand to Europe and the EU region, given that Ireland is an EU member, and well placed to benefit from the ramifications of Brexit.</p>
<p>William McQuillan, partner, said the fund would invest about 50% of the fund into new early-stage companies. The remaining funds will be delayed for later investments in existing portfolio companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s McQuillan’s view that, with Europe having 26% of all the global B2B software market and the U.S. at 50 to 55%, Europe has plenty of growth opportunities.</p>
<p>The new seed fund launches at a time when U.S. VC firms are putting down roots in Europe, such as Sequoia, which opened an office in London last year, and more recently General Catalyst. In May of 2020, Frontline invested in Irish HQ’d company Evervault, alongside Kleiner Perkins, Index and Sequoia.</p>

<p>Seventy percent of Frontline’s seed portfolio companies have raised capital from U.S. VCs since 2012, and Frontline partners have experience with companies such as Google, Twitter, SurveyMonkey, Airtable and Yammer.</p>
<p>In a statement, McQuillan said, &#8220;When we looked at the data back in 2012 &#8211; at the very start of Frontline &#8211; it was painfully clear that European entrepreneurs lacked the infrastructure and support to build a global business out of Europe. Today, Europe rightfully finds itself on top-tier US investors’ target list, but global expansion remains an important challenge to solve. As a team, we&#8217;ve pooled all of our experience and resources into helping our founders cross the Atlantic. Seed Fund III will be an extension of our work &#8211; to help founders get off the ground &#8211; and go global.”</p>
<p>Frontline’s more notable investments include Linked Finance, Clearbanc and Currencyfair. The Frontline X growth fund has invested in the Series B of TripActions; People.ai’s $100 million Series C; and Clearbanc’s $50 million Series B.</p>
<p>Notable exits include Logentries, which was acquired by Rapid7; Orchestrate, acquired by CenturyLink; and Pointy acquired by Google in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.djamo.ci/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djamo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a financial super app for consumers in Francophone Africa, is the first startup from Ivory Coast to get backing from Y Combinator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been a huge profusion of financial services that have emerged in recent years in Africa, Djamo’s mission is to try to plug one specific and very underserved gap in Francophone Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the region, less than 25% of adults have bank accounts, as the focus for banks remains the top 10-20% wealthiest customers. The rest, which is a <a href="http://observatoire.francophonie.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Francophones-Statistiques-par-pays.pdf">huge segment of the market</a> of about 120 million people, is not perceived as profitable. But as banks slacked, mobile money from the region&#8217;s telcos filled in the gap. In the last 10 years, their wallets have reached more than 60% of the population &#8212; proof of how many millions of French-speaking natives were hungry for financial services. Today, this mobile money infrastructure and reach allows startups to build upon their existing payment infrastructure to democratize access through different applications.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djamo is one such company taking advantage of this opportunity to bring affordable and seamless banking to the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/hassan-bourgi-13165136/en-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan Bourgi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a second-time founder, returned to Ivory Coast after exiting his Latin American-based startup, Busportal, to Naspers-company redBus. There he met </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/regisbamba/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Régis Bamba</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was still working at MTN, one of Africa’s largest telcos, leading several mobile money projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated by the unpleasant banking experiences they and many millennials faced in the country, Bourgi and Bamba launched Djamo last year to challenge the banking industry status quo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Banking services are really difficult to access here, and we saw that as a huge opportunity,&#8221; Djamo CEO Bourgi told TechCrunch. “Since day one, we wanted to design a mobile-first platform that could break into the masses and our combined experience building mass-market consumer products was very critical to launching Djamo.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bourgi, the country&#8217;s millennials are trying to create relations with technology companies and be served differently from the norm. So, Djamo is providing this audience with a better front-end experience and faster customer service.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109257" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109257" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2109257 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=768,375 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109257" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Djamo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach, they focused on accommodating multiple layers tailored to different user needs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&#8217;s affording Ivorians the luxury to pay for online services like Amazon, Alibaba or Netflix, or providing Visa debit cards in a timely fashion, these tailored approaches have made Djamo grow organically via word of mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why not? Before Djamo came along, the CEO says people would need to go to their bank branches and stay in long queues to get their cards or even load them with credit. Djamo relieves that stress and even allows customers to use their cards with zero fees in a wide range of services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, it was important to offer a zero-fee card with no recurring fee to a certain limit. After that, you pay as you go in transaction fees. There is a premium plan around $4 a month where users can transact to higher limits,&#8221; said Bourgi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Djamo claims to have around 90,000 registered users and processes over 50,000 transactions monthly. However, to get to this point, the company has ridden on sheer resourcefulness around its operations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Nigeria, where there are established payment infrastructure players like Flutterwave and Paystack, Ivory Coast doesn&#8217;t have such household names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;We have a couple of providers, but most are unreliable. But this doesn&#8217;t matter to the end-user, you have to make it work somehow,&#8221; said Bamba, the company&#8217;s CPO and CTO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacking better options, Djamo switches from one provider to another to keep operations running. The year-old startup has also faced scepticism, common with most African fintech startups when they first launch. In Djamo&#8217;s case though, the founders had to go to lengths to prove to banks and customers that the platform was safe to use for onboarding, KYC and transactions.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109259" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109259" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2109259 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109259" class="wp-caption-text">Hassan Bourgi (CEO) and Régis Bamba (CTO &amp; CPO). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Djamo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboarding customers also came with its own set of problems: the delivery of Djamo Visa cards. Bourgi says unlike more developed countries on the continent, it is a Herculean task to access efficient delivery and logistics services in Ivory Coast. So, the startup built a delivery app with in-house delivery agents for this particular purpose. &#8220;The objective for our customers is that after registering with us, they get their cards the next day in a timely fashion,&#8221; Bourgi added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even before pushing out its MVP, Djamo had already received monetary validation for its product. In June 2019, it raised a pre-seed investment of $350,000 from private investors &#8212; arguably the largest round at this stage in the Francophone region. The ingenuity of the solution, at least to French-speaking Africa, and the founders&#8217; track record, was crucial to Djamo closing the round, Hassan explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, Francophone Africa has been underrated by international investors, despite signs pointing to the emergence of a budding startup scene. Part of this has to do with language barriers and the region&#8217;s GDP and income per capita where English-speaking countries, excluding South Africa, contribute to 47% of sub-Saharan Africa’s average GDP, while French-speaking countries boast of only 19%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/worldbank/status/1126381505637384192"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating that the region will have 62.5% of Africa’s fastest-growing economies by 2021, there&#8217;s bullishness around its growth in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many untapped opportunities, underrepresented regions like Francophone Africa are ripe for disruption. Investors know this and though their checks are still skewed toward Anglophone Africa, million-dollar raises from Senegalese energy startup, Oolu and Cameroonian healthtech startup, Healthlane in 2020 show their keenness on the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Djamo, both startups are YC-backed and are the other Francophone startups to have made it into the accelerator. But with this Winter 2021 batch, Djamo becomes the first fintech startup from the region. Following Healthlane&#8217;s acceptance in 2020, it is also the first time French-speaking Africa has had representatives for consecutive years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the founders, YC&#8217;s backing validates Djamo&#8217;s premise that financial service distribution across the Francophone Africa region is fundamentally changing toward applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Ivory Coast, people always say that the banking industry is too complex and we can’t do anything about it. But we saw it as a huge opportunity and a great industry to take on. Everywhere you see frustration, customers in pain, there is an opportunity for a business to come and do it better,” said Bamba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After participating in the three-month-long program, which culminates in a Demo Day on March 23rd, Djamo will also take part in Visa&#8217;s </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-program.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech Fast Track Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an avenue for the company to leverage the fintech giant&#8217;s network to introduce new payment experiences.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.twincocapital.com/">Twinco Capital</a>, a Madrid and Amsterdam-based startup making it easier to access supply chain finance, has raised €3 million in funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is Spanish VC fund Mundi Ventures, with participation from previous backer Finch Capital and several unnamed angels. Twinco Capital also has a debt facility with the Spanish investment bank EBN Banco de Negocios, which is common for any type of lending company.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Sandra Nolasco and Carmen Marin Romano, Twinco Capital offers a supply chain finance solution that includes purchase order funding. To do this, it integrates with large corporates on the purchase side and then funds suppliers by paying up to 60% of the purchase order value upfront and the remainder immediately upon delivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The entire process is digital, promising a quick decision and fast deployment of funds, and is powered by Twinco’s supply chain analytics and the data it is able to access by partnering with both sides of the supply chain.</p>
<p>“The financing of global supply chains is expensive and inefficient, the burden of the cost is mostly borne by the suppliers and in particular by those that are SMEs in emerging markets,” explains Twinco Capital co-founder and CEO Sandra Nolasco.</p>
<p>“Take any global supply chain, such as apparel, automotive, electronics etc. Exporters in countries like Bangladesh, China or Vietnam that have been supplying European companies for years, with stable commercial relationships. However, their creditworthiness is still measured only on the basis of annual financials, making access to competitive liquidity a major obstacle for growth”.</p>
<p>By having visibility on both sides, including upcoming orders, Twinco provides liquidity to the suppliers “from purchase order to final invoice payment”.</p>
<p>“We do that by analyzing supply chain data &#8212; the performance of the suppliers, the network effects between common suppliers and buyers (and many more data points I am not allowed to mention!),” says the Twinco CEO. “In short, using advanced data analytics we can better assess, price and significantly mitigate risk. The good news is that the more transactions we fund, the more suppliers and buyers we add, the more robust is our risk assessment. We believe there is a strong network effect”.</p>
<p>To that end, Twinco makes money by charging a “discount fee” for each purchase order it funds. “Since default rates are a fraction of that fee, we can unlock significant value,” says Nolasco.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fintech is also unlocking an asset class for investors and competes with local banks that are much more manual and don’t benefit from increased visibility via network effects. Nolasco says that to ensure interests are aligned, the company uses a portion of equity to also invest in the purchase orders it funds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second-largest internet market. “From 1 April 2021, we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses, and shift focus away from our domestic products in India.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>“From 1 April 2021, we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses, and shift focus away from our domestic products in India. This means we will no longer offer domestic payment services within India from 1 April,” said a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>In a long statement, PayPal said its priorities had shifted in India, but did not elaborate why it was winding down the business. A report recently said the company, which has amassed over 360,000 merchants in the country, was struggling to make inroads in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet The Morning Context <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/paypal-india-hits-pause-on-domestic-payments-business">reported</a> in December that PayPal was abandoning its local payments business in India, a claim the company had refuted at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shift in priorities, some PayPal employees have been reassigned to new teams. Our focus is to always minimize the impact on our people whenever possible. Overall, our workforce is growing in India, not reducing. We are currently recruiting across our sites in India in large numbers,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the move comes as a surprise. The company said last year that it was building a payments service powered by India&#8217;s UPI railroad, suggesting an increase in the level of investments it was making in the country.</p>
<p>Over the years, PayPal also partnered with a range of popular Indian businesses such as ticketing services BookMyShow and MakeMyTrip and food delivery platform Swiggy to offer a faster checkout experience. At the time of writing, the PayPal website in India appears to have removed all such references.</p>
<p>India has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest battlegrounds for mobile payments firms in recent years. Scores of heavily-backed firms, including Paytm, PhonePe, Google, Amazon and Facebook, are competing to increase their share in India, where the market is estimated to be worth $1 trillion by 2023. Several of these firms also offer a range of payments services for merchants.</p>
<p>The company, which says it processed $1.4 billion worth of international sales for merchants in India last year, added that it will continue to invest in “product development that enables Indian businesses to reach nearly 350 million PayPal consumers worldwide, increase their sales internationally, and help the Indian economy return to growth.”</p>
<p>PayPal <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has been offering cross-border payments support in India for more than a decade. After entering the country, it allowed consumers in India to pay at online merchants with local currency.</span></p>
<p><em>The story was updated with additional details provided by PayPal.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kuaishou, a Chinese video app that&#8217;s largely underappreciated outside China, has just completed a massive initial public offering in Hong Kong. The app is by far the biggest rival for Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version, and unlike many Western video platforms that make money from ads and subscriptions, Kuaishou&#8217;s cash cow is its tipping business.</p>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s shares opened in Hong Kong on Friday at HK$338 ($43.6) apiece, a 194% jump from its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2021/0126/2021012600014_c.pdf">IPO price of HK$115</a> ($14.8). That catapults its market cap to nearly HK$1.4 trillion ($180 billion). The company pocketed approximately $5.4 billion from the listing with a total of 365,218,600 shares, excluding the overallotment option.</p>
<p>Kuaishou, which is backed by Tencent, now has a replenished coffer to invest in growth and hopefully work toward profitability. In the first nine months of 2020, the app posted an adjusted net loss of 7.2 billion yuan ($1.1 billion), compared to an adjusted profit of 1.8 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s stock is a huge hit with both institutional financiers and retail investors from China, many of whom are familiar with the app that boasted 481 million monthly users in the 11 months ended November. The app set a record as the most oversubscribed deal in Hong Kong, attracting retail investor demand totaling $164.8 billion, the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3119805/tencent-backed-kuaishous-ipo-overbought-1200-times-retail">reported</a>. Its share reached HK$322.8 on the gray market platform operated by Phillip Securities Group and HK$421 on online broker Futu Securities.</p>
<p>Like Douyin, Kuaishou began as a platform for people to create and share 15-second short videos (following a brief period as a GIF app) and later expanded into livestreaming. The transition is natural, as creators who have built a name may seek further interaction with followers, and followers may want to express their loyalty and affection to creators. Livestreaming and virtual gifting fill that need.</p>
<p>Kuaishou has three main monetization methods, with livestreaming making up the majority of its revenue. Fifty-eight million users on Kuaishou spent on live videos monthly in the 11 months ended November, and on average every paying user brought 47.6 yuan ($7.36) in revenue.</p>
<p>The app also sells ads, with each user driving 71.4 yuan ($11) in marketing revenue for the period. Lastly, Kuaishou allows creators to hawk products. The gross merchandise value &#8212; an industry metric used loosely to measure e-commerce transactions &#8212; generated directly on Kuaishou reached 332.7 billion yuan ($51.4 billion) in the period.</p>
<p>For comparison, the livestreaming feature on Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao bazaar generated over <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">400 billion yuan in GMV</a> for the 12 months ended December.</p>
<p>While Kuaishou enjoys growing revenue from livestreaming, regulatory risks loom in the background. The Chinese government has banned users under the age of 18 from purchasing virtual gifts. It has also urged platforms to <a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2020/1124/c1004-31941781.html">put a cap</a> on users&#8217; monthly spending on virtual gifts, though regulators haven&#8217;t specified or suggested a limit.</p>
<p>Kuaishou is aware of the risk, noting in its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102806/documents/sehk21012400052.pdf">prospectus</a> that &#8220;any limits on user spending on virtual gifting ultimately imposed may negatively impact our revenues derived from virtual gifting and our results of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until regulators take further action to rein in virtual gifting, Kuaishou will likely continue to thrive while it works on diversifying its business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Democrats in the House voted to strip <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/qanon-congress-house-race-marjorie-taylor-greene/">freshman Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> of some of her responsibilities Thursday, citing her penchant for <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-threats-pelosi-mccarthy-qanon-parkland-163725291.html">violent</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/532534-rep-elect-marjorie-taylor-greene-wears-trump-won-mask-on-house-floor">anti-democratic</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22256258/marjorie-taylor-greene-jewish-space-laser-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theories">at times anti-Semitic</a> conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Greene has expressed support for a range of alarming conspiracies, including the belief that the 2018 Parkland school shooting that killed 17 people was a &#8220;false flag.&#8221; That belief prompted<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/536976-two-major-teachers-unions-call-on-gop-leadership-to-remove-greene-from"> two teachers unions to call for her removal</a> from the House Education Committee — one of her new committee assignments.</p>
<p>The vote on a resolution to remove Greene from her committee assignments broke along party lines, with nearly all Republicans opposing the resolution. Some of her colleagues even voted in Greene&#8217;s defense in spite of condemning her behavior in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the House moved to vote on the highly unusual resolution, the new Georgia lawmaker claimed that her embrace of QAnon was in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never once said during my entire campaign &#8216;QAnon,&#8217; &#8221; Greene said Thursday. &#8220;I never once said any of the things that I am being accused of today during my campaign. I never said any of these things since I have been elected for Congress. These were words of the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-claims-she-never-promoted-qanon-after-her-georgia-election-win-thats-not-true?via=twitter_page">Daily Beast&#8217;s Will Sommer reported</a>, a deleted tweet from December shows Greene explicitly defending QAnon and directing blame toward the media and &#8220;big tech.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed today that she hasn&#39;t promoted QAnon since being elected. But on Dec. 4, she praised an article promoting Q in a now-deleted tweet. The story Greene praised as &quot;accurate&quot; calls QAnon an &quot;objective flow of information” that&#39;s &quot;uniting Christians.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/nN3bnTCyPa">pic.twitter.com/nN3bnTCyPa</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Will Sommer (@willsommer) <a href="https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1357400323611058180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In another recently-uncovered post from January 2019, Greene showed support for online comments calling for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html">&#8220;a bullet to the head&#8221; for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and executing FBI agents</a>.</p>
<p>Greene has also shared openly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-marjorie-taylor-greene.html">racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views in Facebook videos</a>, a track record that prompted Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to condemn her statements as &#8220;appalling&#8221; last June. More recently, McCarthy defended Greene against efforts to remove her from committees.</p>
<p>Greene was elected in November to represent a conservative district in northwest Georgia after her opponent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/17/kevin-van-ausdal-qanon-marjorie-greene-georgia/?arc404=true">Kevin Van Ausdal dropped out, citing personal reasons</a>. Greene beat her opponent in the Republican primary in August, winning 57% of the vote.</p>
<p>QAnon, a dangerous once-fringe collection of conspiracy theories, was well-represented in January&#8217;s deadly Capitol riot and many photos from the day show the prevalence of QAnon symbols and sayings. In 2019, an FBI bulletin warned of QAnon&#8217;s connection to &#8220;conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists.&#8221; A year later, at least one person who had espoused the same views would win a seat in Congress.</p>
<p>The overlap between Greene&#8217;s beliefs and those of the violent pro-Trump mob at the Capitol escalated tensions among lawmakers, many of whom feared for their lives as the assault unfolded.</p>
<p>A freshman representative with little apparent appetite for policy or coalition-building, Greene wasn&#8217;t likely to wield much legislative power in the House. But as QAnon and adjacent conspiracies move from the fringe to the mainstream and possibly back again — a trajectory largely dictated by the at times arbitrary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/twitter-qanon-ban/">decisions of social media companies</a> — Greene&#8217;s treatment in Congress may signal what&#8217;s to come for a dangerous online movement that&#8217;s more than demonstrated its ability to spill over into real-world violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This probably falls under “good problems,” in the grand scheme of things. After another record quarter, Peloton has announced that it will invest more than $100 million in air and ocean freight deliveries due to “longer-than-acceptable wait times for the delivery of our products.”</p>
<p>The fitness company is among those tech firms that have seen a tremendous rise in interest amid the pandemic. In fact, it seems these days that VCs can’t pump money into at-home fitness solutions quickly enough to appease their interest. 2020 was a banner year for home workout solutions, from LuluLemon’s $500 million acquisition of Mirror to new platforms from Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>In all, Peloton pulled in $1.06 billion in<a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021"> revenue last quarter</a>, marking a more than 200% increase, year over year. The numbers beat Wall Street expectations and are showing no sign of slowing, with another massive quarter expected for the connected fitness brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/embed/#?secret=tMpGlXFQfX" data-secret="tMpGlXFQfX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The market did <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/peloton-pton-reports-q2-2021-earnings.html">balk slightly</a> at Peloton’s admission that, “While this investment will dampen our near-term profitability, improving our member experience is our first priority.” Clearly this big spend on reducing supply bottlenecks is a longer-term play.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how the company’s earnings will stabilize after the pandemic. I’d anticipate there will be some slowing for Peloton and other brands when vaccines make returning to gyms a more widescale phenomenon. Still, home workouts &#8212; like remote work &#8212; may well be an aspect that is fundamentally transformed even with COVID-19 in the rearview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has awarded Firefly Aerospace a $93.3 million contract to take a lunar lander module loaded with experiments to the surface of the moon. While the company will not be performing the launch itself, it will be providing the spacecraft and <a href="https://firefly.com/lunar-lander/">&#8220;Blue Ghost&#8221; lander</a> for the 2023 mission.</p>
<p>The space agency made the award as part of its ongoing Commercial Lunar Payload Services, under which several other non-prime space companies have been selected for similar work: Blue Origin, Astrobotic, Masten and so on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>This particular contract was first publicized to its CLPS partners back in September, which would have submitted bids for the project; Firefly clearly carried the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited another CLPS provider has won its first task order award,&#8221; said NASA associate administrator for science Thomas Zurbuchen <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-firefly-aerospace-for-artemis-commercial-moon-delivery-in-2023">in a release announcing the contract</a>. The last few years have seen many such firsts as NASA has increasingly embraced the commercial sector in providing everything from launch services to satellite and spacecraft manufacturing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly Firefly&#8217;s first order from NASA, though: Its national security subsidiary Firefly Black (ominous) will be launching two cubesats for the Venture Class Launch Service Demo-2 mission. But this is larger and more complex by a huge margin (not to mention more expensive).</p>
<p>This will be the maiden lunar voyage for Firefly&#8217;s Blue Ghost lander, which it&#8217;s been working on for the last few years in anticipation of renewed interest in the moon. It will hold the 10 scientific payloads, which NASA describes <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-firefly-aerospace-for-artemis-commercial-moon-delivery-in-2023">here</a>, including a new laser reflector array and an experimental radiation-tolerant computer. There&#8217;s a lot to be loaded up, but Blue Ghost should have 50kg of space left over for anyone else who wants a ride to the moon.</p>
<p>Everything is going to Mare Crisium, a basin on the &#8220;light&#8221; or near side of the moon, where hopefully they will contribute valuable observations and experiments to inform future visits to and habitation on the moon.</p>
<p>Firefly will also be providing the spacecraft that will take the lander into lunar space, and will be responsible for getting it off the Earth in the first place — the company told me they&#8217;re evaluating options for that. By the time 2023 rolls around there should be plenty of rides to choose from. Firefly&#8217;s own Alpha launch vehicle should have its first flight in March, and the more powerful Beta may be flying by 2023, though neither is ready to commit to a lunar insertion orbit mission today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch tuned into <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a>&#8216; 27th demo day today, keen to get our eyes on the accelerator&#8217;s latest companies.</p>
<p>Demo days are regular affairs, but they always feature a crop of startups that could build the next tech giant, so we pay attention. Especially in the COVID-19 era, when demo days have gone virtual. Now it&#8217;s easier than ever for investors, and journalists, to tune in.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/here-are-the-94-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-2/">covered Y Combinator&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">virtual demo days</a>, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/10-favorite-startups-from-techstars-october-2020-class/">regular batches</a> from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/five-favorite-techstars-startups-ahead-of-its-next-rush-of-demo-days/">various Techstars accelerators around the world</a>.</p>
<p>But, today we&#8217;re talking favorites from 500 Startups&#8217; latest cohort. <a href="https://twitter.com/jshieber">Jonathan Shieber</a> will take the baton first, followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a>.</p>
<h2>Demo day standouts</h2>
<p><a href="https://stackbrowser.com/"><strong>Stack</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> A new way to browse online.</li>
<li><strong>Why we like it:</strong> The browser and tab model hasn&#8217;t changed much since the days of Netscape and organizing online information is increasingly a complicated mess of a hundred tabs (at least on my browser). Stack is pitching a new way to organize information that&#8217;s more interactive, more organized and easier to visualize.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://adapty.io/"><strong>Adapty</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What: </strong>Low-code A/B testing of monetization mechanics and subscriber services for apps.</li>
<li><strong>Why we like it:</strong> Helping to give app developers tools to better understand where, how and why monetization breaks down and offer tools to fix it makes Adapty a standout among this 500 cohort. The app economy is still a multibillion dollar business and getting customers to stick around remains a huge problem. Anything that can help is a boon for company builders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week&#8217;s biggest tech happenings. The good news is that we managed to fit it all into a single episode this week. The bad news is that that means the show is pretty long. Sorry about that!</p>
<p>So, what took us so much time to get through? All of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raised $3.4 billion</a> after its trading hiccups, and we also chatted over what we know about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">the company&#8217;s Q4 2020 numbers</a>. In short, the company is growing nicely.</li>
<li>RPA is big and UiPath is cashing in on the trend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">raising $750 million at a $35 billion valuation</a>. That&#8217;s a lot of cash for very little dilution.</li>
<li>Databricks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">raised $1 billion at a $28 billion valuation</a>, after reaching $425 million in ARR. The company&#8217;s growth is hot, but its valuation may be even hotter.</li>
<li>Bumble is going public, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">we chatted about its results</a>, and how founder- and venture-friendly the dating market may be in the future.</li>
<li>In a big exit for the Boston startup ecosystem, alcohol delivery platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/">Drizly has sold to Uber for $1.1 billion.</a></li>
<li>Sticking to the alcohol beat, Danny talked us <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/vivino-raises-155-million-for-wine-recommendation-and-marketplace-app/">through the Vivino news</a>, describing himself as a wine sophisticate with a distaste for sommeliers, which is just about the most Danny thing he has ever said. But the company really is neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/">Divvy homes raised a $110 million Series C</a> to make it easier to buy a home, after financing five times as many homes in 2020 as it did in pre-pandemic times.</li>
<li>And then there were some neat early-stage rounds to chat about: Balance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/lightspeed-and-max-levchin-bet-on-balance-to-bring-b2b-payments-into-the-digital-world/">raising $5.5 million to bring B2B payments to the modern world</a>, Alloy Automation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/alloy-raises-4m-to-build-out-its-e-commerce-automation-service/">raising $4 million for e-commerce automation</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/beam-raises-9-5-million-to-build-a-web-browser-that-collects-ideas/">Beam raising $9.5 million to build a new browser</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure to read Natasha&#8217;s profile of the new Expectul CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nathalie-walton-expectful-seed/?tpcc=ECTW2020">here</a>.</li>
<li>And, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/softbank-launches-a-100-million-fund-for-miami-based-startups/">closed on some Miami news</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And somehow we still have another entire day before the week is up! So much for 2021 calming down after 2020&#8217;s storms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei’s status in the U.S. has been one of many question marks hovering over the newly minted Biden administration. The smartphone maker was one of a number of Chinese companies added to the Department of Commerce’s “entity list” during Trump’s four years in office.</p>
<p>Gina Raimondo, Joe Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary, has offered what is potentially one of the clearest looks so far at how Huawei’s status might (or might not) evolve under a new administration. Responding to questions from Senate Republicans, former Rhode Island Governor Raimondo indicated that the Biden administration likely would not be in any hurry to remove Huawei from the blacklist.</p>
<p>Republican House members had previously<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/536979-house-republicans-urge-senate-to-block-vote-on-commerce-secretary-over"> raised concerns</a> over Raimondo&#8217;s position on companies like Huawei, a stance she had yet to clarify. “We urge those Senators who have a history of calling for Huawei to remain on the Entity List to stick to their principles and place a hold on Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration clarifies their intentions for Huawei and on export control policies for a country that is carrying out genocide and threatening our national security,&#8221; they wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raimondo has since responded.</p>
<p>“I understand that parties are placed on the Entity List and the Military End User List generally because they pose a risk to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” the politician said, in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist">note reported by Bloomberg</a>. “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QcTAFkiGNv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/">Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/embed/#?secret=QcTAFkiGNv" data-secret="QcTAFkiGNv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The statement isn’t definitive in either direction (as is perhaps to be expected for a Cabinet nominee), but it certainly doesn’t point to a radical change from Trump’s position on the issue. The smartphone marker was added to the list in 2019, following longtime accusations over security and spying concerns. The company has also variously been tied to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The DoC noted at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Huawei was added to the Entity List after the Department concluded that the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, including alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), conspiracy to violate IEEPA by providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged violations of U.S. sanctions, among other illicit activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration proved especially aggressive in regards to blacklisting Chinese tech companies, a fact that has already had a profound impact on Huawei’s bottom line. Drone giant DJI and AI company SenseTime have been added to the DoC list, while Xiaomi made a separate military blacklist in the waning days of the administration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Democrats settle into control of both chambers of Congress, signs of the party&#8217;s legislative priorities are starting to manifest. So far, lawmakers&#8217; interest in reimagining tech&#8217;s regulatory landscape appears to be alive and well.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is out with a new proposal for antitrust reform that would create more barriers for big mergers and beef up federal resources for antitrust enforcement. Klobuchar&#8217;s bill, the <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/1/e171ac94-edaf-42bc-95ba-85c985a89200/375AF2AEA4F2AF97FB96DBC6A2A839F9.sil21191.pdf">Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act</a>, seeks to address consolidation across industries, calling out &#8220;dominant digital platforms&#8221; specifically.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the United States once had some of the most effective antitrust laws in the world, our economy today faces a massive competition problem,&#8221; Klobuchar said. &#8220;We can no longer sweep this issue under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klobuchar now leads the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, a corner of Congress already signaling its interest on reform that would impact big tech.</p>
<p>The new bill would bolster the Clayton Antitrust Act, a 1914 bill that created a framework for the rules around competition that are still applied today. Specifically, it would amend that bill to reinterpret its standard for evaluating anti-competitive mergers, changing the language to prevent any deal that &#8220;create[s] an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition&#8221; rather than the current wording.</p>
<p>The aim is to catch potentially anti-competitive behavior earlier in the game — an outcome that would address the government&#8217;s current conundrum, in which federal regulators are now awkwardly reevaluating mergers that evolved into monopolistic behavior years after the fact.</p>
<p>The bill would also put the onus on merging companies to prove that they don&#8217;t pose a risk of reducing competition, taking that burden off of the government in specific cases. Those rules would apply to &#8220;mega-mergers&#8221; worth $5 billion or more and in which a company with 50% market share seeks to buy a current or potential competitor.</p>
<p>Klobuchar&#8217;s proposal also seeks to add a provision to the Clayton Act against conduct that puts competitors at a disadvantage — a rule that would address some of the murkier areas of anti-competitive behavior that stretch beyond outright mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Citing lacking enforcement budgets, the bill also sets out a $300 million infusion for the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division and the FTC. At the FTC, that money would help create a new division within the agency for research on markets and mergers.</p>
<p>The bill will be co-sponsored by Senators Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, all Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee. And while it&#8217;s a single party endeavor for now, the antitrust reform could attract support from Republicans in Congress like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-ban-big-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions">signaled his interest</a> in antitrust changes that target large tech companies as recently as this week. Hawley also sits on the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee.</p>
<p>Klobuchar stops short of calling for large tech companies like Facebook and Google to be broken into their component parts, a move that has attracted some support from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/presidential-hopeful-elizabeth-warren-is-calling-for-the-breakup-of-big-tech/">lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/18/bernie-sanders-break-up-google-amazon-apple-1369255">Bernie Sanders</a> in recent years. In the midst of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">emerging multistate lawsuits targeting big tech companies</a>, the FTC announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">own antitrust case against Facebook</a> late last year, pushing for the company to be broken up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) has found a strong foothold in the world of enterprise IT through its effective use of AI and other technology to help automate repetitive tasks to free up people to focus on more complicated work. Today, a startup called <a href="http://infinitus.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinitus</a> is coming out of stealth to apply this concept to the world of healthcare &#8212; specifically, to speed up the process of voice communication between entities in the fragmented U.S. healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Infinitus uses &#8220;voice RPA&#8221; to become the machine-generated voice that makes calls from, say, healthcare providers or pharmacies to insurance companies to go through a series of questions (directed at humans at the other end) that typically need to be answered before payments are authorized and other procedures can take place. Those conversations are then ingested into Infinitus&#8217;s platform to parse them for relevant information that is input into the right fields to trigger whatever actions need to happen as a result of the calls.</p>
<p>The startup is coming out of &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; today but it has been around for a couple of years already and has signed on a number of large healthcare companies as customers &#8212; for example, the wholesale drug giant <a href="https://www.amerisourcebergen.com/insights/manufacturers/harnessing-the-power-of-a-digital-assistant-to-accelerate-patient-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AmerisourceBergen</a>. And it is contributing pro bono its technology to public health efforts around the current coronavirus pandemic, with one organization currently using it to <a href="https://infinitus.ai/blog-posts/vaccinateca-covid19-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate a mass calling system</a> across several states to get a better idea of vaccine availability to help connect the earliest doses with the most vulnerable groups that need them the fastest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It made 75,000 calls on behalf of 12,000 providers in January alone.</p>
<p>Infinitus&#8217; public launch is also coming with a funding kicker: it has picked up $21.4 million in Series A funding from a group of big-name investors to build the business.</p>
<p>The round is being co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue, with Gradient Ventures (Google&#8217;s early-stage AI fund), Quiet Capital, Firebolt Ventures and Tau Ventures also participating, along with individual investments from a selection of executives across the worlds of AI and big tech: Ian Goodfellow, Gokul Rajaram, Aparna Chennapragada and Qasar Younis.</p>
<p>Coatue is shaping up to be a huge investor in the opportunity in RPA. Earlier this week, it emerged that it co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest investment in UiPath</a>, one of the leaders in the space, having been a part of previous rounds as well.</p>

<p>“Coatue is proud to have led the Series A in Infinitus,” says Yanda Erlich, a general partner at Coatue. “We are big believers in the transformative power of RPA and Enterprise Automation. We believe Infinitus’ VoiceRPA solution enables healthcare organizations to automate previously costly and manual calls and faxes and empowers these organizations to see benefits from end-to-end process automation.”</p>
<p>The problem that Infinitus is addressing is the fact that healthcare, in particular in the privatized U.S. market, has a lot of time-consuming and often confusing red tape when it comes to getting things done. And a lot of the most immediate pain points of that process can be found in voice calls, which are the primary basis of critical communications between different entities in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Voice calls are used to initiate most processes, whether it&#8217;s to obtain critical information, follow up on a form or previous communication, or pass on some data, or of course provide clearance for a payment.</p>
<p>There are 900 million calls of these kinds made in the U.S., with the average length of each call 35 minutes, and with the average healthcare professional who works in an administrative role to make those calls dedicating some 4.5 hours each day to being on the phone.</p>
<p>All of this ultimately adds to the exorbitant costs of healthcare services in the U.S. (and likely some of those inscrutable lines of fees that you might see on bills), not to mention delays in giving care. (And those volumes underscore just what a small piece Infinitus touches today.)</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Ankit Jain &#8212; a repeat entrepreneur and ex-Googler who held senior roles in engineering and was a founding partner at Gradient at the search giant &#8212; told TechCrunch in an interview that the idea for Infinitus first occurred to him a couple of years ago, when he was still at Gradient.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were starting to see a lot of improvements in voice communications technology, turning text into speech and speech into text. I realised that it would soon be possible to automate phone calls where a machine could carry out a full conversation with someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, around that time, Google itself had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched Duplex, </a>a service built around the same principle<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">, </a>but aimed at consumers, for people to book appointments, restaurant tables and other services.</p>
<p>He determined that just being able to talk like a human and understand natural language wasn&#8217;t the only issue, and not even the main one, in enterprises applications like healthcare environments, which rely on specific jargon and particular scenarios that are probably <em>less</em> rather than more like actual human interactions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Google Assistant will soon be able to call restaurants and make a reservation for you&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/embed/#?secret=jGWqw0hxsb" data-secret="jGWqw0hxsb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I thought, if someone wanted to build this for healthcare it would change it,&#8221; he said. And so he decided to do just that.</p>
<p class="p1">Jain &#8212; who co-founded the company with Shyam Rajagopalan, the CTO, who was previously at Snap, and also worked with Jain at his previous startup Quettra, as well as at Google &#8212; said that Infinitus is using public cloud speech-to-text systems, but the natural language processing and flows to triage and use the information gained from the conversations are built in-house.</p>
<p class="p1">The specialization of the content and interactions potentially is also one reason why Infinitus might not worry so soon about cannibalization from bigger RPA players, at least for now.</p>
<p class="p1">However, Jain notes that much of the tech is vertical-agnostic: that is both an argument for Infinitus to expand into other areas beyond healthcare, but also a sign that others could potentially build something to compete with it.</p>
<p>The fact that services like these &#8212; the new generation of robocalls, as it were &#8212; can sound &#8220;lifelike&#8221;, like actual humans, has been something that consumer versions have aspired to, although that hasn&#8217;t always worked out for the best. Duplex, for example, in its early days <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/duplex-shows-google-failing-at-ethical-and-creative-ai-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came under criticism</a> for how its excellent quality might actually be deceptive, because it wasn&#8217;t clear to users they were speaking to a machine logging their responses in a data harnessing exercise. Jain notes that Infinitus is actually intentionally choosing voices that sound like bots to help make that clear to those taking the calls.</p>
<p>He said that this also &#8220;helps reduce the level of chatter&#8221; on the conversation and keeps the person speaking focused on business.</p>
<p>On that front, it seems that while Infinitus works like other voice RPA services, connected up with live, human agents who can take over calls if they get tricky, that hasn&#8217;t really needed to be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we don’t need to triage with humans because we see high enough success rates with our system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>You might wonder, why hasn&#8217;t the healthcare industry just moved past voice altogether? Surely there are ways of exchanging data between entities so that calls could become obsolete? Turns out that at least for now that isn&#8217;t something that will change quickly, Jain said.</p>
<p>Part of it is because the fragmentation in the market means it&#8217;s hard to implement new standards across the board, covering hundreds of insurance payers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical groups, billing and collections organisations and more.</p>
<p>And when it comes down to it, a phone call ends up being the easiest route for many admins who might have to typically deal with 100 different payment companies and other entities, each with a different logging mechanism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of cognitive load, so it&#8217;s often easier to just pick up the phone,&#8221; Jain said.</p>
<p>Bringing in voiceRPA like Infinitus&#8217;s is part of that long haul to update the bigger system.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;By automating one side we are showing the other side that it can be done,&#8221; Jain said. &#8220;Right now, there are just too many players and getting them to agree on one standard is a gargantuan task, so trying to win one small piece after another is how it’s done. It should not be voice, but by the time standards bodies agree on something else, the world has moved on.&#8221;</p>
