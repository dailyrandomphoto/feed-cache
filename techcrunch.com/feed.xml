</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the rise of livestreaming, gaming has evolved from a toy-like consumer product to a legitimate platform and medium in its own right for entertainment and competition.</p>
<p>Twitch’s viewer base alone has grown from 250,000 average concurrent viewers to over 3 million since its acquisition by Amazon in 2014. Competitors like Facebook Gaming and YouTube Live are following similar trajectories.</p>
<p>The boom in viewership has fueled an ecosystem of supporting products as today’s professional streamers push technology to its limit to increase the production value of their content and automate repetitive aspects of the video production cycle.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The largest streamers hire teams of video editors and social media managers, but growing and part-time streamers struggle to do this themselves or come up with the money to outsource it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>The online streaming game is a grind, with full-time creators putting in eight- if not 12-hour performances on a daily basis. In a bid to capture valuable viewer attention, 24-hour marathon streams are not uncommon either.</p>
<p>However, these hours in front of the camera and keyboard are only half of the streaming grind. Maintaining a constant presence on social media and YouTube fuels the growth of the stream channel and attracts more viewers to catch a stream live, where they may purchase monthly subscriptions, donate and watch ads.</p>
<p>Distilling the most impactful five to 10 minutes of content out of eight or more hours of raw video becomes a non-trivial time commitment. At the top of the food chain, the largest streamers can hire teams of video editors and social media managers to tackle this part of the job, but growing and part-time streamers struggle to find the time to do this themselves or come up with the money to outsource it. There aren’t enough minutes in the day to carefully review all the footage on top of other life and work priorities.</p>
<h2>Computer vision analysis of game UI</h2>
<p>An emerging solution is to use automated tools to identify key moments in a longer broadcast. Several startups compete to dominate this emerging niche. Differences in their approaches to solving this problem are what differentiate competing solutions from each other. Many of these approaches follow a classic computer science hardware-versus-software dichotomy.</p>
<p><a href="https://athenascope.com/">Athenascope</a> was one of the first companies to execute on this concept at scale. Backed by $2.5 million of venture capital funding and an impressive team of Silicon Valley Big Tech alumni, Athenascope developed a computer vision system to identify highlight clips within longer recordings.</p>
<p>In principle, it’s not so different from how self-driving cars operate, but instead of using cameras to read nearby road signs and traffic lights, the tool captures the gamer’s screen and recognizes indicators in the game’s user interface that communicate important events happening in-game: kills and deaths, goals and saves, wins and losses.</p>
<p>These are the same visual cues that traditionally inform the game’s player what is happening in the game. In modern game UIs, this information is high-contrast, clear and unobscured, and typically located in predictable, fixed locations on the screen at all times. This predictability and clarity lends itself extremely well to computer vision techniques such as optical character recognition (OCR) &#8212; reading text from an image.</p>
<p>The stakes here are lower than self-driving cars, too, since a false positive from this system produces nothing more than a less-exciting-than-average video clip &#8212; not a car crash.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>

<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p>Welcome back to the Daily Crunch — it&#8217;s September 10, 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> returns next week, so this is my last day as the captain of this ship. Captain of the Daily Crunch. Captain … Crunch? Oh no.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201112" style="width: 231px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201112" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2201112 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?w=221" alt="" width="221" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg 3588w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=221,300 221w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=768,1043 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=501,680 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=1131,1536 1131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=1508,2048 1508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/capncrunch.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201112" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> evemilla / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Things I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email newsletters are more stressful than blog posts because you can&#8217;t fix typos once they&#8217;re out (and now that I&#8217;ve mentioned it, Murphy&#8217;s law demands this newsletter will have 300% more typos ). <em>[Ed. note: Not on my watch, Captain.]</em></li>
<li>I have a weird tendency to not link to my own stories in this newsletter because it feels weird? (But I&#8217;m going to today, because I&#8217;VE EARNED IT. Also because it&#8217;s my birthday. Also because it ended up being one of our top stories since the last newsletter, so I probably should.)</li>
<li>Alex is a much, much more efficient writer than I am. He gets this done in like a third of the time it takes me. This works well with my theory that, based on the amount of work he does in a day, Alex is actually three people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bye friends!</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/apple-music-is-using-shazam-to-solve-the-streaming-industrys-problem-with-dj-mixes/">Apple will use Shazam to ID songs in DJ mixes:</a></strong> If a DJ mixes a bunch of songs into one big set, how do all the original artists get paid? Apple says the answer, at least for their purposes, starts with Shazam, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">it bought back in 2018 for $400 million</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/jiophone-next-launch-delayed-november-google-reliance-india/"><strong>JioPhone delayed:</strong></a> Google and India&#8217;s Jio Platforms have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/">working on a phone</a> tailored for the Indian market, intending to launch it today. Alas, that&#8217;s not going to happen. In a very last-minute announcement, Jio says that global semiconductor shortages are behind the delay, and that two more months should let them leap that hurdle.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-to-shut-down-houseparty-in-october-including-the-video-chat-fortnite-mode-feature/">Epic is shutting down Houseparty:</a></strong> Just two years after acquiring Houseparty for a reported $35 million, Epic says the party is over. It&#8217;ll be shutting down the video chat app in October, though bits of Houseparty DNA will remain — Fortnite&#8217;s cross-platform voice chat, for example, is based on Houseparty tech.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/breakout-crispr-platform-company-mammoth-biosciences-is-officially-a-unicorn/"><strong>Mammoth, the unicorn:</strong></a> Mammoth Biosciences, a biotech company co-founded by CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna, has blown past the billion-dollar valuation milestone. There&#8217;s literally zero chance that I&#8217;m going to be able to properly explain what this company does in one or two sentences, so check out Emma Betuel&#8217;s writeup for the breakdown.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/supabase-raises-30m-for-its-open-source-insta-backend/">Supabase raises $30M:</a></strong> This one&#8217;s mine! Supabase is building an open source platform meant to automatically handle a lot of the annoying back-end work that comes with starting a new app project — the database, the API (and documentation!), etc. I&#8217;ve been hearing buzz about it constantly since it graduated from YC last year. Supabase just closed a $30 million Series A and is rolling out new features on the regular, all while being fully remote with a team distributed across the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/snyk-snags-another-530m-as-valuation-rises-to-8-4b/">Snyk&#8217;s massive raise:</a> </strong>Another company is raising an absolutely massive round at a mind-blowing valuation — this time it&#8217;s Snyk, which Ron Miller describes as a &#8220;Boston-based late-stage startup that is trying to help developers deliver more secure code.&#8221; It&#8217;s raising $530 million at a valuation of $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m sitting here trying my hardest not to make any ’<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNICK">90s Nickelodeon references</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What China’s new data privacy law means for US tech firms</h2>
<p>China’s first data privacy laws go into effect on November 1, 2021. Will your company be in compliance?</p>
<p>Modeled after the EU’s GDPR, the new regulations &#8220;[introduce] perhaps the most stringent set of requirements and protections for data privacy in the world,&#8221; writes Scott W. Pink, special counsel in O’Melveny’s Data Security &amp; Privacy practice.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive overview, he explains its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/"> key requirements and compliance steps for U.S.-based firms</a> that service Chinese consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;American firms doing business in China or with companies inside China will need to immediately start assessing how this new law will impact their activities,&#8221; he advises.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/microsoft-acquires-takelessons-an-online-and-in-person-tutoring-platform-to-ramp-up-its-edtech-play/">Microsoft buys TakeLessons:</a></strong> Another Microsoft acquisition! Just a few days after announcing it&#8217;s buying web-based video editor Clipchamp, MSFT announced it&#8217;s picking up TakeLessons. Based in San Diego, TakeLessons connects individual students with specialist tutors (both online and off) on topics like math, music, drawing and more. Given that Microsoft says over 100 million students use its Teams platform for school, it makes sense for it to dig a bit deeper on edtech.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">Judge says Apple must change App Store rules</a>:</strong> Big shift in the Epic-versus-Apple legal battle royale this morning, with the judge declaring that Apple must allow developers to offer alternative payment options beyond Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchase system. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says it&#8217;s not enough and that the company &#8220;will fight on.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-asks-apple-to-reinstate-fortnite-in-south-korea-after-new-law/">Epic wants Fortnite back in the App Store in South Korea:</a></strong> Speaking of Epic-versus-Apple … South Korea recently passed a bill that will require Apple to allow developers to use their own payment systems. As such, Epic says it&#8217;s time for Apple to let it (and Fortnite) back on the App Store in the country. Apple says no, and that &#8220;as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account.&#8221;</li>
<li>What to expect from Apple&#8217;s event next week: It&#8217;s September, which means Apple is holding a big event. What will they announce — besides, if tradition holds, a new iPhone? Brian Heater has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">the roundup</a>.</li>

		Denis Kalinin works at venture fund <a href="https://runacap.com/">Runa Capital</a> as Asia Business development manager, devoted to connecting the Western and Asian VC worlds and bringing long-term value to both.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">China is becoming a superpower in the tech industry. <a href="https://scontent.fhel5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/241157385_4278704442207929_4277000757932511453_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=400tdiC-EqYAX8d6FKT&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fhel5-1.fna&amp;oh=cd9dbe0250b18b63180b9df483f55397&amp;oe=613E2481">According to Straits Times</a>, China is the only place in the world where it takes less than six years for a startup to become a unicorn — it takes seven years in the U.S., eight years in the U.K. and 11 years in Germany. Despite <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/04/commerce-adds-seven-chinese-supercomputing-entities-entity-list-their">geopolitical tensions</a> and recent <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3baefe13-76b2-494b-b501-77a9ed41decb">amendments</a> in CFIUS, it is hard to ignore China.</p>
<p>When I joined Runa Capital almost a year ago, my task was to help our portfolio companies enter the Chinese market, find the right partners and raise funding from Chinese investors. And almost on every call with our startups, colleagues from Runa or other global VCs, I heard: Is it a good idea to raise from a Chinese VC? Is it OK to co-invest with Chinese investors? I was surprised to learn that there is little research answering such questions, as there is a lack of adequate information in English about Chinese investments.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Access to the Chinese market seems to be an obvious reason to invite Chinese funds aboard, but only about 20% of Western startups with Chinese capital have operations in China.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So as a Mandarin-speaking specialist, I decided to fill this gap by conducting a study based on Chinese VC database ITjuzi (the Chinese version of Crunchbase) with the help of our powerful data science resources developed by <a href="https://okhlopkov.com/">Danil Okhlopkov</a>.</p>
<p>Below, I will try to answer the following questions using statistics and a case-based approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much do Chinese funds invest abroad?</li>
<li>What is the current trend?</li>
<li>Can Chinese investors bring any value to Western startups?</li>
<li>Who are the most active Chinese investors abroad?</li>
<li>In which areas can Chinese funds bring the most value?</li>
<li>What value can Chinese investors bring?</li>
<li>When is it better to invite a Chinese investor?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chinese investors are interested in Western startups</h2>
<p>After studying data from ITjuzi, we estimated that Chinese funds invested around $250 billion in 2020 (three times higher than the figure in Crunchbase). This figure puts Chinese VC investments only 30% lower than investments by U.S. funds, but three times that of U.K. funds and 12.5 times more than German funds.</p>

<p>However, only 15% of investments in 2020 and 17% of investments in the first half of 2021 were in companies outside China, significantly lower than in 2019. This appears to be because during COVID, China’s economy recovered much faster than other countries&#8217;, so many Chinese investors preferred to redirect their capital flows to the domestic market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is great potential for overseas investments to rebound as soon as the borders reopen and the global economy starts to recover.</p>

<p>We can also see that Chinese investors are eyeing European startups favorably, which is related to U.S.-China geopolitical tensions as well as the fact that the European VC market is becoming mature.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve been scouring the latest rumors and leaks and playing all of The Mamas and The Papas songs forward and backward to get the best possible picture of what we’re in store for with next Tuesday’s “California Streaming’” event.</p>
<p>The invites, which went out a week in advance, don’t appear to give the game away here. There was some extremely cool AR trickery, accessible through Safari on mobile, which could point to some fancy camera upgrades, though augmented reality has become a bit of a staple on these invites.</p>
<p>The California Streaming title, meanwhile, seems likely to be more of a nod to the all-virtual nature of the event, rather than anything to do with, say, Apple TV (of course, we’ve been one-more-thinged in the past). And as for that lovely shot of the Sierras — that could well be a nod to macOS, though the company has moved onto Monterey. It seems just as likely to be a reference to the aforementioned title.</p>

<p>The biggest, simplest and most important answer to the question of what to expect is a new iPhone. Last year’s models saw a notable delay due to COVID-19-related supply chain bottlenecking. Supply chain problems have persisted, of course, but by all accounts, the company appears to be back on track with its pre-pandemic release cycle.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12’s biggest upgrade was, of course, the long-awaited addition of 5G. That, coupled with the delay, led Apple to some pretty massive sales quarters amid a broader stalling of the overall mobile market. While other manufacturers have skipped the number out of superstitious concerns, Apple seems firmly on board with iPhone 13 (even as renders of its successor, the iPhone 14 have <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/09/08/2022-iphone-14-revealed-by-leakers-days-before-iphone-13-announcement">reportedly already leaked</a>).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1938660" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1938660" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1938660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="656" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=1536,984 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=2048,1311 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1173711317.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1938660" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images / Qi Heng/VCG</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent reports suggest that the iPhone 13 will arrive in four different configurations — much like its predecessor. So: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. The screen sizes should remain the same: 5.4, 6.1 (x2) and 6.7 inches. A separate report, meanwhile, suggests that we’ll see additional colors, with the full lineup being black, white, blue, purple, pink (rather than green) and Product (Red). But, keep in mind that offering different color availabilities in different markets isn’t entirely out of the question.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, camera upgrades appear to be the biggest news here. Word from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is that last year’s Pro Max model specs will graduate to the rest of the line (including, potentially, lidar). A ProRes video mode is said to be following the addition of ProRAW to further advance the handset’s bonafides as a semi-pro video shooting rig. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/apple-readies-new-iphones-with-pro-focused-camera-video-updates">Cinematic Video</a>, meanwhile, is said to bring a Portrait-mode-style effect to video. Kuo has also suggested that the devices will be getting a feature based on the Qualcomm X60 that allows for emergency satellite calls — reportedly only available in select markets.</p>
<p>Of course, the phone will also be getting Apple’s latest chip, the A15, said to be coupled with 120 Hz ProMotion display. Apple could also be bringing an always-on feature to the screen, hopefully with minimal impact on battery life. Looks-wise we anticipate it will be more or less the same as its predecessor, albeit with a somewhat smaller camera notch up front — though not to the point of the fake Ted Lasso iPhone. The camera bump around back, meanwhile, is said to be getting larger, perhaps offering an improved telephoto lens.</p>
<p>Oh, and apparently they’ll be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2021/08/28/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-price-release-date-cost-upgrade-iphone-12-pro-max/?sh=4d66e5e3579d">more expensive</a> than the iPhone 12 — clearly not one of the new features Apple is going to be actively promoting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2046642" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2046642" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2046642" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg 2458w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1223 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-15-at-1.14.27-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2046642" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The Apple Watch 7 seems destined to be the other big news of the event. Apple’s massively popular wearable is reportedly set to get more massive, with a larger display, resulting in a slightly larger case size, from 40 mm and 44 mm to 41 mm and 45 mm. The overall size won’t be too large a change, however, as the company is said to be reducing its bezels this go-round.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting rumor around the Watch is the addition of significant battery life. That’s long felt like a blind spot for the product, compared to competing smartwatches — particularly after Apple significantly improved sleep tracking. Most aren’t anticipating major new health features for the Watch this outing, which is a bit of a surprise here, given that health and fitness have been a major cornerstone for Apple.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1800816" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1800816" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-1800816 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="2433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=1536,927 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=2048,1236 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-from-iOS-1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1800816" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>AirPods 3 seem like a reasonably good bet. The latest version of the company’s entry-level earbuds (and their case) are said to be getting a more Pro-style redesign, along with a new chip that’s designed to improve battery life. Active noise cancelation and replaceable tips are apparently not going to make an appearance to maintain the distinction between the two models.</p>
<p>With the company’s rangewide upgrade to its own silicon chugging along, don’t be surprised if we see a number of new Macs. Rumors suggest a new MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and a larger, 27-inch version of its ARM-powered iMac.</p>
<p>The event kicks off Tuesday, September 14 at 10 a.m. PDT/1 p.m. EDT. We’ll be here, bringing you the news as it arrives.<br />

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Both as a term and as a financial product, “buy now, pay later” has become mainstream in the past few years. BNPL has evolved to assume various forms today, from small-ticket offerings by fintechs on consumer checkout platforms and marketplaces, to closed-loop products offered on marketplaces such as Amazon Pay Later (which they are now extending for outside use as well). You can also see some variants offered by companies that want to expand the scope of consumption and consumer credit.</p>
<p>Globally, BNPL has seen the most growth in the consumer segment and has driven retail consumption and lending over the past few years. Consumer BNPL offerings are a good alternative to credit cards, especially for people who do not have a credit history and can&#8217;t get credit from banks. That said, a specific vertical of BNPL products is gaining traction — one targeted toward small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This new vertical is known as &#8220;SME BNPL.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			BNPL can be particularly useful when flow-based underwriting or transaction-based underwriting is used to offer credit to small businesses.					</blockquote>

<h2>B2B commerce in India is moving online</h2>
<p>E-commerce has seen tremendous growth in India over the past decade. Skyrocketing smartphone and internet penetration led to rapid growth in e-commerce across large cities and smaller towns alike. Consumer credit has also taken off in parallel as credit cards and digital lending spurred credit-based consumption across offline and online stores.</p>
<p>However, the large B2B supply chain enabling the burgeoning retail market was plagued by bottlenecks and inefficiencies because it involved a plethora of intermediaries and streamlining became a big problem. A number of tech players responded by organizing the previously disorganized B2B commerce market at various touch points, inserting convenience, pricing and easier product access through tech-enabled logistics and a modern supply chain.</p>

<p>India&#8217;s B2B e-commerce space has developed rapidly since 2020. Small businesses have moved from using paper to smartphone apps for running a significant part of their day-to-day business, leading to widespread disruption in how businesses transact today. The COVID-19 pandemic also forced small businesses, which were earlier using physical means to procure goods and services, to try new and online models to conduct their affairs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200976" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200976" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200976 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?w=680" alt="Graph depicting growth of India's B2B retail market" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png 1704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image03-India-B2B-Retail-Growth.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Redseer</p></div></p>
<p>Moreover, the Indian government&#8217;s widespread promotion of an instant payments system in the form of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has changed how people send money to each other or pay merchants for their goods and services. The next step for solving the digital B2B puzzle is to embed credit inside every transaction and invoice.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200978" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200978" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200978 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png?w=531" alt="Investments in online B2B in india 2016-19" width="531" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png 1124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png?resize=234,300 234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png?resize=768,984 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png?resize=531,680 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image02-India-eB2B-Investments.png?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200978" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Redseer</p></div></p>
<p>If we compare online B2B transactions to the offline world, there is only one missing link: The terms offered to small businesses by their supplier/distributor or vendor. Businesses, unlike consumers, must buy goods and services to eventually trade them, or add value and sell to consumers or others down the value chain. This process is not immediate and has a certain time cycle attached.</p>
<p>The longer sales cycle means many small businesses require credit payment terms when buying inventory. As B2B commerce scales and grows through digital means, a BNPL product that caters to the needs of SMEs can support their growth and alleviate the burden on their cash flows.</p>
<h2>How does consumer BNPL differ from SME BNPL?</h2>
<p>An SME BNPL product is a purchase financing product for small businesses transacting with suppliers, distributors, aggregator platforms or B2B marketplaces.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China’s first data privacy laws go into effect on November 1, 2021. Will your company be in compliance?</p>
<p>Modeled after the EU’s GDPR, the new regulations &#8220;[introduce] perhaps the most stringent set of requirements and protections for data privacy in the world,&#8221; writes Scott W. Pink, special counsel in O’Melveny’s Data Security &amp; Privacy practice.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive overview, he explains its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/">key requirements and compliance steps for U.S.-based firms</a> that service Chinese consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;American firms doing business in China or with companies inside China will need to immediately start assessing how this new law will impact their activities,&#8221; he advises.</p>

<p>Online mortgage company Better.com isn&#8217;t waiting to complete its SPAC merger before making big moves: Ryan Lawler reported that it purchased Property Partners, a U.K.-based startup that offers fractional property ownership.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second company Better bought in recent months: In July, it snapped up digital mortgage brokerage Trussle.</p>
<p>“We aren’t so easily categorized,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg, who told Ryan that the company plans to soon expand into traditional financial services like auto loans and insurance.</p>
<p>Said CFO Kevin Ryan, “a lot of people have their niches in the way they’re attacking this, but we feel like we’re on a path to being full stack where everything’s embedded in the same flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many potential founders are well-versed in startup economics — and many are completely green.</p>
<p>When it comes to raising funds, understanding the relative benefits (and limitations) of debt and equity financing is required knowledge, however.</p>
<p>Founders who are less willing to dilute their control may be willing to use debt financing to fund their capital expenditures, &#8220;but it doesn&#8217;t make sense for everyone,&#8221; says six-time entrepreneur David Friend.</p>

<p>Last year, startups based in Southeast Asia raised more than $8.2 billion, a 4x increase from 2015.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2021, regional M&amp;A has increased 83% to a record $124.8 billion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just venture capitalists and Big Tech who are beefing up their presence in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 229 family offices have been registered in Singapore since 2020, with total assets under management of an estimated $20 billion,&#8221; writes Amit Anand, a founding partner of Jungle Ventures.</p>

<p>Natasha Mascarenhas examined the parallels between edtech and the creator economy, both of which boomed amid the pandemic &#8212; and blurred amid the rise of cohort-based classes.</p>
<p>“Edtech and the creator economy certainly differ in the problems they try to solve: Finding a VR solution to make online STEM classes more realistic is a different nut to crack than streamlining all of a creator’s different monetization strategies into one platform. Still, the two sectors have found common ground in the past year.”</p>

<p>Were the shoes, jacket and makeup that looked so good on Instagram (and in your shopping cart) disappointing when you put them on for the first time?</p>
<p>Due to buyer&#8217;s remorse, it&#8217;s not uncommon for apparel or beauty products to languish in the back of a drawer or end up as gifts, but there are also serious consequences.</p>
<p>“The beauty industry produces over 120 billion units of packaging every year, little of which is recycled. Globally, an estimated 92 million tons of textile waste ends up in landfills,” Sindhya Valloppillil, founder and CEO of Skin Dossier, notes in a guest column.</p>
<p>The answer to bringing sustainability to the industry, she says, is using tech to personalize the retail experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>AR virtual try-on with shade matching</li>
<li>Advanced virtual fitting rooms with VR/AR for fashion</li>
<li>Smart packaging with IoT and distributed ledger technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Twenty million people live in Lagos, Nigeria, and each day, 14 million of them use the city&#8217;s transit system.</p>
<p>Travelers rely on overcrowded public buses that navigate congested routes: What should be a 30-minute trip is often a three-hour journey, but Treepz CEO and co-founder Onyeka Akumah “has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond,” writes Rebecca Bellan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to give people a better way to commute with predictability, where they can know when the bus will get here, the certainty that they will have a seat in a vehicle, that it’s a decent vehicle and a safe one where you can bring your laptop,&#8221; said Akumah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are the things we said we wanted to change.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, a flashcard tool turned artificial intelligence-powered tutoring platform, is planning an initial public offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic/">nearly a year after it was valued at $1 billion.</a> According to people familiar with the matter, Quizlet is considerably far along in the process to go public. <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/quizlet-2/19d49435-66df-42a8-b35f-fdddc40f25ae">A recent job filing</a> shows that it is hiring for senior roles to “help build the financial systems and processes as we move towards an IPO.”</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, the San Francisco-based edtech startup declined to comment. Quizlet hasn’t said much about its revenue specifics or if it’s profitable. Last year, the still-private startup claimed it was growing revenue 100% annually. On its website, Quizlet says that it has 60 million monthly learners, <a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/quizlet-hits-50m-monthly-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">up 10 million learners compared to its 2018 totals.</a></p>
<p>Quizlet has built a large-scale business around simple to share and simple to use products. Its free flashcard maker helps students spin up study guides on topics to prepare for exams. Those insights fuel Quizlet Plus, the startup’s subscription product that charges $47.88 a year for access to more features, including tutoring services.</p>
<p>Quizlet’s tutoring arm, also known as Quizlet Learn, is the company’s most popular offering, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/">per CEO Matthew Glotzbach.</a> As a student goes through the system, Quizlet Learn consistently assesses students to see where they are making mistakes — and where they are making progress.</p>

<p>“It obviously doesn’t yet replace and can’t come anywhere close to replacing a human, but it can provide that guidance and point you in the right direction and help you spend your time in the right places,” he said. “Just even helping you set goals is such a critical step in learning.”</p>
<p>Most recently, Quizlet announced the launch of explanations, a feature that offers a step-by-step solution guide for problem sets from popular textbooks. The feature is &#8220;written and verified by experts&#8221; and is aimed to help &#8220;students better understand the reasoning and thought process behind study questions so they can practice and apply their learnings on their own,&#8221; it said in a statement. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/quibi-rip/">reclaimed the Q from its less fortunate predecessor,</a> amid an entire rebrand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Quizlet’s quiet march toward the public markets has been slow yet steady. The startup was founded in 2005 by a 15-year-old, Andrew Sutherland. It was fully bootstrapped until 2015. Glotzbach, who was previously an executive at YouTube, then joined in 2016. The startup still doesn&#8217;t appear to have a CFO, which is rare for companies that are going public.</p>
<p>Quizlet has raised a majority of its $62 million in venture capital under Glotzbach. Now, investors in the company include General Atlantic, Owl Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Costanoa Ventures and Altos Ventures.</p>
<p>Quizlet’s pursuit of the public markets comes as other edtech companies are proving the market’s reception to the sector. Duolingo, for example, is another consumer-focused education company, albeit one that focuses on one vertical versus Quizlet&#8217;s choice to stay broad. Duolingo went public in July, and is currently trading above its open price at $169.75 per share.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Operators like Spin, Voi, Zipp, Bird and Superpedestrian are investing in tech that can detect and correct poor rider behavior, sometimes going as far as stopping scooters if they're on a sidewalk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The desire to achieve something as simple as keeping shared electric scooters off sidewalks has driven the development of some advanced technology in the micromobility industry. Once the province of geofencing, scooter companies are so eager to get a leg up on the competition that they’re now implementing technology similar to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) usually found in cars.</p>
<p>Operators like Spin, Voi, Zipp, Bird and Superpedestrian are investing in camera-based or location-based tech that can detect and even correct poor rider behavior, sometimes going to the extent of slowing scooters to a stop if they&#8217;re riding on a sidewalk.</p>
<p>People riding or parking scooters on sidewalks is a big problem for cities and forms one of the main complaints from NIMBYist residents who dislike change all the more when it becomes a tripping hazard. Companies are trying to solve this problem with tech that effectively puts the onus of rider behavior on operators, which may result in cities requiring scooter operators to have this sort of ADAS tech.</p>
<p>Scooter ADAS is probably the most doable and cost-effective method that cities can use to prevent unwanted rider behavior. And, it&#8217;s far cheaper than trying to police rider behavior themselves, or, address the lack of protected cycling infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;This technology comes from a need for protected bike lanes,&#8221; said Dmitry Shevelenko, co-founder and president of Tortoise, an automated vehicle positioning service for micromobility companies. &#8220;It exists in this world where riders kind of have to do things that aren&#8217;t that great for others, because they have nowhere else to go. And so that&#8217;s the true driver of the need for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cities can solve this problem for the long term by building bike lanes or creating scooter parking bays, but until that happens, operators need to reassure local administrations that micromobility is safe, compliant and a good thing for cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until cities have dedicated infrastructure for whatever new modality comes to play, you have to figure out a way to use technology to make sure things don&#8217;t mix poorly,&#8221; said Alex Nesic, co-founder and chief business officer of Drover AI, a computer vision startup that provides camera-based scooter ADAS. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re after. We want to enable this kind of maturation of the industry.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Street views versus satellite views</h2>
<p>Drover AI works with Spin, while Luna, another computer vision company, works with Voi and Zipp to attach cameras, sensors and a microprocessor to scooters to detect lanes, sidewalks, pedestrians and other environmental surroundings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just about every company is sitting on vast amounts of data, which they can use to their advantage if they can just learn how to harness it. Data is actually the fuel for machine learning models, and with the proper tools, businesses can learn to process this data and build models to help them compete in a rapidly changing marketplace, to react more quickly to shifting customer requirements and to find insights faster than any human ever possibly could.</p>
<p>Boston-based <a href="http://datarobot.com">DataRobot</a>, a late-stage startup that has built a platform to help companies navigate the machine learning model lifecycle, has been raising money by the bushel over the last several years, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/boston-based-datarobot-raises-206m-series-e-to-bring-ai-to-enterprise/">$206 million in September 2019</a> and another <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/datarobot-raises-300-million-in-new-funding-11627392058">$300 million in July</a>. DataRobot CEO Dan Wright will be joining us on a panel to discuss the role of data in business at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datarobotpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datarobotpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS on October 27th</a>.</p>
<p>The company covers the gamut of the machine learning lifecycle, including preparing data, operationalizing it and finally building APIs to make it useful for the organization as it attempts to build a soup-to-nuts platform. DataRobot&#8217;s broad platform approach has appealed to investors.</p>
<p>As we wrote at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/boston-based-datarobot-raises-206m-series-e-to-bring-ai-to-enterprise/">the $206 million round</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company has been catching the attention of these investors by offering a machine learning platform aimed at analysts, developers and data scientists to help build predictive models much more quickly than it typically takes using traditional methodologies. Once built, the company provides a way to deliver the model in the form of an API, simplifying deployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>DataRobot has raised a total of $1 billion on $6.3 billion post valuation, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/57523-60/company/profile">PitchBook data</a>, and it&#8217;s been putting that money to work to add to its platform of services. Most recently the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/datarobot-raises-300-million-in-new-funding-11627392058">acquired Algorithmia</a>, which helps manage machine learning models.</p>
<p>As the pandemic has pushed more business online, companies are always looking for an edge, and one way to achieve that is by taking advantage of AI and machine learning. Wright will be joined on the data panel by Monte Carlo co-founder and CEO Barr Moses and AgentSync co-founder and CTO Jenn Knight to discuss the growing role of data in business operations</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Wright, the conference will also include Microsoft&#8217;s Jared Spataro, Amplitude&#8217;s Olivia Rose, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Laela Sturdy, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A judge this morning <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-epic-games/judge-in-epic-suit-says-apple-restrictions-anti-competitive-idUSKBN2G61IK">issued</a> a ruling in California’s Epic Games v. Apple case, siding with the Fortnite maker on the topic of third-party payments. Effectively, the judge has ruled that Apple cannot prohibit developers from adding links for alternative payments beyond Apple’s App Store-based monetization.</p>
<p>The mobile giant’s control over fees on iOS has long been a sticking point for Epic and the veritable cash cow of its in-gaming micro-transactions.</p>
<p>The ruling notes, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision is the result of a fight that&#8217;s been brewing for years between Apple and larger developers, particularly in gaming, whose businesses account for a hefty majority &#8212; 70%, the judge noted &#8212; of App Store revenue.</p>
<p>After Apple banned Epic Games&#8217; Fortnite app for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">implementation</a> of a new payment mechanism that allowed it to bypass Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase framework last August, the game maker sued Apple, alleging it was abusing its market power by forcing companies to use Apple&#8217;s payment systems. Epic Games also sued Google and joined up with other app developers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/">form the Coalification for App Fairness</a>, a group that actively lobbied for app store reform, including by involving itself in individual efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/05/technology-202-state-legislatures-across-country-are-targeting-app-stores/">generate legislation</a> at the state level in the U.S.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Apple has made a few minor tweaks to its App Store rules as the result of concessions related to other lawsuits and legislation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">which included a settlement with a Japanese regulator</a> that saw the tech giant change its policies for “reader apps”&#8211; apps that provide access to purchased content &#8212; that would allow them to point users to their own website where users could sign up and manage their accounts.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/"> Another settlement gave developers permission</a> to use customer contact information collected inside their app to tell customers about other payment options. And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">South Korea, a new law forced</a> Apple and Google to allow developers to use their own third-party payment systems. After the passing of that law, Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-asks-apple-to-reinstate-fortnite-in-south-korea-after-new-law/">asked</a> to reinstate Fortnite to the App Store in that market, but Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/epic-games-asks-apple-allow-fortnite-return-south-korea-2021-09-10/">rebuffed that request</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s ongoing refusal to adapt its App Store rules to the changing environment, it has historically argued, is about consumer protections. In prior statements, allowing alternative means of in-app purchases could put users at risk of fraud and undermine their privacy, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">said</a>.</p>
<p>While today&#8217;s ruling will force Apple to now accommodate developers by allowing them the choice to include buttons or links to other places where they can pay, it still won in the sense that it was not deemed a monopoly. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had disagreed with how both Apple and Epic Games have framed the relevant market, saying that in digital mobile gaming transactions, Apple did not have a monopoly.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Court finds that Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinarily high profit margins, these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct,&#8221; Rogers wrote. &#8220;Success is not illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said. &#8220;As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal.’ Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace that supports a thriving developer community and more than 2.1 million U.S. jobs, and where the rules apply equally to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s ruling may have longer-term implications for the developer community, as Apple will have to adjust its rules to accommodate apps that point to other payment options. It could choose to require apps to include Apple&#8217;s own in-app payments option as an option, for example. It could also decide that qualifying &#8220;reader apps&#8221; as a separate category no longer makes sense, given this new requirement. But those sorts of decisions will roll out in the days ahead.</p>
<p>What Epic Games didn&#8217;t win is getting Apple dubbed a monopolist, which is ultimately a much bigger deal with ramifications that could have led to U.S. government regulations. And Apple will not have to allow third-party app stores or sideloading, which could have been far more disruptive to the long-term prospects of its App Store business as a whole. For consumers, however, it means the App Store could get more complicated as they&#8217;re forced to exit apps to make purchases or to get better pricing. And when consumers use outside payment systems, they&#8217;ll lose the ability to manage all their subscriptions in one place, potentially making cancellations more difficult.</p>
<p>As a result of the lawsuit, Rogers ruled that Epic Games will have to pay Apple the 30% of the $12 million it earned when it introduced its alternative payment system in Fortnite, which was then in breach of its legal contract with Apple.</p>
<p>Following the decision, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370846545809410?s=20">tweeted</a> that Fortnite will return to the App Store when and where it can offer in-app payment in &#8220;fair competition with Apple in-app payment,&#8221; and would pass along the savings to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to everyone who put so much time and effort into the battle over fair competition on digital platforms, and thanks especially to the court for managing a very complex case on a speedy timeline,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;We will fight on.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.crowberrycapital.com">Crowberry Capital</a>, operating in Reykjavik and Copenhagen, has launched Crowberry II: a $90 million seed and early-stage fund aimed at startups in the Nordic region. A second close &#8212; bringing in an additional $40 million &#8212; is planned for July 2022.</p>
<p>The EIF (European Investment Fund) is the lead LP on the fund, after putting in €20 million from the EU’s “InnovFin Equity” program. This is InnovFin Equity’s first VC fund in Iceland.</p>
<p>Other investors include Icelandic Pension funds, several family offices and angels, including David Helgason, founder of Unity Technologies.</p>
<p>Crowberry II, which claims to be the largest VC fund operating out of Iceland, is headed up by three women founders: Hekla Arnardottir, Helga Valfells and Jenny Ruth Hrafnsdottir.</p>
<p>The Crowberry I fund (a $40 million fund launched in 2017), invested in startups in the areas of gaming, SaaS, health tech and fintech.</p>
<p>Hekla Arnardottir said: “An incorrect assumption is that because we are women, we are only interested in supporting female founders. As our investment record shows, we support companies because they are game changers, irrespective of the gender of their senior team members. However, we also benefit, as an all-female team, from a circumspection which means that we can see potential in businesses and sectors which are typically overlooked by others in our space.”</p>
<p>She added: “Inclusivity is good for business, and through being open and approachable, your deal-flow multiplies in parallel to your talent pool, and businesses are built with a broader potential user base. It’s crazy that in 2020, female-led startups received just 2.3% of VC funding, yet Crowberry considers this to be an opportunity: where the Nordics lead in gender equality on a societal level, we want to show that the region can also show the way in terms of inventive venture support.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crowberry’s previous fund (Crowberry I) featured 15 companies, of which 33% had female CEOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said on Friday it will give its two billion users the option to encrypt their chat backups to the cloud, taking a significant step to put a lid on one of the tricky ways private communication between individuals on the app can be compromised.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned service has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/">end-to-end encrypted chats</a> between users for more than a decade. But users have had no option but to store their chat backup to their cloud — iCloud on iPhones and Google Drive on Android — in an unencrypted format.</p>
<p>Tapping these unencrypted WhatsApp chat backups on Google and Apple servers is one of the widely known ways law enforcement agencies across the globe have for years been able to access WhatsApp chats of suspect individuals.</p>

<p>Now WhatsApp says it is patching this weak link in the system.</p>
<p>“WhatsApp is the first global messaging service at this scale to offer end-to-end encrypted messaging and backups, and getting there was a really hard technical challenge that required an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage across operating systems,” said Facebook&#8217;s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113891830147821">in a post</a> announcing the new feature.</p>
<h2>Store your own encryption keys</h2>
<p>The company said it has devised a system to enable WhatsApp users on Android and iOS to lock their chat backups with encryption keys. WhatsApp says it will offer users two ways to encrypt their cloud backups, and the feature is optional.</p>
<p>In the “coming weeks,” users on WhatsApp will see an option to generate a 64-digit encryption key to lock their chat backups in the cloud. Users can store the encryption key offline or in a password manager of their choice, or they can create a password that backs up their encryption key in a cloud-based &#8220;backup key vault&#8221; that WhatsApp has developed. The cloud-stored encryption key can&#8217;t be used without the user&#8217;s password, which isn&#8217;t known by WhatsApp.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200868" style="width: 1320px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200868" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200868 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg" alt="" width="1310" height="1006" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=768,590 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/whatsapp-e2ee-backup.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200868" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp/supplied</p></div></p>
<p>“We know that some will prefer the 64-digit encryption key whereas others want something they can easily remember, so we will be including both options. Once a user sets their backup password, it is not known to us. They can reset it on their original device if they forget it,” WhatsApp said.</p>
<p>“For the 64-digit key, we will notify users multiple times when they sign up for end-to-end encrypted backups that if they lose their 64-digit key, we will not be able to restore their backup and that they should write it down. Before the setup is complete, we’ll ask users to affirm that they’ve saved their password or 64-digit encryption key.”</p>
<p>A WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch that once an encrypted backup is created, previous copies of the backup will be deleted. &#8220;This will happen automatically and there is no action that a user will need to take,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>
<h2>Potential regulatory pushback?</h2>
<p>The move to introduce this added layer of privacy is significant and one that could have far-reaching implications.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption remains a thorny topic of discussion as governments continue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/encryption-backdoor-bill-dangerous-lofgren/">lobby for backdoors</a>. Apple was reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">pressured</a> to not add encryption to iCloud Backups after the FBI complained, and while Google has offered users the ability to encrypt their data stored in Google Drive, the company allegedly didn&#8217;t tell governments before it rolled out the feature.</p>
<p>When asked by TechCrunch whether WhatsApp, or its parent firm Facebook, had consulted with government bodies — or if it had received their support — during the development process of this feature, the company declined to discuss any such conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;People’s messages are deeply personal and as we live more of our lives online, we believe companies should enhance the security they provide their users. By releasing this feature, we are providing our users with the option to add this additional layer of security for their backups if they’d like to, and we’re excited to give our users a meaningful advancement in the safety of their personal messages,&#8221; the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>WhatsApp also confirmed that it will be rolling out this optional feature in every market where its app is operational. It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to withhold privacy features for legal and regulatory reasons. Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-privacy-focused-features/">upcoming encrypted browsing feature</a>, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-private-relay-unavailable-in-china/">won&#8217;t be made available to users in certain authoritarian regimes</a>, such as China, Belarus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.</p>
<p>At any rate, Friday&#8217;s announcement comes days after <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">ProPublica reported</a> that private end-to-end encrypted conversations between two users can be read by human contractors when messages are reported by users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making backups fully encrypted is really hard and it’s particularly hard to make it reliable and simple enough for people to use. No other messaging service at this scale has done this and provided this level of security for people’s messages,&#8221; Uzma Barlaskar, product lead for privacy at WhatsApp, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been working on this problem for many years, and to build this, we had to develop an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage that can be used across the world’s largest operating systems and that took time.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a parent of teenagers, I’m used to having tough, sometimes even awkward, conversations about topics that are complex but important. Most parents will likely agree with me when I say those types of conversations never get easier, but over time, you tend to develop a roadmap of how to approach the subject, how to make sure you’re being clear and how to answer hard questions.</p>
<p>And like many parents, I quickly learned that my children have just as much to teach me as I can teach them. I’ve learned that tough conversations build trust.</p>
<p>I’ve applied this lesson about trust-building conversations to an extremely important aspect of my role as the chief legal officer at Foursquare: Conducting “The Privacy Talk.”</p>

			The discussion should convey an understanding of how the legislative and regulatory environment are going to affect product offerings, including what’s being done to get ahead of that change.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<h2>What exactly is The Privacy Talk?</h2>
<p>It’s the conversation that goes beyond the written, publicly posted privacy policy and dives deep into a customer, vendor, supplier or partner’s approach to ethics. This conversation seeks to convey and align the expectations that two companies must have at the beginning of a new engagement.</p>
<p>RFIs may ask a lot of questions about privacy compliance, information security and data ethics. But it’s no match for asking your prospective partner to hop on a Zoom to walk you through their broader approach. Unless you hear it firsthand, it can be hard to discern whether a partner is thinking strategically about privacy, if they are truly committed to data ethics and how compliance is woven into their organization’s culture.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft said in January this year that Teams, its online collaboration platform, was being used by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-education-google-chromebooks-teams-2021-1?op=1&amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 million students</a> &#8212; boosted in no small part by the COVID-19 pandemic and many schools going partly or fully remote. Now, it&#8217;s made another acquisition to continue expanding its position in the education market.</p>
<p>The company has acquired <a href="https://takelessons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TakeLessons</a>, a platform for students to connect with individual tutors in areas like music lessons, language learning, academic subjects and professional training or hobbies, and for tutors to book and organize the lessons they give, both online and in person.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal have not been disclosed but we are trying to find out. San Diego-based TakeLessons had raised at least $20 million from a <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52618-87/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of VCs and individuals</a> that included LightBank, Uncork Capital, Crosslink Capital and others. TakeLessons <a href="https://takelessons.com/microsoft-student" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a short note</a> in the form of a Q&amp;A confirming the deal on its site. The note said that it will continue operating, business as usual, for the time being, with the intention of taking its platform to a wider global audience.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="exEunDIXov"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/">The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/embed/#?secret=exEunDIXov" data-secret="exEunDIXov" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how many active students and tutors TakeLessons had on its platform at the time of acquisition, but for some context, another big player in the area of online one-to-one tutoring, <a href="http://gostudent.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoStudent</a> out of Europe, raised <a href="https://takelessons.com/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$244 million in funding earlier this year</a> that valued it at $1.7 billion. Others in online tutoring like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/brainly-raises-80m-as-its-platform-for-crowdsourced-homework-help-balloons-to-350m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainly</a> are also seeing valuations in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Given the relatively modest amount raised by TakeLessons, it&#8217;s likely this was a much lower valuation. Yet the acquisition is still one that gives Microsoft the infrastructure and beginnings of setting up a much more aggressive play in mass-market online education, potentially to go head-to-head with these and other big platforms.</p>
<p>TakeLessons today offers instruction in a wide variety of areas, including music lessons (which was where it had gotten its start) through to languages, academic subjects and test prep, computer skills, crafts and more. It has been around since 2006 and got its start as a platform for people to connect with tutors local to them for in-person lessons, before progressing into online lessons to complement that business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic has precipitated a shift to a much bigger wave of the latter, with online tutoring apparently the majority of what is offered on the TakeLessons platform today. These lessons continue to be offered on a one-on-one basis, but additionally students can take part in group lessons online via the startup&#8217;s <a href="https://takelessons.com/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live</a> platform.</p>
<p>The shift to online education that we&#8217;ve seen take hold around the world is likely why Microsoft sees a big opportunity here.</p>
<p>On the heels of many schools around the world scrambling for better online learning platforms to manage remote learning during lockdowns and quarantines, educators, families and students have been using (and paying for) a variety of different tools. Within that, Microsoft has been pushing hard to make Teams a leader in that area.</p>
<p>That was built on years of traction already in the market (and a number of other investments and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/microsoft-acquires-datasense-management-from-brightbytes-to-step-up-its-education-play-in-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisitions</a> that Microsoft has made over the years).</p>
<p>But it also comes amid a new insurgence of competition arising from the current state of affairs. That includes adoption of Google Classroom, as well as a wide variety of more targeted point solutions for specific purposes like video lessons (Zoom figures big here); apps for lesson planning and homework planning; online on-demand tutorials in specific areas like math or languages or science to bolster in-class learning experiences; and more.</p>
<p>The Microsoft way is to bring as many features into a platform as possible to make it more sticky and less likely that users will turn to other apps, providing more value for money around the Microsoft offer. In other words, I&#8217;d expect to see Microsoft do more deals and launch more features to cover all of the services that it doesn&#8217;t already provide through its educational tools.</p>
<p>(Case in point: My children&#8217;s school uses Teams for online lessons, in part because it already uses Outlook for its email system. Now, the school has announced that it will no longer be using a different third-party app for homework planning; instead, teachers will be assigning homework and managing it via Teams. For a cash-strapped state school like ours, it makes sense that it would opt out of paying for two apps when it can get the same features in just one of them. The kids are not happy about this! This is what Microsoft leverages with its platform play.)</p>
<p>NextLessons is somewhat adjacent to that school-focused education strategy. Yes, there will be a big audience of students and their families who might represent a good cross-selling opportunity for tutoring, but NextLessons represents also a more mass-market offering, open to anyone who might want to learn something, not just those already using Microsoft Education products.</p>
<p>So the interest here is likely not just students who want to supplement their online learning &#8212; there is a big audience for online tutoring &#8212; but any lifelong learner, as well as the many consumers or professionals out there who have gotten interested in learning something new, especially in the last 1.5 years of spending more time alone and/or at home.</p>
<p>And with that, there are other potential opportunities for NextLessons in the Microsoft universe.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Ryan Roslansky, the CEO of Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, held an online presentation about what work will look like in the future. Education &#8212; specifically professional development &#8212; figured strongly in that discussion, with the conversation coinciding with LinkedIn launching a new Learning Hub.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ODkIVeabYA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/">LinkedIn doubles down on development with new learning hub, free courses and new search fields for hybrid working</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LinkedIn doubles down on development with new learning hub, free courses and new search fields for hybrid working&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/embed/#?secret=ODkIVeabYA" data-secret="ODkIVeabYA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>LinkedIn has not only been working for years on building out its education business, but it has also long been looking for a more sticky inroad into doing more with video on its platform.</p>
<p>Something like NextLessons could, interestingly, kill those two birds with one stone. While LinkedIn&#8217;s education content up to now has not been something specifically tied to &#8220;live&#8221; online lessons, you could imagine a bridge between Microsoft&#8217;s latest acquisition and what LinkedIn might consider next, too.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>took over this week&#8217;s show with <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace, </a>which meant that our overdeveloped senses of curiosity filled up the script just fine (even on a somewhat short week). Unintentionally, today&#8217;s episode was built around a theme of inclusion &#8212; from auto-insurance to women&#8217;s health, and from payments to knowledge.</p>
<p>But here are some more specifics on what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>For our funding round section, we discussed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.’s Marshmallow getting unicorn status for its </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more inclusive, big-data take on car insurance, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/womens-health-tech-brand-elvie-tops-up-series-c-to-97m/">women’s health tech brand Elvie topping up its Series C to $97 million,</a> and an ambitious fintech play from Leap, which wants to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/"> give gig workers access to financial products</a> by partnering directly to marketplaces. </span></span></li>
<li> After getting past the dollars and deals, I indulged by bringing up my latest piece: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Edtech leans into the creator economy with cohort-based classes.</a> The core of the story gets into a ton of tensions, the biggest of which I&#8217;d pose as a question to you: should anyone be allowed to be a teacher?</li>
<li>Then we headed into Mary Ann&#8217;s world of fintech to understand what I dubbed feels like national BNPL week. If I may, I&#8217;d argue that this is the &#8220;can&#8217;t miss&#8221; segment of the entire show, as we made sense of why it&#8217;s a global phenomenon, which markets are popping off and what this means for the credit card industry. Below is a smattering of headlines we walked through:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal acquires Japan’s Paidy for $2.7B to crack the buy now, pay later market in Asia </span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip acquisition of Payflex means Africa is ripe for BNPL disruption</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi raises $75M to advance ‘buy now, pay later’ in LatAm, nearly triples valuation</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then we ended by talking about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/">an adorable, but potentially dangerous robot unicorn.</a> Yep. You read that right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember when we were all thinking about what &#8220;the new normal&#8221; would look like? Well, I guess it&#8217;s here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vouch.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vouch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of business insurance to startups and high-growth companies, announced today it has raised $90 million in new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $90 million figure was raised across two rounds: a $60 million Series C co-led by SVB Capital (a subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank) and Ribbit Capital that values the company at $550 million, and a previously unannounced $30 million Series B1 led by Redpoint Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest financing, San Francisco-based Vouch has now raised a total of $160 million since its 2018 inception. Other investors include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allegis Group, Sound Ventures and SiriusPoint.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6bp936ZVeJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=6bp936ZVeJ" data-secret="6bp936ZVeJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many insurance technology companies out there that serve consumers, there are far fewer that offer it to companies, much less startups. Vouch describes itself as “a new kind of insurance platform” for startups that offers fully digital, “tailored coverage that takes minutes to activate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Vouch has seen impressive growth. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, but said it saw “7x” increase in its customer base year over year and currently protects over $5.7 billion in risk across thousands of policies. Today, Vouch has more than 1,600 clients, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/middesk/">Middesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/neighbor-raises-53m-series-b-for-self-storage-marketplace-after-5x-revenue-growth/">Neighbor</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/altman-brothers-lead-b2b-payment-startup-routables-30m-series-b/">Routable</a>. It is also the “preferred” business insurance provider to the customers of Silicon Valley Bank, Brex, Carta and WeWork. Y Combinator too also refers Vouch to its portfolio companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Vouch co-founder and CEO Sam Hodges, the ability to attract some of the highest-profile businesses in the startup world speaks to the company’s understanding of the startup ecosystem. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s our responsibility to meet startup founders where they are, and give startups flexibility as they navigate changing laws, regulations and the virtual and physical locations of their businesses,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies, Vouch had to shift its model during the pandemic to adapt to the different types of emerging risks businesses have faced. For example, last year, Vouch saw a change in where its startup clients’ teams were distributed. Before the pandemic, nearly 30% of the teams were remote. During the pandemic, that figure has shifted to over 53%. As a result, Vouch developed a broader range of insurance coverages to adapt to the “new normal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in its new line of proprietary products and services aimed at startups are: work from anywhere coverage, broader cyber coverages and embedded insurance. It also expanded its underwriting capabilities to serve early-stage to growth-market startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the work from anywhere coverage is in direct response to the pandemic-related shift in remote work and can insure up to $500,000 per occurrence and can include a specified property owned by a startup regardless of the location of that property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major differentiator for Vouch, said Hodges,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it is now the only business insurance provider for startups that has its own insurance carrier, which means the company backs its own policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This capability means we have a lot of control over how we build and underwrite our policies — which translates into superior coverage and a better experience for our clients,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hodges co-founded Vouch with Travis Hedge three years ago after seeing how challenging it could be for a company to get the business insurance it needs to start and then scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to make it as easy as possible to onboard new customers and personalize the coverage as much as possible based on each company’s needs based on what they do, their customer base, stage of growth and the founder’s threshold for risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical client can get a quote and bind their coverage online in under 10 minutes, without any phone calls or paperwork,” he told TechCrunch. “Vouch also has many coverage features that are uniquely geared for startups. For example, our directors and officers coverage includes a cap table coverage feature meant specifically to protect startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vouch looks at startups that need business insurance on a case by case basis, Hodges added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it asks questions like, “Does an e-commerce company handle a very limited amount of client-sensitive information?” If so, it could make sense that it has a lower cyber insurance coverage limit and pay less for its policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if a startup is trying to raise money, it might need to invest more in Vouch’s directors and officers insurance to make sure it is covered should disputes arise in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hodges said the new capital would go toward continued investment in technical capabilities, an expansion of its product offerings, more hiring and building embedded insurance for its partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to the embedded capabilities, within the next 12 months, all of the company’s partners’ customers will be able to purchase Vouch insurance directly from those partners’ websites. Vouch’s headcount has more than doubled, from 55 employees in September 2020 to 125 full-time employees presently, and Hodges expects that will continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Becker, president and CEO of SVB Financial Group, said that Vouch’s mission aligns with SVB’s in that they both aim to “empower the innovation economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what Vouch is doing today, helping startups and tech innovators mitigate their risks as they grow,” he wrote via email. “We are proud to co-lead Vouch’s latest funding round to give startups access to the insurance they need as they add headcount, increase their customer base, or raise funding rounds of their own.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[MaxRewards is a digital wallet app that manages credit cards and automatically activates benefits like rewards, cashback offers and monthly credits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Anik Khan graduated from college, his first job was working on credit cards and business expenses at Accenture. There, he found that someone could bring in a couple of thousand dollars just by having the right credit cards and following the rewards and promotions.</p>
<p>It was back in 2017 when he and David Gao got the idea for his company <a href="http://maxrewards.com/">MaxRewards</a>, a digital wallet app that manages credit cards and automatically activates benefits like rewards, cashback offers and monthly credits. It also makes recommendations at the point of purchase on which card would yield the best reward for that purchase.</p>
<p>Going after the some <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2021-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2020-banking-and-credit.htm">83% of Americans that have a credit card</a>, the app version was officially launched in 2019, and now the Atlanta-based company is announcing a $3 million seed round co-led by Dundee Venture Capital and Calano Ventures. Also backing the company are Techstars, Fintech Ventures Fund, Service Provider Capital and Fleetcor president Nick Izquierdo.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1EJaFBLKvf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">Upgrade launches a credit card with bitcoin rewards</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Upgrade launches a credit card with bitcoin rewards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/embed/#?secret=1EJaFBLKvf" data-secret="1EJaFBLKvf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tracking his own credit cards manually prior to MaxRewards, Khan recalled in one year, getting $16,000 in rewards. However, utilizing those benefits was time-consuming and difficult, because the rewards and savings aren’t always made evident by the credit card companies.</p>
<p>“Other companies have tried to do something similar, but the issue is you don’t have the reward information or the offers,” Khan told TechCrunch. “If you were to aggregate this information, you still would have to activate all of these things and use them before they expired.”</p>
<p>Users connect their accounts and when they make a purchase, their location is cross-referenced with the merchant and an algorithm is applied to tell the user which card to use. The average app user has six credit cards.</p>
<p>MaxRewards is free to download and use, and the majority of the app&#8217;s functionalities are free. Users who want additional features, like the auto activation or rewards, can join MaxRewards Gold and are given the opportunity to choose their own monthly price — the average is over $25 per month — based on the value they expect to gain, Khan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200610" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200610" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200610" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200610" class="wp-caption-text">MaxRewards offers and benefits. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MaxRewards</p></div></p>
<p>Ron Watson, partner at Dundee, said his firm invests in seed-stage companies between the coasts and is interested in consumer and e-commerce companies. Watson said he was impressed with what MaxRewards has been able to do with a team of three. He also relates to the company’s mission, having grown up in a lower, middle-class family that did not frequently go on vacations.</p>
<p>When he got his first job and was suddenly flying everywhere, he recalls building up so many rewards to the point where he was able to go on a vacation to Hawaii and only spend maybe $100, he said.</p>
<p>“I used to put my points into a spreadsheet, but as I got older and had kids, I realized how hard it was for the average person to do that and how important it is to have automation,” Watson said. “I downloaded the app, and on the first day, saved $20.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is often compared to NerdWallet or Mint, but in terms of functionality, Khan said he feels MaxRewards is unique due to its credit card system connectors. Rather than rely on third-party aggregators to discover the rewards, MaxRewards leverages its own proprietary connectors to card systems.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of offers to be discovered, and consumers are asking for even more features, so Khan decided it was time to go after seed funding. He had raised a small seed, about $200,000, from his time at Techstars, but the new funding will enable him to add to his team of three people. He expects to be at 20 by the end of the year. Khan also wants to accelerate its user acquisition, product improvement and compliance.</p>
<p>Next up, the company is going to automate rewards and savings across additional platforms like debit cards, payment apps and cashback apps, as well as create browser extensions and a web app. Khan also wants to do more on the education side with regard to using credit cards in a smart manner.</p>
<p>Arron Solano, managing partner at Calano, met Khan through Techstars and said he is an advocate for using credit cards in the right way. His firm was looking for a company like MaxRewards.</p>
<p>“During our first call, I remember telling my partner that Anik was a bulldog who knew what he was talking about, especially at that stage,” Solano added. “He had strong team members, his vision lined up well and that checked off a massive box for us. He energized us and showed he could find a market with insanely high ‘super users.’ ”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amagi provides cloud broadcast and targeted advertising software so that customers can create content that can be created and monetized to be distributed via broadcast TV and streaming TV platforms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Media technology company <a href="https://www.amagi.com/">Amagi</a> announced Friday $100 million to further develop its cloud-based SaaS technology for broadcast and connected televisions.</p>
<p>Accel, Avataar Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners joined existing investor Premji Invest in the funding round, which included buying out stakes held by Emerald Media and Mayfield Fund. Nadathur Holdings continues as an existing investor. The latest round gives Amagi total funding raised to date of $150 million, Baskar Subramanian, co-founder and CEO of Amagi, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based Amagi provides cloud broadcast and targeted advertising software so that customers can create content that can be created and monetized to be distributed via broadcast TV and streaming TV platforms like The Roku Channel, Samsung TV Plus and Pluto TV. The company already supports more than 2,000 channels on its platform across over 40 countries.</p>
<p>“Video is a complex technology to manage — there are large files and a lot of computing,” Subramanian said. “What Amagi does is enable a content owner with zero technology knowledge to simplify that complex workflow and scalable infrastructure. We want to make it easy to plug in and start targeting and monetizing advertising.”</p>
<p>As a result, Amagi customers see operational cost savings on average of up to 40% compared to traditional delivery models and their ad impressions grow between five and 10 times.</p>

<p>The new funding comes at a time when the company is experiencing rapid growth. For example, Amagi grew 30 times in the United States alone over the past few years, Subramanian said. Amagi commands an audience of over 2 billion people, and the U.S. is its largest market. The company also sees growth potential in both Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition, in the last year, revenue grew 136%, while new customer year over year growth was 44%, including NBCUniversal — Subramanian said the Tokyo Olympics were run on Amagi’s platform for NBC, USA Today and ABS-CBN.</p>
<p>As more of a shift happens with video content being developed for connected television experiences, which he said is a $50 billion market, the company plans to use the new funding for sales expansion, R&amp;D to invest in the company’s product pipeline and potential M&amp;A opportunities. The company has not made any acquisitions yet, Subramanian added.</p>
<p>In addition to the broadcast operations in New Delhi, Amagi also has an innovation center in Bangalore and offices in New York, Los Angeles and London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumer behavior and infrastructure needs have reached a critical mass and new companies are bringing in the next generation of media, and we are a large part of that growth,” Subramanian said. “Sports will come on quicker, while live news and events are going to be one of the biggest growth areas.”</p>
<p>Shekhar Kirani, partner at Accel, said Amagi is taking a unique approach to enterprise SaaS due to that $50 billion industry shift happening in video content, where he sees half of the spend moving to connected television platforms quickly.</p>
<p>Some of the legacy players like Viacom and NBCUniversal created their own streaming platforms, where Netflix and Amazon have also been leading, but not many SaaS companies are enabling the transition, he said.</p>
<p>When Kirani met Subramanian five years ago, Amagi was already well funded, but Kirani was excited about the platform and wanted to help the company scale. He believes the company has a long tailwind because it is saving people time and enabling new content providers to move faster to get their content distributed.</p>
<p>“Amagi is creating a new category and will grow fast,” Kirani added. “They are already growing and doubling each year with phenomenal SaaS metrics because they are helping content providers to connect to any audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ten days after Apollo Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed its acquisition of Yahoo</a> (formerly Verizon Media) from Verizon for $5 billion, it has appointed a new CEO for the group. Jim Lanzone, who is currently the CEO of dating app Tinder, is coming on to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210910005121/en/Jim-Lanzone-to-Join-Yahoo-as-Chief-Executive-Officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead the company</a> (which, disclaimer, also owns TechCrunch). Renate Nyborg, who had been running Tinder&#8217;s business in EMEA, is taking on the role of CEO at Tinder.</p>
<p>Guru Gowrappan, who had led the division for three years under Verizon, is stepping down and taking on a role as &#8220;advisor&#8221; to Apollo.</p>
<p>The major changing of the guard had been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/verizon-media-leadership-in-doubt-ahead-of-apollo-acquisition-on-sept-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored for weeks</a> leading up to the Apollo sale closing, something that our sources were saying was not inaccurate, so this should not come as a huge surprise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YtCYcxfct2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">Apollo completes its $5B acquisition of Verizon Media, now known as Yahoo</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apollo completes its $5B acquisition of Verizon Media, now known as Yahoo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/embed/#?secret=YtCYcxfct2" data-secret="YtCYcxfct2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lanzone&#8217;s tenure at Tinder was just 14 months, short-lived but perhaps in keeping with an app optimised for speed and casually meeting people? Before that, he spent years running CBS Interactive, among other roles in media, and specifically digital media, including dabbling in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/tc50-backstage-is-jim-lanzone-a-jerk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founding digital media startups</a>, such as this online video guide that launched at TechCrunch Disrupt many years ago (that company, Clicker, was acquired by CBS, which is how he came eventually to run CBS Interactive). Prior to that he worked at IAC, the company that originally incubated and launched Tinder.</p>
<p>“Jim has a remarkable track record of leading and growing innovative businesses in our industry, and we are thrilled to welcome him on board. With his experience and proven management skills, we are confident Jim is the right leader to steward Yahoo through a transformational new phase that can leverage the best of Yahoo’s platform and performance to reach new heights,” said Yahoo Chairman and Apollo Partner Reed Rayman, in a statement. “We also want to thank Guru for his significant contributions to the company, passing the baton following three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity as an advisor to Apollo.”</p>
<p>Nyborg is young but has a very long track record in tech &#8212; and another disclaimer, she&#8217;s a friend of mine &#8212; which includes time at Headspace, working at Apple across different roles in subscriptions and developer relations, building her own startups and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Her connection to Tinder is a professional and personal one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swiped right on my husband and it changed my life,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;Being CEO of this company is a truly humbling and extraordinary opportunity; to make that happen for the next generation of singles around the world. The Tinder team is – hands down – the most innovative and inspiring group I&#8217;ve ever worked with. We are building the most fun, inclusive, safest place for singles to connect. And you can see this evolution on our app. We&#8217;re building the technology and raising the bar for the industry along with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two big changes leave a lot of question marks in the air for both companies. For Yahoo, many will be wondering how and if Apollo longer-term plans to try to continue running the organization as a cohesive whole, or whether it will sell it for parts, as is sometimes the tendency with private equity houses. The appointment of Lanzone implies that there could be a bigger view to building the business into a more profitable operation as-is with a media and content face at the front of it. Or at least tighten it up to make it more attractive to other digital media conglomerates.</p>
<p>For Tinder, appointing a woman to the top job is a major move to give the app a more human face after years of controversy behind it and one of its co-founders, Whitney Wolfe-Herd, who eventually left and built Bumble &#8212; a more female-friendly dating app &#8212; to take Tinder head-on.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The uproar that arose after Dolly Parton <a href="https://timesofe.com/friday-roundup-side-hustle-collision-open-season-on-the-vaccine-and-future-of-digital-banking/">rewrote the lyrics to &#8220;9 to 5&#8221;</a> for a Squarespace Super Bowl commercial revealed a problem with the English language: A worker is no longer a worker.</p>
<p>As she sang in celebration of entrepreneurs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Working 5 to 9<br />
you’ve got passion and a vision<br />
&#8216;Cause it’s hustlin’ time<br />
a whole new way to makе a livin’<br />
Gonna change your life<br />
do something that givеs it meaning …</p></blockquote>
<p>Some criticized it, saying it celebrated an “empty promise” of capitalism, as if people aiming to establish their own businesses were “workers” who needed to be protected from powerful corporations. Others grasped that there is more nuance in our economy than ever before and that, perhaps, Parton was on to something.</p>
<p>In fact, her updated lyrics represent a shift in the primacy between capital and labor in the 40 years since she penned the original. Gone is the idea that getting ahead is only a “rich man’s game … puttin’ money in his wallet.” Workers today have a different potential than they did in 1980 when she first sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a better life<br />
And you think about it, don&#8217;t you?<br />
It&#8217;s a rich man&#8217;s game<br />
No matter what they call it,<br />
And you spend your life<br />
Puttin&#8217; money in his wallet.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are abusive corporations, and we do need a better social safety net so that people aren’t at the mercy of the doctrine of shareholder primacy, but that truth disguises a more complicated reality. The divide between capital and labor increasingly looks like an anachronism, a throwback to the language and illusory simplicity of another time. Yet still, the media persists in pushing this false dichotomy; this mistaken idea that labor and capital are two separate and oppositional forces in our economy. Perhaps doing so is human nature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Or perhaps it simply sells more newspapers or generates more clicks. The media certainly thrives on conflict (real or imaginary) and, along with human nature to try to group things into black and white, the continued framing of our economy as somehow consisting of individual actors who exist solely on one side of the capital/labor line makes for easier narratives.</p>
<p>The truth of this aspect of our economy, as with most things, exists in the gray areas. In the nuance and the movement between groups. The U.S. economy has always been uniquely entrepreneurial, from the discovery of the “new land” to the formation of our government to the expansion of our country and eventually its industrialization. Entrepreneurs have long led the way. Today, nearly 60 million people are entrepreneurial in some way.</p>
<p>The vast majority inhabit the frontlines of the economy. They are freelancers or the late-night business starters that Parton sang about. They are freelancing on the side to earn money to support some other dream, or are stitching together lives for themselves by being their own boss. They’re driving Ubers, delivering meals for GrubHub and selling their crafts on Etsy. Never have more people had more access to expand their horizons through pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams than right now. And they exist in the world of technology, where a single person at a kitchen table has the same power to bring an innovation to market as giant corporations did four decades ago.</p>
<p>Victor Hwang, CEO of Right to Start and a former vice president of entrepreneurship for the Kauffman Foundation, described the capital-versus-labor debate as “the biggest false narrative out there. It’s an artificial narrative that we’ve created: employer versus employee; big versus small; corporation versus worker. All are false narratives and contribute to the incorrect notion that the most important fight in our economy exists between these supposedly oppositional forces.”</p>
<p>But our economic and government funding debates are framed, often by the media, around the idea of capitalism versus socialism, corporations versus workers. That increasingly divisive conversation has some of the hallmarks of a deliberately engineered division, like the ones over climate change or gun rights. Right-wing groups with an interest in freezing the government into inaction figured out how to divide the country into two groups and get them fighting.</p>
<p>Why don’t we have universal health care, parental leave, working infrastructure — all things that would, not incidentally, boost entrepreneurship and small business? We’ve been too busy fighting about a socialist takeover and the evils of capitalism.</p>
<p>The conflict thrives in part because we don’t have the right language to describe what’s happening now: “These debates should be viewed as part of a larger discussion,” Hwang said. “We should be striving to encourage highly innovative people and companies. What are the categories we need to develop? How do you classify someone’s role in the economy?”</p>
<p>What we need as an economy is a system that empowers more people to be producers and entrepreneurs. To solve problems and look for opportunities to create change in their communities. Instead, we’ve built a system that supports incumbents; that thrives on the status quo; that stifles innovation and uses the tactics of division to do so. It’s a tension that stems from our neoliberal worldview that achieved an almost consensus in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>
<p>Beyond just arguing that free markets and open trade make it easier and better to do business (which we generally agree with), it also implied that the only thing that mattered in our economy was making big companies bigger (while, perhaps, allowing for the occasional upstart &#8212; but only those that had the potential to grow quickly and become big companies themselves). Lost was the value of smaller businesses, operating in the in-between spaces in our economy. We don’t even effectively measure their impact.</p>
<p>Wanting to know how the “economy” is doing, we look no further than the fate of the 500 largest publicly traded companies (the S&amp;P 500) or the 30 massive businesses that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average. No wonder people across Main Streets are scratching their heads as pundits describe the economy as thriving by citing the continued rise of the Dow when they can see the millions of small businesses closing all around them.</p>
<p>In our book, &#8220;<a href="https://thenewbuilders.com/"><u>The New Builders</u></a>,&#8221; we describe entrepreneurs as “builders.” Builder is a word with Old English roots in the ideas “to be, exist, grow,” according to the Online Dictionary of Etymology. In a century where change is the lingua franca, builders own the value of their own labor as a mechanism to build independence and, eventually, capital.</p>
<p>We often forget that the majority of these builders &#8212; the small business owners of America &#8212; create opportunities with the most limited resources. According to the Kauffman Foundation, 83% of businesses are formed without the help of either bank financing or venture capital. Yet small businesses are responsible for nearly 40% of U.S. GDP and nearly half of employment. Perhaps that’s why International Economy publisher David Smick termed them “the great equalizer” in his book of the same name.</p>
<p>Technology has fundamentally changed the landscape for businesses of all sizes and has the potential to enable a resurgence of our small business economy. Rather than pushing a false narrative that individuals need to choose between being a part of the labor or capital economies, we should be encouraging fluidity between the two. The more capital ownership we encourage &#8212; through savings, investment in their own businesses, and by allowing more and more people to become investors of all kinds &#8212; the more we drive wealth creation and open economic activity for generations to come.</p>
