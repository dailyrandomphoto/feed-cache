										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2009, <a href="https://intellihot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intellihot</a> has been on a mission to make commercial buildings more efficient, by improving the cost and physical footprint of keeping building H<sub>2</sub>O nice and toasty. The company just announced it raised $50 million to shake up the $81 billionn global HVAC market, with plans to expand internationally. The round was led by <span style="font-weight: 400;">investors </span><a href="https://www.aegonam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegon Asset Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.avenuecapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>When you walk into an office building, you see security guards, fancy company plaques on the walls and, around this time of year, you may see a Christmas tree or two. What you don&#8217;t see is what happens deep in the bowels of a building, and if you&#8217;ve never paused to think about the vast amount of magic that happens under the floors, in the walls and along the ceilings of a building, you&#8217;ve probably not thought about what an incredibly complex creature a modern office building can be. Apart from the immediately obvious &#8212; electricity, internet and an endless and deeply necessary supply of caffeinated hot beverages &#8212; buildings need hot water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paradoxically, hot water access is everywhere, necessary and yet easy to overlook — until you don’t have it anymore. Intellihot has recognized the enormous opportunity at hand to integrate hardware and software into a smart, environmentally sustainable solution to improve how commercial facilities use hot water,&#8221; said John Larkin, head of Impact Investments and co-manager of the Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund. &#8220;Intellihot reflects well upon our strategy to partner with great businesses that can deliver financial performance along with beneficial outcomes for society and planet.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Larkin points out, if the hot water stops flowing, things very quickly get unpleasant. The challenge with hot water is that usage is incredibly time-specific. If the building has apartments or gyms in it, 7 am is a huge peak, and if the hot water runs out, the building managers&#8217; phones won&#8217;t stop ringing. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also painfully expensive to heat water and to keep it hot, especially at times where hot water usage is lower than usual. Intellihot is addressing all of the above, using tankless, on-demand water heating solutions for a wide range of commercial buildings, including hotels, restaurants, stadiums, hospitals and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, truly we started it as outsiders, with no connection to the industry. I am passionate about energy loss; every time I see the radiator or a tailpipe on a car, I know that its singular purpose is to heat the environment,&#8221; explains Sridhar Deivasigamani, founder and CEO of Intellihot. &#8220;I felt the same thing when a water heater broke at my house. And since then, we have totally reinvented how water is heated and delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lot of applications, having a large tank of water means that hot water is instantly available while more water is being heated up. That&#8217;s convenient and serves as a buffer, but it is also spectacularly expensive to keep a large tank of water at temperature. In residential homes, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/water-heaters/tankless-water-heaters-vs-storage-tank-water-heaters-a5291982593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports is seeing an increase</a> in the popularity of tankless, on-demand water heaters, but for commercial buildings, the adaptation has significantly lagged behind. One of the biggest challenges in this space is that a lot of planning and engineering goes into building and upgrading medium to large commercial buildings. When the buildings are designed, the space allocated to hot water is typically designed for water tanks &#8212; which have an 80% larger footprint than Intellihot&#8217;s heaters. Once the space is there, and the energy cost of heating the water is calculated into the overall energy expenditure of the building, there hasn&#8217;t traditionally been much incentive to switch to a tankless solution &#8212; but that is very slowly starting to shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the first new startup in this space in almost 100 years,&#8221; claims Deivasigamani. &#8220;If you look at the big three companies in this space, they all started in the late 1800s. So you have generations and generations of builders, building engineers and contractors thinking this is the only way it can be done.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the incumbents are also starting to produce tankless heaters, but Intellihot believes it has an edge in the approach it takes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equipment always breaks down on a Friday night, and 90% of equipment is replaced when there is an emergency. That&#8217;s not ideal. If you&#8217;re a Chipotle or Starbucks, the solution today is to double up the number of equipment they have. That&#8217;s not great for the environment. We have an alternate approach: we launched a piece of equipment that is called <a href="https://intellihot.com/products-commercial-tankless-hot-water-heater-type-gas/tellibot-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tellibot AI</a>,&#8221; explains Deivasigamani. The equipment connects to water heaters to gather data based on flow, heating patterns, etc. You install it for 10 days, and the company will analyze the data and give you a projection for how long the existing equipment will continue to perform. The goal is to give building owners a chance to replace water heaters as scheduled maintenance, rather than at the worst possible time, at exorbitant 24-hour-call-out rates.</p>
<p>Intellihot has its equipment installed &#8220;in thousands of buildings,&#8221; its CEO told me, including hotels, multi-family residential buildings, senior living facilities, hospitals and more. The company claims it has logged more than 670 million hours of operation without failures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The aggregator model has proved to be very successful in Latin America as the e-commerce market explodes in the region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new company is entering the crowded e-commerce aggregator space to acquire and scale high-performing Latin American brands selling on MercadoLibre, Shopify or Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://quinio.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinio</a>, a Mexico-based company, announced today it secured $20 million in a debt-and-equity round that will be used to add more than 30 brands to its portfolio.</p>
<p>The company was founded last year by Juan Gavito, Iker Garay and Gavito’s brother, Santiago Gavito. CEO Juan Gavito, who was previously in digital advertising, and Garay have backgrounds in private equity and venture capital, while Santiago Gavito was scaling startups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Iker introduced us to Thrasio’s business model and we got excited,” Juan Gavito told TechCrunch. “We thought this is the way to capture value, so we started working on everything from creating the pipeline, team, tools and understanding the specifics of doing the acquisition.”</p>
<p>Quinio isn’t focused on any certain categories, but is going after medium-sized brands that bring in between $100,000 and $20 million in annual revenue. After acquisition, the Quinio team focuses on increasing sales, operations efficiency and optimizing cost structures.</p>
<p>The company will kick off the new year with 10 brands representing $10 million revenue run rate. That has enabled Quinio to realize double-digit growth each month so far. And although the company is initially looking at acquiring 30 brands, Gavito estimates there are 100,000 sellers across Latin America that fit its strategy among a market worth $105 billion.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Cometa, which was joined by AlleyCorp, DILA Capital, Western Technology Investment, GBM Ventures, Bridge Partners and a group of entrepreneurs, including Adalberto Flores, founder and CEO of Kueski.</p>
<p>Juan Gavito expects to use over 80% of the new capital on acquiring companies, with a plan of one per month. The company will also expand its staff — at 33 people today — to over 100 by the end of next year as it begins looking for brands outside of Mexico in Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the new funding, Quinio joins a long list of aggregators, also known as e-commerce roll-ups, around the world that have also attracted investor attention to purchase marketplace companies.</p>
<p>For example, Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a> this week. Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Juan Gavito says the e-commerce aggregator model has proved to be very successful in Latin America, with a few initial players launching operations between January and August of this year, all in Mexico.</p>
<p>He notes this is due to the region being one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in the world, citing a gross merchandise value growth of over 60% in 2020, to $105 billion, which represents double the growth rate initially expected before the global pandemic hit. E-commerce is expected to grow another 30% this year, Juan Gavito said.</p>
<p>One of the ways Quinio is differentiating itself is by acquiring companies with locally sourced products, with plans to have more than 60% of its portfolio this way.</p>
<p>“This is a key differential in terms of lead times and working capital requirements, especially considering the problems that the current Asia supply chain is facing,” Juan Gavito said. “There are just a few players in such a large market, so there is opportunity for all of us to have successful companies and business models. For example, in the U.S., there are more than 20, and many are successful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce roll-up play <a href="https://www.opontia.com/">Opontia</a> launched in June, raising $20 million in debt and equity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> older, small e-commerce brands in the Middle East and Africa. Today, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has closed a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round, a $42 million Series A nine months after it was founded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll-up plays are generally known to secure more debt than equity when they raise mega-round deals. Opontia&#8217;s seed round was the case, but the share between equity and venture debt stands at about 50% each for its Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STV led the round, with Raed Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Upper90 and VentureSouq participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Angel investors Salman Butt of Salla and Wiktor Namysl of McKinsey Poland joined, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture debt fund Partners for Growth funded Opontia&#8217;s debt financing.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243468" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch gathered that Opontia has somewhat switched focus on its target market. Though it launched with eyes on the Middle East and Africa, the company has only made efforts in some parts of the former (the UAE and Saudi Arabia) while making significant headway into Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Turkey and Poland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is opportunity there; it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not the biggest markets,&#8221; co-founder and co-CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnstonphilip/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Johnston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said when asked why Opontia wasn&#8217;t in Africa yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Poland is six times the size of Egypt, for example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e-commerce spend. We&#8217;re definitely going to Africa; we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are doing the biggest markets first. So if you have to prioritize, you go for the market that&#8217;s the biggest and then you work your way down. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the biggest markets for us, it&#8217;s Poland, Turkey, Saudi, UAE, Nigeria, after that is Egypt and Pakistan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has a slight operational and geographical difference, though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Opontia founders, while Thrasio, Berlin Brands, Branded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Western Europe, Opontia has found an opening in targeting brands in East and Central Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, none of these players except Opontia is active in the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike the more prominent players, Opontia pursues an omnichannel model instead of a singular model targeting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;FBA&#8221; &#8212; fullfillment by Amazon &#8212; businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when one of our unique values is we are building like a house of brands on our omnichannel setup. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So compared to Thrasio, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on FBA, we focus on three different sales channels &#8212; marketplaces, website, Shopify and social commerce,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; co-founder and co-CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manfredmeyer82/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manfred Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So our acquisitions are now like 50% marketplace, but 50% marketplace and Shopify. What we&#8217;re doing is like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like building a setup where you can serve all the customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not only on the Amazon marketplace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/opontia-raises-20m-to-roll-up-e-commerce-brands-in-africa-and-the-middle-east/">spoke to TechCrunch</a> in June, they mentioned that Opontia was in talks with &#8220;more than 100 small e-commerce brands&#8221; and claimed to have signed several term sheets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, it has purchased four brands, including Novimed, a UAE-based direct-to-consumer outfit that sells medical equipment and therapeutic products.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And since acquiring Novimed in August, Opontia said it has quadrupled the brand&#8217;s revenues and doubled its profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Opontia exists because we realized that there are many e-commerce entrepreneurs in CEEMEA who have grown their brands to a certain point but now need help to take it to the next level,&#8221; the founders said in an email response on why brands see getting acquired by Opontia as a viable option</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We give the founder an attractive exit, while also giving them a share in the future growth in the profit of the brand as we scale them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it wants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 20 more brands across Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East in six months. J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ohnston said at least two-thirds of the Series A investment, about $30 million, will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to carry out these acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has also hired a former executive at Jumia Kenya as its VP of operations, who will be responsible for the company&#8217;s efforts in Africa as it hopes to establish offices in Egypt and Nigeria, in addition to those in Istanbul, Warsaw, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://minlyapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a MENA-based media and entertainment startup, announced today that it has acquired <a href="https://www.oulo.com/">Oulo</a>, a Dubai-based celebrity shoutout platform, for an undisclosed fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition is coming six months after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a $3.6 million seed round and off the back of an impressive year of growth that saw the platform &#8212; which connects fans with athletes, musicians and stars through personalized experiences &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 130,000 users and 1,000 celebrities in over a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oulo, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a video gifting platform with more than 300 celebrities across Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 by Kamal Nazha.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merged business will operate under the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brand and roll out its combined experience offerings across the GCC region. And as part of the transaction, Nazha will join </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the chief commercial officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 450 million people in the MENA region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One out of three are between the ages of 18 to 30 &#8212; a group with a deep connection to social media and fast contributing more to the global creator economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is optimizing its solution to capture a budding audience in the MENA region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO</span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/shinnawy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamed El-Shinnawy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spoke to TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/egypts-minly-raises-3-6m-to-connect-celebrities-and-fans-through-personalized-experiences/">in June</a>, he mentioned that the company was doubling down on building local celebrity acquisition teams across MENA and the GCC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One wouldn&#8217;t have interpreted his statement as an expansion rather than a literal acquisition play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whilst Minly&#8217;s expansion in the GCC market was possible without Oulo, this acquisition has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerated our expansion there,&#8221; El-Shinnawy said when asked why the company acquired Oulu instead of expanding on its own. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to become the number one creator economy platform in the region, and speed to market is critical to achieving this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stated that the acquisition adds critical assets to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; Oulo&#8217;s roster of tier-1 pan-Arab Levantian stars, its strategic partnerships and team who can support Minly&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> existing team, both in the Levant and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the majority of pan-Arab celebrities were either Egyptian or Lebanese. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, combining forces unlocks immense synergies as, together, we dominate the two most important sources of cultural content,&#8221; said Nazha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that following the acquisition, the company&#8217;s primary objectives are to launch new complementary products, deepen its roster of stars and grow its geographic reach via an increased presence in other MENA and Arabic-speaking countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are the clear choice for stars in the region looking to create unforgettable, authentic digital experiences with fans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This acquisition will widen the gap, as the Oulo team shares the same mission and passion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minly-Oulo deal is the second major acquisition between an African and a GCC-based startup this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A month ago, Meddy, a Qatar-based doctor booking startup, was acquired by Nigerian health tech startup Helium Health in an undisclosed deal that saw Meddy services folded into its parent company&#8217;s digital healthcare ecosystem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gradual return of tourism and travel in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to see a wave of startups raising rounds of funding to meet new opportunities in the market. In the latest development, <a href="https://easol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easol</a>, which has built event and experiences software that third-party companies can use to market and sell bookings &#8212; it includes a website builder, reservation and booking tools, and payment plug-ins &#8212; has picked up $25 million, a Series A that it will be using to continue building out its software stack, with a view to being a one-stop shop for experiences organizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we enable [organizers] to sell events, but we don’t give them distribution,&#8221; said CEO Ben Simpson, who co-founded the London-based startup with his wife Lisa. &#8220;We see that as a major opportunity, giving creators the chance to get inventory from elsewhere and push theirs out to other places.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has seen some strong growth in the last year, after a period in which Simpson said it had zero revenue due to travel and gathering restrictions in 2020. Since closing a seed round of $4.5 million that year, it has grown the number of organizers (which Easol calls &#8220;creators&#8221;) tenfold, with the customer base up 913%, transaction numbers up 50x, and spend on the platform up by 30x. It has set ambitious targets to treble its growth in 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its software is used across some 130 countries, although the majority of the consumers engaging in the events themselves are based out of North America and Europe, Simpson said.</p>
<p>Those are scaling and traction numbers that catch the attention of VCs, and this latest round is has some of the biggies. Tiger Global is leading the Series A, with participation also from previous backers Notion Capital, Foundation Capital, Y Combinator (Easol was in the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/easol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S18 batch</a>) and FMZ Ventures &#8212; which is led by Michael Zeisser, the former Chairman of US investments at Alibaba. (Zeisser is also joining the board.)</p>
<p>Travel and tourism startups definitely shaped up to be some of the biggest pity cases during the pandemic: through no mishandling of their own, some of the most promising founders and companies found themselves suddenly in freefall when their customers &#8212; and depending on the business model, the customers of their customers &#8212; simply stopped moving around and doing things. That vacuum however also led to some very interesting pivots and efforts to find business in completely new places.</p>
<p>Peek, one of Easol&#8217;s competitors in the experiences management space &#8212; went from focusing mainly on its own experiences marketplace and turned to providing more and better tools and wider guidance to their events management customers. It too recently raised a significant round of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million just last month</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Easol might look quite a lot like Peek on the front end, however, the ethos behind what it&#8217;s doing is very different. The Simpsons came to founding the startup having previously been on the event organizing side of the equation, starting and running events like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise</a> &#8211; a massive ski/clubbing/music confab in the French Alps. Ben said that building and running that raised a ton of organizational issues specifically when it came to IT.</p>
<p class="p1">The festival not only sells tickets to events, but it manages lift passes and a range of different accomodation options, as well as a variety of ski experiences and equipment hire. &#8220;We had to run the whole thing through five different platforms,&#8221; he recalled, &#8220;which also meant a number of separate transaction fees. They had all that power on their side.&#8221; So they came up with a plan. &#8220;What if we build and ran all of that, and didn&#8217;t charge ridiculous fees but built it around a subscription model with smaller fees? Then creators could customize the journey end to end, and keep the experience all in one place, and invest in their own growth.&#8221; (Currently, the <a href="https://easol.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing model</a> is based on three tiers depending on the level of service, at £5/month, £54/month or £207/month offering a variety of different features and a commission scale that changes depending on how much you pay per month.)<b></b></p>
<p>All this is sufficiently specialized enough, Lisa added, that they didn&#8217;t feel it really existed in the complex way that experience creators needed it to. She said they thus refer to the category with a distinct term: &#8220;experience commerce.&#8221; They left Rise, which became a customer, with other current users including Wanderlust, Ibiza Rocks, Global Cycle Network, Untravelled Paths and Envision Festival.</p>
<p>The returns are what have made the pitch compelling to these companies: Easol claims that for an event with a $2 million turnover, using Easol&#8217;s software instead of a mix of third-party tools works out to more than $80,000 of savings annually.</p>
<p>“Easol’s market-leading platform and industry expertise allows clients to imagine and market unique experiences for consumers,&#8221; said Evan Feinberg of Tiger Global in a statement. &#8220;In the rapidly expanding experience commerce market, we believe Easol is poised to capture outsized growth, and we are excited to partner with Ben, Lisa and the Easol team.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/d46570d1b23448a6c8d2251e26f99102bc1d47bf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bento.africa%2F&amp;userId=1725294&amp;signature=bc5b84af3f271644">Bento</a>, Nigeria’s digital payroll and human resource management platform is expanding to Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda with plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa over the next one year.</p>
<p>In its next phase of expansion, Bento is eyeing Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola and Ethiopia by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Bento is tapping the payroll and HR management market in Africa that has traditionally relied on laborious analog processes to disburse pay. The startup, founded in 2019, is helping businesses to automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances including taxes and pension.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244703" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Seeing so many companies using analogue methods to manage their workforce is both frustrating and exciting for us. Employers don’t have access to locally customized, world-class payroll and HRM tools, and employees can’t easily access third-party services to help make life easier. When you think about it, your salary powers your life, so we’re building the operating system that will have a profound impact on the African continent for generations to come,” said Bento co-founder and CEO, Ebun Okubanjo.</p>
<p>Bento said that its platform is leveraging data to extend credit solutions to third parties (employees) and other services like unemployment insurance, savings and investments.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s proprietary credit engine, built in partnership with Israel’s Tarya, ensures the disbursement of instant loans.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Bento currently serves over 900 businesses including healthcare and financial service companies such as Hygeia and Tangerine Africa, and Y Combinator-backed startups Paystack, Kobo360, Branch and LORI Systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re starting with payroll and HRM, but moving rapidly towards Salary 2.0, where we redefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent,” said Bento’s other co-founder and COO, Chidozie David Okonkwo.</p>
<p>“Having successfully established product-market fit in Nigeria, one of the most difficult markets to penetrate in Africa, we’re excited to roll out across the continent and solve the real problems we know millions of employers and employees face on a daily basis,” said Okonkwo.</p>
<p>Bento’s expansion comes about a month after Workpay, a Nairobi-based payroll and HR management startup, expanded to Nigeria to tap small medium sized businesses in the West African region. Workpay, a Y Combinator startup, is among the 50 enterprises in Africa that received equity-free funding and support from Google. Workpay said its platform makes it possible for companies to pay in 15 currencies across Africa and to hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity. Its platform currently supports 400 businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cinetpay.com/">CinetPay</a>, a payment gateway that allows e-merchants and merchants to accept mobile money and other forms of payments in Francophone Africa, has secured $2.4 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital fund 4DX Ventures and unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> are the investors in the round, and it signifies two particular markers for the pair. CinetPay is their first investment in the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CinetPay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ci.linkedin.com/in/idrissmarcialmonthe&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiot9647tP0AhVTiP0HHVYLBzsQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Pq3P2OHcp2ZVjPdDspjZi"> Idriss Monthe</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ci.linkedin.com/in/daniel-dindji-7a1418122&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjurMG-7tP0AhWpgv0HHZRkCwMQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3b8c27f9Pi3ghM6LAnXa-a">Daniel Dindji </a></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in 2016 after CEO Monthe experienced issues collecting payments at his previous startup, CinetCore, a site specializing in the sale of online domain names.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we launched our website to sell domain names online, we faced difficulty in collecting online payment after creating many PayPal accounts which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were blocked by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PayPal because we were in Africa,&#8221; the CEO told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the cost that we make is that in Francophone Africa 80% of the population have a mobile money account. And between 10 and 20% of people have a bank account and credit cards. We decided to explore the tract of mobile money and create a payment gateway, where we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all mobile money available in Francophone Africa to enable merchants to accept online payments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ivorian startup acts as an online and point-of-sale payment solution for merchants to process payment from more than 130 different payment operators &#8212; mobile-money, bank cards, wallets &#8212; in nine French-speaking African countries: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Congo, Guinea and Benin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, merchants have to open an account and then upload their KYC, integrate Cinet&#8217;s APIs and start collecting payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each merchant pays an annual subscription fee of $20 a year and Cinet collects 1-1.5% commission on every transaction made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244715" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244715" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244715" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244715" class="wp-caption-text">CinetPay team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants on the platform range from e-commerce platforms and digital public services to insurance companies and schools. Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 12,000 merchants have registered on the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Monthe admits that only 400 of them are active. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why the company had a poor retention rate, he said most active merchants have opened several accounts in the past before sticking with one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also possible that CinetPay&#8217;s numbers are a reflection of the presence of bigger payments gateways such as MFS Africa and PawaPay that target sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s 562 million registered mobile money accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company has done fine in its own right. So far, it has processed more than 30 million transactions for these 400 active merchants, processing about $12.5 million in transactions monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been tracking the Francophone Africa market for some time now, and have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CinetPay’s ambitious goal to digitize payments across the region,” said Walter Baddoo, co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures. “We look forward to partnering with the CinetPay team alongside our long-time portfolio company, Flutterwave, to help usher in the next phase of digital payments across the Francophone region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave&#8217;s involvement in the round is a continuation of the unicorn&#8217;s partnership with CinetPay that started in 2019, said both companies in a statement. It is also a diversification from the mobile money moves Flutterwave has made recently where it signed a partnership with MTN to allow businesses in select countries to receive MTN mobile money (MoMo) via the gateway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga &#8220;GB&#8221; Agboola said the investment in CinetPay is an example of the duo&#8217;s shared vision to &#8220;simplify payments on the continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CinetPay said the seed investment gives it the opportunity to boost its sales and marketing efforts across the markets in West and Central Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthe maintained that despite the company&#8217;s size being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smaller to that of its competitors, its geographical presence, technology and mission to &#8220;simplify payment and make it accessible via all channels&#8221; makes it different from other players. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the plan is to be the foremost payment gateway in the next four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our vision is to be the first payment aggregator in Francophone Africa by 2025. First </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our geographical presence in 15 countries in Francophone Africa. First </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovation, first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market share,&#8221; he remarked in a grandiose manner.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s has acquired the Austria-headquartered startup GeoGebra, the latest in a series of purchases by the Indian edtech giant this year as it scales its online learning platform across the globe.</p>
<p>Neither of the firms disclosed the purchase price, but a source familiar with the matter said the deal size is about $100 million and includes both cash and stock. Byju’s declined to comment.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/?lang=en">GeoGebra</a> operates an interactive and collaborative mathematics learning tool and reaches over 100 million students across more than 195 countries and territories. The platform offers its service to both enterprises as well as philanthropic non-profit organisation, the latter of which accesses GeoGebra at no charge. Byju&#8217;s said GeoGebra&#8217;s current apps and web services will continue to be available for free post the acquisition.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244707" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;GeoGebra was born out of a passion to help students learn math in a visually appealing and engaging manner. Our shared passion for learning and teaching resonates with BYJU’S, making them a perfect partner for our onward journey. I am confident that this partnership will help millions of students learn mathematics in an interactive way, in turn making them overcome their fear of math and learn to master it,&#8221; said Markus Hohenwarter, co-founder of GeoGebra, in a statement.</p>
<p>Byju’s said the GeoGebra acquisition “complements” its product strategy. The most valuable Indian startup will integrate GeoGebra’s offerings with its products to make “math more engaging” for its students.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GeoGebra team has built a powerful and stimulating platform that complements BYJU’S mission of providing impactful learning for students. Designed to improve mathematical understanding, it offers significant features that provide interactive resources that adapt to every child’s style and pace of learning,” said Anita Kishore, Chief Strategy Officer of Byju’s, in a statement.</p>
<p>“At Byju&#8217;s, with the help of innovative teaching and technology, we have been making Math fun, visual, and engaging. And with GeoGebra on board, we will continue to further enhance, reimagine and transform the way Math is taught and learned. Together with our combined strengths, we will have a wider reach and the best resources to build innovative and exciting next-generation learning formats,” she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GeoGebra is the latest in a series of about 10 purchases Byju&#8217;s has made this year as it looks to fill the whitespaces in its offerings. The Bangalore-headquartered startup has this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/">acquired Tynker</a>, Scholr, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash Institute</a>, Hashlearn, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">Epic</a>, Great Learning, and Gradeup among others for over $2 billion in cash and equity deals.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive of Byju’s, told TechCrunch in an earlier interview that the firm is still looking for more merger and acquisition opportunities. In the meantime, Byju&#8217;s is also exploring an initial public offering as soon as next year. TechCrunch first reported that some bankers including Morgan Stanley have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">pitched a $50 billion valuation to Byju&#8217;s</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, at the start of the fintech services boom in Africa, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oblantern/?originalSubdomain=uk">Oliver Blantern</a> got an opportunity to work in the continent offering advisory services to high-growth startups.

<p>Impact Rooms offers well-rounded solutions for startup problems, from ensuring that they are investor-ready and are matched with the right investors, to raising capital. To be investor-ready means that the startups have strong financial models, are sourcing the right kind of human capital, and comply with regulations.</p>
<p>Blantern said the Impact Rooms is also using data to help investors make decisions on which countries, industries or startups to invest in – giving an equal opportunity to startups across all markets in Africa.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage a high percentage of capital into regions outside the four main markets (South Africa, Kenya, Egypt and Nigeria) as much as we can. We want to encourage capital into African women-led businesses, and to support a high number of existing local and global investors to invest more capital in this market,” Impact Room CEO and founder Blantern told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On Impact Rooms, startups also get access to a diverse range of services, including legal and marketing support, from the platform’s other partners. Impact Rooms is backed by US-based investment group Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/world-mobile-group-bringing-zanzibaris-online-through-mobile-network-built-on-blockchain/">Blockchain</a> Ventures (GBV).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our job is to support startups and help them all the way to maturity. We conduct company evaluations through investor-readiness support and offer introductions to relevant service partners, and then support with capital raising.”</p>
<p>The Impact Rooms team is currently spread across the world with some of its experts in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">Kenya</a>, Zambia, Ghana, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Australia, US, UK and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Blantern said that the startup has also built a database to provide insights on how investors are making investment decisions.</p>
<p>“It is the most comprehensive and intelligent investor database for Africa, and it allows us to understand why some companies raise capital and others don’t, as well as to improve their chances in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>Impact Rooms uses its proprietary algorithm, Cortex, to conduct company evaluations and in valuation benchmarking to understand trends.</p>
<p>The startup is planning to establish Smart Fund, an investor-matching program that uses algorithms to pick the best opportunities for funders. The fund will bring together investors with shared interests from across the world to expand their investment prospects in Africa.</p>
<p>“We work and partner with investors, incubators, companies, and all kinds of ecosystem players, including financial service providers &#8211;we are not a competitor. We are here to work with everyone in this ecosystem,” he said.</p>
<p>Impact Rooms is currently working with 14 startups from six countries across Africa, spanning different specialties from e-commerce to blockchain-based communications. The supported startups include Ghana’s Wala Digital Health, a SaaS Software connecting hospitals and donors for critical blood transfusions.</p>
<p>The startup has so far evaluated 85 companies and by the end of next year, it hopes to work with 5,000 companies across the continent and to directly, or indirectly create an additional 10,000 jobs. This in addition to helping 1,000 startups raise funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jin Stedge studied aerospace engineering at MIT, but after she found herself at Scotty Labs, an SRI International spin-out focused on autonomous driving, she says she came to appreciate how far away the tech is from large-scale adoption.</p>
<p>Indeed, when Scotty was acquired by DoorDash in the summer of 2019, she teamed up with Sanjaya Wijeratnebut, a colleague and senior software engineer at Scotty Labs, and they got to work on a more ruthlessly practical challenge: empowering truck drivers to run their current businesses more efficiently.</p>
<p>For Stedge, it was largely personal. Her  grandparents were owner operators who acquired up to six trucks in the 1980s; her uncles and cousins later entered the business, too, she says. Armed with their insights, she knew the daily difficulties that independent truckers endure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244679" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She also knew that predictions by AI experts who said truck drivers would be out of work <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-experts-predict-the-future-truck-drivers-out-of-jobs-by-2027-surgeons-by-2053/">by 2027</a> were flat wrong. &#8220;If you think about what long-haul truckers do,&#8221; says Stedge, &#8220;they go over the Rockies, they have to tarp freight to the back of their trucks, they&#8217;re often without cell service for hours at a time &#8212; that kind of environment is just really hard to automate.&#8221;</p>
<p>It helped, of course, that the market they&#8217;d be chasing is enormous. It&#8217;s no coincidence that so many startups have flocked to address different aspects of the trucking industry, from brokers and load marketplaces to outfits that help with cash flow, make equipment, provide insurance or make compliance products.</p>
<p>In fact, the opportunity that Stedge and Wijeratnebut spied with their startup, <a href="https://www.truenorthfleet.com/">TrueNorth</a>, was to create a single, easy-to-use platform to help truckers manage their customers; find, book, and coordinate loads; optimize their routes; invoice their customers; and collect payment. It would also pay them upon the completion of a job, so drivers wouldn&#8217;t be forced to wait a month or more to be paid, as has long been customary.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bfCQsWOw9s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/">SoftBank-backed Flock Freight is the freight industry&#8217;s newest unicorn</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SoftBank-backed Flock Freight is the freight industry&#8217;s newest unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/embed/#?secret=bfCQsWOw9s" data-secret="bfCQsWOw9s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea, broadly speaking, was for TrueNorth to give the independent truckers who make up somewhere between 10% and 20% of the industry the resources of a larger fleet &#8212; and better economics.</p>
<p>Y Combinator liked the pitch enough to welcome Stedge and Wijeratnebut into its winter 2020 batch. A seed check from Sam Altman quickly followed, then an $8.5 million Series A round led by former Stripe exec Lachy Groom.</p>
<p>Now, Stedge says, the company has just closed on $50 million in Series B funding co-led Groom and Altman (along with brothers Max and Jack). Many others have joined the ride, too, including  Flexport Fund, Tribe Capital, Original Capital, K5 Global, 137 Ventures, and Fifth Down Capital.</p>
<p>TrueNorth has so far raised $61.8 million altogether.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2244694 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg" alt="" width="5998" height="3999" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg 5998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5998px) 100vw, 5998px" /></p>
<p>The question begged is whether TrueNorth, which already employs 50 people &#8212; half of them women, notably &#8212;  can deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>Certainly, the $50 million should help, along with $10 million in working capital that TrueNorth has separately secured from a debt provider. It&#8217;s already using that money to ensure its customers get paid promptly after each job.</p>
<p>The company is also already lowering costs for the roughly 200 truckers already using its software, insists Stedge. She says that just one way it&#8217;s doing this is pooling its customers together and securing lower-cost insurance for the group. (&#8220;An independent trucker who&#8217;s truly on their own will pay $20,000 to $30,000 a year in insurance, which is crazy,&#8221; says Stedge. &#8220;With us, they pay $10,000 a year.&#8221;)</p>
<p>TrueNorth says, too, that it increases drivers&#8217; revenue by helping them find the highest-paying trucking jobs and making it simple to book them.</p>
<p>Still, one outstanding question is how effectively TrueNorth is able to reach its customers, given that it is targeting a very fragmented market. Stedge notes that the company has &#8220;never done outbound sales&#8221; because all of its customers have found the company on their own, and she says that 90% have additionally referred friends. With deeper pocketed rivals, it could need to spin up a more aggressive marketing strategy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One rival in particular would seem to be a threat, and that&#8217;s CloudTrucks, which just two weeks ago closed on </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">$115 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in Series B funding and whose founder, Tobenna Arodiogbu, previously cofounded Scotty Labs, where he was CEO.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qRO7qlnXOF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/embed/#?secret=qRO7qlnXOF" data-secret="qRO7qlnXOF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like TrueNorth, Arodiogbu&#8217;s vision is to help trucking entrepreneurs operate their businesses. As he told TechCrunch in late November, &#8220;Lots of tools are being built for brokers and shippers, but not nearly enough is being done for the truck driver who’s actually doing the really hard work.”</p>
<p>For her part, Stedge sees CloudTruck&#8217;s momentum as a strong signal to truckers and investors alike. &#8220;We serve the same customer, which is independent truckers, [but] I think it&#8217;s good, to be honest,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a humongous market. It&#8217;s a $100 billion market, just in these independent truckers and small fleets. So the more people who are helping owner operations and who are doing that marketing and brand awareness, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stedge is hiring fast, and revenue is starting to add up for the young company, which charges customers between 15% and 18% of all goods they move. (If that seems high, Stedge observes that big fleets often take closer to 40%.) Right now, those drivers are delivering between $30,000 and $50,000 per year per trucker, which puts TrueNorth&#8217;s gross revenue at between $6 million and $10 million. But that&#8217;s up 3.4 times over the last six months alone, and the company is still mostly operating in its first market Dallas, and more newly in Atlanta, says Stedge.</p>
<p>As important, she says: the company has been significantly improving its contribution margin, which is basically the portion of sales that helps to offset its fixed costs. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re growing really fast if there&#8217;s a leaky bucket,&#8221; says Stedge, who could just as well be talking about one of her trucking customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know that you&#8217;re building a business that lasts, and we have been very efficient with our money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few weeks after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/21/lydia-adds-stock-and-crypto-trading-to-its-payment-app/">stock and crypto trading</a>, French fintech startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is announcing that it has raised a $100 million Series C round. With this funding round, the startup has reached a unicorn valuation, which means that it is currently valued at more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Dragoneer and Echo Street are investing in the startup for the first time, and many of Lydia’s existing investors are putting more money on the table, such as Tencent, Accel and Founders Future.</p>
<p>“What’s really impressive with this round is that it is primarily financed by existing investors,” Lydia co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243430" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Times are changing. A few years ago, when a startup chose to raise from its existing investors, it usually meant that the team couldn’t find new investors. So existing investors would accept to put more money in the company in exchange for a lower valuation.</p>
<p>But now, many VC firms have raised huge funds. Hedge funds are now investing in venture rounds. Investing in the most competitive startups have become harder. If a portfolio company is doing well, VC firms now usually want to double down on their previous investment.</p>
<p>And Chiche confirmed that Lydia’s valuation has increased starkly compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/lydia-raises-another-86-million-to-build-european-financial-super-app/">last year’s round</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Lydia was a peer-to-peer payment app. After adding your debit card and your bank details, you could send and receive mobile payments with other Lydia users. It progressively became the dominant mobile payment app in France.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, the app has evolved quite a lot to become a financial super app with a wide range of features and financial products. Users can get a virtual or physical debit card that works on the Visa network. They can also manage their money more easily by creating sub-accounts that they can share with other Lydia users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243434" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243434" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2243434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243434" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lydia</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to daily payments, Lydia also offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/">small loans</a> from €100 to €3,000, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/lydia-partners-with-cashbee-to-add-savings-accounts/" title="Lydia partners with Cashbee to add savings accounts">savings accounts</a>, and now trading. In particular, the new crypto and stock trading partnership with Bitpanda makes it much easier to invest small amounts of money whenever you want.</p>
<p>Lydia and Bitpanda are offering fractional shares so that you can buy, for example, €10 worth of Apple share 24/7 — it’s something quite new for the French market. And given the success of trading in Robinhood and Cash App in the U.S., the new trading feature could represent a big opportunity for the future of the French startup.</p>
<p>By adding more products on top of peer-to-peer payments, Lydia wants to drive engagement. The business model is quite clear. When you’re sending and receiving a handful of payments with the app, everything is free. If you want to go further, the company offers premium subscriptions.</p>
<p>Lydia has attracted 5.5 million users so far. Even more important, a third of French people who are 18 to 35 years old have a Lydia account. In other words, things are going well in France. And the startup now wants to go down the same road in other European countries.</p>
<p>Lydia plans to hire 800 people over the coming three years, including 160 people in 2022 alone. By 2025, the company hopes that 10 million customers in Europe will use Lydia as their primary account.</p>
<p>“What we’re experiencing is the reinvention of the banking industry,” Cyril Chiche told me. According to him, people are not going to manage money the same way in a few years. Some companies will get it while others won’t change.</p>
<p>He doesn’t think it’s a duel between neobanks and incumbents. Some legacy players may have what it takes to stay relevant in the future. But, of course, he truly belies that Lydia can simplify retail banking so that it becomes more accessible to more users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://flip.id/">Flip</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an Indonesia-based fintech startup, announced today it has raised $48 million in a Series B to accelerate its growth. The funding brings Flip’s total capital raised to $65million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sequoia Capital India, Insight Partners and Insignia Ventures Partners co-led the Series B round. Flip is Insight Partners’ first investment in Indonesia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup plans to use the fresh capital to accelerate its business expansion further, strengthen its operations in Indonesia, advance technology and expand its engineering and product teams. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This new funding is a testament to our team’s commitment and persistence. It gives us the resources we need to fuel and accelerate our mission to build innovative solutions that simplify money movement in Indonesia,” said </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arriyan/">Rafi Putra Arriyan</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, co-founder and CEO of Flip. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Arriyan, Luqman Sungkar and Ginanjar Ibnu Solikhin co-founded the company in 2015 while studying at University of Indonesia. They built the Flip platform to find an answer to the problem Arriyan himself experienced as a college student – having to wait for a long time to transfer funds and pay a transfer fee each time to different banks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Indonesia, transferring money can be tedious for bank account holders – from funds getting stuck while transferring to lengthy clerical processes and poor product experiences with outdated interfaces and complicated flow. Flip hopes to change that by helping individuals and businesses to eliminate complexity and execute their money transfer at a low cost. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip, which intends to be the most customer-centric financial technology company in the world, enables users to do fair financial transactions from anywhere to anyone. The startup obtained a license from Bank Indonesia (BI) in 2016 to provide financial services, including interbank transfers to more than 100 domestic banks, international remittances, e-wallet top-ups, salary transfers and business solution products.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said the annual volume of money transfer in Indonesia was recorded at a nominal value of more than </span>$2.2 trillion<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in 2020, citing </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.bi.go.id/id/statistik/ekonomi-keuangan/spip/Default.aspx">Bank Indonesia&#8217;s data</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Interbank transfer is the most dominant payment method in Indonesia’s fast-growing digital economy. Flip has a massive user base and is growing rapidly with outstanding retention metrics, all of which point to the delightful and seamless product that the company has built… Sequoia Capital India believes that Flip is the most exciting consumer fintech company in Indonesia. The firm is thrilled to be leading the third consecutive round, testament of its high conviction in the company,” said Aakash Kapoor, vice president of Sequoia India. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip serves more than seven million users for various kinds of financial transactions from and to different regions in Indonesia and overseas money transfers. More than 340 Indonesian companies and SMEs in travel, hospitality, e-commerce, transportation, education, outsourcing, crowdfunding, business management sectors use Flip’s employee payroll, customer refunds, invoice/ supplier payments, and international transfers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its users have increased 10x compared to before the pandemic following the increase of technology adoption and mobility restrictions in Indonesia, Arriyan said. During the pandemic, the protocol around mobility restriction in Indonesia resulted in most bank offices closing, requiring people to use technology-based solutions for their financial transactions, he continued. The shift in consumer behavior from visiting bank branches to using digital products increased users, Arriyan added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Flip is disrupting the existing interbank transfer market and has established itself as a clear leader in the category, with its superior product that allows for seamless payment movement between bank partners,” said Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As the first institutional investor in Flip, we have witnessed the incredible growth of the product and the execution of the team over the past two years. Flip is now the dominant player in its space, with millions of Indonesians trusting the platform for their day-to-day financial needs,” said Samir Chaibi, principal at Insignia Ventures Partners.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip has added over 250 team members to build its financial services for millions of Indonesian people. The company has increased its team size by 140 % over the past months. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s largest card company just doubled down on its bid to capture the crypto market. Visa announced today that it has launched a crypto advisory practice for its clients and partners under its Visa Consulting and Analytics (VCA) arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes just a few months after Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/a-whole-new-class-of-consumers-is-entering-crypto-space-visa-exec.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared the asset class had become “cool”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a fintech conference last month. The payments behemoth made waves when it bought a CryptoPunk NFT in August this year, but its move to launch a dedicated crypto consultancy shows its attempts to capture crypto market share in a crowded field extend beyond marketing stunts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa’s partnerships with crypto platforms have doubled in the past 18 months, Sheffield told TechCrunch in an interview. Consumers have also spent about $3.5 million dollars using Visa’s crypto-linked card programs, Sheffield said, </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-creeps-checkout-line-marqeta-visa-mastercard-bitpay/609409/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up from $1 million in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244574" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It also announced the results of a new global survey it conducted on consumer attitudes about crypto, which found that 40% of its 6,000+ respondents would be likely to switch primary banks to one that offers crypto products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa has seen “an incredible amount of inbound calls from hundreds of clients and partners and traditional financial institutions” who are looking to integrate crypto into their offerings, Sheffield said. Visa’s consulting arm has around 700 employees, though the company did not share how many would be affiliated with the crypto practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see Visa well-positioned as a global neutral brand, with deep expertise in crypto, that can help to abstract away some of the complexity of these new technologies and help banks bring it into their core products,” Sheffield said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Visa invested in blockchain compliance firm TRM Analytics by participating in its $60 million Series B, <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/trm-labs-raises-60m-as-visa-amex-play-catchup-on-crypto-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/trm-labs-raises-60m-as-visa-amex-play-catchup-on-crypto-tracking/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">announced yesterday</a>. American Express and Citi also participated in the fundraise. Visa is just one of many card incumbents scrambling to make inroads into crypto, which is threatening their fee-dependent business model by replacing them as the new underlying infrastructure for payments.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastercard, for its part, </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/crypto-creeps-checkout-line-marqeta-visa-mastercard-bitpay/609409/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched a crypto rewards program in October this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, using Bakkt as its custodian for digital assets. Visa does not hold crypto in custody directly either, but partners with Anchorage Digital to provide this capability – a company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/anchorage-cryptocurrency-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it first invested in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019. Visa is building out its crypto API platform on top of Anchorage, enabling other banks to access their custodial services, Sheffield said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheffield anticipates growth in Visa’s crypto-linked debit card programs as well as use cases like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Although just seven countries have launched CBDCs to date, 87 more are considering them, </span><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Atlantic Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa is hoping to capitalize on this interest by helping banks develop CBDC-related products, Sheffield said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time on research on what infrastructure CBDCs would use for consumer experiences, and how consumers would interact with them. We are taking that expertise and the engagements that we&#8217;re having with central banks and helping banks start to think about their role in preparing, as we think there&#8217;ll be a number of countries that end up going down this route,” Sheffield said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deeproute.ai, an autonomous vehicle startup with offices in Shenzhen and Fremont, California, unveiled an ambitious self-driving solution on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The package, named DeepRoute-Driver 2.0, is a production-ready Level 4 system that costs approximately $10,000. The price tag is incredible given the hardware used: five solid-state lidar sensors, eight cameras, a proprietary computing system, and an optional millimeter-wave radar.</p>
<p>Lidar accounts for roughly half of the total cost, a Deeproute spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;As the whole supply chain is getting more developed and scale[s] up, we can expect the cost can go further down.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two-year-old startup is unabashed about going up against its more mature counterparts. As it said in its Wednesday release, &#8220;DeepRoute-Driver 2.0 offers differentiation from existing L4 pioneers like Waymo and Cruise, which boast sophisticated and efficient L4 algorithms but with a hefty price tag, and from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as Tesla, that are affordable but have limited capabilities in terms of fully automated driving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sensor makers in China have been working to reduce the once exorbitant prices of lidar to make them fit for mass production.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> DJI-spawned Livox</a> is one, and so is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temasek-backed Innovusion</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244664" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244664" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="551" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=1536,827 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LiDAR-on-the-Car-Roof.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244664" class="wp-caption-text">Lidar on the car roof. Photo: Deeproute.ai</p></div></p>
<p>Deeproute&#8217;s L4 solution uses two pieces of lidar from Robosense, which is based in Shenzhen, as its main lidar on the car roof. Three other lidar sensors from Beijing-based Z Vision are located at the front, left and right around the rear wheel, covering the vehicle&#8217;s blind spot. Both Z Vision and Deeproute are backed by Fosun RZ Capital, an affiliate fund of Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The low price of Deeproute&#8217;s L4 tech could mean thin profits for the startup, or, it&#8217;s squeezing the margins of its suppliers, a founder of an autonomous vehicle startup suggested to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A test drive shows that Deeproute&#8217;s L4 system is able to navigate rush-hour traffic in downtown Shenzhen, performing tasks like flexible lane change, yielding to pedestrians and auto on or off-ramp merging.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QMm8wqDXZW8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Though merely two years old, the team behind Deeproute includes pioneers in China&#8217;s self-driving industry. In 2019, Zhou Guang founded Deeproute after he was forced out of his last company Roadstar.ai amid infighting. At the time, Roadstar had raised at least $140 million from investors and was widely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a promising player in the autonomous vehicle space</a>.</p>
<p>Investors have been rooting for Zhou&#8217;s new venture. In September, the startup announced a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million Series B round</a> from Alibaba, Jeneration Capital, Chinese automaker Geely, among others. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to see OEMs and carmakers pouring money into AV startups in exchange for future production partnerships. Momenta, for instance, has landed multiple strategic investments from titans like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch, Toyota and Daimler</a>.</p>
<p>While Deeproute hasn&#8217;t officially secured a customer for its L4 solution, the startup&#8217;s spokesperson said a few &#8220;major automakers&#8221; have taken rides in the cars integrated with the tech and &#8220;they were impressed by the functionality as well as the pricing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very positive on the prospect of signing the contract soon,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com CEO Vishal Garg apparently realizes he’s done wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(As if the barrage of negative publicity wasn’t enough evidence of that.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, a letter to current employees was </span><a href="https://nyl.as/t1/306/czkxvedfahuokld7tkw8n3lc9/0/d89395136ee9fee037b10c12db6bd059370499b25335d4397dc6e1e72a7614f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked on Blind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a verified Better employee. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter, Garg apologized for the way he (mis)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">handled the layoff news last week, writing: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better. I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it I blundered the execution.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might argue that he also embarrassed himself. Among the affected employees was the company&#8217;s diversity &amp; inclusion team, according to multiple sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier today, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ources familiar with internal happenings within the company told TechCrunch the company’s VP of communications, Patrick Lenihan; head of public relations, Tanya Gillogley; and head of marketing, Melanie Hahn, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-coms-pr-comms-marketing-heads-submit-resignations-in-wake-of-layoffs-fiasco/">all submitted their resignations</a>. Insider also reported that </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/better-marketing-communications-pr-executives-resign-after-layoffs-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallout from the way CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg handled the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">layoffs of about 900 people, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as first reported by TechCrunch, has been widespread, including criticisms of it being handled over Zoom, to charges of insincerity on Garg’s part.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move last week came after the digital mortgage lender announced it had received a cash infusion of about $750 million as</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an amendment of its SPAC agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with blank check company Aurora Acquisition Corp., and SoftBank, and then promptly laid off about 9% of its 10,000 workforce.

<p>Today, Bloomberg reported that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/better-com-laid-off-900-workers-over-zoom-day-after-spac-merger-deal-delayed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company is now (unsurprisingly)</a><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> pushing back its SPAC, which was originally expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch has reached out to Better.com for comment but has not yet heard back at the time of writing. The employees said to have resigned also have not responded to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com is not the only SoftBank-backed proptech that has seen top executives leave in advance of its public debut. In 2019, Insider also reported more than a dozen of WeWork’s top officials </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-executive-exodus-everyone-who-left-resigned-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had left the company </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">amid reports of internal complaints and uncertainty surrounding its IPO plans.</span></p>
<p>The question on all of our minds at this point is will investors and board members tolerate this sort of behavior from Garg, or will he be forced out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/">Adam Neumann-style</a>?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg’s reputation as a not very nice person goes back to last year, when </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same Forbes article revealed that Garg was the subject of a number of lawsuits from the likes of PIMCO and Goldman Sachs for things like “improper and even fraudulent activity at two prior business ventures, and of misappropriating “tens of millions of dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent dip in refinancings is believed to be a factor in Better.com’s decision to lay off some of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2020, Better.com said it was “hiring aggressively” as more people were seeking to refinance their homes in the face of historically low mortgage rates. At that time, I had reported for Crunchbase News that an internal memo to employees from Garg revealed that the mortgage lending startup was </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digital-lending-startup-better-com-hiring-aggressively-as-more-people-refinance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to hire about 1,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 as a whole “as more and more homeowners come online for their needs.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been five years since the founding of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&#8217;s Science program (not CZI itself, which is a year older), which has proven to be quite a generous patron of cutting-edge biotech science and research, and far from winding down, the organization is stepping on the gas as good outcomes from its grants and internal work pile up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working as partners with scientists, patients, and open source communities, we’ve learned so much during these first five years of our science journey about where we can have the best impact in accelerating biomedicine. Now we’re ready to begin our next chapter,&#8221; said Priscilla Chan, co-founder and co-CEO of CZI (with husband Mark Zuckerberg, of course), <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-announces-10-year-effort-to-develop-science-and-technologies-to-measure-human-biology-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>The organization has funded hundreds of experiments, projects, trials and other essential basic research. While we don&#8217;t always <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-gives-68m-to-fund-human-cell-atlas/">cover the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-drops-3-8m-on-23-biomedical-open-source-projects/">projects themselves</a>, being rather technical in nature, the value of this focused and highly curated giving is pretty clear. (Though it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-faces-racial-discrimination-allegations-from-former-employee/">not without its critics</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244553" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been astonished by the fact that methods in single-cell biology, microscopy, and artificial intelligence that were considered impossible just five years ago are now routine,&#8221; said CZI&#8217;s head of science, Cori Bargmann. &#8220;This work has yielded great insight and laid the foundation for what we plan to do going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Initiative has several major announcements to coincide with its anniversary celebrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biomedical Imaging will push forward in one of CZI&#8217;s favored areas of research. Imaging at a cellular or even molecular level is a constant source of insight for researchers, but it&#8217;s often phenomenally complex and expensive. Much work has been funded by CZI over the years to lower the cost and increase the efficacy of these approaches — and the new Institute will centralize and further accelerate these efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/bay-area-coronavirus-testing-chan-zuckerberg-initiative-cz-biohub-ucsf-gavin-newsom/">The CZ Biohub</a> was started as a cross-institutional, cross-discipline platform focused on understanding and modeling the mechanisms behind every disease, with the goal of preventing, curing or managing all of them by the end of the century. Hard to aim higher than that! But it&#8217;s clearly a lot of work, so they&#8217;re extending the current Biohub&#8217;s operations through 2031, and establishing a network of new ones to scale up operations.</li>
<li>A new research institute at Harvard, the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, will focus on understanding and replicating the human mind. The next generation of AI will likely require insights from how our own brains work — and the truth is we&#8217;re kind of in the dark on that part. Maybe they&#8217;ll figure it out here.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch the big fifth anniversary symposium summarizing and discussing the last few years of work by CZI and partners, you should be able to catch up when they <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/anniversary-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post the video here</a> later.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Whether you call it sustainability, ESG or climate tech, there is no doubt that doing good while making money has taken the world by storm.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-18/-35-trillion-in-sustainability-funds-does-it-do-any-good?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, global sustainable investment assets grew to $35.3 trillion just last year. That pencils out to about $1 of every $3 managed globally seeking to profit out of “making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>As these dollars flow into venture capital, the world seeks to solve some of the hardest climate-related problems to keep the globe within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. Investors seem to sense the urgency: Climate tech investment grew at a faster rate than overall VC between 2013 and 2019, according to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/new-report-finds-vc-investment-into-climatetech-growing-five-times-faster-than-overall-vc/">PwC report</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244262" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To clarify, the term “impact investing” is being used here loosely and synonymously with other terms, such as socially responsible investing (SRI) and environmental, social and governance (ESG). In essence, impact is “making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>But therein lies the problem with impact investing: If better is in the eye of the beholder (and it is), then what exactly <em>is</em> better?</p>
<p>After all, Philip Morris <a href="https://www.pmi.com/investor-relations/overview/how-cigarettes-are-made#:~:text=We%20operate%2038%20production%20facilities,700%20billion%20cigarettes%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes</a> 700 billion cigarettes a year, but it’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/philip-morris-eyes-sustainable-debt-in-move-away-from-smoking?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">striving for ESG goals</a> to lure investors. The logic of how escapes me, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Hans Taparia <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_world_may_be_better_off_without_esg_investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> this beautifully:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to what many investors think, most ratings don&#8217;t have anything to do with actual corporate responsibility as it relates to ESG factors. Instead, what they measure is the degree to which a company’s economic value is at risk due to ESG factors. For example, a company could be a significant source of emissions but still get a decent ESG score, if the ratings firm sees the pollutive behavior as being managed well or as non-threatening to the company’s financial value.</p></blockquote>
<p>You get what you measure, and in the world of public equity, measurement can be grossly misleading. Still, retail investors will buy into the fund because of successful “ESG factor” marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Now, there are genuine investment managers out there who are giving their best effort to make the most impact.</p>
<p>To demonstrate impact, these managers adopt a standard measurement framework, such as <a href="https://iris.thegiin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRIS</a>. But impact measurements are notoriously difficult to apply. They are also extremely difficult to measure, and many are also inherently subjective and more costly to measure compared to the solutions trying to improve them.</p>
<p>Moreover, there may be multiple factors generating a positive outcome, and it is often impossible to discern the specific cause and effect in improving those outcomes. As a result, the manager resorts to the next best thing: They measure actions and implementations. But it is very easy to mistake leading indicators for change.</p>
<p>PlayPumps, a merry-go-round apparatus that pumped underground water the more it spun around from children playing on it, is an <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent example</a> of this. The number of installations, percentage of children using the PlayPumps, or liters of water pumped did not necessarily demonstrate whether a community has better access to clean water as a result of the pumps.</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that these are fund managers and corporate executives who <em>still</em> have to deliver financial performance.</p>
<p>Unlike dollar values, impact measurements are vague and lack true standards, making it more difficult for investors to compare the social impact of an investment portfolio or evaluate relative performance. This also makes tying performance-based pay to impact measurements nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Impact takes time to materialize and is often outside of the fund’s or company’s influence. In the financial world that lives quarter to quarter, maximizing the dollar is always the easier choice to make when a choice must be made.</p>
<p>There is a special place for impact to exist. One where incentives between the managers and companies are aligned, the specific measurements do not matter much, and the time horizon is long enough to make a real difference.</p>
<p>That special place? The early-stage venture asset class.</p>
<p>At Creative Ventures, we use impact as an opportunity lens. We understand that the bigger the impact, the bigger the problem — and likely the bigger the market opportunity and financial return.</p>
<p>Impact is where the problems are. In a world plagued by sophisticated impact measures, our approach imagines a world where an EV costs 20% less and can go 40% farther. A world where we could cure cancer. Where energy consumption is halved in all data centers.</p>
<p>And do we not all agree the world would be a significantly better place if just one of these companies were to succeed?</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 7, 2021! It’s nearly time to reflect on the year, a period in which so very much changed for the global startup world. One of the most interesting themes? Rising venture investment for African startups. Long ignored by the global investing set, startups from the African continent are having a barnstorming year. Sure, we have data to back up that claim, but with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/#:~:text=Equinix%20announced%20today%20that%20it,Ivory%20Coast%2C%20for%20%24320%20million.">even more nine-figure deals landing in Africa</a> it’s a market that any technologist now must keep an eye on. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/#:~:text=Equinix%20announced%20today%20that%20it,Ivory%20Coast%2C%20for%20%24320%20million.">More on the MainOne-Equinix deal here</a>. —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-acquires-quill-a-would-be-slack-rival-team-will-work-on-dms-as-quill-shuts-down/"><strong>Twitter buys Quill, will work on DMs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Let’s be clear, Twitter is a fun place to hang out, but its private-messaging service is pretty <em>basic</em>. But there’s good news on the horizon with the social media company buying the business messaging service’s team to work on DMs. Quill will not survive, but it’s hard to compete against Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Facebook’s parent company is busy generating headlines this week, with the head of its Messenger service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/metas-messenger-boss-is-leaving-the-company/">leaving the company</a>, adding to a roster of exits in recent months (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/facebooks-cto-to-step-down-after-13-years-at-the-company/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-vr-exec-hugo-barra-is-leaving/">here</a>). And ahead of a congressional hearing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/">Instagram is rolling out parental controls</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/discord-premium-memberships/"><strong>Discord working on paid memberships:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the larger creator economy, chat service Discord has found an interesting niche. And it’s working to take advantage of the communities that have been built atop its platform, working on a “new way for creators to make money by offering community members access to paid, subscriber-only content,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>While the year is coming to a close, the IPO cycle is not yet done. We have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">HashiCorp’s debut on the way</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank in the wings</a>. But don’t forget about IoT shop Samsara, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">which could become a decacorn in its upcoming IPO</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244378" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/therify-hopes-to-build-a-more-diverse-and-inclusive-therapist-network-with-1-3m-seed-round/"><strong>Therify wants to make therapy more accessible:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Finding a therapist is not easy if you’re a cishet man. I can attest to this. But if you are a “person of color or someone with disabilities, there are few or no people sharing your experience available,” TechCrunch notes. Therify just raised $1.3 million to work on the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Jupe is </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/jupe-series-a/"><strong>&#8220;not making … glamping tents for bros at Coachella:&#8221;</strong></a><strong> </strong>So what is the startup building? Housing for the roughly 1.5 billion people — by its count — that lack sufficient shelter. The company just raised $9.5 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/torq-raises-50m-series-b-for-its-no-code-security-automation-platform/"><strong>Torq puts points on the board for the Portland, Oregon, tech scene:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The startup formerly known as StackPulse is building a no-code tool for security workflows. And that effort helped it raise a simply massive $50 million Series B. Yes, the pre-IPO rounds of old are today’s early-stage investments. Get used to it. Regardless, we don’t hear that much from my home state, so it’s nice to see Torq doing well. SentinelOne led the round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/sendowl-a-platform-for-selling-digital-goods-raises-4-5m-from-defy-vc-and-stripe/"><strong>SendOwl raises to help creators sell digital goods:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, we’re not talking about NFTs. Instead, SendOwl wants to help “creators and businesses sell digital goods such as e-books, podcasts and online courses.” There is a big market for such content, even if SendOwl is not the only startup that we can name that is working in the space. Defy.vc and Stripe put up the capital for SendOwl’s $4.5 million seed round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/majority-raises-27m-series-a-six-months-after-its-seed-round-to-expand-mobile-banking-for-migrants/"><strong>Today’s neobank funding round is MAJORITY:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We recently discussed a neobank aimed at SMBs. Today, immigrants. MAJORITY has raised a $27 million Series A for its work, bringing its total capital raised to some $46 million, per TechCrunch reporting. The company now allows folks to sign up sans a Social Security number, which feels notable.</li>
<li><strong>I thought Circle was </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/dave-eggers-denies-reading-the-boy-kings/"><strong>a book?</strong></a><strong> Or the </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/circle-is-a-good-example-of-why-spacs-can-be-useful/"><strong>crypto company going public via a SPAC?</strong></a> Turns out it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/circle-comes-around-again-with-fresh-capital-led-by-tiger-global-for-200m-valuation/"><em>also</em> a startup helping creators build and manage their community</a>. Which seems cool, but we’d politely ask the company to rebrand to avoid us talking in circles on Slack. Regardless, Circle just raised at a $200 million valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/agentsync-raises-75m-for-its-insurance-focused-api-business/"><strong>AgentSync is today’s new unicorn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Fundraising rocket ship AgentSync announced a $75 million funding round today, pushing its valuation up to the $1.2 billion mark. Working in the insurtech API <em>infra</em> space, AgentSync is proof that there is big money in connecting disparate informational elements of antiquated industries.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/the-every-co-grabs-175m-as-it-cracks-code-on-animal-free-protein-products/"><strong>Honey, you’ve barely touched your brewed protein!</strong></a><strong> </strong>We kid, but if The EVERY Co. has its way, we’ll be eating fermented animal protein equivalents in due time. The company just landed a huge $175 million round to help it bring the future it envisions to life. The startup was previously known as Clara Foods, for reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/londons-pento-raises-35m/"><strong>Pento raises pile of capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s main Tiger round is Pento, a U.K.-based payment automation startup that just raised $35 million. Running payroll is a pain, and even more so for small companies. Pento of course has lots of competition, but certainly doesn’t lack for TAM.</li>

<h2>AWS re:Invent 2021 was more incremental than innovative</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re used to Amazon making news: It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s third-largest company, and its founder is planning to build his own private space station.</p>
<p>But at last week&#8217;s re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS customers, &#8220;it felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>After going virtual in 2020, this year&#8217;s in-person return to Las Vegas saw updates from incoming CEO Adam Selipsky, CTO Werner Vogels and others, but &#8220;nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few highlights: AWS unveiled the Gravitron 3, its latest Arm-based processor, along with re:Post, a managed Q&amp;A service that replaces AWS forums, and Amplify Study, a no-code/low-code service for devs building cloud-connected applications.</p>
<p>But notably, &#8220;this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database,&#8221; said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/aws-reinvent-2021-was-more-incremental-than-innovative/">recap of the week&#8217;s announcements</a> — and the lack thereof — points to a company in transition: &#8220;Perhaps Amazon is becoming a bit more like Apple.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/microsoft-seizes-control-of-websites-used-by-china-backed-hackers/">Microsoft takes on Chinese hacking ring:</a> </strong>TechCrunch reports that Redmond-based software giant Microsoft has “seized control of a number of websites that were being used by a Chinese government-backed hacking group to target organizations in 29 countries, including the U.S.” Good news that the company did that, but bad news that it had to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/google-disrupts-russian-botnet-that-infected-1-million-windows-machines/">Google disrupts Russian botnet:</a> </strong>At some point we’ll get a handle on rampant cybercrime, but today is not that day. Not yet. Progress is being made, however, with U.S. software giant Google taking on a Russian botnet of “technical sophistication,” to quote the firm. Again, good to have this happen, bad that it was a required action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twitter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Twitter-Quill news was only one headline from the social service, with Big Tweet also rolling out the ability for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">all iOS and Android users to listen to recorded Spaces</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-reported-tweets-analysis/">executing work regarding reported tweets</a> that will not force users to “specify which of Twitter’s policies they believe a tweet is violating.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The rest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/"><strong>App stores big:</strong></a> You knew that, but the data is actually somewhat staggering even given our expectations. Per Sarah Perez, first-time app installs are expected to reach 143.6 billion this year, with consumer app spending reaching some $133 billion. No wonder Apple is loath to loosen its grip on its own app-related incomes. They are huge.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-three-more-titles-globally-on-ios-and-android/"><strong>Netflix gaming is really, actually a thing:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I keep expecting this story to go away, but it’s doing the opposite. Again. TechCrunch noted today that video-streaming service Netflix has added three gaming titles to its larger portfolio. Instead of doing this, frankly, I’d hazard that Netflix would be better served just sponsoring its own League of Legends team, but, hey, that’s just me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/at-lens-fest-snap-debuts-creations-tools-for-more-sophisticated-augmented-reality-experiences/"><strong>Something something Snap metaverse something something:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, held something called Lens Fest. Yes, this was AR and Spectacles and the like. Our own Lucas Matney has the information you need.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The same day in February 2020 that Credit Karma planned to announce that it had been acquired by Intuit for more than $7 billion, the stock market tanked, spooked by news that a novel virus had the potential to start a pandemic.</p>
<p>“I’m up at 5 o’clock in the morning, the Dow is flashing red … and we’re all like, ‘Are we going to do this?’” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/how-credit-karma-acquired-amid-covid-chaos-fared-in-its-first-year-under-intuit/">said Credit Karma CEO Ken Lin</a>.</p>
<p>That deal eventually closed in December 2020, but in the intervening months, the U.S. Department of Justice forced the company to divest its tax business, and credit markets tightened considerably.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244219" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Fintech reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed Lin, Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, Credit Karma’s chief people officer Colleen McCreary and other executives to learn about how they weathered COVID-19 and divestment while simultaneously crafting a new management structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What had been a very profitable business for a very long time is all of a sudden very unprofitable, because you can’t pivot on a dime,&#8221; said Lin. &#8220;We had a lot of decisions to make.”</p>

<p>Initially founded to create wireless sensors, IoT platform company Samsara reached a $3.6 billion valuation in 2018, but its latest S-1/A filing could boost that &#8220;from $10.1 billion to $11.6 billion,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, he delved into the company&#8217;s inner workings, but &#8220;today, we’re more interested in the resulting numbers, not how they were achieved.&#8221;</p>

<h2>AWS re:Invent 2021 was more incremental than innovative</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re used to Amazon making news: it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s third-largest company, and its founder is planning to build his own private space station.</p>
<p>But at last week&#8217;s re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS customers, &#8220;it felt more like Amazon was checking boxes and filling in holes in the product road map,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>After going virtual in 2020, this year&#8217;s in-person return to Las Vegas saw updates from incoming CEO Adam Selipsky, CTO Werner Vogels and others, but &#8220;nothing came out of the 2021 re:Invent that felt really cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few highlights: AWS unveiled the Gravitron 3, its latest Arm-based processor, along with re:Post, a managed Q&amp;A service that replaces AWS forums, and Amplify Study, a no-code/low-code service for devs building cloud-connected applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But notably, &#8220;this is the first re:Invent in a long time where AWS did not announce a new database,&#8221; said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s recap of the week&#8217;s announcements — and the lack thereof — points to a company in transition: &#8220;Perhaps Amazon is becoming a bit more like Apple.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a founder, raising seed money can be the hardest part of the puzzle, and depending on the sector, can take dozens of weeks to accomplish.</p>
<p>A data-driven approach to the process, however, can help founders tackle fundraising efficiently while minimizing headaches, writes Russ Heddleston, CEO of DocSend.</p>
<p>“Having very clear data on where VCs focus their time on pitch decks or in meetings will guide you to deliver a finely tuned pitch to the right investor.”</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s announcement by LinkedIn that it would start offering its services in Hindi highlights a problem facing startups trying to recruit software developers — many of them don&#8217;t use the platform.</p>
<p>Potential hires who live in emerging markets are less likely to use LinkedIn, but a lot of devs just don&#8217;t take a strong interest in building their brands on social media.</p>
<p>Making an effort to meet developers where they are will help your company as an attractive place to work, writes Sergiu Matei, founder of Index.</p>
<p>In a TechCrunch+ post, he shares three tips you can use to attract engineers in an increasingly competitive market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up your content, chats and code</li>
<li>Make EQ, not IQ, your hiring criteria</li>
<li>Say “yes” to more candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>The market is ripe for AI companies to go public, but for SenseTime’s Hong Kong IPO, demand may be less than that of the wider market, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new IPO target of up to HK$5.99 billion (US$768 million) is a far cry from its previous $2 billion IPO, possibly reflecting the fact that investors aren’t excited about its steadily increasing losses, Alex writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s cloud arm, AWS, announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-second-aws-top-secret-region-extending-support-us-government-classified-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new &#8216;top secret&#8217; region</a> this week, designed specifically for the U.S. government. It is Amazon&#8217;s second such region. The company now boasts &#8220;top secret&#8221; regions on the east and west coasts of the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS Top Secret-West is accredited to operate workloads at the Top Secret U.S. security classification level. The new Region adds multiple Availability Zones geographically separated from AWS Top Secret-East,&#8221; Amazon&#8217;s Max Peterson wrote in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-second-aws-top-secret-region-extending-support-us-government-classified-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company blog post</a> announcing the new region.</p>
<p>The company, which is experiencing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-went-down-and-took-a-bunch-of-the-internet-with-it/">an outage today in its East Coast region</a>, recognizes that government clients have different needs. You can&#8217;t put them in a multi-tenant server farm with the rest of humanity. They need isolation and security, and that&#8217;s what the top secret regions have been designed to give them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;AWS is committed to helping our customers and partners in the defense, intelligence and national security communities deliver their most critical missions,&#8221; Peterson wrote.</p>
<p>Last year when the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">fighting with Microsoft</a> over the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pentagon-jedi-contract/"> decade-long JEDI cloud contract</a>, it could point to this top secret region as evidence of its capabilities in managing these special requirements. That contract <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">was eventually scrapped</a>, lost in litigation, and perhaps this is another way to show just how prepared Amazon is to deal with sensitive material like the kind from the DoD in the future.</p>
<p>The new site gives government clients a way to spread out their workloads across geographies, and then within that, choose different availability zones. The zone has been certified by a number of government entities to provide the level of security required by the target customers, including Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Intelligence Community Directive (ICD 503) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4.</p>
