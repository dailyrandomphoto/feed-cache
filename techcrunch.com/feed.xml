Labs will give Twitter Blue subscribers early access to features that Twitter is testing as a part of that bundle, which is currently only available in Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>Now, Labs subscribers now have the ability to upload videos that are up to 10-minutes long from their desktop. Standard users currently only have the option to upload videos that are up to 2 minutes and 20 seconds long. Additionally, iOS users can now swipe to pin their favorite conversations to the top of their direct message inbox.</p>

<p>Today, we‚Äôre rolling out Labs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f52c.png" alt="üî¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, giving you *early access* to some new features we‚Äôre building before everyone else like: <br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f539.png" alt="üîπ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Pinned Conversations on iOS<br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f539.png" alt="üîπ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Longer video uploads on desktop only </p>
<p>Here are some questions you might be asking:</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1453457352426803202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says features that are released via Labs may eventually roll out to the rest of Twitter, become a static feature of Twitter Blue, or be scrapped altogether based on feedback it hears from subscribers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúLabs also provides an opportunity for other internal product teams to submit features, get early quantitative and qualitative data, and then later release to a wider audience. What&#8217;s featured in Labs will change as we develop new features,‚Äù the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">had said last month</a> it planned to be more experimental as it released new products, noting that it would share its progress publicly along the way and scrap ideas that didn&#8217;t work &#8212; as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/">recently did</a> with Fleets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that if we‚Äôre not winding things down every once in a while, then we‚Äôre not taking big enough bets,&#8221; said Twitter Head of Consumer Product Kayvon Beykpour at the time.</p>
<p>In Canada and Australia, a Twitter Blue subscription currently costs $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD, respectively. The subscription gives Twitter users access to premium features, including tools to organize bookmarks and an ‚ÄúUndo Tweet‚Äù feature, which seems to be the closest thing Twitter will offer in relation to the long-requested ‚Äúedit‚Äù button. Twitter Blue also comes with a reader mode feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health</a>, the San Francisco-based company that offers a digital solution to treat chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, like back and joint pain, closed on $400 million in Series E funding to give the company a $6.2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Tiger Global and Coatue Management, which co-led the company‚Äôs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">$300 million Series D round</a> back in January, are back again to lead this one. They are joined by Alkeon Capital and Whale Rock, which put in a $200 million secondary investment to acquire some ownership in Hinge. Tiger, Coatue and Alkeon were also recently an investment team in Abacus.ai, which announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/abacus-ai-snags-50m-series-c-as-it-expands-into-computer-vision-use-cases/"> $50 million round this week.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The new investment, which brings Hinge Health‚Äôs total funds raised to date at over $1 billion, will be funneled into technology and product development to improve access, outcomes and patient experiences, Daniel Perez, co-founder and CEO of Hinge Health, said in a written statement. The company also touts that it is &#8220;now one of the most valuable companies in digital health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hinge Health‚Äôs technology aims to reduce MSK pain, surgeries and opioid use through the use of advanced wearable sensors and computer vision technology that is monitored by a clinical care team of physical therapists, physicians and board-certified health coaches.</p>
<p>So far this year, the company, which is approaching 1,000 employees, more than doubled its customer base to now serve over 575 enterprise customers. It also rounded out its leadership team with new hires Lalith Vadlamannati, who joined as chief technology officer after spending 13 years at Amazon, and Vincent Lim, chief people officer, who has previous experience scaling teams at Google, Medium and JUUL Labs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle charging companies depend on reliable internet access to sell electricity to customers, track usage data, authenticate users and receive over-the-air updates. If a WiFi connection is unreliable, drivers could find themselves in a sticky situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the phone loses service, the charger loses service, the environment loses service or the server is down, the charging session never occurs and you&#8217;re stranded,‚Äù EV charging startup <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/9f1e221bf5ba19014a1a314cae7e6ef7e51acb8e?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xealenergy.com&amp;userId=5405119&amp;signature=32c192a397a94f29">Xeal</a> co-founder Alexander Isaacson said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúThat&#8217;s the status quo: if you want smart functions it comes at the dependence on someone else&#8217;s connectivity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Two-year-old Xeal, founded by Isaacson and Nikhil Bharadwaj, aims to solve this tricky problem by bypassing WiFi connectivity entirely, at least at the point of sale. It does so through a patent-pending protocol called Apollo, which uses time-bound cryptographic tokens and distributed ledgers ‚Äì a mouthful of buzzwords but the centerpiece of Xeal‚Äôs technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The tech has gotten the attention of investors, to the tune of an $11 million Series A and a previously unannounced $3 million seed round. The Series A saw participation from an interesting mix of investors from climate tech and proptech, including ArcTern Ventures and Moderne Ventures, with additional funding from LPC Ventures, the venture arm of Lincoln Property Company, Harrison Street, Hunt Companies, and Align Real Estate. The seed round was co-led by Ramez Naam and Pasadena Angels.</p>
<p>In practice, the Apollo protocol looks like a closed loop system between the driver‚Äôs phone and the EV charger, which has no IT infrastructure, modems, ethernet cables or SIM cards. To establish that closed loop, drivers must download the app (on WiFi, of course), enter personal information, payment details and vehicle information. At that point, the driver‚Äôs phone receives a cryptographic token to access all of Xeal‚Äôs public charging stations. This is the point at which the system authenticates the user.</p>
<p>When the driver goes to charge her car at a station, the station accesses the digital token embedded in the phone ‚Äì no WiFi required. The cryptographic tokens are &#8220;time-bound&#8221; because they dissolve after they are used. The charger has something akin to a local server that reads the token and authenticates the session. When the session ends, the charger imparts to the phone a distributed ledger with details on the charging session, like how much electricity was used and the fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To get another token ‚Äì for another charging session ‚Äì the driver would need to eventually access WiFi, Isaacson explained. In a way, drivers exchange the distributed ledger, with their fee details, for another token. But even if, theoretically, a driver threw their phone into a lake or never reconnected it to WiFi, perhaps hoping to steal a bit of kilowatts, the details of that charging session are distributed to the other chargers nearby, too, and imparted to other users‚Äô phones. That means that even if a single phone does not reconnect to WiFi, other phones that inevitably do can update the ledger over the network.</p>
<p>Xeal says its protocol is much more secure than conventional smart chargers on the market. Isaacson likened the internet to a public highway, with information travelling along it vulnerable to interception and manipulation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe&#8217;re not going anywhere outside of the charger and the phone,‚Äù he said. The company also says Apollo makes for more cost savings too, because real estate owners don‚Äôt have to pay for data plans or incur costs associated with installing internet access in hard-to-accommodate places that are convenient for drivers, like a parking garage.</p>
<p>Xeal launched the Apollo protocol in July, after working on it for around two years. Isaacson said the company is on-track to install 2,000 charging stations by the end of the year and 10,000 in 2022. The main catalyst for growth, he added, was through targeting major real estate groups, particularly apartment building owners, who are looking to provide EV charging on their properties.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Xeal aims to use the $11 million funding to hit its target of installing 10,000 charging stations next year. The company will also be hiring more engineers and possibly even expand the self-reliant offline protocol to other use-cases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEverything you do in life, to perform well, you need to have someone else performing well,‚Äù Isaacson said. ‚ÄúThat just wasn&#8217;t the reality that we wanted. That&#8217;s the whole theme of central network dependence in general because when you&#8217;re depending on a central focal point, and it ever goes down, the entire system breaks.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marc and Lynne Benioff announced a $200 million donation this morning to combat climate change and encourage others to take action. Marc Benioff&#8217;s company, <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, threw in $100 million more for a total donation of $300 million.</p>
<p>The Benioffs&#8217; portion is divided into two tranches, with $100 million going to the Benioff Time Tree Fund and the other $100 million going to Time Ventures, the couple&#8217;s venture firm, to invest in promising startups working to build products and services that battle climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Benioff Time Tree Fund will focus on indigenous and community-based forest management and mitigating the increasing impacts of climate change on the most at-risk communities and natural ecosystems in emerging and developing countries,&#8221; the organization said in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225638" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Marc Benioff said that it&#8217;s going to take a concerted and combined effort by various constituencies to fight climate change, and tree-planting efforts are a big part of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can succeed in arresting climate change if every government, company and individual makes it a priority to protect and preserve our planet. We have to sequester 100 gigatons of carbon and reforestation is critical in making it happen,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In addition, the Time Ventures component plans to invest $100 million in eco-focused startups. This comes on top of another $100 million the couple&#8217;s firm has invested since 2014 in companies like DroneSeed, Loam Bio and Mango Materials, according to the firm.</p>
<p>Salesforce has already stated that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/salesforce-reaches-net-zero-energy-usage-announces-updates-to-sustainability-cloud/">it has achieved Net Zero</a> and announced commitments to grow 30 million trees this year at Dreamforce, the company&#8217;s customer conference, in September. This additional $100 million is being distributed to several initiatives, including grants over the next decade to help nonprofit organizations working in areas like ecosystem restoration and climate justice. Furthermore, the company plans to donate technology and commit to 2.5 million in volunteer hours at organizations working on climate action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suzanne DiBianca, chief impact officer at Salesforce, said that the company&#8217;s actions to achieve Net Zero is a first step, but the additional money is aimed at helping other groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to empower those who are working to accelerate climate action and help those who are most impacted by climate change. We need bold and urgent action if we are to reduce emissions and deliver a healthier, more resilient, Net Zero world,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company has achieved <a href="https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero/">Net Zero</a> emissions through a combination of using renewable energy and purchasing carbon offsets when that&#8217;s not an option.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What do you do to build a deck that can‚Äôt be ignored? To answer that question, we assembled a group of three exceptional venture capitalists on the Extra Crunch stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of pitch decks, and only a handful of winners. Such is the math of the VC industry right now, what with an explosion of startups and dreams of glory launching every year. VCs are overwhelmed with pitches, which means that crafting the perfect deck and connecting with a reader in the few seconds you have their attention is critical.</p>
<p>So what do you do to build a deck that can‚Äôt be ignored? To answer that question, we assembled a group of three exceptional venture capitalists on the Extra Crunch stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> who have probably read more decks collectively than any group of humans should ever be expected to. Mar Hershenson is founding managing partner at <a href="https://www.pear.vc">Pear VC</a>, Mercedes Bent is a partner at <a href="https://lsvp.com">Lightspeed</a>, and Saba Karim is the head of global startup pipeline at <a href="https://www.techstars.com">TechStars</a>.</p>
<p>In our discussion, we covered what‚Äôs changing with pitches as the world moves toward a hybrid in-person and virtual pitch model, discussed how deep tech startups should think about pitches, and then we wrapped by exploring how each panelist reads decks ‚Äî and what that portends for founders who don‚Äôt want to be ignored.</p>
<h2 id="The changing nature of reading pitches in 2021 and standardizing formats">The changing nature of reading pitches in 2021 and standardizing formats</h2>
<p>We got right into the crux of the matter at the top of the panel: What does reading pitch decks feel like in 2021? For Hershenson, there‚Äôs just always more under the sun:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say the volume of pitches that we receive has increased and continues to increase at some form of exponential rate. For us, we have to become far more efficient at sorting and reading through these decks. The actual reading of the individual deck hasn&#8217;t changed, but the rate and volume have increased dramatically. <em><b>(Timestamp: 1:01)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bent noted that the bar has gone up for the quality of decks that she reads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The decks are getting better and better in terms of design. I think more and more people have realized that the visual representation of your deck is just as important as the material and the content that&#8217;s in there. There&#8217;s these instinctive milliseconds that an investor looks at your deck and almost makes a snap judgment about whether it&#8217;s even in the realm of something they want to look at it. Unfortunately, it shouldn&#8217;t be like that, but we&#8217;re human. So I&#8217;m seeing decks that are super polished, and I don&#8217;t know where everyone is getting these great graphics from, but they&#8217;re amazing. <em><b>(Timestamp: 1:48)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most pitch decks are based off templates, and therein lies a key trade-off: How much should you rely on a template versus being ‚Äúoriginal,‚Äù but different and perhaps harder to read? Karim noted that sometimes originality can pay off:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best pitch deck that I got in a different format would be from a company that recently got into TechStars ‚Äî it was actually a podcast version of their pitch deck that had my face on it. I went into Apple Podcasts and it said, ‚ÄúHey, Saba, here&#8217;s my pitch.‚Äù That was amazing! But the second or third time that happens, it might not be as impressive because I&#8217;ve seen it before. <em><b>(Timestamp: 3:41)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hershenson pushed founders to consider keeping to the standard templates because it can help VCs focus on what makes each business unique.</p>
<blockquote><p>For us, having the pitch in a format that we are able to consume in an efficient way is super important. There are a lot of templates online, we all know the key points that need to be hit on in a deck. So your job as a founder is to hit those in a deck of 10 to 15 slides and kind of do the hard work of synthesizing your business in a short format. I think you can be original, but sometimes being original is to your detriment.</p>
<p>I can tell you my own story. When we were first fundraising for Pear, we decided we were going to be really original: We&#8217;re going to use Prezi to send decks to LPs. And that was just totally the wrong call, because it&#8217;s almost like, ‚ÄúWhat did they just send me?‚Äù <em><b>(Timestamp: 4:29)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting dynamics that has shown up in the last year has been the rise of Notion as a form for fundraising. Responses from our panel were muted. Hershenson said Notion isn‚Äôt an excuse for not being succinct.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $80 million</a> at a $505 million valuation, blockchain and Web3 development SaaS startup <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alchemy</a> has raised $250 million in a Series C funding round that values the company at $3.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the financing, which was extremely competitive with a number of large venture firms clamoring to not only back the company, but lead the investment, according to sources familiar with the transaction.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that Alchemy increased its valuation by a staggering 7x over a six-month period (that‚Äôs a gain of more than $1 billion in value per month), the round is notable for a few other reasons. For one, it represents one of a16z‚Äôs largest Web3/blockchain investments to date. In June, the firm revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.2 billion crypto fund</a>, illustrating its serious commitment to the space. (For the unacquainted, Web3 refers to a</span><span class="s1"> set of protocols led by blockchain, that intends to reinvent how the Internet is wired in the backend).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What‚Äôs also interesting is that Alchemy has managed to achieve something that remains elusive for most startups: profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO and co-founder Nikil Viswanathan, the company is in fact ‚Äúvery profitable.‚Äù It turned that corner over the past few months, he said, as demand for its offering has exploded and revenue grew 15x since its last raise in April. The startup has been doing so well that it hasn‚Äôt even touched the $80 million it raised in its Series B, according to Alchemy CTO and co-founder Joe Lau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAll that money is still in the bank,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt need the money but we saw the value in bringing on great partners, such as Andreessen, which has an incredible team with deep technical expertise in the blockchain space.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Alchemy wants to do for blockchain and Web3 what AWS (Amazon Web Services) did for the internet. ‚Äã‚Äã</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup‚Äôs goal is to be the starting place for developers considering building a product on top of a blockchain or mainstream blockchain applications. Its developer tool aims to remove the complexity and costs of building infrastructure while improving applications through ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù developer tools. It launched its offering in August of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Alchemy powers a range of transactions across nearly every blockchain vertical, including financial institutions, exchanges, billion-dollar decentralized finance projects and multinational organizations such as UNICEF. It has also quickly become the technology behind every major NFT platform, including MakersPlace, OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and CryptoPunks. Other customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dapper Labs, Axie Infinity, Fortune 500s building on blockchain such as the recently signed Adobe, PricewaterhouseCoopers. It also serves ‚Äúthe majority of DeFi.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy powers over $45 billion in transaction volume for companies around the globe. That‚Äôs up from $30 billion at the time of its April raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company has also expanded the number of blockchains that it powers.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOur platform was more or less on Ethereum, but we‚Äôve seen a lot of demand and have since expanded to include Polygon, Optimism and Flow,‚Äù Lau said.¬†</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225566" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225566" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225566 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alchemy2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225566" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alchemy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy has also seen a lot of new developers, noted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viswanathan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had many more teams and companies join Alchemy, and more developers per team or per company are using our platform,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre seeing growth across all axes.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its explosive growth, Alchemy remains a lean team. It currently has 37 employees, up from 22 in April. It is based in San Francisco, with an office in New York and remote employees globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to invest in building a community around blockchain. Alchemy started at the right time, in the execs&#8217; view &#8212; in 2017 when the market was tiny and many still doubted the opportunity in the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOur </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimate goal is to bring the promise of blockchain to life,‚Äù Lau said. ‚ÄúWe want to fulfill its potential by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating more resources for developers to come into the space and more effectively and more quickly build blockchain products.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>Viswanathan believes Alchemy is playing a crucial role in the recent surge and popularity of blockchain.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As blockchain has been growing, not only has Alchemy grown, but we have helped the blockchain ecosystem grow because,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s this kind of virtuous cycle &#8212; the more we provide better tooling, the easier it is for developers to build products, and then more users come, so then more developers come so that we make the tooling better, and so on and so forth. So we like to think of ourselves as helping spin that flywheel.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Ali Yahya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (16z), described Alchemy as &#8220;a key driver&#8221; of the growth of blockchain and Web3, and said the startup is already &#8220;the de facto developer platform&#8221; for Web3.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">&#8220;Just as Microsoft and AWS built platforms that powered the computer and internet industries, Alchemy‚Äôs platform enables developers to build blockchain products used by millions globally,&#8221; he wrote via email, adding that¬†</span><b></b><span class="s2">Alchemy&#8217;s growth across all relevant metrics has been &#8220;staggering.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google chairman and Stanford University President John L. Hennessy &#8212; who invested in the company&#8217;s last round &#8212; echoed Yahya&#8217;s sentiments. But he also made another, noteworthy comparison: </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAlchemy is powering the growth of the blockchain industry the same way Amazon Web Services did for the cloud,&#8221; he wrote via e-mail. &#8220;The excitement about their technology reminds me of the early days of Google.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C financing also included participation from new investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Redpoint. Existing backers Coatue, Lee Fixel‚Äôs Addition, DFJ and Pantera Capital doubled down on their investments in Alchemy, which has now raised about $345 million in total since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other previous investors in the company includ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e the Chainsmokers‚Äô Mantis, actor Jared Leto and the Glazer family (owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United), Yahoo co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang, Coinbase, SignalFire, Samsung, Stanford University, Charles Schwab, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and others.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tarken connects grain buyers and sellers around more transparent pricing for commodities, starting with corn.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian grain trading marketplace <a href="https://www.tarken.ag/en.html#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarken</a> secured $3.5 million in a seed round, co-led by Monashees and Maya, to continue developing its technology that connects grain buyers and sellers and operates an artificial intelligence tool for commodity pricing.</p>
<p>Joining them was Gilgamesh Ventures and individual investors, including Kavak founder Carlos Garcia, Ual√° founder Pierpaolo Barbieri, Zap VivaReal Group‚Äôs Brian Requarth and DoorDash‚Äôs Gokul Rajaram.</p>
<p>Luiz T√¢ngari and Carlos Neto founded Tarken this year after working together in agriculture for the past eight years at Strider, a crop protection systems company they co-founded and later sold to Syngenta in 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After integrating the company, they left and started Tarken, which is initially focused on corn, which T√¢ngari estimates to be a $30 billion market. The National Supply Company (CONAB) from the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture estimated <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/092221-brazil-corn-crop-extreme-weather" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corn production in Brazil</a> at 102.6 million metric tons for the 2020-21 growing year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe biggest problem in commodity trading is that it is not liquid,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIf you are a farmer growing corn and soy, if you want to sell in a hurry you have to sell at a discount, or you are waiting for weeks for the right prices.‚Äù</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TnbeUraEwe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">As its startup market accelerates, Brazil could be in for an IPO bonanza</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As its startup market accelerates, Brazil could be in for an IPO bonanza&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/embed/#?secret=TnbeUraEwe" data-secret="TnbeUraEwe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He said the United States figured out price variations a decade ago. To give similar transparency to grain trading in Brazil, Tarken set up an AI tool that pulls in data from different sources and generates a price for every Brazilian city, something T√¢ngari said was a mystery before. Buyers and sellers can search a map to see who is selling, at what price and the freight cost to get the product.</p>
<p>The farmer can communicate with the seller and the freight operators, which are vetted by Tarken, and execute the transaction right from the platform, which T√¢ngari said ‚Äúremoves risk from the table.‚Äù A process that used to take about 12 weeks ‚Äî between figuring out the prices, negotiations and product delivery ‚Äî can now take just days, he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a tool combined with education to draw scenarios for strategies to buy and sell,‚Äù T√¢ngari added. ‚ÄúCurrently, farmers have zero help, and we want to level that. We want to help market players be smarter, have smaller price variations and better liquidity. If we are successful, we will see chicken prices in the market go down 3%.‚Äù</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since Tarken launched four months ago, it has facilitated over 1,000 negotiations and has several hundred open bids for products. The number of negotiations is growing 50% per day, and T√¢ngari expects to close the year with 10,000 registered customers.</p>
<p>Half of the new funding will go toward engineering to continue developing the product, including finishing out the AI tool. The other half will be invested in marketing for the marketplace to attract new customers, building content and education to help growers and buyers understand about trading and sales.</p>
<p>T√¢ngari also notes that Tarken is on track to begin raising a Series A round and expects that to begin in six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo Lima, partner at Monashees, said in a statement that he previously knew T√¢ngari and Neto through an investment in Strider and is backing Tarken for its approach to the agricultural commodities market, which has not seen innovation in recent years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe strongly believe in the ability to use technology and data to aggregate supply and demand, improve the user experience and build a great marketplace in the region,‚Äù Lima said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen this happening across multiple spaces and asset types. We are on the ideal timing and we have the perfect team to lead this movement in agribusiness.‚Äù</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Transit planning app Moovit is now featuring Bird&#8217;s shared e-scooters and e-bikes in its app. As of Thursday, Moovit users in 65 cities across 12 countries ‚Äî including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom ‚Äî will be able to locate nearby Bird vehicles in real time, gauge how long it will take to walk there and see the battery range of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Moovit says it plans to open the Bird integration to U.S. cities in the near future but didn&#8217;t specify when.</p>
<p>Bird has around 20 mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) integrations, including with smaller entities like myCicero in Italy and Skipr in Belgium and France, with planned integration with Germany&#8217;s Jelbi. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/bird-is-the-latest-operator-to-integrate-its-e-scooters-and-e-bikes-with-google-maps/'">recently also integrated with Google Maps</a>, alongside competitors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/">Spin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">Lime</a>, both of which are already featured in the Moovit app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bird&#8217;s vehicles can be found in over 300 cities globally, and the company is always looking for ways to increase its reach. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">the operator launched a &#8220;Smart Bikeshare&#8221; platform</a> that allows local shared e-bike and e-moped providers and transit apps to feature their vehicles on the Bird app. As micromobility increasingly becomes an integral part of the transport ecosystem, these types of cross-platform integrations are bound to continue surfacing.</p>
<p>Moovit, which says it has served over 1 billion urban users in over 1,500 cities across 112 countries, has about 300 mobility providers integrated into its app, including Tier, Voi, Beam, Helbiz, Beryl, Zwings, Revel and many more, according to the company. As part of the integration, Bird and Moovit plan to collaborate on urban mobility research in these regions to gain local perspectives on mobility trends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moovit&#8217;s goal is to simplify urban mobility around the world and make it more efficient, accessible and sustainable,&#8221; Sharon Kaslassi, global corporate communications manager at Moovit, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Integrating private sector companies such as Bird and Lime help support that goal by encouraging riders toward car-free, multimodal trips. It also provides people returning to their pre-COVID routines with easily accessible first- and last-mile options to choose from for more hassle-free travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moovit wants to be a true MaaS platform and that means offering more forms of alternative transport. Aside from micromobility integrations, Moovit On-Demand, the company&#8217;s shared mobility planning feature, is integrated into the Moovit consumer app in certain regions. Last November, Moovit partnered with SMART, a dial-a-ride transport operator outside Detroit, to modernize its service and reduce wait times. Now, locals can use the Moovit app to book those on-demand transit rides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moovit also powers a white label app for transport agencies and cities that want to offer on-demand shared mobility. Just this year, Australian bus provider Ventura launched a new on-demand service and app to Melbourne residents, called FlexiRide, which is powered by Moovit On-Demand, and two Scottish regions, the <a href="https://moovit.com/press-releases/moovit-partnership-scottish-borders-council/">Scottish Borders</a> and <a href="https://moovit.com/press-releases/moovit-aberdeenshire-council-partnership/">Aberdeenshire</a>, also launched similar services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public and shared transportation is the backbone of society, and Moovit&#8217;s goals are to harness the power of MaaS, driven by big data, to create a world with simpler, more intuitive ways of accessing and consuming transportation,&#8221; said Kaslassi. &#8220;Moovit aims to reduce congestion, grow ridership and increase mobility efficiency by guiding people in getting around using any mode of transport (except for using private vehicles).&#8221;</p>
<p>Moovit can be downloaded on the¬†<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moovit-train-bus-times/id498477945">App Store</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tranzmate&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fat tire e-bike manufacturer Rad Power Bikes just raised another $154 million. The Series D raise from existing investors, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $329 million, comes just eight months after Rad raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">$150 million.</a>¬†The Seattle-based startup aims to use the funds to boost investments in product and technology innovation and beef out its distribution network, according to founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>Rad‚Äôs latest round is led by institutional investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with investments from funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Vulcan Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP and The Rise Fund, TPG&#8217;s multisector global impact investing strategy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think the fact that some of the world‚Äôs most respected investors are doubling down just shows this competence in our business, both with the scale advantage that we have and also just the overall potential in the e-bike market,‚Äù Radenbaugh told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It‚Äôs Rad‚Äôs scale that the company is leaning on now in order to really become a powerhouse. Rad Power has launched dozens of new bike accessories and multiple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rad-power-bikes-reveals-more-user-friendly-next-gen-e-bike-radrover-6-plus-for-1999/">new e-bikes</a> this year, despite the supply chain shortages that have caused delays on product releases across industries. That‚Äôs in part due to the company‚Äôs diversified and dedicated supply chain. Rad has multiple source suppliers and manufacturing partners across continents to fall back on and has even started chartering its own vessels to ensure bikes are delivered, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/rad-power-bikes-founder-mike-randenbaugh-on-fueling-the-e-bike-revolution/">Radenbaugh told TechCrunch in a previous interview</a>.</p>
<p>Rad has also opened up multiple distribution centers this year, and by the end of the year, expects to triple its capacity to deliver bikes and accessories to customers within five days. The plan is to keep that momentum going into next year by adding more distribution centers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Europe in order to strengthen its logistics and fulfillment capabilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think of our business more like a solutions business, so it‚Äôs also our buy online experience and pickup in store experience, our integrations with our retail stores and mobile service centers and making all that a seamless customer experience,‚Äù said Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>The company says it will triple the number of physical locations of mobile service and retail stores by the end of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúOur business has been largely break-even or profitable, and it kind of fluctuates around break-even, so this is all growth capital,‚Äù said Radenbaugh. ‚ÄúIt&#8217;s all just designed to flow into expansion of our operations, customer service and innovation.‚Äù</p>
<p>For Radenbaugh, the guy who started building e-bikes at 15 years old, expanding Rad Power Bikes isn‚Äôt just about growing his business. It‚Äôs about making green transportation more accessible. It‚Äôs about getting people out of their cars and back outside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúE-bikes are really the solution to a lot of our toughest challenges for the environment, and it‚Äôs the direct reason why customers are picking them up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt could be teens and professionals commuting to school or work, running errands, retirees reliving the joy of riding again, commercial last-mile customers. These people are buying the product because it‚Äôs a better tool for everyday life and mobility, but there‚Äôs the environmental side, too, which gets our investor base really energized around the business.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rad Power Bikes has 350,000 customers, so it has plenty of data on how people use its vehicles. The company found that more than 70% of customers ride their bikes more than several times per week. In addition, Rad‚Äôs number one acquisition channel is word of mouth and repeat customers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe richness of our data is starting to show something bigger happening here, a kind of consumer-led movement by passionate, high-use customers,‚Äù said Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>These are heartening statistics because they signal a shift in modes of transportation that we‚Äôre starting to see mirrored in the way cities look at cycling infrastructure. Radenbaugh said the company initially built powerful utilitarian bikes with throttles, big batteries and fat tires in large part to overcome poor infrastructure. Now as the company tries to become a brand that is synonymous with the future of mobility, it‚Äôs doubling down on government affairs and lobbying for better accessibility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that as an industry leader, Rad Power Bikes has a compelling market opportunity to fulfill the potential of e-bikes as an effective transportation and mobility solution globally,‚Äù said Andrew Davis, director of private investments at T. Rowe Price, in a statement. ‚ÄúIn our view, they have the management team, technology strength and operational expertise to succeed over the long term and to play an important role in addressing the world‚Äôs current and future climate challenges.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barcelona-based mobile keyboard software maker, <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/">Fleksy</a>, has bagged a $1.6 million Series A to cement a pivot to b2b for its white-label SDK for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>The round is led by Spanish asset management firm, Inveready, with follow on funding from some of the startup&#8217;s existing investors: SOSV and Simile Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The Series A brings the team&#8217;s total raised to date to just under $3M (‚Ç¨2.5M) since the business was founded back in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The AI keyboard maker has been a long time player in the third party smartphone keyboard space, initially developing a productivity-focused keyboard called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/04/thingthing-keyboard/">ThingThing</a> &#8212; before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/fleksy-keyboard-to-get-major-reboot-under-thingthing-dev-team/">acquiring the assets of better known US-based custom keyboard Fleksy</a> (which had gone into stasis after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/pinterest-acquires-the-team-behind-fleksy-a-custom-ios-and-android-keyboard/">dev team got acquired by Pinterest</a>) and making developing Fleksy the full focus.</p>
<p>However monetizing in the consumer custom keyboard space is tough going, with features like next word prediction and swipe inputting now baked into native smartphone keyboards, reducing the value of a third party add-on.</p>
<p>Tech giants like Apple and Google also throw their weight around in peculiar ways. (See, for eg, the flaky implementation of third party keyboards on iOS which helps dissuade users from switching away from Apple&#8217;s native keyboard. Or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/googles-play-store-is-giving-an-age-rating-finger-to-fleksy-a-gboard-rival/">this unfun thing Google&#8217;s Play Store did for a while</a>.)</p>
<p>So, last year, Fleksy rolled out an SDK &#8212; licensing its keyboard tech to other app makers and businesses who want powerfully predictive, context-specific, custom AI keyboard software which they can tint, brand and adapt in all sorts of ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The keyboard SDK could also be used by third parties to learn more about their users and/or seek to drive their own sales.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jkrccOXqAk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/fleksy-rolls-out-an-sdk-for-its-ai-keyboard/">Fleksy rolls out an SDK for its AI keyboard</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fleksy rolls out an SDK for its AI keyboard&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/fleksy-rolls-out-an-sdk-for-its-ai-keyboard/embed/#?secret=jkrccOXqAk" data-secret="jkrccOXqAk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among potential features which clients can implement via the SDK that it lists on its <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/solutions/">website</a> are the ability to bake context-specific advertising into the keyboard (aka, &#8220;hyper-contextually suggest products and services or set triggers to show your brand in any app at the opportune moment&#8221;); and a forthcoming CRM feature that Fleksy says will &#8220;enable shops to send marketing materials, invoices, updates, tasks, and even collect payment from the keyboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security focused features are also touted as &#8220;coming soon&#8221; &#8212; with custom tweaks that it says could be used to &#8220;prevent data leaks and sensitive information from getting out, monitor at-risk employees, Secure messages, prevent fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside this b2b play, Fleksy continues playing in the consumer space &#8212; where it strongly emphasizes user privacy as a differentiator for its software vs alternatives like Google&#8217;s Gboard (which sends users&#8217; search data to Google) &#8212; and most recently it was trying to entice consumers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fleksy-adds-an-art-marketplace-to-spice-up-its-keyboard-app/">art keyboards</a>.</p>
<p>But its center of gravity has clearly shifted to b2b. Hence foregrounding &#8216;Fleksy for Business&#8217; branding on its website, which has also had a deeptech aesthetic design makeover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.app.fleksy.com/fleksy-product">consumer keyboard</a> will still stick around, though &#8212; for the hardcore fans and, doubtless, as a useful showcase/testbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumer is hard when the giants don&#8217;t compete equally. See Apple mess and Google mess around that. So we found our profitable niche: Helping others build an outstanding keyboard experience and beyond, via license fees,&#8221; says Fleksy&#8217;s CEO Olivier Plante, who was also CEO and co-founder of ThingThing. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to build what we have built, so it&#8217;s now a no brainer for these digital companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleksy SDK gives all the tools that a company needs to thrive in their own rationale,&#8221; he also tells us when we raise the (privacy) question of how third parties might seek to use its keyboard tech to data-mine their own users. &#8220;Fleksy plays a technological role here only. We are not associated with a client&#8217;s own privacy stance.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he adds: &#8220;To be clear, Fleksy Consumer Apps will always be private &#8212; we don&#8217;t change our rationale there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fleksy says it now has &#8220;dozens&#8221; of companies licensing its tech &#8212; and touts 50 more in its &#8220;pipeline&#8221;. It also says revenue for its SDK business has grown 10x in a year.</p>
<p>This uplift explains the relatively modest size of the Series A, per Plante.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only needed this because we are generating quite a lot of money at the moment,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, adding that the reason for raising a Series A now is to &#8220;expand faster&#8221;.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for growth, hiring (to build out its 13-strong team) and to expand its portfolio of clients.</p>
<p>Fleksy&#8217;s best markets for licensing the keyboard tech to currently are the US and Europe but Plante says it has customers all over the world.</p>
<p>The SDK is also attracting a broad mix of customers &#8212; from digital health and fintech to gaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so many leads looking for a keyboard experience &#8212; as you can see under /<a href="https://www.fleksy.com/solutions/">solutions</a>/ on the website &#8212; these industries &#8212; and even more will all be powered by Fleksy tech,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have clients from all types with different needs and because we have built everything in-house &#8212; no third party&#8217;s black-box &#8212; we are able to modify everything for them. Which no other company can provide today. So companies in digital health for example have a profitable company to partner with who has full control over its tech stack,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleksy SDK can be modified in many ways: From the layout, dictionary all the way to the core engines that power our autocorrect, predictions, sentiment and more. It&#8217;s what makes us the right choice but, as you know, the vision is much larger &#8212; &#8216;Typing on a screen will be typing on Fleksy&#8217; in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the Series A funding round, Inveready&#8217;s Ignacio Fonts is joining Fleksy&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Fonts said: ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to join the <span class="il">Fleksy</span> team, which has been able to conquer a worldwide leadership position in keyboard technology, one of the control points of personal computing (phone, mobile, desktops) devices. This round will help them accelerate the development of a very compelling roadmap that will unveil to users new ways to interact with their devices and will provide companies new insights about their customers.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s world is run on data, and the amount of it that is being produced, managed and used to power services is growing by the minute &#8212; to the tune of some 79 zettabytes this year, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one estimate</a>. Today, a company called <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yugabyte</a>, which has built an open-source distributed SQL database model to help handle all that volume, is announcing that it has raised $188 million at a valuation of over $1.3 billion &#8212; a big round of funding and big valuation that underscore the market demand for better tools, and the demand that Yugabyte is in particular is seeing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C is being led by <span class="s1">Sapphire Ventures</span>, with <span class="s1">Alkeon Capital </span>and <span class="s1">Meritech Capital</span>, <span class="s1">Wells Fargo Strategic Capital</span>, and previous backers <span class="s1">Lightspeed Venture Partners</span>, <span class="s1">8VC</span>, <span class="s1">Dell Technologies Capital</span>, and <span class="s1">Wipro Ventures</span>, all also participating, among other unnamed backers. It was only seven months ago that the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/yugabyte-announces-48m-series-c-as-cloud-native-database-makes-enterprise-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed its Series B round</a> (which totaled $78 million).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo is one of Yugabyte&#8217;s key commercial customers, alongside Kroger, Hudson River Trading, Plume and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other organizations</a> that handle large amounts of data in their businesses, and in particular are looking for SQL-based solutions that can be used across multi-cloud, heterogeneous environments. The company tells me it is approaching 50 commercial customers currently. There are more using its open-source, free version, and it says that some 1,200 organizations &#8220;have signed up for&#8221; its fully-managed solution, Yugabyte Cloud, since its beta launch last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225620" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re at an inflection point in enterprise IT at the moment, where a years-long trend of organizations gradually migrating to the cloud &#8212; and in particular more complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments &#8212; has seen a massive acceleration, in large part due to Covid-19. The pandemic precipitated a bigger shift to companies producing more data internally due to working in more remote and distributed environments, in many cases using more cloud-based digital tools to do so; and it also led to a huge surge in the world at large using more digital services. The knock-on effect is a much greater need among organizations for better database solutions to manage and work with that data, but also the realities, and complexities, of how it exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large enterprises are really only just starting to hit critical mass of workloads,&#8221; Bill Cook, Yugabyte&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview, added that those enterprises also are balancing that with some key priorities: &#8220;They are thinking a lot about infrastructure, and they don‚Äôt want to get locked into a particular cloud provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yugabyte&#8217;s pitch is that it addresses that challenge with a framework that can scale easily and securely as needed. It currently provides three SQL products to the market covering different use cases: YugabyteDB, its free, open source distributed SQL database; Yugabyte Platform, its self-managed cloud database-as-a-service product; and Yugabyte Cloud, the fully-managed cloud DBaaS launched just in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005390/en/Yugabyte-Delivers-Effortless-Distributed-SQL-With-Cloud-Database-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a>.</p>
<p>Yugabyte itself was borne out of first-hand experience of how other systems didn&#8217;t work as well. The startup&#8217;s founders &#8212; Kannan Muthukkaruppan (president), Karthik Ranganathan (CTO) and Mikhail Bautin (software architect) originally worked together at Facebook. There, they built the NoSQL database that powered Messenger, where they came away realising some of the shortcomings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially very taken with the NoSQL &#8220;market success, we then realized the limitations of it,&#8221; said Ranganathan, who is Yubabyte&#8217;s CTO. &#8220;It&#8217;s very different to deal with these databases in production.&#8221; Specifically, as Cook described it, trends in microservices, containerization, services distribution, open source and API usage (and thus high latency and availability), are best addressed not through NoSQL but a distributed SQL database.</p>
<p>Jai Das, the president of Sapphire who is joining the board with is round, said that this is also what motivated him to lead this round.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;There hasn‚Äôt been any SQL innovation since MySQL,&#8221; he said, in particular to address the fact that many of the largest entprises now work with distributed databases, either because they have opted to do so, or they are required to because of regulatory demands or simply because that is how their networks and systems have evolved. Das believes that SQL will be at the heart of how databases will continue to evolve. &#8220;It is the lingua franca of how all applications will be built in the back end, and Yugabyte is the next generation.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Co-founder and CEO Grant Lee refers to building content in Gamma like ‚Äúchoosing your own adventure.‚Äù]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grant Lee has been living in slide decks for most of his career, but it wasn‚Äôt until he was doing some advisory work last year that relied heavily on slides that he aimed to reimagine the format.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSlides were built for a different era of work,‚Äù he told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúThey were more of a visual aid. You had to have a presenter because they have little standalone power without the person.‚Äù</p>
<p>Previously, people would print off slides or watch the presentation together on one screen, but the overall problem of people sharing and communicating their work has existed for a long time. Lee said. Slides have been around for over 30 years, and now everyone has their own screen.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So Lee and his co-founders, James Fox and Jon Noronha, all former Optimizely employees (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">Optimizely was acquired by Episerver in 2020</a>), started <a href="https://gamma.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamma</a>, a software that enables users to build stacks of cards that fit a brand‚Äôs aesthetic and prioritize design by linking different bits of content, like videos and embeddable forms that can be filled out in real time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225076" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225076" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225076 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg" alt="Gamma" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225076" class="wp-caption-text">The Gamma team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gamma</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Gamma was to create something that still feels familiar to the traditional slide, but that also ‚Äúunlocks a whole new set of super power,‚Äù Lee said. He refers to building content in Gamma like ‚Äúchoosing your own adventure,‚Äù and the content can be dragged, dropped uploaded and fit into the cards. And though the presenter is guiding the conversation, watchers can explore the content themselves and then go back to following the presentation.</p>
<p>The company was founded last November, launched in private beta in August and is now announcing $7 million in seed funding led by Accel. Other participants in the round include Zoom CEO Eric Yuan; former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner; founders at Airtable, Patreon, Segment, Honey and Optimizely; and early-stage funds including Script Capital, South Park Commons, LocalGlobe, Afore and Hustle Fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we came out of stealth in August, we were talking to Accel and thought they were the right partner,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúInvesting in a new medium can be difficult, but we were excited about crafting the right building blocks. The new funding will allow us to build out the team and the product, and it will help having the right partner.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gamma is now out of private beta and Lee said there are thousands of people on the waitlist to be onboarded. It is too early to discuss growth metrics, due to the company not yet having paying customers, but there will be some paid plans down the road, he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new funding will accelerate the company‚Äôs goal of doubling its stores in the U.S. and Europe.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish food tech company <a href="https://nicks.com/">N!CK‚ÄôS</a> is taking on the world, one healthy ice cream pint at a time.</p>
<p>The company on Thursday announced $100 million Series C funding toward creating additional healthy snacks and ice cream products that have a proprietary blend of sweeteners and ingredients, but with a fraction of the calories and no added sugar.</p>
<p>Kinnevik, Ambrosia and Temasek co-led the round and were joined by Gullspang. The latest funding gives the company $160 million in total investments, Carlos Altschul, N!CK‚ÄôS CEO North America, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>N!CK‚ÄôS got started in 2017 in Europe when founder and head of R&amp;D Niclas Luthman‚Äôs mother was diagnosed as a diabetic, and Luthman diagnosed as pre-diabetic, according to Altschul.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúHe recognized that there was not a lot of food science bringing better-for-you solutions to the space,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe found that it was easier to change the food versus change the way we eat.‚Äù</p>
<p>In Europe, the company makes ice cream, snack bars and confectionery products. However, Altschul says N!CK‚ÄôS is a snacking brand that is ‚Äúa platform for changing culture.‚Äù The innovation and ingredients, all rooted in the company&#8217;s R&amp;D, are what differentiates the company from its competitors, he added.</p>
<p>The company has been busy over the past two years. At the end of 2019, N!CK‚ÄôS entered the United States with ice cream and is now leading in velocity per store in that category, he added. It also launched a vegan dairy line featuring Perfect Day‚Äôs proprietary animal-free dairy proteins and plant-based alternative fat.</p>
<p>Its direct-to-consumer business launched in 2020 and has remained at the top of the DTC ice cream delivery space since July, Altschul said. This year, the company launched a line of Keto protein bars, starting on its direct-to-consumer and Amazon channels, with plans to expand into retail stores by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, N!CK‚ÄôS expanded from 4,500 U.S. stores to 6,700, and expanded in the U.K. through a partnership with WHSmith.</p>

<p>The new funding will accelerate the company‚Äôs goal of doubling its stores in the U.S. and Europe, hiring additional talent, marketing and making investments in R&amp;D so that it can launch new products.</p>
<p>Magnus Jakobson, investment director at Kinnevik, said he has been investing in the food space for a few years and says the industry is attractive due to the multiple tailwinds of sustainability and health happening at the moment, which is driving demand and the upstream ability to build brands.</p>
<p>He considers it ‚Äúan exciting point in time,‚Äù that the traction N!CK‚ÄôS has shown to date ‚Äúis impressive,‚Äù especially having done it on its own initially, and that strategy has now attracted other food technology partners.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow people live and consume food is changing and is what is enabling new brands to be built,‚Äù Jakobson said. ‚ÄúCompanies like Oatly, Beyond and Impossible started the industry, but we have seen more breakouts in technology and new ways of reaching consumers with standalone brands. N!CK‚ÄôS is a super exciting one, and even in the early days of the industry, is showing promise.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia could be next to mandate a choice screen in a bid to break Google&#8217;s dominance of the search market.</p>
<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is recommending it is given the power to &#8220;mandate, develop and implement a mandatory choice screen to improve competition and consumer choice in the supply of search engine services in Australia&#8221;.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/DPB%20-%20DPSI%20-%20September%202021%20-%20Full%20Report%20-%2030%20September%202021%20%283%29_1.pdf">new report</a> by the country&#8217;s competition watchdog concludes that interventions are needed to boost competition in the local search engine market and address harms flowing from Google&#8217;s circa 94% marketshare of search in Australia, such as barriers to entry for other competitors and the risk of lower quality services with what it dubs &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/">undesirable features</a>&#8221; &#8212; like more sponsored content vs organic search results&#8230;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225600" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fv0a873HNU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/">Google&#8217;s latest user-hostile design change makes ads and search results look identical</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s latest user-hostile design change makes ads and search results look identical&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/embed/#?secret=Fv0a873HNU" data-secret="Fv0a873HNU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s grip on the local search market is also hampering new business models emerging &#8212; such as subscription options that don&#8217;t rely on ads (and data-mining users) to monetize Internet search.</p>
<p>The report gives the example of <a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>, a new, subscription-based search engine &#8212; which advertises itself as &#8220;the only ad-free private search engine&#8221; &#8212; and (unlike Google most other search engines) has no ads or affiliate links in search results &#8212;¬† thereby offering &#8220;a different value proposition that consumers may desire&#8221;, in the regulator&#8217;s assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google‚Äôs foreclosure of key search access points through the arrangements discussed in this Report limits the ability of these businesses to grow, and consumers‚Äô exposure to new and potentially attractive business models,&#8221; the ACCC concludes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To tackle such problems, the regulator wants to be able to implement a search choice screen on Android devices which will provide users with a selection of options vs Google&#8217;s &#8220;predetermined default&#8221; &#8212; with the regulator saying that such a mechanism &#8220;can improve the ability of rival search engines to reach consumers&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the ACCC also wants to be responsible for developing the criteria around the application of a choice screen to specified service providers &#8212; which its report notes should be &#8220;linked to the provider‚Äôs market power and/or strategic position&#8221;.</p>
<p>That looks like a key qualification given Google has been offering a search choice screen in the European Union to users of Android smartphones for around three years &#8212; and there has been no notable shift in its regional dominance of search.</p>
<p>That can be blamed on the EU leaving it up to Google to determine how to &#8216;remedy&#8217; the $5BN &#8216;cease &amp; desist&#8217; antitrust enforcement it issued against Google over Android back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>Google responded by adding a &#8216;choice&#8217; screen of its own devising in the EU &#8212; which search rivals quickly decried.</p>

<p>They were especially incensed about a sealed bid auction model Google opted for &#8212; selling slots on the choice screen to rivals, without needing to pay to continue displaying its own search engine on the very same screen of course.</p>
<p>This resulted in Android choice screens that were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/europes-android-choice-screen-keeps-burying-better-options/">filled with an uninspiring parade of Google-style ad-targeting wannabies</a> or else Google itself as the offered &#8216;choice&#8217; &#8212; almost entirely excluding pro-privacy or not-for-profit alternatives who were unable to outbid data-mining rivals.</p>
<p>The entirely predictable result was that Google has maintained its iron grip on Europe&#8217;s search market. And laughed all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>Eventually the European Commission did step in &#8212; and, this summer year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/#:~:text=EU%20pressure%20%7C%20TechCrunch-,Google%20ditches%20pay-to-play%20Android%20search%20choice%20auction%20for,free%20version%20after%20EU%20pressure&amp;text=Google%20is%20ditching%20a%20massively,be%20able%20to%20freely%20participate.">Google announced it would drop the auction model</a> and instead let search rivals appear for free.</p>
<p>However alternative search engines, such as the non-tracking DuckDuckGo, remain highly critical of remedy, arguing that for a choice screen to truly work regulators must tackle the whole suite of damaging defaults Google applies to lock users to its products.</p>
<p>The EU implementation, for example, only applies to new Android devices (and not also to Chrome), and only on set-up or factory reboot of a device.¬†DuckDuckGo&#8217;s counter suggestion is that regulators must make search competition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">a single click away</a> at all times.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="erIsR7Kx5z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">DuckDuckGo presses the case for true &#8216;one-click&#8217; search competition on Android</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DuckDuckGo presses the case for true &#8216;one-click&#8217; search competition on Android&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/embed/#?secret=erIsR7Kx5z" data-secret="erIsR7Kx5z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Australia&#8217;s watchdog appears aware of such pitfalls &#8212; writing: &#8220;The development of a choice screen and its implementation should be subject to detailed consultation with industry participants and user testing, and there should be careful consideration of its interaction with other measures proposed in this Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, it&#8217;s leaning towards the choice screen¬†applying to both new and <em>existing</em> Android mobile devices &#8212; which is immediately a considerably broader application than Google chose to apply in the EU (giving itself a free pass to keep applying its damaging defaults on the hundreds of millions of already in-play Androids).</p>
<p>The ACCC also stipulates that an Australian Android choice screen should be free for search engines to participate in. So the lesson of Google&#8217;s self-serving EU auction model has clearly trickled down under.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s watchdog also wants wider powers to be able to effectively tackle the lack of competition in search &#8212; suggesting it will need measures to restrict a provider (&#8220;which meets pre-defined criteria&#8221;) from tying or bundling search services with other goods or services; and perhaps also limit the ability of a provider to pay for certain default positions.</p>
<p>The report also floats the idea of &#8220;potentially mandating access to specified datasets for rival non-dominant search engines&#8221;.</p>
<p>The regulator suggests rivals may need access to Google&#8217;s click-and-query data &#8212; &#8220;and potentially other datasets&#8221; &#8212; though it adds that this would need to be subject to &#8220;extensive consideration of privacy impacts, and careful design and ongoing monitoring to ensure there are no adverse impacts on consumers&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are a number of factors that contribute to the quality of a search engine, click-and-query data is a critical input,&#8221; the report goes on. &#8220;In limiting rivals‚Äô ability to reach consumers at scale, Google has ensured it maintains access to an unrivalled dataset, allowing it to continuously improve the quality of its search results in a way that its competitors cannot, and reducing the extent to which rivals are able to scale and compete against Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has flow on effects for the ability of rival search engines to monetise their services, effectively self-reinforcing Google‚Äôs dominance in search. Google‚Äôs position means it can offer greater sums to suppliers of browsers and OEMs to be the default search engine. Rivals are thereby foreclosed from accessing users and the necessary click-and-query data to improve their search engine service, further raising barriers to entry and expansion, and extending and entrenching Google‚Äôs dominance in search.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the ACCC is considering some meaty interventions against Google&#8217;s dominance of search, actual action appears some way off &#8212; with a fifth interim report, that&#8217;s not due until September 2022, set to consider a framework for the proposed rules and powers, along with a broader assessment of the need for ex-ante regulation for digital platforms &#8212; &#8220;to address common competition and consumer concerns we have identified across digital platform markets&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reports are part of work ordered by the Australian government last year &#8212; when it instructed the regulator to conduct an <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platform-services-inquiry-2020-2025">inquiry into digital markets</a> and report back every six months. However the final report is not due until March 2025.</p>
<p>The EU of course has already proposed ex ante rules to tackle platform giants, under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a>, which was presented at the end of last year. Though is likely years off being adopted.</p>
<p>The UK is also working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">a competition reform</a> that will give regulators pre-emptive powers over tech giants who are deemed to have strategic market power. But, again, a dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a> is pending a suite of legislative powers.</p>
<p>While Germany &#8212; which is ahead of the pack &#8212; updated its digital regulations at the start of this year, bringing in ex ante powers to tackle platforms. Its competition watchdog, the FCO, is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">assessing</a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">market</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">power</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">a number of tech giants</a> to determine how it might intervene to support competition.</p>
<p>Germany suite of probes includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">a close look at Google&#8217;s News Showcase product</a>, through which the tech giant licensed news publishers&#8217; content by inking closed door commercial deals which risk playing large publishers off against smaller ones, among other competition concerns.</p>
<p>Australia has already passed legislation in this area &#8212; putting a news bargaining code into legislation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">back in February</a> that applies to both Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the ACCC report, Google sent us this statement attributed to a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúPeople use Google Search because it‚Äôs helpful, not because they have to and its popularity is based on quality that‚Äôs built on two decades of innovation. Android gives people choice by allowing them to customise their device &#8212; from the apps they download, to the default services for those apps. Preinstallation benefits users by making it easier for them to use services quickly and easily. We are continuing to review the report and look forward to discussing it with the ACCC and Government.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">Dragos</a> has raised $200 million in Series D funding at a valuation of $1.7 billion. The investment, which Dragos says is also the largest funding round achieved by an industrial cybersecurity firm, was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies and BlackRock.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to accelerate the company‚Äôs global expansion and support customers in key growth markets including electric, oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, water, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt trying to raise the Series D round,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch. &#8220;What ended up happening was because people realized how important operational technology is, and you‚Äôve got the president <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-further-actions-to-protect-u-s-critical-infrastructure/">talking about it</a>, the investment community woke up to the opportunity.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dragos was founded in 2016 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/dragos-premium-people-profits/">detect and respond to threats</a> facing industrial control systems (ICS), the devices key to the continued operations of power plants, water systems, and other critical infrastructure.</p>

	</p>
<p>The company‚Äôs latest investment ‚Äî <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">which follows a $110 million in Series C round in December last year</a> ‚Äî comes at a time of explosive growth for industrial cybersecurity, and a rise in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure. In May and June this year, ransomware attacks targeted Colonial Pipeline and the IT network of meat maker JBS, forcing the companies to shut down their industrial operations.</p>
<p>Lee said it&#8217;s forcing organizations to reassess the security of their operational technology, or OT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll these CEOs and board directors have never not understood that they make money out of OT, but when the pandemic happened, they&#8217;re going, ‚ÄòHoly crap, we need to do a lot more&#8217;,&#8221; said Lee. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs been driving momentum in a way we couldn‚Äôt have predicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dragos said it saw year-on-year growth of 100% in platform recurring revenue, as well as success on the national security front, fueled by its unique Neighborhood Keeper technology, a visibility solution that shares ICS threat intelligence across industries and geographic regions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen a giant policy shift with the Biden administration to call out the necessity of ICS,&#8221; Lee says.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for Dragos? Lee tells TechCrunch that the company&#8217;s intention is to IPO, though he said it&#8217;s by no means an immediate priority for the company.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs right for our customers is to stay long-term independent, and I don‚Äôt see how anything other than an IPO once you‚Äôve taken venture capital keeps you independent,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We‚Äôve had all the multi-billion dollar acquisition offers along the way, but if my son is going to have lights and water when he grows up, it‚Äôs going to be based on us being independent long term.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two months into 2021, South African fintech Stitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/">came out of stealth</a> and raised $4 million in seed funding, allowing it to begin to make</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†inroads into Nigeria some months ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Stitch formally announced the expansion into Nigeria and a seed extension of $2 million to go with it; the total seed investment now stands at $6 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in the round include existing backers Raba, Firstminute Capital, CRE, Village Global, 500 Fintech, Future Africa, and Norrsken. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executives at global fintechs, participated as well. They include Tom Blomfield, co-founder of Monzo and GoCardless; Matt Robinson, co-founder of GoCardless; Emilie Choi, president and COO of Coinbase; and Charlie Delingpole, founder of ComplyAdvantage.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Stitch launched the typical Plaid playbook used globally by fintech infrastructure players: a data product to help developers and fintechs connect their applications to users‚Äô financial accounts. These businesses can then access their identities, accounts, transaction history and balances with users‚Äô consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Stitch had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched from stealth, it felt too early for the company to divulge how many financial accounts it had connected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine months in, the company still isn‚Äôt enthused about sharing those numbers, though </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it has been testing a payments product and has made significant progress there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African fintechs most times rely on card payments, and despite the infrastructure provided by the likes of Yoco, Flutterwave and Paystack, there are still issues around chargeback fees and fraud costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, Stitch decided to address these issues and help businesses process payments better by soft launching its pay-by-bank feature.¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOnce you make the user experience even more frictionless for pay-by-bank, and as tokenizable as card, the choice to use this method over others [particularly for fintechs] is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> straightforward,‚Äù <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/kiaan-pillay-887979106">Kiaan Pillay</a>, the co-founder and CEO of Stitch, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillay says that within six months of its soft launch in South Africa, the company has seen more than 50% month-on-month growth in customer and payments volume across all solutions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, Stitch has also been testing its payments product instead of its primary data product.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, the company had a more compelling use case of the payments product in Nigeria after speaking to over 40 fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here‚Äôs why: Nigeria has an efficient instant bank settlement system and the option to pay via bank in various fintech applications is relatively standard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is that when customers try to pay via their mobile or internet banking app, they must </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use their mobile bank application to complete the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Stitch, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, users do not need to go through that hassle and can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once-off, recurring and user-not-present bank transfers, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe opportunity is ripe,‚Äù said Pillay, who co-founded Stitch with</span><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/ncthbrt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie Cuthbert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/priyen-pillay"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Priyen Pillay.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more and more API fintechs are recognizing that paying via credit card interchange comes with a high fee when converting customers onto their platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month alone, we‚Äôve seen our inbound requests increase five- to tenfold here in South Africa, and customers are integrating us in Nigeria even as we were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still in soft launch.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now fully live in South Africa and Nigeria, Stitch says it is on track to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $10 million in monthly payments by the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of its clients include Chipper Cash, Paystack, Franc, Sanlam, Yoco and Flexclub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When open banking startups came into the African fintech scene last year, it seemed there was a race to become Africa‚Äôs Plaid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, each player has settled in their respective markets &#8212; Pngme in Kenya and Nigeria; Mono in Nigeria and Ghana; Okra in Nigeria, with beta in South Africa and Kenya; and Stitch in South Africa and Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear how important Nigeria is as a market for these startups. So how does Stitch plan to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customers in a market where other competitors offer the same payments product?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúFor a start, we are offering Nigerian businesses who intend to use Stitch free access to the product until the end of 2021,‚Äù <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/benjamindada">Benjamin Dada</a>, the country manager of Stitch Nigeria, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dada will spearhead Stitch‚Äôs operations in Nigeria. Before joining the company, he was the founder and editor-at-large at Nigerian tech publication <a href="https://www.benjamindada.com/">Benjamindada.com</a>. The country manager‚Äôs fintech experience comes from working at partnerships for Eyowo, a Nigerian digital bank and a brief stint at Tiger Global-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">FairMoney</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Dada believes the market is big enough to accommodate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players, he says the team will try to edge others by developing ‚Äúinclusive and sustainable‚Äù pricing for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThey will not only be achieving cost savings by accepting account payments, but they can now earn a little more for each payment they accept via Stitch,‚Äù he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the company intends to do that is murky for now. What is clear, though, is that the company plans to launch its data solution by the end of November</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed extension will be integral to that and to seeing more hires join Dada and his team in Lagos, Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blomfield said in a statement that he backed Stitch because he sees the company playing a crucial role in building the infrastructure to enable exponential growth for digital finance companies in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI see a lot of potential in African markets, where the wave of digital finance innovation is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beginning to gain momentum, and the Stitch team is getting in at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">precisely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right time. The team is one of the best I‚Äôve seen globally, and I‚Äôm excited to see them continue to grow in Nigeria and beyond.‚Äù</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estonian on-demand transport firm <a href="https://bolt.eu/">Bolt</a> is set to roll out electric taxi options in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt‚Äôs plan follows the introduction of a ‚Äògreen category‚Äô ‚Äì which lets riders hail an electric or a hybrid vehicle. This comes as the company expands its services to environmentally friendly modes of transport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe are looking to roll out a green taxi category in South Africa in the next few months, and plan to roll out green categories in other African markets,‚Äù said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt‚Äôs regional director for Africa and Middle East, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Partridge.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company already offers a green option in Kenya, where it also runs e-bike food delivery. It also plans to launch e-mobility options for food delivery in its other markets across East Africa, including Uganda and Tanzania.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013 by Markus Villig, the tech firm, which has operations in 45 countries &#8211; including seven in Africa &#8211; runs a gamut of services comprising ride-hailing, car, scooter and bike rentals, food delivery, and recently grocery delivery, fashioning itself as a transport and deliveries company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIn East Africa we see a lot of potential on the motorbike side, and especially for delivery. We plan to invest more in this direction as it also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves to eliminate the challenges associated with constantly fluctuating fuel prices, currently the most significant operating cost for our couriers,‚Äù said Partridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities for electric mobility are said to be huge, but a majority of countries lack the necessary infrastructure to support their adoption, says a UNEP</span><a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/25188/EMOB_OpportunitiesChallenges.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of recharging infrastructure, low grid power connectivity, and generally expensive e-vehicles remain hindrances to the adoption of electric transportation options in many African countries.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A transition to electric power would offer countries in sub-Saharan Africa a range of gains, including affordable transport and a reduction in emissions, with fossil-fuel vehicles contributing 12% of the region‚Äôs total emissions, according to the</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00721-7.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SSA Nature Sustainability report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt is planning arrangements with banking institutions in its markets in Africa to help its drivers access credit for purchasing electric vehicles, exploring other options away from its current scheme with leasing companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe purchase cost and import duties are often high, thereby deterring ownership. We are exploring a number of vehicle financing partnerships in Kenya and South Africa for electric cars and bikes, which would help make it easier for drivers to get access to, and eventually own, electric vehicles,‚Äù he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company‚Äôs plan to expand its offering across the continent comes in the wake of growing competition from companies such as Uber, which is currently testing a carpooling service in Nairobi, with plans to roll it out in Ghana and Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt recently launched the food delivery service in Nigeria, and also expanded its reach in South Africa by rolling out the service in Johannesburg after introducing it in Cape Town last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes in the wake of the company‚Äôs recent $696 million (‚Ç¨600M) funding round that the tech firm said will go into growing the new grocery delivery service, Bolt Market, as well as in expanding its other transport and delivery services.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Capital, Tekne Capital, and Ghisallo, G Squared, D1 Capital, and Naya Capital are some of the investors that participated in the funding round that increased its valuation to ‚Ç¨4 billion. The new funding came after the International Finance Corporation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/ifc-backs-bolt-with-24m-to-expand-its-transportation-network-in-emerging-markets/">injected $24 million </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/ifc-backs-bolt-with-24m-to-expand-its-transportation-network-in-emerging-markets/">(‚Ç¨20)</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/ifc-backs-bolt-with-24m-to-expand-its-transportation-network-in-emerging-markets/"> into the business at the beginning of the year</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the services it is looking to grow is Bolt Drive, the car rental service launched early this year to offer different choices including compact, mid-size, electric, premium, SUV, and van. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is currently available in Estonia‚Äôs capital Tallin with plans to roll it out in other Europe and Africa markets. Bolt Drive adds to the micro-mobility options ‚Äì scooters and e-bikes ‚Äì that the company introduced in line with its goal of availing to the masses, more budget environmentally friendly transport solutions. The e-mobility service is available in over 100 cities across Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe continue to scale up our operations for the benefit of our customers.¬† Our core business is to provide reliable, safe and affordable transportation services to everyone and we are excited to make travel easier and quicker in many cities across the continent,‚Äù said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partridge.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It‚Äôs fairly simply: Softwood grows a lot faster &#8211; in ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô forests &#8211; than hardwood. The latter is often found in bio-diverse old-growth forests like, um, the Amazon. So if you could make softwood behave like hardwood, you‚Äôd not only access more sustainable wood for construction, you‚Äôd also protect hardwood forests from destruction. Plus, you save a lof of GHG emissions.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the reasoning behind what <a href="https://us.kebony.com/">Kebony</a>, has come up with. Billing itself as a ‚Äòwood modification technology company‚Äô, Kebony has now raised a ‚Ç¨30 million ($34M) funding round led by Jolt Capital and Lightrock. And how it does this is fascinating.</p>
<p>Kebony starts with sustainably harvested wood, then modifies that wood with waste coming from the food production process associated with sugarcane and corncobs. The company says this can give the wood a long-lasting character which actually mirrors the behavior and characteristics of tropical hardwoods.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, as the construction industry increasingly looks for greener construction materials, using this type of material makes a lot of sense, not to mention the fact that it might well reduce tropical deforestation.<br />
¬†<br />
Kebony claims this treatment transforms wood like pine into a wood with features that are ‚Äúcomparable, and in some cases superior, to those of precious tropical hardwoods.‚Äù It also says the process is superior to traditional wood treatment based on impregnation with wood preservatives.<br />
¬†<br />
Kebony‚Äôs financing round is led by Jolt Capital and Lightrock. They are joined by previous shareholders Goran, MVP, FPIM, PMV and Investinor, of which the latter two will remain represented on the board.</p>
<p>Kebony‚Äôs core markets are Europe and the US, where it plans to expand. The European timber market is worth in the region of ‚Ç¨3 billion for the residential and non-residential construction industries.<br />
¬†<br />
Norman Willemsen, Chief Executive Officer of Kebony said: ‚ÄúKebony produces the most beautiful and ecological wood on the market, with a superior quality that is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.‚Äù</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225354" style="width: 817px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225354" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg" alt="Kebony founders: Norman Willemsen (CEO) and Thomas Vanholme (CFO)" width="807" height="469" class="size-full wp-image-2225354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg 807w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Norman-Willemsen-CEO-and-Thomas-Vanholme-CFO.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225354" class="wp-caption-text">Kebony founders: Norman Willemsen (CEO) and Thomas Vanholme (CFO)</p></div></p>
<p>Antoine Trannoy, Managing Partner at Jolt Capital commented: ‚ÄúAt Jolt Capital we have a strong interest in material science companies which leverage their patented technologies to offer sustainable products. With over 20 years of R&amp;D in woodtech and a well-proven process that gives cultivated soft woods the desirable properties of hard tropical ones, Kebony is one of them.&#8221;<br />
¬†<br />
Kevin Bone, Partner at Lightrock added: &#8220;Kebony is perfectly positioned in the race for a decarbonized world with an ambition to be the leader within wood modification technologies.‚Äù</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kebony says it reported revenue growth of 23% in the first half of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, with a strong positive EBITDA.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Willemsen explained: ‚ÄúWhat we do actually is we impregnate the wood and put it in an autoclave. This changes the cell walls of the wood structure permanently and gives it a permanently changed character which actually lengthens the lifetime of the wood.‚Äù</p>
<p>Yes, but how scalable is it all, I asked?</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s actually very scalable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have two operations up and running right now. We&#8217;ve got basically a blueprint to scale it up further.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said compared to traditional materials, such as concrete and steel, their carbon footprint is ‚Äúsignificantly less. We have emissions of about 350 kilos, co2 per cubic metre. If we compare this to, for example, steel, or the traditional hardwoods, those are around 10,000 killos. So we&#8217;re a very small portion of those other materials.‚Äù</p>

<p><a href="https://wavemaker.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wavemaker Partners</a> doesn‚Äôt just want to invest in climate tech and sustainability startups. It also wants to help build them. Today, the Singapore-based firm announced the launch of <a href="https://wavemakerimpact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wavemaker Impact</a>, a venture builder that identifies potential business opportunities, finds seasoned entrepreneurs to turn those ideas into startups and acts like a co-founder as companies scale.</p>
<p>Wavemaker Impact is planning to a raise $25 million for its first fund and is currently looking for founders. The founding team includes Wavemaker managing partner Paul Santos; PropertyGuru founder and impact investor Steve Melhuish; Doug Parker, the former COO of Nutonomy; and Quentin Vaquette and Marie Cheong. Vaquette and Cheong led <a href="https://apac.engiefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENGIE Factory</a>, the sustainability-focused Southeast Asia venture arm of ENGIE Group, one of the world‚Äôs largest utility companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225561" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Santos told TechCrunch that Southeast Asia is filled with opportunities to create what Wavemaker Impact calls 100X100 companies, meaning they can generate $100 million in revenue while abating about 100 million metric tons of carbon. He says the firm has already identified over 50 issues that startups can address in sectors like land use and carbon sinks, agriculture and food, industrial processes and energy.</p>
<p>Vaquette and Cheong first met the Wavemaker team when it invested in <a href="https://www.tablepointer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TablePointer</a>, an energy efficiency startup that was one of the first companies to emerge from ENGIE Factory.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo us that was a real validation,‚Äù Cheong told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúIf you can follow the process and find the right entrepreneur to work with, you can build a company that has the ability to have a significant carbon impact, but also that the venture world recognizes is investable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Much of Southeast Asia‚Äôs economy is focused on regions that are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change. For example, researchers have found that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/21/world/asia/jakarta-sinking-climate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jakarta</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/climate/coastal-cities-underwater.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City</a> are at risk of being underwater by 2050.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚Äú120 million people in Southeast Asia rely on coastal regions for their livelihoods and that will all be significantly altered by climate change,‚Äù said Cheong. ‚ÄúOne of the things we learned from COVID is that Singapore is this gorgeous city, but if our neighbors aren‚Äôt doing well, that‚Äôs going to really destabilize the whole region.‚Äù</p>
<p>On the upside, Wavemaker Impact‚Äôs founders say people are paying more attention to finding solutions. ‚ÄúIt feels like the economy has woken up to the green transition in Southeast Asia, which is estimated to be an $2.7 trillion opportunity by itself,‚Äù Cheong said.</p>

Here are 4 books for autumn to understand what‚Äôs changing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/fall-climate-change-books/embed/#?secret=cbFEK3TaC1" data-secret="cbFEK3TaC1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wavemaker created its own emissions map focused on Southeast Asia, and found that 26% of the emissions in the region come from land use. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that is kind of unique to our region,‚Äù said Santos. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs create business models that can help fight climate change and seriously address climate emissions, solutions that work for our market and are based on local dynamics.‚Äù</p>
<p>Before launching Wavemaker Impact, the firm implemented an internal initiative called Green Wave to look at its carbon footprint and hold workshops for portfolio founders. After talking with them, Wavemaker&#8217;s team realized that many startups were already thinking about how to reach sustainability goals, so it created a pledge for companies to enact more initiatives as they scale up. (Wavemaker has invested in more than 140 companies and currently has $180 million in AUM across its three funds in Southeast Asia.)</p>
<p>But even entrepreneurs with a track record of founding successful companies might have concerns about launching a climate tech or sustainability startup. That‚Äôs one of the things Wavemaker Impact wants to address.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI met an entrepreneur yesterday and he said, ‚ÄòI feel like there‚Äôs a U-curve of learning, I‚Äôm on the downhill and I need to get deep before I get up,‚Äô‚Äù said Cheong. ‚ÄúOur pitch to him was, come work with us and you can start at least midway in your journey.‚Äù</p>
<p>For some entrepreneurs, the U-curve is thinking that they need a science background. ‚ÄúThe energy work is super complicated, it‚Äôs kind of opaque,‚Äù said Cheong. ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt been working for an energy transition for the last 10 years, you probably don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming next. There‚Äôs all this data out there about climate change and lot of it is quite academic. It‚Äôs hard to translate that into ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs the business opportunity here?‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where Wavemaker Impact and its network comes in.In addition to capital, Santos said part of Wavemaker Impact‚Äôs role will be acting as a co-founder, helping entrepreneurs identify opportunities, acquire their first customers, develop scalable business models and build teams. ‚ÄúOur value-add is saving time, through process and network,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Out of the 50 opportunities identified by Wavemaker in the climate tech and sustainability space, it is prioritizing 20 to match with entrepreneurs. For example, deforestation is a major issue in Indonesia, as land is cleared for palm oil crops. Another one is <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/09/13/simple-planting-switch-could-slash-rice-methane-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct-seeding rice crops</a>, which can reduce carbon emissions but hasn‚Äôt been widely adopted by farmers yet. All these are potential ideas for Wavemaker Impact entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have spaces where we know the TAM is big enough, the carbon potential is big enough and we know it‚Äôs possible, so we want to find somebody who is super passionate about the space, to talk to these farmers and understand how to build these companies,‚Äù said Cheong.</p>
<p>She added, ‚ÄúA lot of the time, people think that you need governments, you need scientists and R&amp;D and they‚Äôre like, ‚Äòhow do I, a guy who just built a big SaaS startup, make a difference?‚Äô Our message is that we know how to build companies that have this scale and growth trajectory, that can be venture grade opportunities and abate carbon. It‚Äôs not about impact or profit, it‚Äôs the two of those together, and we really believe we need entrepreneurs to make this change.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fiftyyears.com/">Fifty Years</a>, a six-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit with a portfolio that&#8217;s already rife with mostly deep tech companies &#8212; many with a good story to tell about how they can have an impact on the environment &#8212; just closed its third and newest fund with $90 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>The money isn&#8217;t coming from just anywhere. Firm cofounder Seth Bannon tells us the firm aimed to recruit founders of 20 so-called unicorn companies so that they would have a vested interest in &#8212; and could occasionally advise &#8212; its portfolio companies. He says that Fifty Years wound up instead with 44 &#8220;unicorn&#8221; founders, including from Spotify, Github, Skype, Supercell, Minecraft, Dropbox, Unity, Klarna, Zendesk, Kahoot, and Upstart.</p>
<p>Some of those founders were backed by Fifty Years, in fact, including the cofounders of the synthetic biology company Solugen, which is now valued by investors at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/solugen-raises-357-million-to-make-chemicals-and-plastic-from-plants.html">$1.8 billion</a> and which received its first check from Fifty Years; Astranis, a geostationary communications satellite operator that is currently valued at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/astranis-satellite-internet-raises-250-million-from-blackrock-others.html">$1.4 billion</a> and which also received its first check from Fifty Years; and Opentrons, a maker of affordable lab robots that is now valued at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/softbank-invests-in-robotics-company-behind-nyc-covid-testing?sref=gni836kR">$1.8 billion</a> (which Fifty Years backed as part of a broader seed round).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, Fifty Years &#8212; which is run by Bannon; firm cofounder Ela Madej; and six other full-time people, including a synthetic biologist &#8212; has a pretty good story to tell about itself for such a young firm.</p>
<p>First, it has an undeniably interesting portfolio. In addition to space satellites and sustainable chemicals, the firm&#8217;s bets include Upside Foods, the food tech company that was formerly known as Memphis Meats (and whose valuation is also estimated to now be in the billion-dollar range). It&#8217;s also an investor in Varda, a space manufacturing company that has raised <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/varda-space-raises-over-50-million-to-build-space-factories.html">$51 million</a> and plans to make things in space to deliver back to earth.</p>
<p>Explains Bannon: &#8220;There are things like protein therapeutics, telecommunications fibers, and semiconductors that, because gravity interferes [with their production], you&#8217;d rather make without gravity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also unique, seemingly, is Fifty Years&#8217;s ability to connect with scientists and to help them start companies. It isn&#8217;t a matter of Bannon and Madej hanging out in college parking lots or tech transfer offices but instead creating initiatives that, while perhaps gimmicky, are also helpful for everyone involved.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of these is a PhD-to-VC program wherein Fifty Years, with the help of its broader networks, helps to educate PhDs (as well as doctoral program drop-outs) about the ins and outs of venture capital over 10 weeks so that they might find their way into the industry. The academics get to learn the lingo and processes that are part and parcel of the venture world, while Fifty Years gets to know the academics.</p>
<p>Fifty Years also has a &#8220;super nerdy&#8221; podcast called the &#8220;Translation Podcast,&#8221; wherein the lead author of a breakthrough paper in biology is asked to go through his or her background and what they aim to accomplish with their research.</p>
<p>And Fifty Years has a platform dubbed the &#8220;Fifty 50&#8221; that brings together 50 top biologists from labs across North America who are provided content on entrepreneurship &#8212; as well as companionship, including via a Slack channel and in-person regional events.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do this because we heard from top biology PhDs that academia can be very isolating and that it&#8217;s hard to meet people who even share your interests,&#8221; says Bannon.</p>
<p>Last but not least, a connection dating back to Y Combinator, which both Bannon and Madej passed through, presumably helps. For example, it was through YC that Fifty Years met <a href="https://buildcover.com/">Cover</a>, a fast-growing maker of modular homes an ADUs.</p>
<p>As for where its new capital might flow, Bannon says that synthetic biology remains a major area of interest, thanks largely to Solugen. &#8220;We&#8217;ve grown more active over time because the more a company begins to breakout, the more learnings you develop over time based on supporting that company, and the bigger your network in that space grows,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Madej is also &#8220;taking a deep dive into Web3 currently,&#8221; says Bannon. &#8220;We think enough core infrastructure has been built to allow people to build applications that create massive positive social impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifty Years will likely find willing co-investors along the way. Not only does Fifty Years have a portfolio it can brag about now, but unlike in 2015, when &#8220;we felt very lonely,&#8221; says Bannon, it&#8217;s &#8220;no longer fringe to say you can make great returns and make an impact. A ton of allies have come into this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very good news, as far as he&#8217;d concerned. &#8220;We don&#8217;t view anyone as competitive. We love working with Lowercarbon Capital. Chris [Sacca] has been an LP since our second fund and we love what they&#8217;ve been doing in climate. We like another firm, <a href="https://www.boomcap.co/">Boom Capital</a>, as well as <a href="https://cantos.vc/">Cantos</a>, which more or less exclusively partners with deep-tech impact companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are also a growing number of better-known venture outfits that &#8220;like really hard, really ambitious startups,&#8221; such as Founders Fund, he notes. Even still, says Bannon, there&#8217;s much more for the taking. When it comes to deep-tech investment firms, he says, in his view, &#8220;We probably need 10 times more of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifty Years now has $200 million in assets under management altogether.</p>
