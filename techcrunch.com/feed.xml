										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ExOne this week <a href="https://twitter.com/ExOneCo/status/1361753464309751815?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">announced that</a> the U.S. Department of Defense has granted it $1.6 million. It’s one of the Pennsylvania-based metal 3D printing company’s largest government contracts, in service of building a portable 3D printing factory for the front line – essentially a method for troops to fabricate broken and missing parts where the need them the most.</p>
<p>“Over the last two years, we’ve really focused on providing our technology into government-type applications: DoD, NASA, DoE,” CEO John Hartner tells TechCrunch. “Sometimes people talk about disrupting the supply chain and getting decentralized manufacturing. This is decentralized and forward deployed, if you will. Be it an emergency, humanitarian mission or frontlines for a war fighter.”</p>
<p>The money from the grant will specifically go toward R&amp;D and building the first unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ExOne is proud to have been awarded a $1.6M U.S. Department of Defense contract to develop a portable self-contained 3D printing “factory” housed in a shipping container.

<p>The system combines a series of machines with a software layer designed to lower the barrier of entry for use. While some training will be required, the hope is that people will be able to operate the system in the field.</p>
<p>“We’ve ruggedized the products that are going inside,” says Hartner. “There’s an element of software that makes the whole thing easier to use together. You start with scanning. So, there’s a possibility that you print from a cloud-based repository, but that may not be available for whatever reason, so you may have a broken part that you can scan and do some digital repair to the file and print.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devices rely on binder jet printing, the core tech behind ExOne’s machines. The system essentially composites powder, layer by layer to build up an object. ExOne expects to deliver the first system by Q3 2022. If all goes well, the parties will discuss further partnerships going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The day before <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a> goes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-hearings-congress-waters-robinhood/">under the the Congressional hammer</a>, domestic rival <a href="https://public.com/">Public.com</a> announced this morning that it has closed a $220 million funding round at a $1.2 billion valuation. News of the round was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/robinhoods-pain-is-publics-gain-as-vcs-rush-to-give-it-more-money/">first broken by TechCrunch</a>. Further reporting <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fintech-publiccom-valued-at-about-12-billion-in-round-led-by-tiger-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">colored in the lines</a> concerning the investment&#8217;s size and valuation range.</p>
<p>Confirming the funding news today, Public added a fresh metric to the mix, namely that it has reached one million members – over the course of just 18 months post-launch, the company was quick to point out.</p>
<p>That means that Public&#8217;s backers – its latest round was put together by prior investors, including Greycroft, Accel, Tiger Global, Inspired Capital and others – values the company at around $1,200 per current &#8220;member.&#8221; Whether or not that feels rich, we leave to you to decide.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But with rising interest in the savings and investing space – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/there-is-infinite-money-for-stock-trading-startups/">some data here</a> &#8212; and Robinhood&#8217;s revenues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">growing to a run rate of more than $800 million</a> in Q4 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">and looking even better at the start of 2021</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to see why investors are backing Public. It&#8217;s even easier if you believe that Robinhood&#8217;s brand has undergone material harm from its woes during the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gamestopo">GameStop</a> saga.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The pair, along with a host of other fintech services that offer savings and investing products, have been buoyed by a secular shift in banking away from the physical world (in-person shopping, bank branches, plastic cards) to the digital (neo-banks, ecommerce, virtual cards). Robinhood shook up the trading world with zero-cost investing, fitting neatly into the mobile and virtual banking future that is being built. And Public has taken that model a step further <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/">by dropping</a> payment for order flow (PFOF), a method revenue generation in which companies like Robinhood get a small fee for sending their users&#8217; trades to one particular market maker or another.</p>
<p>TechCrunch recently joked that it seems like &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/there-is-infinite-money-for-stock-trading-startups/">there is infinite money for stock-trading startups</a>,&#8221; in light of the anticipated Public round, which has now has arrived. Let&#8217;s see who is next to take home a big check.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally.io</a>, a software startup with a focus on the OKR (objectives and key results, in case you&#8217;ve somehow avoided being exposed) goal-setting technique, announced that it has closed $50 million in new capital. The Series C round was led by Green Oaks Capital, Madrona Capital, and its Series B lead, Tiger Global.</p>
<p>Ally raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/ally-raises-8m-series-a-for-its-okr-solution/">an $8 million Series A in August, 2019</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ally-raises-15m-series-b-to-scale-its-okr-focused-service/">a $15 million Series B in October of the same year</a>. The Series C is more than its A and B rounds put together – and doubled.</p>
<p>That Ally raised such a large round really wasn&#8217;t too big a surprise. OKR-software rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">Gtmhub raised a $30 million Series B earlier this year</a>, and companies in this particular software niche reported rapid-fire growth last year. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">collected growth metrics</a> from a host of companies competing in the OKR and corporate goal-setting market, including Ally. In 2020, <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a>, <a href="https://www.perdoo.com/">Perdoo</a>, <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a>, and Ally.io all grew in the triple digits.</p>
<p>In a blog post that TechCrunch saw before publication, Madrona investor and Ally backer S. Somasegar noted that &#8220;nearly $300 million&#8221; has been invested into OKR startups in the last two years. Such rapid growth from so many players in such a competitive space could signal a huge market.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mbAWonxKXj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">Rapid growth in 2020 reveals OKR software market&#8217;s untapped potential</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rapid growth in 2020 reveals OKR software market&#8217;s untapped potential&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/embed/#?secret=mbAWonxKXj" data-secret="mbAWonxKXj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ally&#8217;s latest round makes it clear that investors expect similar growth from the cohort in 2021.</p>
<p>For flavor, we got new growth numbers from Ally.io. Previously the startup had shared growth of 3.3x in 2020. Its CEO Vetri Vellore told TechCrunch in an email that Ally.io&#8217;s &#8220;revenue has increased by 5x and [has] added over 600 customers&#8221; since its Series B, which came around 15 months prior. That&#8217;s quick.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the sort of growth that venture investors want to own a piece of. So, even though Vellore told TechCrunch that his company has &#8220;most of [its] Series B money in the bank,&#8221; it decided to take on more capital &#8220;to accelerate further,&#8221; to which we&#8217;d add <em>because it could.</em></p>
<p>Ally did not have to twist arms to raise more. Vellore described the round as &#8220;extremely competitive&#8221; in an email, noting that he had &#8220;started the [fundraising] process in early January.&#8221; It&#8217;s just over mid-February, so the round came together quickly: &#8220;Within two weeks of starting the process, we were able to wrap it up,&#8221; the CEO wrote, adding that the investment &#8220;was heavily oversubscribed due to strong interest from both existing investors and our new investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The market for OKR software, and corporate goal-setting software in general, is proving to be large, and lucrative. Let&#8217;s see which rival player is the next to raise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers throughout the United States will now have the option to pay for street parking right from Google Maps as part of an expanded partnership with transportation software companies Passport and Parkmobile. Google also announced it was extending this contactless payment feature to public transit users.</p>
<p>Google Maps&#8217; pay for parking feature will expand first via Android to more than 400 U.S. cities, including Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York and Washington D.C. The feature will be available through the iOS version of the Google Maps app soon, the company said. The transit feature will include more than 80 transit agencies globally.</p>
<p>The parking feature, which integrates with Passport&#8217;s operating system, launched in Austin last year. The two companies indicated, at the time, that the feature would eventually roll out in other U.S. cities. While the expansion was expected, it&#8217;s still a boon for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/investors-find-a-spot-for-65-million-in-passports-parking-management-tech/">North Carolina-based startup</a>, which is now integrated in one of the most widely used navigation apps. The same goes for Parkmobile, which is also embedded in Google Maps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aim, according to Google Maps product manager Vishal Dutta and Google Pay&#8217;s Fausto Araujo, is to help drivers users pay for parking without having to touch a meter — a compelling feature in this era of COVID-19.</p>
<p>When navigating with Google Maps on iOS and Android, drivers in certain cities in the U.S. will see an option to pay for parking with Google Pay as they approach their destination. This means a user has to set up a Google Pay account, which is linked to a credit or debit card. From there, drivers add their meter number, the amount of time they wish to pay for, and complete the payment via Google Pay. Parkers can also add time to their meter from their Google Pay app without returning to their vehicle.</p>
<div class="article-meta__author-title">
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google said the payment feature has been extended to including transit fares for more than 80 transit agencies around the world. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ll be able to plan your trip, buy your fare, and start riding without needing to toggle between multiple apps,&#8221; Google wrote in a blog post.</span></p>
<p>The transit pay option pops up in Google Maps in the user&#8217;s directions. In places like San Francisco, users will also be able to buy a digital Clipper card directly from Google Maps. Once they&#8217;ve purchased their fare, the user just needs tap their phone on the reader or show their digital ticket.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a>, a low-code app development service, announced that it has closed $150 million in new capital. The round was led by Abdiel Capital and Tiger Global. Notably this is not the largest funding event that the Portugal and U.S.-based software company has raised. TechCrunch covered a $360 million round that OutSystems<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/portugals-outsystems-raises-360m-from-kkr-and-goldman-sachs/"> raised in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>OutSystems was founded in 2001, making it older than most companies that we cover on TechCrunch, and yet it remains privately held. And like many startups, it appears to have caught a tailwind from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">accelerating digital transformation</a> of companies both large and small.</p>
<p>By selling $150 million worth of its own shares at a $9.5 billion valuation, OutSystems parted ways with around 1.6% of itself in the deal. Investors would not be willing to buy such a tiny slice of a company for such a price if they didn&#8217;t have confidence in its future performance.</p>
<p>The new funds put OutSystems on an IPO path, we reckon; the company declined to discuss public market plans with TechCrunch. It could go out sooner rather than later. This round smells a bit like pre-IPO capital, and OutSystems touted its model to TechCrunch as &#8220;efficient&#8221; in a conversation about its new funding, implying moderate cash-consumption at worst.</p>
<p>TechCrunch had asked the company to break down its stated plan to invest its new capital in both go-to-market (GTM) capabilities and product (R&amp;D) work. OutSystems CEO Paulo Rosado told TechCrunch in an email that even before this announcement OutSystems was &#8220;steadily increasing both our R&amp;D and GTM capacity,&#8221; meaning that it was &#8220;investing for growth.&#8221; The company remains &#8220;focused on building scale in an efficient way,&#8221; the CEO added.</p>
<p>OutSystems works on <em>low</em>-code app development, in contrast to the startups and more mature private concerns that are focused on the <em>no-</em>code project; no-code tools do not involve code, while low-code services bring together some coding along with visual programming interfaces.</p>
<p>In an interview with Rosado in late 2020, he explained to TechCrunch the differences between no-code and low-code as both complexity (the ability to tackle heavy-duty internal corporate workflows) and extensibility (the ability to adapt).</p>
<p>In OutSystems&#8217; view low-code is simply better suited to creating material corporate apps. Here&#8217;s how the CEO explained it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is not low-code is worse than no-code. If no-code is very narrow, which most no-code tools are, when you get [a] change request that goes beyond what you can do visually, that&#8217;s it. The only answer that you have for the customer is &#8220;no, we cannot do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With low-code, you can do it. But you have to do it with code. You go, you [add] code, and the code then gets blended into the no-code portion.So low-code means it&#8217;s a no-code capability, with the possibility of jumping into code.</p></blockquote>
<p>No-code fans would argue that as their tools&#8217; ability to avoid code improves, the code-required portion of development that Rosado details will decline. Regardless, the OutSystem&#8217;s method approach to the market appears to be working, if its recent capital raise is any indication.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Subscription-based pricing is dead: Smart SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/embed/#?secret=3OJDGFlmGv" data-secret="3OJDGFlmGv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back to the round, to better understand of OutSystems&#8217; market position in both competitive and completeness terms, TechCrunch asked the CEO about its relative strength in customer pricing calls. He responded by saying that the OutSystem&#8217;s &#8220;pricing model is based on platform utilization&#8221; over traditional SaaS pricing. We could quibble with the company here – it does have seat limits on lower-priced tiers – but the focus on consumption over traditional SaaS reminded us more of on-demand software over what Salesforce pioneered. Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">the changes we&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS market lately</a>, it&#8217;s a distinction worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>Finally, how competitive is the low-code market that OutSystems&#8217; is now taking on with fresh funding? According to its CEO, their chief competitor is not some other startup, but, instead &#8220;non-consumption.&#8221; A bit like how Netflix is <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition">competing with sleep</a>, instead of HBO.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the no-code and low-code for quite some time. We put words together concerning OutSystem&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/02/outsystems-raises-55m-for-its-rapid-application-delivery-platform/">2016-vintage, $55 million round</a> for example. But lately it seems that the demand for corporate apps – be they no-code or low-code – does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/whats-ahead-for-no-code-and-low-code-startups/">appear to have accelerated</a>. In the last four or six quarters, startups in the less-code market have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps/">consistently reported high-demand to TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if the moment is enough to carry OutSystems all the way to the public markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has a host of big product updates coming this year, and it just detailed a lot of them in a blog post from Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan. Google&#8217;s streaming video site plans to expand its TikTok-esque Shorts mobile video creation and consumption tool to the U.S. (it&#8217;s currently in beta in India), make YouTube TV a more full-featured in-home cable alternative, add customization and control options to YouTube Kids and more.</p>
<p>Many of the product updates detailed by Mohan are expansions of existing tests and beta features, but there are also entirely new developments that could significantly change how YouTube works for both creators and audiences. YouTube&#8217;s focus on monetization and new formats also indicates a desire to keep creators happy, which makes a lot of sense in the context of the platform&#8217;s popular new mobile-first competitor TikTok.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a TL;DR of everything YouTube announced today for its 2021 roadmap:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Expansion of its in-video e-commerce shopping experience beyond the current limited beta</li>
<li>Expansion of <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632365">Applause tipping</a> feature</li>
<li>YouTube Shorts launching in the U.S.</li>
<li>Adding the ability for parents to specify individual channels and videos for their kids to be able to watch on YouTube Kids</li>
<li>New features for user playlists on YouTube Music, and making those playlists more discoverable to others</li>
<li>A new paid add-on coming to YouTube TV that offers 4K streaming, DVR for off-line playback, and unlimited simultaneous in-home streams</li>
<li>Automatic video chaptering for some videos that don&#8217;t have creator-defined ones</li>
<li>A redesigned YouTube VR experience focused on accessibility, search and better navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube has a big year planned, and some of these changes could significantly alter the dynamics of the platform. Making it possible for every creator to turn their channel in a mini shopping channel has a lot of potential to alter what it looks like to build a business on the platform, while YouTube TV&#8217;s transformation narrows the gap even further between that service and traditional cable and satellite provider offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon’s Day 1 Edition program pulled back the curtain ever-so-slightly on the company’s hardware development process. The initial class featured its Echo Frames smart glasses and Loop smart ring. Based on early user feedback, the company only opted to continue production on the former.</p>
<p>But it takes the idea even further. The program is akin to a kind of in-house crowdfunded pre-order program. Amazon presents a handful of concepts and potential customers vote with their pre-order. If the goal is met, they’ll bring the product to market. If not, they spike it. It’s not dissimilar to the “First Flight” program Sony Japan launched a little over five years back.</p>
<p>Clearly Amazon doesn’t wont for resources when it comes to launching products. But while a system like this isn’t necessary, I can certainly appreciate how it will facilitate letting the hardware team get a little weird with it. There have been a few exceptions from the company in recent years, with an Alexa-enabled Big Mouth Billy Bass, but as a rule, big corporations don’t often let really weird hardware concepts get all the way to production.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>There are three products in this first batch, and they run the gamut from straightforward to wacky. The common thread &#8212; at least with this round &#8212; is they all work with Alexa. I’d anticipate that will be the case going forward, but Amazon’s willingness to tip its hand has some very clear limits.</p>

<p>On the more mundane side is a Smart Stick Note printer. Basically you tell Alexa/Echo something and it will use thermal technology to print to an off-brand Post-it. The thermal tech means there’s no ink to replace. The idea is you can print, say, grocery lists and event reminders using voice. That’s up for a $90 pre-order (like Kickstarter/Indiegogo, prices will increase if/when these come to market).</p>

<p>The $35 Smart Scale is designed to work with an Echo Show. You say something like, “Alexa, ask Smart Scale how much sugar is in these blueberries,” or “Alexa, ask Smart Scale to weigh 200 calories of blueberries” and the smart screen will show off the nutritional information for the weighed amount.</p>
<p>The weirdest/most fun of the bunch is the Smart Cuckoo Clock. Following up on the much more mundane Echo Wall Clock, the proposed model adds a mechanical cuckoo to the mix. There’s also a removable pendulum, allowing users to mount it on a wall or stick it on a shelf. That one is $80 in pre-order.</p>

<p>The company isn’t listing specific goals, but each project will show the percentage toward completion (with no numbers listed). If the goal isn’t met, pre-orders won’t be charged and the company will move on to the next project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a> has created an open source observability trifecta that includes Prometheus for monitoring, Loki for logging and Tempo for tracing. Today, the company announced it was releasing enterprise versions of these open source projects in a unified stack designed specifically for the needs of large companies.</p>
<p>Company CEO Raj Dutt says that this product is really aimed at the largest companies in the world, who crave  control over their software. &#8220;We&#8217;re really going after at scale users who want a cutting edge observability platform based on these leading open source projects. And we are adding a lot of feature differentiation in the enterprise version along with 24/7 support from the experts, from the people who have actually created software,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Among those features is a set of plug-ins that lets these large customers pull data into the platform from leading enterprise software companies including Splunk, New Relic, MongoDB and Snowflake. The Enterprise Stack also provides enhanced authentication and security.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dutt calls this product self-managed to contrast it with the managed cloud versions of the product the company already has been offering for some time. &#8220;We have two main products, Grafana Cloud and now Grafana Enterprise Stack. Grafana Cloud is our hosted deployment model, and the Grafana Enterprise Stack is essentially licensed software that customers are free to run however they want, whether that&#8217;s on prem, in a colocation company like Equinix or on the cloud vendor of their choice,&#8221; Dutt explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xkP7JMDwVw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/grafana-labs-adds-a-free-tier-to-its-managed-observability-platform/">Grafana Labs adds a free tier to its managed observability platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grafana Labs adds a free tier to its managed observability platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/grafana-labs-adds-a-free-tier-to-its-managed-observability-platform/embed/#?secret=xkP7JMDwVw" data-secret="xkP7JMDwVw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They can also mix and match their deployments across the cloud or on-prem in a hybrid style, and the large enterprise customers that the company is going after with this product should like that flexibility. &#8220;It also allows them to hybridize their deployments, so they may decide to use the cloud for metrics, but their logs contain a lot of sensitive information [and they want to deploy that on prem]. And since it&#8217;s a composable stack, they may have a hybrid deployment that&#8217;s partly in the cloud cloud and partly on prem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When you combine this new enterprise version with the managed cloud version that already exists, it gives Grafana another potentially large revenue source. The open source products act as a driver, giving Grafana a way into these companies, and Dutt says they know of over 700,000 instances of the open source products in use across the world.</p>
<p>While the open source business model usually only turns a fraction of these users into paying customers, having numbers like this gives the company a huge head start and it&#8217;s gotten the attention of investors. The company has already raised over $75 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/grafana-labs-nabs-24m-series-a-for-open-source-based-data-analytics-stack/">a $24 million Series A 2019</a> and a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/17/2079144/0/en/Grafana-Labs-Raises-50-Million-to-Accelerate-R-D-Investments-in-Open-Source-Logs-Metrics-and-Composable-Observability.html">$50 million Series B</a> in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://edgybees.com/">Edgybees</a>, a company that helps businesses, first responders and military users accurately geotag and augment their aerial video streams in real time, today announced that it has raised a $9.5 million Series A round. The news comes almost exactly two years after the company announced its $5.5 million seed round. <a href="https://seraphim.vc/">Seraphim Capital</a>, which specializes in <a href="https://seraphim.vc/focus/">space tech investments</a>, led this new round. New investors <a href="https://refinery.com/">Refinery Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.lgtechventures.com/">LG Technology Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.kodemgrowth.com/">Kodem Growth</a>, as well as existing investors <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/">OurCrowd</a>, 8VC, <a href="http://www.verizonventures.com/">Verizon Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/about/company-overview/ventures.html">Motorola Solutions Venture Capital</a> also participated.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to ensure positive human outcomes during life-saving missions,” says Edgybees co-founder and CEO Adam Kaplan. &#8220;Our new partners will be key to continuing to push our mission forward. With their unique industry expertise, we are poised to expand our global footprint and drive innovation within the industry. We look forward to the next phase of growth, meeting the critical demands of the defense, public safety and critical infrastructure markets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Using the company&#8217;s Visual Intelligence Platform, users can easily register and track assets in video show by a drone, for example. The standard use case here would be to help first responders get an accurate picture of an evolving emergency on top of live images from the scene, with the ability to track all of their assets and personnel in real time. But Edgybees has also shown other use cases that range from tracking and visualizing golf games to insurance and defense use cases.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Edgybees, which had its start in Israel but is now based in San Diego, launches its Argus platform, which makes it easier for users to bring their own drone and other live video platforms to the service&#8217;s geo-registration engine.</p>

<p><span class="il">&#8220;Edgybees</span> solves a huge problem in spatial computing: how do you really know what you are seeing through fast moving airborne or other video feeds? <span class="il">Edgybees</span> brings together the real and virtual worlds and helps first responders save lives, industrial drone users save money, and defense teams get the mission done,&#8221; Ourcrowd CEO Jon Medved explained.</p>
<p>Similarly, Seraphim managing partner and CEO Mark Boggett noted that he thinks of Edgybees as a Google Maps fused with live video. &#8220;Their geo-referencing capability is a breakthrough technology that brings a new level of insight and usability to video streams from space, drones or bodycams. We are very excited about <span class="il">Edgybees</span>, not only for the innovation it brings to public safety and defense, but because its ability to be utilized in a wide range of industries,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv-based <a href="https://spectralops.io/">Spectral</a> is bringing its new DevSecOps code scanner out of stealth today and announcing a $6.2 million funding round. The startup&#8217;s programming language-agnostic service aims to automated code security development teams to help them detect potential security issues in their codebases and logs, for example. Those issues could be hardcoded API keys and other credentials, but also security misconfiguration and shadow IT assets.</p>
<p>The four-person founding team has a deep background in building AI, monitoring and security tools. CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondot/?originalSubdomain=il">Dotan Nahum</a> was a Chief Architect at Klarna and Conduit (now Como, though you may remember Conduit from its <a href="https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/6900-remove-search-conduit-com-redirect">infamous</a> toolbar that was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/10/confirmed-1-3b-mobilebrowser-toolbar-startup-conduit-is-splitting-still-mum-on-perion-acquisition/">spun off</a>), and the CTO at Como and HiredScore, for example. Other founders worked on building monitoring tools at Elastic and HP and on security at Akamai. As Nahum told me, the idea for Spectral came to him and co-founder and COO Idan Didi during their shared time at mobile application build Conduit/Como.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113774" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113774" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png 1853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dash-shot.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spectral</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We basically stored certificates for every client that we had, so we could submit their apps to the various marketplaces,&#8221; Nahum told me of his experience at Counduit/Como. &#8220;That certificate really proves that you are who you are and it&#8217;s super sensitive. And at each point at these companies, I really didn&#8217;t have the right tools to actually make sure that we&#8217;re storing, handling, detecting [this information] and making sure that it doesn&#8217;t leak anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nahum decided to quit his current job and started to build a prototype to see if he could build a tool that could solve this problem (and his work on this prototype quickly discovered an issue at Slack). And as enterprises move from on-premises software to the cloud and to microservices and DevOps, the need for better DevSecOps tools is only increasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The emphasis is to create a great developer experience,&#8221; Nahum noted. &#8220;Because that&#8217;s where we started from. We didn&#8217;t start as a top down cyber tool. We started as a modest DevOps friendly, developer-friendly tool.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113773" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1200x628-Spectral-post.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spectral</p></div></p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Spectral&#8217;s approach, which uses a machine learning model to detect these breaches across programming languages, is that it also scans public-facing systems. On the backend, Spectral integrates with tools like Travis, Jenkins, CircleCI, Webpack, Gatsby and Netlify, but it can also monitor Slack, npm, maven and log providers &#8212; tools that most companies don&#8217;t really think about when they think about threat modeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our solution prevents security breaches on a daily basis,” said <span class="il">Spectral</span> co-founder and COO Idan Didi. &#8220;The pain points we’re addressing resonate strongly across every company developing software, because as they evolve from own-code to glue-code to no-code approaches they allow their developers to gain more speed, but they also add on significant amounts of risk. <span class="il">Spectral</span> lets developers be more productive while keeping the company secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company was founded in mid-2020, but it already has about 15 employees and counts a number of large publicly-listed companies among its customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Databricks and Google Cloud today announced a new partnership that will bring to Databricks customers a deep integration with Google&#8217;s BigQuery platform and Google Kubernetes Engine. This will allow Databricks&#8217; users to bring their data lakes and the service&#8217;s analytics capabilities to Google Cloud.</p>
<p>Databricks already features a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/microsoft-makes-databricks-a-first-party-service-on-azure/">deep integration with Microsoft Azure</a> &#8212; one that goes well beyond this new partnership with Google Cloud &#8212; and the company is also an AWS partner. By adding Google Cloud to this list, the company can now claim to be the &#8220;only unified <span class="il">data</span> platform available across all three clouds (Google, AWS and Azure).&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth stressing, though, that Databricks&#8217; Azure integration is a bit of a different deal from this new partnership with Google Cloud. &#8220;Azure <span class="il">Databricks</span> is a first-party Microsoft Azure service that is sold and supported directly by Microsoft. The first-party service is unique to our Microsoft partnership. Customers on Google Cloud will purchase directly from <span class="il">Databricks</span> through the Google Cloud Marketplace,&#8221; a company spokesperson told me. That makes it a bit more of a run-of-the-mill partnership compared to the Microsoft deal, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the two companies aren&#8217;t just as excited about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re delighted to deliver <span class="il">Databricks</span>’ lakehouse for AI and ML-driven analytics on Google Cloud,&#8221; said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian (or, more likely, one of the company&#8217;s many PR specialists who likely wrote and re-wrote this for him a few times before it got approved). &#8220;By combining <span class="il">Databricks</span>’ capabilities in <span class="il">data</span> engineering and analytics with Google Cloud’s global, secure network—and our expertise in analytics and delivering containerized applications—we can help companies transform their businesses through the power of <span class="il">data</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi noted that he is &#8220;thrilled to partner with Google Cloud and deliver on our shared vision of a simplified, open, and unified <span class="il">data</span> platform that supports all analytics and AI use-cases that will empower our customers to innovate even faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed, this is clearly a thrilling delight for everybody around, including customers like Conde Nast, whose Director of Data Engineering Nana Essuman is &#8220;excited to see leaders like Google Cloud and <span class="il">Databricks</span> come together to streamline and simplify getting value from <span class="il">data.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re also thrilled about this, you&#8217;ll be able to hear more about it from both Ghodsi and Kurian at an event on April 6 that is apparently hosted by <a href="https://hopin.com/events/databricks-google-cloud?utm_source=databricks&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=7013f000000TxbtAAC&amp;ref=c10a5549097d">TechCrunch</a> (though this is the first I&#8217;ve heard of it, too).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has been fined again by Italy&#8217;s competition authority &#8212; this time the penalty is €7 million (~$8.4M) &#8212; for failing to comply with an earlier order related to how it informs users about the commercial uses it makes of their data.</p>
<p>The AGCM began investigating certain commercial practices by Facebook back in <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/detail?id=a275df5f-079b-4772-9870-3148c9ca558c">2018</a>, including the information it provided to users at sign up and the lack of an opt out for advertising. Later the same year it went on to <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers’-data-for-commercial-purposes">fine Facebook €10M</a> for two violations of the country&#8217;s Consumer Code.</p>
<p>But the watchdog&#8217;s action did not stop there. It went on to launch further proceedings against Facebook in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/facebooks-dodgy-defaults-face-more-scrutiny-in-europe/">2020</a> &#8212; saying the tech giant was still failing to inform users “with clarity and immediacy” about how it monetizes their data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Facebook Ireland Ltd. and Facebook Inc. have not complied with the warning to remove the incorrect practice on the use of user data and have not published the corrective declaration requested by the Authority,&#8221; the AGCM writes in a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/2/IP330-">press release</a> today (issued in Italian; which we&#8217;ve translated with Google Translate).</p>
<p>The authority said Facebook is still misleading users who register on its platform by not informing them &#8212; &#8220;immediately and adequately&#8221; &#8212; at the point of sign up that it will collect and monetize their personal data. Instead it found Facebook emphasizes its service&#8217;s &#8216;gratuitousness&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The information provided by Facebook was generic and incomplete and did not provide an adequate distinction between the use of data necessary for the personalization of the service (with the aim of facilitating socialization with other users) and the use of data to carry out targeted advertising campaigns,&#8221; the AGCM goes on.</p>
<p>It had already fined Facebook €5M over the same issue of failing to provide adequate information about its use of people&#8217;s data. But it also ordered it to correct the practice &#8212; and publish an &#8220;amendment&#8221; notice on its website and apps for users in Italy. Neither of which Facebook has done, per the regulator.</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, has been fighting the AGCM&#8217;s order via the Italian legal system &#8212; making a petition to the Council of State.</p>
<p>A hearing of Facebook&#8217;s appeal against the non-compliance proceedings took place in September last year and a decision is still pending.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on AGCM&#8217;s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us: <span lang="EN-IE">“We note the Italian Competition Authority’s announcement today, but we await the Council of State decision on our appeal against the Authority’s initial findings.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;Facebook takes privacy extremely seriously and we</span><span lang="EN-IE"> have already made changes, including to our Terms of Service, to further clarify how Facebook uses data to provide its service and to provide tailored advertising</span><span lang="EN-IE">,&#8221; it added.</span></p>
<p>Last year, at the time the AGCM instigated further proceedings against it, Facebook told us it had amended the language of its terms of service back in 2019 &#8212; to &#8220;further clarify&#8221; how it makes money, as it put it.</p>
<p>However while the tech giant appears to have removed a direct &#8220;<em>claim</em> of gratuity&#8221; it had previously been presenting users at the point of registration, the Italian watchdog is still not happy with how far it&#8217;s gone in its presentation to new users &#8212; saying it&#8217;s still not being &#8220;immediate and clear&#8221; enough in how it provides information on the collection and use of their data for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The authority points out that this is key information for people to weigh up in deciding whether or not to join Facebook &#8212; given the economic value Facebook gains via the transfer of their personal data.</p>
<p>For its part, Facebook argues that it&#8217;s fair to describe a service as &#8216;free&#8217; if there&#8217;s no monetary charge for use. Although it has also made changes to how it describes this value exchange to users &#8212; including dropping its former slogan that “Facebook is free and always will be” in favor of some fuzzier phrasing.</p>
<p>On the arguably more salient legal point that Facebook is also appealing &#8212; related to the lack of a direct opt out for Facebook users to prevent their data being used for targeted ads &#8212; Facebook denies there&#8217;s any lack of consent to see here, claiming it does not give any user information to third parties u<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nless the person has chosen to share their information and give consent.</span></p>
<p>Rather it says this consent process happens off its own site, on a case by case basis, i.e. when people decide whether or not to install third party apps or use Facebook Login to log into a third-party websites etc &#8212; and where, it argues, they will be asked by those third parties whether they want Facebook to share their data.</p>
<p>(Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in Europe, Ireland&#8217;s DPC, has an open investigation into Facebook on exactly this issue of so-called &#8216;forced consent&#8217; &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">complaints filed</a> the moment Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation begun being applied in May 2018.)</p>
<p>The tech giant also flags on-site tools and settings it does offer its own users &#8212; such as &#8216;Why Am I Seeing This Ad&#8217;, &#8216;Ads Preferences&#8217; and &#8216;Manage Activity&#8217; &#8212; which it claims increase transparency and control for Facebook users.</p>
<p>It also points to the &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/facebooks-latest-transparency-tool-doesnt-offer-much-so-we-went-digging/">Off Facebook Activity</a>&#8216; setting it launched last year &#8212; which shows users some information about which third party services are sending their data to Facebook and lets them disconnect that information from their account. Though there&#8217;s no way for users to request the third party delete their data <em>via</em> Facebook. (That requires going to each third party service individually to make a request.)</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/facebooks-dodgy-defaults-face-more-scrutiny-in-europe/">Last year</a> a German court ruled against a consumer rights challenge to Facebook&#8217;s use of the self-promotional slogan that its service is “free and always will be” — on the grounds that the company does not require users to literally hand over monetary payments in exchange for using the service. Although the court found against Facebook on a number of other issues bundled into the challenge related to how it handles user data.</p>
<p>In another interesting development <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">last year</a>, Germany&#8217;s federal court also unblocked a separate legal challenge to Facebook&#8217;s use of user data which has been brought by the country&#8217;s competition watchdog. If that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/09/is-europe-closing-in-on-an-antitrust-fix-for-surveillance-technologists/">landmark challenge</a> prevails Facebook could be forced to stop combining user data across different services and from the social plug-ins and tracking pixels it embeds in third parties&#8217; digital services.</p>
<p>The company is also now facing rising challenges to its unfettered use of people&#8217;s data via the private sector, with Apple set to switch on an opt-in consent mechanism for app tracking on iOS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">this spring</a>. Browser makers have also been long <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/webkits-new-anti-tracking-policy-puts-privacy-on-a-par-with-security/">stepping up action</a> against consentless tracking &#8212; including Google, which is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">phasing out support for third party cookies on Chrome</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a low energy solution to home heating and cooling sitting right underneath most houses, but until recently no one has been able to tap it.</p>
<p>That solution is geothermal energy, using the earth&#8217;s own heat to provide temperature controlled comfort to homeowners is the mission that Kathy Hannun set for herself while working at Google X (the skunkworks division within Google) and it&#8217;s been her goal when she spun out her technology as the startup <a href="https://dandelionenergy.com/">Dandelion Energy</a>.</p>
<p>Her company is now helmed by chief executive Michael Sachse, a former entrepreneur in residence at the venture firm NEA and a longtime executive at the energy management company, Opower, so Hannun can focus on pushing the technology she developed forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Helping her advance the geothermal tech is a new $30 million cash infusion from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the fund backed by Bill Gates and a slew of other billionaires to provide financing that can commercialize the new sustainable technologies needed to help the world respond and adapt to global warming.</p>
<p>In Dandelion&#8217;s case that means driving down the cost of installing geothermal systems from over $50,000 to roughly $18,000 to $20,000. The company partnered with Con Edison back in 2019 to offer Westchester homeowners $5,000 off their installations, and that project accounts for some of the 500 homes that are already using Dandelion&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>While the number of installations is small Sachse and Hannun have ambitious goals and some other strategic financial backers that may help them meet their targets.</p>
<p>Chiefly, the U.S. homebuilding giant Lennar is an investor in the company&#8217;s latest round and their presence on the cap table could mean big things if Dandelion can get its systems installed in any planned new construction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to be able to do 10,000 homes per year. When we think about getting to 10,000 homes per year what that requires is for us to expand geographically,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lennar, which depending on how you measure it either the second largest or the largest homebuilder &#8212; they are not just an investor but we are working with them on developing communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For now Dandeliion&#8217;s technology is only used by folks in very specific situations who could loosely be described as upper middle class.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We think of our typical customer as someone who is interested in making a sound economic choice. They&#8217;re in their 40s or 50s, with a college degree and good credit,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;Living in a home that is 2000 to 2500 square feet that is by definition a little bit removed from the traditional urban infrastructure. Upper middle class product in the same way that solar has found traction in homes like that.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Currently, the company focuses on the retrofit market and is confining its operations to the Northeast where there are roughly 5.6 million homes that use fuel oil or propane where installing a Dandelion system can make economic sense given the current costs for the tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The core target customer is someone who is using fuel oil or propane to heat their home. The reason to target them is because we think the payback or them is most attractive,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;Typically the customers who are investing in a Dandelion system and paying cash are going to see a five to seven year payback. Customers who are financing are going to see a lower energy bill  from day one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Dandelion&#8217;s innovations touch on three different aspects of making geothermal systems work, the drill, the heat exchanger, and the monitoring and management system for the heating and cooling system once it&#8217;s installed.</p>
<p>First, the company designed a drill that could give installation operations a smaller footprint. Installers need about 7 feet of space to drill down the 300 feet to 500 feet the company needs to access the 55 degree temperatures necessary to create the Dandelion heat loop.</p>
<p>The company then connects that loop to a novel heat exchanger located in a mechanical room of the house. That heat pump is connected to several sensors allowing the company to integrate with things like the Nest Thermostat to enable homeowners to have more control of the temperature n their homes through their smart phones.</p>

Image Credit: Dandelion Energy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dandelion’s system also includes a smart remote monitoring system that collects and stores data. The data is then uploaded about every 10 seconds and is monitored by Dandelion engineers, the company said. This means any potential problems will be caught immediately and a repair man can be sent to the homeowner’s house before the customer is even aware there might be an issue. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s executives argue that massive adoption of their home heating and cooling systems represent a vital part of any energy transition away from fossil fuels, chiefly because electric heating systems are inefficient.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we had a grid that was large enough to renewable supply electricity and not worry about the efficiency of the electricity demand we’d be in an amazing spot,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;Realistically to electrify the grid we need to triple our capacity while becoming more efficient. I don’t see how we get there without as part of that journey finding more sustainable ways to heat our homes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Geothermal home heating would certainly go a long way toward stabilizing the grid, according to Hannun</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Already air conditioners that are more efficient are putting enormous strain on the grid. Drives fuel use and transition challenges. The benefits of geothermal because of that connection to the ground is really moving out the demand peak,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The technology has a lot of benefits that it confers to the grid and help it operate much better. Which is one reason why we’ve seen utilities in New York embrace this technology and really become its champion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Breakthrough Energy Ventures is wholeheartedly on board with Dandelion&#8217;s solution.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through a combination of technology, data and operations, Dandelion is making geothermal heating and cooling cost-effective for the residential market, and working to solve a critical need for homeowners and our energy ecosystem,&#8221; said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Dandelion&#8217;s geothermal heat pumps provide an efficient electric heating and cooling system that lowers the cost of heating and cooling for homeowners, no matter their region or climate. We&#8217;re looking forward to working with Dandelion as they look to fully displace fossil fuels from the home&#8217;s heating and cooling systems.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/">TigerGraph</a>, a well-funded enterprise startup that provides a graph database and analytics platform, today announced that it has raised a $105 million Series C funding round. The round was led by Tiger Global and brings the company&#8217;s total funding to over $170 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;TigerGraph is leading the paradigm shift in connecting and analyzing data via scalable and native graph technology with pre-connected entities versus the traditional way of joining large tables with rows and columns,&#8221; said TigerGraph found and CEO, Yu Xu. &#8220;This funding will allow us to expand our offering and bring it to many more markets, enabling more customers to realize the benefits of graph analytics and AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current TigerGraph customers include the likes of Amgen, Citrix, Intuit, Jaguar Land Rover and UnitedHealth Group. Using a <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/gsql/">SQL-like query language</a> (GSQL), these customers can use the company&#8217;s services to store and quickly query their graph databases. At the core of its offerings is the TigerGraphDB database and analytics platform, but the company also offers a hosted service, <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/cloud/">TigerGraph Cloud</a>, with pay-as-you-go pricing, hosted either on AWS or Azure. With GraphStudio, the company also offers a graphical UI for creating data models and visually analyzing them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The promise for the company&#8217;s database services is that they can scale to tens of terabytes of data with billions of edges. Its customers use the technology for a wide variety of use cases, including fraud detection, customer 360, IoT, AI, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Like so many other companies in this space, TigerGraph is facing some tailwind thanks to the fact that many enterprises have accelerated their digital transformation projects during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last 12 months with the COVID-19 pandemic, companies have embraced digital transformation at a faster pace driving an urgent need to find new insights about their customers, products, services, and suppliers,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Graph technology connects these domains from the relational databases, offering the opportunity to shrink development cycles for data preparation, improve data quality, identify new insights such as similarity patterns to deliver the next best action recommendation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hardware may <a href="https://pando.com/2013/10/03/hardware-is-the-new-software-nope-says-marc-andreessen-its-called-hardware-for-a-reason-it-is-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indeed be hard</a>, but a startup that&#8217;s built a platform that might help buck that idea by making hardware a little easier to produce has announced some more funding to continue building out its platform.</p>
<p>Fictiv, which positions itself as the &#8220;AWS of hardware&#8221;, providing a platform for those wanting to design and manufacture items, to easily evaluate and order the manufacturing, and subsequent movement of those goods, has raised $35 million.</p>
<p>It will be using the money to continue building out its platform and the supply chain that underpins Fictiv&#8217;s business, which the startup describes as the &#8220;Digital Manufacturing Ecosystem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>David Evans, the CEO and founder, said that the focus of the company has been and will continue to be jobs that are highly specialised, and ultimately not mass-produced items, such as prototypes or objects that are specialised and by their nature not aimed at mass markets, such as particular medical devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focused on 1,000 to 10,000,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;This is the range where most products still die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round &#8212; a Series D &#8212; is coming from a mix of strategic and financial investors. Led by 40 North Ventures, it also includes Honeywell, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Adit Ventures, and M20 (Microsoft&#8217;s strategic investment arm), as well as past backers Accel, G2VP, and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>The round brings the total raised by Fictiv to $92 million, and its valuation is not being disclosed</p>
<p>Evans said that the last couple of years since its previous round ($33 million raised in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/fictiv-raises-33m-to-be-the-aws-of-hardware-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2019</a>) have well and truly tested the business concept that he envisioned when first establishing the startup.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, &#8220;we had no idea what the trade wars between the U.S. and China would do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite abruptly, the supply chain got completely &#8220;crunched, with everything shut down&#8221; in China over those disputes, at which point, Fictiv shifted manufacturing to other parts of Asia such as India, and to the U.S. That ended up helping the company when the first wave of Covid-19 hit, initially in China.</p>
<p>Then came the global outbreak, and Fictiv found itself shifting yet again as plants shut down in the countries where it had recently opened. Then, with trade issues cooled down, Fictiv again reignited relationships and operations in China, where Covid had been contained early, to continue working there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we were just in the right places at the right time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup made its name early on with building prototypes for tech companies neighboring it in the Bay Area, startups build VR and other gadgets, with services that included injection molding, CNC machining, 3D printing and urethane casting, with customers using cloud-based <a href="https://www.fictiv.com/our-platform">software</a> to design and order parts, which then were routed by Fictiv to the plants best suited to make them.</p>
<p>These days, while that business continues, Fictiv is also working with very large global multinationals on their efforts with smaller-scale manufacturing, products that are either new or unable to be tooled as efficiently in their existing factories.</p>
<p>Work that it does for Honeywell, for example, includes mostly hardware for its aerospace division. Medical devices and robotics are two other big areas for the company currently, it said.</p>
<p>But Evans and his investors are careful not to describe what they do as specifically industrial technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Industrial tech is a misnomer. I think of this as digital transformation, cloud-based SaaS and AI,&#8221; said Marianne Wu, the MD of 40 North. &#8220;The baggage of industrial tech tells you everything about the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fictiv&#8217;s pitch is that by taking on the supply-chain management of producing hardware for a business, it can produce hardware using its platform in a week, a process that might have previously taken 3 months to complete, which can mean lower costs and more efficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you speed up development, you see more products getting introduced,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, however. One of the big sticking points in manufacturing has been the carbon footprint that it creates in production, and also in terms of the resulting goods that are produced.</p>
<p>That will likely become even more of an issue, if the Biden Administration follows through on its own commitments to reduce emissions and to lean more on companies to follow through for those ends.</p>
<p>Evans is all too aware of that issue and accepts that manufacturing may be one of the hardest to shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainability and manufacturing are not synonymous,&#8221; he admits. And while materials and manufacturing will take longer to evolve, for now, he said the focus has been on how to implement better private and public and carbon credits programs. He envisions a better market for carbon credits, he said, with Fictiv doing its part with the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/01/2137387/0/en/Fictiv-Launches-Carbon-Neutral-Shipping-Program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of its own tool</a> for measuring this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainability is ripe for disruption, and we hope to have the first carbon-neutral shipping program, giving customers better choice for more sustainability. It&#8217;s on the shoulders of companies like us to drive this.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and struggle to get out of a debt cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup is developing financial products targeted toward this segment of the population, with the goal of helping them build credit, save money, access funds and plan for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That startup, </span><a href="http://www.seedfi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced Wednesday it has raised $50 million in debt and $15 million in an equity funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z. The VC firm also led SeedFi&#8217;s $4 million seed funding when it was founded in March of 2019.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flourish, Core Innovation Capital and Quiet Capital also participated in the latest financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi was founded on the premise that it is difficult for many Americans to get ahead financially. Its founding team has worked at both startups and big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, and operates under the premise that many legacy financial institutions are simply not designed to help Americans who are struggling financially to get ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen firsthand how the system has been designed for underprivileged Americans to fail,” said Jim McGinley, co-founder and CEO of SeedFi. “Our average customer earns $50,000 a year, yet they pay $460 a year in overdraft fees and payday loan companies charge them APRs of 400% or more. They barely make enough to cover their expenses and any misstep can set them back for years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous roles, McGinley was responsible for payday loans for underserved communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There I got insights to the financial difficulties they had and the need for better products to help them get a step up,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder Eric Burton said he can relate because he grew up in Central Texas as part of “a super poor family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I experienced all the struggles of being low income and the necessity of taking on high-priced credit to get through day to day,” he recalled. “I personally was trapped in a debt cycle for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a job offer he got from Capital One was temporarily rescinded because the company said he had “bad credit,” which turned out to be a result of unpaid medical bills he’d incurred at the age of 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t know about them, but was able to get the job after using my signing bonus to pay off that debt,” he said. “So I can understand how a certain starting point makes it very hard to progress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi’s goal is to tackle the root of the problem. It launched in private beta in 2019, and helped its initial customers build more than $500,000 in savings &#8212; even during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it’s launching </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the public with two offerings. One is a credit building product that is designed to “create important long-term savings habits.” Customers save as little as $10 from every paycheck, which is reported to the credit bureaus to build their credit history, and are then able to generate $500 in savings in six months’ time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After six months of on-time payments, SeedFi customers with no credit history were able to establish a credit score of 600, while customers with existing credit scores and less than three credit accounts boosted their scores by 45 points, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of enabling consumers to build credit history beyond traditional methods is becoming increasingly more common. Just last week, we wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/">Tomo Credit,</a> which provides customers with a debit card so they can build credit based on their cash flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi’s other offering, the Borrow &amp; Grow Plan, is designed to be a more affordable alternative to installment or payday loans. It provides consumers with “immediate access” to funds while also helping them build savings and credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz general partner </span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/angela-strange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angela Strange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , who has joined SeedFi’s board with the financing, believes there’s “a massive business opportunity for new financial services entrants to reach historically underserved populations through better product experiences, underwriting and technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blog post, she shares an example of how SeedFi works. The company evaluates risk and extends credit to a customer that might be traditionally hard to underwrite. It determines how much to lend, as well as the proportion of dollars to give as money now versus savings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For instance, a typical SeedFi plan might be structured as $500 right now and $500 reserved in a savings account. The borrower pays off $1,000 over time, and at the end of the plan, he or she has $500 in a savings account. Not only has the borrower paid a lower interest rate, he or she is in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> financial position after making the decision to borrow money,” Strange writes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, SeedFi plans to use its new capital to build out its product suite and grow its customer base. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://certific.co/">Certific</a>, a health tech startup co-founded by TransferWise&#8217;s Taavet Hinrikus, is breaking cover today with the launch of what it claims is the first &#8220;certified&#8221; remote COVID-19 testing service.</p>
<p>The British-Estonian company is using techniques borrowed from the worlds of fintech and telemedicine, including asking users to film themselves while taking the at-home test, in a bold attempt to solve remote testing&#8217;s adherence and trust problem.</p>
<p>Initially targeting private individuals and businesses in the U.K., with other markets to follow, tests can be ordered online and are carried out remotely with the promise of a certified result the following day for PCR tests and in under 90 minutes for antigen tests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, the Certific app and user journey is designed to increase trust in remote testing and ensure that self-performed tests reach the same standard as those carried out in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>“When the pandemic hit, we started toying around with the first finger prick tests to see if you have antibodies, and thinking, &#8216;hey, is there a way to make use of these to help the world along,’ ” Hinrikus told me during an interview earlier this week. “[But] then it turned out that these kind of antibody tests, and the end immunity, was a very unclear concept. And so we kind of put it on hold, but we kept on thinking about what better things we can do to make testing more trustworthy and easier”.</p>
<p>Then late last year he and Certific’s other co-founders &#8212; physician Dr. Jack Kreindler and CEO Liis Narusk &#8212; realised that there were things “that we can and should be doing to come up with a more democratised way of medical testing, and apply this to the pandemic”.</p>
<p>Hinrikus doesn’t quite say it, but as the founder of TransferWise and a prolific angel investor, including backing Estonian verification platform Veriff, there’s little doubt that Certific is partly inspired by the authentication techniques that have gained prominence in fintech, such as video selfies used to onboard new customers at digital banks. In addition, medical director Kreindler has experience with anti-doping in close-combat sports.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yeK8way83T"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/">Veriff raises $7.7M Series A to become the &#8216;Stripe for identity&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Veriff raises $7.7M Series A to become the &#8216;Stripe for identity&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/embed/#?secret=yeK8way83T" data-secret="yeK8way83T" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Coupled with more traditional identity checks, the Certific app asks you to film yourself while you take the test. The recording and test result is securely uploaded to Certific and checked by a qualified physician to ensure you have adhered to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions properly. A medical certification containing the test result is then delivered back to the app. PCR tests cost £64, and the soon to be available rapid antigen tests will be sold in 12-packs for £249 (making the price of a single antigen test £20.75).</p>
<p>But how easy would it be to cheat the test and therefore fake a result? “That&#8217;s one thing we definitely are very, very focused on solving,” says Certific CEO Narusk. “Our experience in all the anti-fraud and anti-cheat areas means that we went far and beyond to make sure that you can&#8217;t actually tamper with the process. So when you record the video, and after you have recorded the video, it is checked by our test verification officers who make sure that you haven&#8217;t moved the tests away from the screen”.</p>
<p>In addition, Certific ensures that the test you have used is actually the test that you ordered and contains the same unique ID, and that you are the person who was supposed to do the test.</p>
<p>That in itself isn’t entirely fraud proof, and Hinrikus clarifies that Certific is initially focusing on ensuring that a test is carried out medically correctly. He says that a higher-priced tier will be offered at a later stage with enhanced video verification, such as a live operator acting as a witness.</p>
<p>This could be particularly useful for businesses, such as live events or travel, where there could be incentives for individuals to cheat and where operators may be required to prove to insurance companies or government authorities that they are COVID-19 safe.</p>
<p>Kreindler, Certific’s medical director, contrasts this with key workers that are currently permitted by U.K. authorities to carry out coronavirus home-testing without any additional verification, but who aren’t nearly as likely to want to fake a result.</p>
<p>“If you think about it, those public servants are not at a great disadvantage if they test positive, because they still get paid. So there&#8217;s less of an incentive to cheat. And the challenge comes where you are doing point of care testing in an environment where there actually is some incentive or a big disadvantage [to testing positive]”.</p>
<p>Kreindler also says it’s not just about individuals and that Certific has worked with academics in Estonia, North America and in the U.K. to develop a computational risk model for mass testing for “super spreader” environments, such as large events. People will not only be able to take a test at home before attending, but a risk model that continually learns and takes into account “democratised decentralised testing” and an understanding of vaccination and immunity, could enable further mitigations to be put in place to make sure there&#8217;s no net spread of the virus back into the community. “That&#8217;s very core to our thinking going forward,” he says. “It&#8217;s not just about certifying testing, it&#8217;s also about certifying crowds”.</p>
<p>Zooming out even further &#8212; and beyond the current coronavirus pandemic &#8212; Certific has been built to be entirely test agnostic. Combining speed, convenience, adherence and trust, the company aims to be the rails on which existing and future home tests can run (my words, not theirs). In the future, this could span testing for sexually transmitted diseases (SDIs) to anti-doping tests in sports. And, of course, new types of COVID-19 tests as they come on stream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest challenges for organizations in modern times is deciding where, when, and how to use the advances of technology, when the organizations are not technology companies themselves. Today, a startup out of Manchester, England, is announcing some funding for a platform that it believes can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://peak.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak AI</a>, which has built technology that it says can help enterprises &#8212; specifically those that work with physical products such as retailers, consumer goods companies, and manufacturing organizations &#8212; make better, AI-based evaluations and decisions, has closed a round of $21 million.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Oxx, with participation from past investors MMC Ventures and Praetura Ventures, as well as new backer Arete. It has raised $43 million to date and is not disclosing its valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Richard Potter, the CEO who co-founded the company with Atul Sharma and David Leitch, said that the funding will be used to continue expanding the the functionality of its platform, adding offices in the U.S. and India, and growing its customer base.</p>
<p>Its list of clients today is an impressive one, including the retailer PrettyLittleThing, KFC, PepsiCo, Marshalls and Speedy Hire.</p>
<p>As Potter describes it, Peak identified its opportunity early on. It was founded in 2014, a time non-tech enterprises were just starting to grasp how the concept of AI could apply to their businesses but felt it was out of their reach.</p>
<p>Indeed, the larger landscape for AI services at that time was largely one focused on technology companies, specifically companies like Google, Amazon and Apple that were building AI products to power their own services, and often snapping up the most interesting talent in the field as it manifested through smaller startups and universities.</p>
<p>Peak&#8217;s basic premise was to build AI not as a business goal for itself but as a business service. Its platform sits within an organization and ingests any data source that a company might wish to feed into it.</p>
<p>While initial integration needs technical know-how &#8212; either at the company itself or via a systems integrator &#8212; using Peak day-to-day can be done by both technical and non-technical workers.</p>
<p>Peak says it can help answer a variety of questions that those people might have, such as how much of an item to produce, and where to ship it, based on a complex mix of sales data; how to manage stock better; or when to ramp up or ramp down headcount in a warehouse. The platform can also be used to help companies with marketing and advertising, figuring out how to better target campaigns to the right audiences, and so on.</p>
<p>Peak is not the first company that has seized on the concept of using a &#8220;general&#8221; AI to give non-tech organizations the same kinds of superpowers that the likes of big tech now use in their own businesses everyday.</p>
<p>Sometimes the ambition has outstripped the returns, however.</p>
<p>Witness Element AI, a highly-touted startup backed by a long list of top-shelf strategic and financial investors to build, essentially, an AI services business for non-tech companies to use as they might these days use Accenture. It never quite got there, though, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/servicenow-is-acquiring-element-ai-the-canadian-startup-building-ai-services-for-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by ServiceNow last year</a> at a devalued price of $500 million, the customer deals it had were wound down, and the tech was integrated into the bigger company&#8217;s stack.</p>
<p>Other efforts within hugely successful tech companies have not fared that well either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Einsten&#8217;s features are essentially useless, and you can quote me on that,&#8221; said Potter of Salesforce&#8217;s in-house CRM AI business. &#8220;Because it is too generic, it doesn’t predict anything useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is perhaps the crux of why Peak AI is working for now: it has remained focused for now on a limited number of segments of the market, in particular those with physical objects as the end product, giving the AI that it has built a more targeted end point. In other words, it&#8217;s &#8220;general&#8221; but only for specific industries.</p>
<p>And it claims that this is paying off. Peak’s customers have reported a 5% increase in total company revenues, a doubling of return on advertising spend, a 12% reduction in inventory holdings, and a 5% reduction in supply chain costs, according to the company (although it doesn&#8217;t specify which companies, which products, or anything that points to who or what is being described).</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard and the excellent Peak team have a compelling vision to optimize entire businesses through Decision Intelligence and they&#8217;re delivering real-world benefits to a raft of household name customers already,&#8221; said Richard Anton, a general partner at Oxx, in a statement. &#8220;The pandemic has meant digitization is no longer a choice; it’s a requirement. Peak has made it easier for businesses to get started and see rapid results from AI-enabled decision making. We are delighted to support Peak on their way to becoming the category-defining global leader in Decision Intelligence.&#8221; Anton is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games has taken its fight against Apple&#8217;s App Store rules to the European Union where it&#8217;s lodged a complaint with the bloc&#8217;s antitrust regulators.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple">blog post</a> today the maker of the popular online game Fortnite said it&#8217;s extending its battle for what it dubbed &#8220;fairer digital platform practices for developers and consumers&#8221; to Europe, noting the bloc is already looking into competition concerns attached to the Apple App Store (and its payment service, Apple Pay).</p>
<p>The EU opened a formal probe into certain Apple practices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regional lawmakers have also recently set out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">plan to expand platform regulation</a> to put specific strictures on &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms with the aim of ensuring fairness and accountability vis-a-vis third parties. And the issue of platform power is certainly one that&#8217;s now under close scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers around the world.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re bringing our fight to end Apple’s App Store monopoly to Europe. Apple’s practices are harming consumers and app developers in Europe and around the world, and we’re joining the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EU</a>’s ongoing investigation into Apple’s abuse of its dominant position <a href="https://t.co/LIb346QmEi">https://t.co/LIb346QmEi</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1361935723620950019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The complaint, filed with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition, alleges that through a series of carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions, Apple has not just harmed but completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes,&#8221; Epic writes, adding: &#8220;Apple uses its control of the iOS ecosystem to benefit itself while blocking competitors and its conduct is an abuse of a dominant position and in breach of EU competition law.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not seeking damages against Apple but wants EU competition authorities to impose remedies against what it describes as the iPhone maker&#8217;s &#8220;monopoly channels&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yXyLyyI1gy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">Apple terminates Epic Games&#8217; App Store account</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple terminates Epic Games&#8217; App Store account&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/embed/#?secret=yXyLyyI1gy" data-secret="yXyLyyI1gy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“What’s at stake here is the very future of mobile platforms,” said Epic Games founder and CEO, Tim Sweeney, in a statement. “Consumers have the right to install apps from sources of their choosing and developers have the right to compete in a fair marketplace. We will not stand idly by and allow Apple to use its platform dominance to control what should be a level digital playing field. It’s bad for consumers, who are paying inflated prices due to the complete lack of competition among stores and in-app payment processing. And it’s bad for developers, whose very livelihoods often hinge on Apple’s complete discretion as to who to allow on the iOS platform, and on which terms.”</p>
<p>Epic launched a US lawsuit against Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">last August</a> after Apple banned Fortnite from the App Store.</p>
<p>The tech giant made the move after Epic tried to bypass its in-app purchase framework (and circumvent the cut Apple takes) by adding its own payment mechanism to Fortnite to let users purchase in-game currency directly &#8212; in direct contravention of Apple&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>As well as banning Fortnight, Apple said it would go further and revoke Epic&#8217;s developer account and access to developer tools for its Unreal Engine &#8212; a move that would have affected third party app makers that rely on Epic&#8217;s engine. However it was barred from going that far.</p>
<p>A US judge quickly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/">denied Epic&#8217;s motion to force Apple to unblock the game</a> but Cupertino was ordered not to block Epic’s ability to provide and distribute its Unreal Engine on iOS &#8212; limiting Apple&#8217;s ability to take a scorched earth approach to try to shut Epic&#8217;s battle down.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qePCbo2yQ4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/">Apple ordered to not block Epic Games&#8217; Unreal Engine, but Fortnite to stay off App Store</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple ordered to not block Epic Games&#8217; Unreal Engine, but Fortnite to stay off App Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/embed/#?secret=qePCbo2yQ4" data-secret="qePCbo2yQ4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since then Epic has filed legal complaints against Apple in Australia and the UK. It&#8217;s now also petitioning EU regulators.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division, meanwhile, opened a formal investigation of Apple last summer &#8212; more than a year after the Europe-based music streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-a-complaint-against-apple-with-the-european-commission-over-apple-tax-and-restrictive-rules/">Spotify had made a similar complaint</a> over &#8216;restrictive&#8217; App Store rules and the 30% cut Cupertino takes on iOS in-app payments.</p>
<p>The Commission said at the time that an unnamed e-book/audiobook distributor had also complained about the impact of App Store rules on competition.</p>
<p>It confirmed today that it has received a complaint <span lang="EN-IE">by Epic Games against Apple. </span><u></u><u></u><u></u><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;</span><u></u><span lang="EN-IE">We will assess it based on our standard procedures,&#8221; a Commission spokesperson told us. </span></p>
<p>Epic&#8217;s argument is that Apple is denying Fortnight users on iOS a choice between Apple payment and Epic direct payment &#8212; claiming savings would be passed to direct purchasers (although Epic of course stands to gain money if it can open up a channel that bypasses Apple&#8217;s cut on in-app payments).</p>
<p>Epic has also tried to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fortnite-maker-asked-apple-to-publish-epic-games-app-store-2020-8">push Apple to let it operate an Epic Games Store on iOS</a> &#8212; a move Apple refused, citing the &#8220;exacting standards for security, privacy, and content&#8221; which it argues are predicated on the App Store rules (although Apple&#8217;s claims of curation equaling &#8216;quality&#8217; don&#8217;t always live up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">the reality of what it allows to operate on its App Store</a>).</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/apple-arcade-is-apples-new-cross-platform-gaming-subscription/">2019</a>, Apple also launched its own gaming distribution service, Apple Arcade &#8212; a pure-play content play that offers access to new and exclusive games playable across Apple&#8217;s device ecosystem.</p>
<p>That move was perhaps the straw the broke the camel&#8217;s back vis-a-vis Epic Games deciding to go all in on an antitrust brawl with Apple. (Its blog post references Apple Arcade, and notes that Apple has barred competitors, including itself, from doing the same).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Epic has also squared up to Google, which similarly takes a cut of in-app payments of Android apps distributed via its Play Store &#8212; and which also removed Fortnight from the Play Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation">last year</a>.</p>
<p>However Google&#8217;s Android platform allows sideloading of third party apps and alternative app stores, arguably making it harder to make an antitrust case stick vs the tighter restrictions applied by Apple.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, Android dominates smartphone marketshare &#8212; while Apple&#8217;s cut of the global market is less than a fifth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprises have been loading more of their operations into cloud &#8212; and, more often than not, multi-cloud &#8212; environments over the last year, creating vast networks of services that can be complex to manage. Today, <a href="http://varmour.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vArmour</a>, a startup that provides ways to manage in real time and ultimately secure how applications (and people) work in those fragmented environments is announcing funding to capitalize on the demand for its services.</p>
<p>The Bay Area startup has picked up funding of $58 million in what it described as an oversubscribed round. Co-led by previous backers AllegisCyber Capital and NightDragon, existing investors Standard Chartered Ventures, Highland Capital Partners, Australian carrier Telstra, Redline Capital, and EDBI also participated.</p>
<p>CEO Tim Eades (who co-founded the company with Roger Lian) said this round is likely to be its final fundraising ahead of an IPO for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We had one hell of a year in 2020 with companies rushing to the cloud,&#8221; he said in an interview, with net new annual recurring revenue doubing year over year in the last year. It started out, he noted, with perhaps 10% of business processes in the cloud, and ended at more like 50%. &#8220;Now the focus for us is to get to the public markets, maybe in two or 2.5 years from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company appointed a CFO last October as part of its go-public plan, he noted &#8212; <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/06/2104340/0/en/vArmour-Appoints-Chris-Dentiste-as-Chief-Financial-Officer-to-Bolster-Business-Leadership-and-Corporate-Strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Dentiste</a>, who previously had been the CFO of RSA. &#8220;His job is to help me find the right window. My job is to make sure we have enough fuel in the tank, and we do,&#8221; said Eades.</p>
<p>He added that the company is likely also to look at making some acquisitions in the meantime. A recent launch of an AI lab in Calgary, Canada, points to one area where we might see some activity.</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation, although Eades confirmed it was a significant up-round. It has raised $197 million to date.</p>
<p>For some context, in the last round of funding that we covered &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/varmour-a-security-startup-focused-on-multi-cloud-deployments-raises-44m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$44 million round in 2019</a> led by the same two investors &#8212; we mentioned a <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/55942-03/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> estimate of $420 million from the previous round &#8212; a figure that the company did not dispute with us at the time.</p>
<p>vArmour has been around for several years, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/20/in-year-3-of-stealth-mode-enterprise-security-startup-varmour-raises-another-36m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first three spent in stealth mode</a>, quietly building its technology, raising money and amassing early customers. Those customers, Eades said, fall into categories like telecommunications (strategic backer Telstra being one of them), and financial services.</p>
<p>Those industries speak largely to the challenges that vArmour is addressing in its business.</p>
<p>Legacy businesses in critical verticals often pre-date the modern era of business, and while many of them are going through what enterprise people like to refer to as &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;, the evolution is not a smooth one.</p>
<p>In many cases, adopting new technologies can be slow, and in almost every case, when you are talking about large enterprises, the changes are very piecemeal, affecting one particular service, or region, or department, or even a subsection of any of those.</p>
<p>All of this means that for malicious actors, there are a number of options to tackle when setting out to look for vulnerabilities in a business or its network, and for those on the inside, it makes for a very complicated and fragmented situation when it comes to monitoring those networks and the services running on them, finding vulnerabilities or suspicious activity, and doing something about that. VArmour&#8217;s term that it uses for this is &#8220;Application Relationship Management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eades &#8212; whose <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tieades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">background</a> includes working for the likes of IBM but also leading number of startups acquired by bigger technology giants &#8212; has first-hand understanding of how that complexity looks from both sides, from the end user end and from the service provider end. That is in essence what his company has identified and is trying to fix.</p>
<p>Having started out in managing application policies and providing insights to protect on that front, the company is expanding the range of tools that it provides with the recent launch of identity access management on top of that.</p>
<p>But that is likely to be just one of the product steps that it takes to tackle what remains a difficult problem to fix, as its growth is related not just to the growth of activity on a network, but further digital migration of services, and the rise of new technology within an organization&#8217;s stack.</p>
<p>(And that is also an area that vArmour is not alone in considering, or even the only approach to tackling it: consider yesterday&#8217;s news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/sources-palo-alto-networks-acquired-devops-security-startup-bridgecrew-for-around-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palo Alto Networks acquiring Bridgecrew</a> to extend its own ability to provide automated security monitoring services to DevOps teams.)</p>
<p class="p6">“Managing risk and resiliency in the hybrid cloud is one of the most significant security challenges for enterprises,” said Bob Ackerman, Founder and Managing Director at AllegisCyber Capital, in a statement. “vArmour’s platform provides the visibility, controls, and accountability necessary to actively manage these challenges and has done this for hundreds of customers. We are ecstatic to be part of their next stage of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;As applications become more complex, more distributed, and more targeted by attackers, the importance of full visibility into the relationships between applications becomes increasingly important.&#8221; added Dave DeWalt, founder of NightDragon. &#8220;vArmour&#8217;s approach to application relationship management ensures that enterprises of all sizes can continuously audit, respond, and control identity relationships to best protect their important IP, and mitigate risk to the business.”</p>
