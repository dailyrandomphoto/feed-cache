					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Happy Saturday, everyone. I hope that you are well, resting and relaxed.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to have some fun. Sure, down below we have our usual mix of venture capital rounds and notes and the like. But first, let’s talk about AI.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215623" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This week I got to chat to two different companies working on making machine intelligence a bit more concrete. One dealt with hardware, the other software.</p>
<p>On the hardware side of things, I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhchapman/">IonQ’s Peter Chapman</a>. IonQ is a quantum computing company that recently <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/828571518/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/IonQ_Investor_Presentation_-_Sept_2021_Updates_v092121.pdf">went public via a SPAC</a>. However, instead of digging into redemptions and other blank-check minutiae, Chapman and I mostly discussed science fiction and what strong AI really means.</p>
<p>In simple terms, strong AI is not how Alexa works today. Alexa, per Chapman, works by having engineers code up lots of possible responses to queries. That scales for a while. But <em>strong</em> AI has to be able to write its own code, Chapman explained, which makes it fundamentally different than human-generated question-and-answer setups.</p>
<p>This fits into the quantum topic because quantum computing, Chapman said, is very good at the sort of code generation that strong AI will require. And, critically, it’s also pretty alright at parsing myriad probabilities at the same time and selecting between them.</p>
<p>All this is to say that quantum computing is reaching its early commercial stages, and companies like IonQ — named for its use of trapped ions in its technology — are helping usher in this new computer era. As quantum computing becomes more mainstream we should be able to get closer to the sort of AI that isn’t just ML models on a macro scale.</p>
<p>From the software side of things, I got on the phone with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelacarpenter/">Intrinio CEO Rachel Carpenter</a>. Her <a href="https://intrinio.com/">company</a> has built a huge financial dataset that it makes available via an API. As a financial nerd, that’s cool. How much time you have spent reading SEC filings will determine if you care about that part of Intrinio or not.</p>
<p>But the startup is also building something <a href="https://intrinio.com/thea">called Thea</a>, an AI service that works by weaving together neural networks into a custom natural language processing machine that can understand text. For folks looking to parse huge amounts of financial reporting, it’s a great product idea.</p>
<p>What struck me when talking to Carpenter was that Thea was initially trained on the larger internet. It’s not just a financial language parsing tool. It can do more.</p>
<p>Today the company is keeping Thea’s focus on its financial niche, per the CEO. But if Intrinio can spin up something that complex using partially open source services, we could see many more intelligent systems like Thea come to market in the coming years. Fuse that to increasingly commercial quantum computing tech and it seems, just maybe, that we’re possibly on the road to eventually, one day, maybe getting closer to actual artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes, we were both born 50 years too early.</p>
<h2>Venture capital this, venture capital that</h2>
<p>As expected, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">the Q3 venture capital landscape was utterly bonkers</a>. Flat crazy. Historically rich. Pick your phrasing.</p>
<p>So far Q4 is looking precisely and exactly the same. A sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notion</strong> has raised a $275 million round at a valuation of $10 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=47cdc3416490">according to Alex Konrad over at Forbes</a>. (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad">Alex</a> has been doing great work lately, I should note.) That’s effectively free capital. How so? Notion just sold 2.75% of itself for north of a quarter billion dollars. In terms of capital efficiency in dilution terms, that’s … cheap. Especially for a startup still too worried about its revenue scale to actually share the numbers. Notion still had a bunch of its last round in the bank before this round. So, it raised a quarter billy on spec, from investors who had that much capital lying around to place a  bet on the company managing an exit of at least $30 billion in time. Let’s see.</li>
<li>And this week <strong>Modern Treasury</strong> raised <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211006005329/en/Modern-Treasury-Raises-85-Million-Passes-2-Billion-Valuation">an $85 million Series C</a> that values the “payments operations” fintech company at more than $2 billion. The company raised its Series B earlier this year when it was valued at roughly $300 million <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>. That’s a lot of value creation in a very, <em>very</em> short period of time! But it feels pretty fitting for what we’ve seen in recent months.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is to say that it doesn’t appear that Q4 is slowing compared to quarters two and three of this year. If 2022 doesn’t best 2021’s venture capital totals, I wonder how long it will be until we see this sort of investment again.</p>
<p>What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>In other news I wrote some more take-y stuff this week — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-might-not-be-having-fun-at-work-you-guys/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/rich-and-worried-about-the-world-put-your-money-where-your-concern-is/">here</a> — if you want something with more bite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a late-August ruling, China’s supreme court declared one of the country’s most infamous work practices illegal.</p>
<p>Known as “996,” the term is shorthand for a work schedule spanning from 9AM to 9PM, six days per week. Though popularized by the country’s soaring tech firms, often evoking images of hip urban startup employees with stock option plans hustling before being made millionaires by an IPO or funding round, “996” has evolved in how it is understood and applied by employers and employees, as well as how it is viewed by regulators.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the August 26 Supreme Court decision and issuance of guidelines from the Ministry of Human Resources will impact tech firms and their well-educated, well-compensated employees, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/">case itself</a> dealt with a worker much further down the digital economy hierarchy: a logistics worker making a salary of 8,000RMB (roughly $1,240) per month, which is just slightly <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/0705/c90000-9594926.html">below the average</a> of the country’s 37 largest cities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215722" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>China’s regulators appear to be sending a message to employers and employees alike that the rules which define their relationship must change. As is the case with many things in China these days, what the country’s leaders are asking for will require a change not just in action, but also in the philosophies, psychologies, and incentive structures at the core of Chinese society. What this change will look like is only starting to come into form.</p>
<h2><b>Hungry like the wolf (culture)</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1865654" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1865654" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1865654" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?w=680" alt="GettyImages 1153554466" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg 3078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153554466.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1865654" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Whether as a result of the intense work culture that has defined many Chinese companies, or as the pacesetting example that many have emulated, there is perhaps no better case study of the spirit, the benefits, and the potential toxicity of a 996 work culture than that of Huawei.</p>
<p>Known for its “wolf culture,” the Shenzhen-based telecoms behemoth became defined by its intensity. Depending on who you ask, the description can be interpreted in multiple ways. In a more generous interpretation, it is seen as a sort of kinship, of team members moving in coordinated packs in pursuit of a shared goal. For others, it can mean something far more brutal. “In Huawei, ‘wolf culture’ means you kill or be killed,” explained a former Huawei employee who I interviewed for <a href="https://supchina.com/2017/10/09/thinking-working-chinese-company-first-find-lenovo-huawei/">an article</a> on the company in 2017. “I think the idea is that if you have everyone in the company competing fiercely with one another, the company will be better at fighting and competing with external threats.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless of how its employees came to characterize it, the intensity central to Huawei’s culture also helped shape its success. In contrast to its European competitors Ericsson and Nokia who have been criticized for their cumbersome bureaucracy and perceived complacency, Huawei’s willingness to win and deliver projects regardless of seemingly any obstacle made them favorites of telecommunications network providers across the world.</p>
<p>Though juiced by cheap financing from the Chinese state and lucrative contracts in its domestic market that allowed it to subsidize its overseas business, there is also a competitive logic to the extreme zeal that has characterized the firm’s culture, and which also helps to explain why other Chinese firms adopted such spirit in the form of “996.”</p>
<p>While now considered cutting-edge innovators in some areas, Huawei and other Chinese firms experienced a constant struggle to overcome deficits in technological sophistication in comparison to their foreign peers in their early days. Without holding an advantage through unique or advanced tech, they achieved an edge through cost, speed, and a flexibility in circumventing the obstacles to doing business that can be particularly tricky in the developing world.</p>
<p>“What Chinese tech companies seem to really understand is the value that execution can have over product,” explains Skander Garroum, a German entrepreneur who has founded startups both in China and Silicon Valley. “The U.S.-centric tech narrative is so often one of a genius who creates a great product, and due to an open internet and open economy, it scales simply due to its obvious superiority. But in China and other developing markets, [there] are more obstacles, less openness, and scaling is a question not simply of how good a product is, but how well a team executes, and how hard they work.”</p>
<p>While such narratives are often hyperbolic renditions of the truth, the willingness to out-work rivals is a badge of honor many Chinese companies carry. For ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, its famed victory over Uber in their mid-2010s battle for the Chinese market was a result of a myriad of factors. Yet to ask many who were involved, the answer is often that they simply executed better on a local level and were willing to fight harder until Uber deemed it to be simply not worth continuing the fight.</p>
<p>Self-defined by their work ethic and hunger, many firms have actively sought out individuals without a privileged background, but who aspire to move above their station in life. Huawei, for example, is known to target its recruiting efforts on young, skilled people from fourth- or fifth-tier cities looking for their ‘first pot of gold’ (<span class="s2">第一桶金 dìyī tǒng jīn), using a phrase meaning the first opportunity that a person receives to make a lot of money, or to move into the middle class.</span></p>
<p>As China grew and its firms rose to global prominence, the dream of the first pot of gold was indeed achievable for many, and generous compensation often accompanied the demanding work hours. For longtime Huawei employees enrolled in the company’s <a href="https://jefftowson.com/2019/10/huaweis-employee-stock-ownership-plan-esop-is-a-great-example-of-meritocracy-plus-partnership-in-china-tech-at-scale-pt-2-of-3/">share scheme</a>, annual dividends have been known to surpass hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars for individual employees, in many cases eclipsing employees’ salaries. It was hard work, but hard work that paid off.</p>
<h2><b>A system set up for employer exploitation</b></h2>
<p>Known for its infamously hard-driving work culture, it can be counterintuitive to learn that the laws on the books in China are quite protective of the rights of workers. In practice, however, these rules have rarely been enforced.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://www.hrone.com/overtime-payments-regulations-china/">technically</a> mandating overtime pay for anything surpassing a standard 5-day/40-hour work week, employers are known to avail themselves of a plethora of formal and informal methods for evading their legal obligations.</p>
<p>In the case of Huawei, this is known to come in the form of a “<a href="https://www.thenanjinger.com/news/national-news/china-work-life-imbalance-married-to-the-job/">striver pledge</a>,” a supposedly “voluntary” agreement signed by new employees in which they forego their rights to overtime pay and paid time off. Though Huawei has gained attention for such an approach, similar methods seem to be commonplace, and often for companies who do not offer Huawei’s perks and paths for advancement.</p>
<p>“For our [blue-collar staff], our contracts stipulate that all overtime pay is already included in their monthly salaries,” explained one career-long HR manager who has worked for both domestic and foreign firms in China. “It’s not a good thing, but it is pretty standard throughout China as far as I know.”</p>
<div>Another method for circumventing labor law is through crafting performance metrics that give overwhelming power to management. “It is common for companies in China to take the Western performance-management concept of ‘deliverables,’ but to extend it to extremes,” said a female executive who formerly headed human resources for two large Sino-European joint ventures and who like many interviewees for this piece, requested anonymity to speak freely about a sensitive policy issue. “The ‘deliverables,’ however, will often be impossible to reach. This puts more power in the hands of the manager to determine if they deem the ‘effort’ of the employee to be satisfactory.” The executive added that she has discouraged such practices throughout her career, and that they were more common with local Chinese firms than with multinationals. With such a dynamic in place, it is not difficult to imagine the myriad forms of exploitation that could potentially occur.</div>
<p>For those who have chosen to take on the system, they have often found themselves not only to be at odds with their employer, but with the state as well. Independent labor unions are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-labour/two-chinese-trade-union-officials-arrested-after-helping-workers-source-idUSKCN1NZ0SP">functionally illegal</a> in China, and the state-run All-China Federation of Trade Unions has historically been inconsistent in aiding workers in labor disputes.</p>
<p>In 2019, former 13-year Huawei employee <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50658787">Li Hongyuan</a> was jailed for 241 days over charges that he had blackmailed the company while negotiating an exit package. Though eventually freed, as prosecutors failed to find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing on his part, news of his lengthy detention was a source of considerable online outrage.</p>
<p>Popular frustration over labor issues in nominally socialist China seems to have been on the rise in recent years. In 2018, security at the elite Peking University <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/students-clash-with-security-over-control-of-pku-marxist-society/">cracked down</a> on protests by the school’s Marxist Society, which itself had been protesting the crackdown on labor activists in southern China. The GitHub repository “<a href="https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU">996.ICU</a>” became a popular online forum for tech workers frustrated with their companies’ brutal workplace practices to vent and bring attention to the worst-behaving companies. For burnt-out young people across China, the trend of &#8220;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/the-lying-flat-movement-standing-in-the-way-of-chinas-innovation-drive/">lying flat</a>&#8221; (tǎngpíng 躺平), which rejects the pressure and ambition that so defined earlier generations, has gained sufficient popularity that <a href="https://qz.com/2019322/why-lying-flat-a-niche-chinese-millennial-meme-alarms-beijing/">the government has lambasted the movement</a> in major newspapers.</p>

<h2>Schrödinger’s working hours: Written laws and unwritten norms</h2>
<p>Compounded by a need to reduce pressure on families and boost a dwindling birth rate, authorities are now looking to change the unwritten rules of the game that have long dictated labor relations in China.</p>
<p>In response to the August 26 ruling, many companies acted quickly to change official policies. Yet for many firms and industries, the question that looms larger is one of culture and expectations.</p>
<p>TikTok parent company ByteDance, which previously was known to officially conduct a six-day work week, brought an <a href="https://technode.com/2021/07/09/bytedance-to-end-weekend-work-in-blow-to-996-culture/">end</a> to the policy. However, this was not entirely welcomed by employees, who in exchange for reduced work days saw commensurate reductions in their pay.</p>
<p>“For many of us, we know what we’re agreeing to when we work for internet companies,” explained a woman surnamed Zhou who has worked for several such firms in China. “We know we might have to work hard, but we also get a chance to make more money,” she said. “If we wanted something different, we would have decided to work for other companies,” adding that she can understand why some ByteDance employees would be upset at the reduced hours and pay.</p>
<p>In the eyes of some China tech workers, increased pressure on companies to comply with government’s stricter expectations around working hours may just mean more informal working hours, for which they are not directly compensated. “Nothing has changed for me or my team as far as I know,” shared one employee of a popular U.S.-listed Chinese internet company. “I work on the weekends, and will work over my holiday [the National Day holiday of October 1]. Just because it’s officially a day off doesn’t mean that business stops,” adding that they “of course” do not receive overtime pay for their extra working hours.</p>
<p>The idea that “business doesn’t stop” is what leaves some in doubt about whether any government regulation will have any positive impact on the condition of tech workers. “ByteDance is cutting back official hours and pay, but if nothing else changes, it doesn’t really matter,” shared Zhou bluntly. “People still want to keep their jobs and get promoted, so of course they will work as much as they can … or move to a company that will pay them more to do it.”</p>
<p>Yet for those who are higher up the management ladder, there is a much stronger inclination to take recent government mandates seriously, both in the letter and spirit of the law. “Companies have to show that they are taking action on this, and if they don’t, they risk being made an example of by authorities,” said the Sino-European corporate HR executive. “HR departments should be conducting company-wide audits and getting a clear picture of what kind of hours people are working,” adding that, “the most likely outcome will probably be to hire more people, who will each work shorter hours, at least in the short term.”</p>
<p>What most do seem to agree on is the broader trend: as Xi Jinping speaks of “common prosperity” and puts the country’s corporate titans on notice, it appears as though the go-go years of China’s gilded age are coming to a close. How far the government will go in enforcing its desired changes is yet to be determined, however. For the first time in a long time, Beijing is signaling to the country’s corporate community that it will no longer tip the scales overwhelmingly in favor of business over labor. The question now is to what degree the balance of those scales will be adjusted.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency remittances are a lifeline for Afghans after the abrupt U.S. withdrawal led to Western Union temporarily ceasing operations and banks in the country severely limiting withdrawals.</p>
<p>As regulators in remittance source countries like the U.S. and U.K. turn their sights on crypto, they should remember how indispensable those currencies are to some of the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Crypto will become increasingly indispensable as the local currency &#8212; in Afghanistan and elsewhere &#8212; becomes not only difficult to access but unreliable as a store of value. Conflict fuels inflation, which makes currencies less valuable &#8212; sometimes worthless.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If we regulate cryptocurrency transfers to appease the crypto hawks at home, we risk turning our backs (again) on those who need this asset class the most: the Afghan people and many others like them.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For remittances to continue to be a lifeline, they need to be fast. When money is needed, it is often needed instantly.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With the Taliban takeover comes the freezing of Afghanistan’s financial system, too. Foreign aid has halted, which makes up approximately <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-58328246">40% of Afghanistan’s GDP</a>, according to the World Bank. Similarly, foreign reserves of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-58328246">Afghanistan central bank have been frozen, which is approximately $9 billion.</a></p>
<p>What’s more, in response to the Taliban’s takeover and Western countries halting foreign aid, international money transfer companies like Western Union and MoneyGram shut off their services (in some cases, they have resumed activity, for now), leaving the average Afghan with no way to engage with the global financial system and, crucially, no way to receive remittances from relatives abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Remittances, the practice of sending money “back home” from rich countries,<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-help-people-in-afghanistan-as-western-union-suspends-money-transfers-into-the-country-11629225525#:~:text=Remittances%20%E2%80%94%20money%20beamed%20from%20abroad,billion%2C%20the%20World%20Bank%20said."> makes up approximately 4% of the country’s GDP</a>. In an economy that is so heavily cash dependent, the sudden crumbling of the local financial infrastructure may well mean the difference between life and death for many Afghans.</p>
<p>For remittances to continue to be a lifeline, they need to be fast. When money is needed, it is often needed instantly. An internally displaced person, for example, cannot wait three to five days for funds to clear; they need food, fuel and medical supplies today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin “maximalists” make wide-eyed claims about how crypto will change the global economic system. Whether you believe them or not, we can see that crypto has already revolutionized remittances in unstable, conflict-ridden places. Afghanistan presents a textbook use case for cryptocurrencies in failed states.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sheer necessity creates the strongest argument for new tech. Afghanistan is <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index">20th on the list of 154 countries in the Global Crypto Adoption Index formulated by Chainalysis</a>, a blockchain data platform. When adjusted for peer-to-peer transactions (including remittances), it ranks seventh. In 2020, Afghanistan didn’t even make the list.</p>
<p>Afghanistan is not alone. Crypto usage has spiked recently in Lebanon, Turkey and Venezuela. Those people are not trying to get rich &#8212; they are simply trying to receive funds from relatives abroad and stop their wealth from disappearing at a time of high inflation.</p>
<p>“Many people are mining and trading [cryptocurrencies] not to acquire products, but to protect themselves from hyperinflation,” Venezuela-based crypto consultant Jhonnatan Morales <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-can-alleviate-the-financial-fallout-for-people-in-afghanistan">observed</a>.</p>
<p>Venezuela, which has one of the highest rates of inflation in the world (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-inflation/venezuela-monthly-inflation-hits-28-5-in-may-central-bank-says-idUSL2N2NY2I5">moving toward 3,000%</a>), has increasingly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/venezuelas-economy-regresses-crypto-fills-gaps-2021-06-22/">adopted cryptocurrencies</a> as its economy teeters.</p>
<p>Lebanon is another example: As the lira lost 80% of its value, Lebanese downloads of bitcoin wallet <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/alternative-assets/463079-cryptocurrencies-offer-lebanese-place-to-put-their-cash-amid-hyperinflation">BlueWallet, for example, grew by 1,781% year on year in 2020.</a></p>
<p>But Afghanistan may be the most urgent and tragic case of why the Global South needs crypto. As cash becomes scarce, prices soar and as the Taliban loses the foreign aid the country was previously dependent upon, the already crumbling afghani currency will get even weaker. By allowing the Afghan people to receive, store and spend their wealth in bitcoin, they may be able to protect themselves against the worst effects of a failed state.</p>
<p>And this is what we must remember when we regulate cryptocurrencies in the West. That regulation will not just affect speculators; it will hit those who want to send remittances “back home.” Those who receive remittances have the most to lose.</p>
<p>When Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell publishes his report on the next stage of cryptocurrency regulations, I hope that he doesn’t forget those who need cryptocurrency the most: the Afghan people &#8212; and millions across the world like them.</p>
<p>While the West may have turned its back on the people of Afghanistan, we need to make sure that our laws don’t continue to leave them in the dark. We need cryptocurrency regulation that ensures those vital financial lifelines are not lost. If we do, we are closing another door of hope for the people who need it the most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kevin Ryan has become very wealthy by being at the right place at the right time &#8212; including at online ad network DoubleClick, which he joined as its twelfth employee and eventually ran as CEO (it was later acquired, twice) &#8212; as well as co-founding numerous companies, including the software company MongoDB, which is currently valued at roughly $30 billion as a publicly traded company. (Ryan still owns &#8220;at least half my shares&#8221; in the company, he says.)</p>
<p>The other day, we talked with Ryan about his biggest, newest bet, which is on healthcare tech. As we reported earlier, his investment firm AlleyCorp is plugging <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/kevin-ryans-alleycorp-is-giving-these-physicians-100-million-to-invest-in-healthcare/">$100 million</a> of largely Ryan&#8217;s own capital into starting and funding outfits in the space &#8212; and that&#8217;s atop the roughly 20 related bets the outfit has made already. We wondered how he became so involved when his earlier projects were almost entirely unrelated. You can hear that conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/renowned-investor-kevin-ryan-thinks-the-big-money-is/id1498270180?i=1000537303736">here</a> or check out excerpts below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: For someone not paying attention, your extreme focus on healthcare tech is surprising. What spurred your initial interest?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>KR: One of the things that I always do from an AlleyCorp point of view is think about, what are the five- to 10-year trends that we want to bet on. Some areas can be overcrowded, and you think there&#8217;s no opportunity there, everything&#8217;s already been done. And sometimes you think there&#8217;s a big opportunity. And so starting two or three years ago, I just felt like both in New York and in healthcare in general, there were huge opportunities because there are so many aspects of the healthcare system that just don&#8217;t work well. It&#8217;s incredibly expensive, the electronic records are not great, it&#8217;s super inefficient. Most of us are very frustrated by this whole healthcare system, which means opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re overseeing mostly your own capital here. Why not take on billions of dollars of outside capital to invest, which, in this current market, as a proven entrepreneur and investor, you could presumably do?</strong></p>
<p>KR: Partly because the area of the ecosystem that I like to play in and am most comfortable and know the best is early stage. So do I want to invest in some company that&#8217;s worth $3 billion and hope it gets to $10 billion? That&#8217;s not really where I play. I want to be in the early stage, where it&#8217;s most risky, and that just requires less capital. We&#8217;re not capital constrained, by the way, or we wouldn&#8217;t be launching all these other things [including incubating a number companies inside AlleyCorp like Nomad Health, which raised a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005344/en/Nomad-Health-Raises-63-Million-in-Funding-to-Address-Healthcare-Staffing-Shortages-Across-the-Country-as-COVID-Surges-Yet-Again">$63 million round</a> earlier this year, and Pearl Health, which closed an <a href="https://pearlhealth.com/blog/pearl-strands/pearl-health-raises-18m-led-by-a16z-to-create-an-efficient-marketplace-for-healthcare-risk/">$18 million</a> round in September].</p>
<p>When we start a new company, putting in $1.5 million to $2 million is what it takes to get a company off the ground, then we raise money [from] outside and if we need to raise a lot of money, we raise a lot of money, and we keep investing, we try and cap our investment in any one company at around $10 million. But no, there&#8217;s lots of opportunities. And so this is where I want to play.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: And this model works even in a world where we&#8217;re now seeing $100 million seed rounds? </strong></p>
<p>KR: The changed environment only helps us. Take Pearl Health. We put in $1.5 millionish into that company and start with a big equity position. It depends on the company but we&#8217;ll have somewhere between our partners probably 30% to 60% because the management team has a lot and sometimes we have co-founders in there as well, so it&#8217;s a big position.</p>
<p>Then a firm like Andreessen Horowitz comes in at a big valuation, a big step up &#8212; and we put another $3 million or $4 million into that round &#8212; but we&#8217;re the ones choosing who comes in. And, by the way, if there&#8217;s a round that happens at, I don&#8217;t know, $400 million, at that point, we&#8217;ll probably stop investing. That&#8217;s what happens with seed funds. Other large funds will come in, we&#8217;ll be diluted down, and that&#8217;s not a problem. Our money is most effective when we think we can make 10 times our money.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you&#8217;re not interested in participating in at the later stages.</strong></p>
<p>KR: No. I&#8217;ve occasionally invested up. We just put in a bunch of money into Nomad, and Nomad is at roughly a $250 million valuation. But I think it&#8217;s a $2 billion company that can be created, so I still feel good about [our bigger investment], but it&#8217;s probably the last round that we will invest in. There are other people who play the role of putting in money and thinking they&#8217;re going to get a 2x or 3x return on that, which is fantastic for their fund. They&#8217;re much later stage; they&#8217;re only going to be in [a company] for five years. We want to put our money in, be in for nine years, and make 100 times our money,</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of your contemporaries are beginning to transition out of the venture industry, or out of their firms, at least. I did wonder how you&#8217;re thinking about this. Do you have a right-hand person at AlleyCorp? What happens as you decide to eventually step back?</strong></p>
<p>KR: First, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen any time soon. But you know, it&#8217;s Brenton [Fargnoli], running the healthcare effort; it&#8217;s Wendy [Tsu] who is in the non-healthcare space. And then my guess is we&#8217;ll have two or three other partners a year from now and I would effectively be the managing partner of the firm. But I&#8217;m good for another 10 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outsourcing engineering has become more common in recent years, so we&#8217;re starting a new initiative to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/who-are-the-best-software-development-consultants-for-startups/">profile the software consultants</a> who startups love to work with the most. Founders and other startup leaders, just fill out <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl?typeform-source=techcrunch.com">this quick survey</a> with a few more details to help us find the right ones.</p>
<p>For our first profile, we interviewed Joshua Davidson, CEO of Chop Dawg earlier this week. &#8220;We’ve been around since the early days, and we have maintained relevancy,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;If you asked one of our partners … I think what they’re going to tell you is that longevity allows us to tell people not just what to do, but that we know why to do it that way, and how to be more pragmatic — save time, save energy, but also know what not to do. From being around so long, we’ve probably made every mistake you can possibly think of. Which is an advantage.&#8221; The software development agency has worked on more than 350 digital products since its founding in 2009, for startups of all sizes.</p>
<p>More details in the link below. But first, here are some of the reviews we&#8217;re already getting from the new survey.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="http://www.appetiser.com.au">Appetiser Apps </a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Andre Eikmeier, founder of <a href="https://goodempire.org/">Good Empire</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They had a good reputation globally and had produced some good products. We also liked their flexible model — we were able to use our CTO to lead a team of six devs from the Appetiser team, with occasional UX/UI, product management and project management as needed, it was properly collaborative, not a blackbox agency arrangement. So we were able to build capability in house at the same time, rather than dependency. [Working with them] allowed us to get a first iteration of product to market from scratch in three months. We were able to build iOS and Android versions simultaneously.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="http://aloa.co">Aloa</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Samir Mirza, <a href="https://www.fifthstarfunds.com/">Fifth Star Funds</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> &#8220;Fifth Star Funds (our fund) is a venture philanthropy fund focused on closing the funding gap for Black founders, at the family and friends round. We&#8217;re an evergreen fund, so as the startups we invest in grow, all returns are funneled back into the fund so we can invest in more founders (hence the philanthropic portion). Aloa is our dev partner because they have integrity. First, they&#8217;re aligned with our mission and offering at-cost services to anyone we invest in. Second, they have helped perform work for some of our team members and built our website pro-bono. Aloa understands the pain points of outsourcing. They aren&#8217;t going to just tell you what to do, they&#8217;re going to understand what your business problems are and figure out how to best solve it with technology. In instances, they&#8217;ve turned potential clients away encouraging them to use no-code tools as Aloa wasn&#8217;t worth their money yet.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.ajmerainfotech.com/">Ajmera InfoTech</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Chintan Bakshi, <a href="https://www.styku.com/">Skyku</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“As a startup CTO, I was looking to work with a team that can be sustained for multiple years of development and product launch. Our small team and company, which was bootstrapped, tried to invest and train new hires, but would eventually lose junior developers through attrition because of a competitive landscape. In Ajmera Infotech, we found experienced architects and developers that we have been able to work with through multiple releases. We have built trust and can truly leverage offshore time zones to gain 16-18 hours of productivity. For our company, this has allowed us to stay within our budget and continue to add value into our product and services.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong>Goncalo (Gonka) Moraes, Rishabh Jaipuria (RJ) from <a href="https://www.devgrid.com/">DevGrid </a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Leo Malave, co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.orbix360.com">Orbix360 Inc</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“We went from running a &#8216;hobby&#8217; SaaS offering to running a real company with goals, releases and a growing customer base. Thanks to DevGrid, we have an achievable product roadmap, revenue model and plans to solicit investment.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://cultum.io/ ">Cultum</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Deji Ariyo, <a href="https://laudah.com/">Laudah</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“[We chose them for their] expertise, transparency, cost-effectiveness and willingness to help. [They] helped, and are still helping, to translate our idea to a market-ready solution that customers love.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://managedkube.com/">ManagedKube</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Garland Kan, consultant<br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“[They have] a deep understanding of cloud technology and how to use that in combination with open source software to get us an infrastructure that is scalable but easy to understand and maintain. They were literally trying to make themselves obsolete!”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="http://www.appetiser.com.au">Appetiser Apps </a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Matt Brennan, <a href="https://www.tradenowapp.com/">TradeNow</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“The Appetiser team has developed great leading applications and also believed in the vision of TradeNow from the very start. We were able to develop a great working relationship early on and continue this along the journey.”</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" data-tf-widget="MXehi2kl"><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="http://aloa.co">Aloa</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>David Pawlan, <a href="http://bachbracket.com">Bracketology</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>&#8220;Aloa approaches this space differently. They aren&#8217;t in love with their solution; they&#8217;re in love with the problem of outsourcing. Before they determine how to best handle our experience, they first understand us as a business. Then, rather than serving as a dev shop, they essentially provide the infrastructure necessary to have a seamless experience. They&#8217;ve vetted through over 10,000 firms and match you with the one that makes the most sense for you. They have a PM tool focused on client-facing project management. They have an invoicing tool so we don&#8217;t have to deal with international fees, exchange rates or international tax compliance. They have an audit process that is based off custom development strategies they built out for us. They then also have a strategist, someone in the U.S., who serves as an account manager in case I need anything. What&#8217;s wild is they do all of this at still an outsourced price. They helped us not only grow our tech, but they helped us understand how we were growing our tech. One of the greatest values is their focus on education. I&#8217;m not a technical leader, so the ability to understand the process of what is happening, allowing me to speak more intelligently about the product, has been incredible.&#8221;</div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/investors-share-how-infrastructure-as-code-is-taking-over-devops/">(TechCrunch+) Investors share how infrastructure as code is taking over DevOps:</a> “Infrastructure as code (IaC) has been gaining wider adoption among DevOps teams in recent years, but the complexities of data center configuration and management continue to create problems — and opportunities.” Karan spoke with some of the top investors in IaC startups. He asked them questions like, “Which areas do you think IaC’s capability to set up any cloud resource will be most used” and “How can a startup trying to establish itself as a provider of IaC set itself apart from the competition?”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/driving-ai-innovation-in-tandem-with-regulation/">Driving AI innovation in tandem with regulation:</a> Will Uppington, guest contributor for TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder of TruEra, writes about how the regulation of AI could slow down its growth in Europe. Uppington says, “The main thrust of the EC regulations is to place new requirements on “high-risk” AI systems. These include AI systems used for remote biometric identification, public infrastructure management, hiring and employment, creditworthiness assessment and education, as well as for various public-sector use cases, such as dispatching first responders.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/app-agency-chop-dawg-on-helping-startups-build-for-the-long-term/">App agency Chop Dawg on helping startups build for the long term:</a> Miranda Halpern spoke with Davidson about trends in the app development industry, how the popularity of outsourcing tech has changed since the pandemic and more. One thing you should know about Chop Dawg is that Davidson says, &#8220;As a company, we purposely are constantly just trying to be better and better at what we do. Even today, with my CEO hat on, I’m constantly like, “How can our process improve? What new technologies can we adapt? What do new design trends, technology trends can we be leveraging?” I think that’s probably one of the things I’m most proud of.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Growth Marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/as-apple-messes-with-attribution-what-does-growth-marketing-look-like-in-2021/">(TechCrunch+) As Apple messes with attribution, what does growth marketing look like in 2021?”:</a> Danny walks through a recap of his panel at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. Danny says, “Growth provides revenues, venture capital, prestige and scale — ultimately driving the success of every business. Yet, measuring growth is complex and challenging — and it’s only getting tougher. Changes to attribution in iOS 14 and further refinements in iOS 15, plus other privacy-preserving initiatives in the industry, have forced growth marketers to rethink how they define their growth analytics engines.” Read on to see what his panel members have to say.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/why-generic-marketing-approaches-dont-work-on-software-developers/">Why generic marketing approaches don’t work on software developers:</a> Anna Heim interviewed Adam DuVander, a developer marketer and author of “Developer Marketing Does Not Exist.” DuVander says, &#8220;The book title is a call to these marketers to treat their technical audience differently. To reach more developers requires more education and less promotion. Your &#8216;marketing&#8217; should not feel like marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/5-common-growth-marketing-mistakes-startups-make/">(TechCrunch+) 5 common growth marketing mistakes startups make:</a> Jonathan Martinez dives into common growth marketing mistakes, and what startups can do to fix them. Martinez says, &#8220;A common thread of mistakes connects most startups that try their hand at growth marketing. Some frequent errors include performance metrics not being correctly measured, product and growth teams working in silos, low testing velocity and failure to consider the entire marketing funnel.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/b2b-marketing-tactics-that-can-help-move-the-needle/">(TechCrunch+) B2B marketing tactics that can help move the needle:</a> Ryan Narod, marketing lead at Mutiny, walks us through 10 marketing tactics. One piece of advice Nord gives us is, &#8220;When a target account lands on your pricing page, one of the most helpful things you can do is surface ROI for them right away. The easiest way to calculate your ROI is by vertical.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 8, 2021! It’s Friday! We made it! If you are tired, consider how weary the Instagram team must be. Their service is having even more uptime issues this afternoon. Between that and announcing that its users are no longer allowed to sell bits of the Amazon rainforest, it’s a banner week for Zuck’s empire. Now, let’s talk tech! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/the-mystery-of-elon-musks-missing-gas/">Elon’s mystery gas:</a> </strong>Big plans from SpaceX regarding its largest rockets are missing a few details on where the company intends to find tens of millions of cubic feet of natural gas that it will need. Sure, Tesla is petrol-free, but SpaceX has left a few question marks in a draft programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) regarding combustible gas that have us scratching our heads.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/why-techstars-is-doubling-down-on-europe/"><strong>Europe’s startups set to receive pre-seed boost:</strong></a> Early-stage founders in Europe are about to have a few new accelerators in their neighborhood, courtesy of Techstars. The accelerator collective is opening programs in Paris (again) and Stockholm, in addition to its current efforts on the continent. Per Techstars’ CEO, there’s far more founders in Europe today than are being served, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">despite record venture capital totals</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/elon-musk-announces-tesla-to-move-headquarters-to-austin/"><strong>Tesla to move its HQ to Texas:</strong></a> Ah, taxes. Tesla will move its headquarters to Austin, Texas from its traditional California home, but it won’t stop investing in the West Coast state. Indeed, the company intends to boost “output at its Fremont gigafactory by 50%,” TechCrunch reports. So, Texas taxes. That’s what this move appears to be about.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/annienjanja">Annie Njanja</a> reports that “economic growth and the rapid expansion of digital and mobile services” in markets like Kenya and Africa as a whole could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/insuretech-on-the-heels-of-a-fintech-boom-heats-up-in-africa/">lead to a boom in insurtech products</a>. Insurtech has proved fertile ground for founders and investors alike in North America and Europe. So, why not Africa as well? African startups have proved strong in the fintech market, so perhaps the push into insurtech is overdue.</li>
<li>Today’s Tiger round is actually news of an impending round. Namely that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/tiger-global-slice-india-fintech/">the investing impresario may put capital to work in Slice</a>. Slice is an Indian company looking to bolster credit card usage in the country. Tiger may put $100 million into the company, per TechCrunch reporting. Manish Singh writes for the blog that Slice “raised around $30 million in its previous equity financing rounds and was valued at under $200 million in a round earlier this year.” More soon, I reckon. (Note: Slice, the American pizza software service, is not the same thing as the above Slice. Also note that startups should come up with more distinct names!)</li>
<li>Next up: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/alpha-paw-brings-in-5-2m-to-carve-out-its-niche-in-the-pet-wellness-space/">Alpha Paw, which just raised $8 million</a>. If you are ready to mock a pet wellness startup for raising venture capital money, I can tell that you have not been to the vet recently. If you can keep your pets healthy, you might be able to save big bucks. Alpha Paw “offers pet products for dogs and cats like food and supplements that are customized with pet breed in mind,” to be specific. Given that about half my generation has more dogs than children (current score is 3-0 in my house), I fully expect Alpha Paw to raise $800 million more by December.</li>
<li>Closing out our startup coverage today,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/productfy-raises-16m-to-build-the-shopify-of-embedded-finance/"> Productfy has raised $16 million</a> for its banking-as-a-service (BaaS) product. I have to admit that I have lost track of all the different BaaS (pronounced like the fish, if you were wondering) startups out there. They all seem able to raise capital, so there must be growth to be shared. But in time are we going to see BaaS consolidation? We’re finally seeing a little movement in the hot OKR startup space, and BaaS feels even more crowded. For now, however, Productfy “aims to stand out with its mission to build DeFi for traditional finance, according to founder and CEO Duy Vo,” per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Private equity is ready to take MSP consolidation to the next level</h2>
<p>Good news: Businesses of all stripes are digitizing their operations faster than ever before, creating huge advantages for companies that start the work now.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215671" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bad news: Many technical workers are already looking for new jobs, and companies must compete to find the right people who can build robust, secure IT environments.</p>
<p>Managed services providers (MSPs) are filling the gap, and private equity firms are paying attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;MSPs have all the ingredients that private equity loves,&#8221; write Mike McGill and Kevin Jolley of Cowen and Company, LLC.</p>
<p>&#8220;A strong demand trend, low risk of obsolescence, a &#8216;sticky&#8217; service that attracts long-term customers and high recurring revenues, strong cash flow margins and a relatively &#8216;asset-light&#8217; business.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/google-youtube-climate-change-denial-ban/"><strong>Google, YouTube to ban climate denial ads:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Mountain View-based Alphabet has decided it no longer wants to profit from folks who deny climate change. To that end, the company will “no longer allow ads or monetization for content that promotes climate change denialism.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/google-to-give-security-keys-to-high-risk-users-targeted-by-government-hackers/"><strong>Google to distribute physical hardware keys to 10,000 users under threat of Russian hacking:</strong></a><strong> </strong>At some point we have to come up with a better solution to state-sponsored hacking than Google sending out security keys, but for now this counts as good news.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/pinterest-rolls-out-new-havens-mental-health-support-space/"><strong>Pinterest is building something called havens</strong></a> that are “space on its platform to explore the relationship between mental health and rest.” Which sounds nice, I suppose.</li>

<h2>Promote the right content to the right people</h2>
<p>You spend a lot of time creating content for your customers, but they typically have a hard time discovering the content that’s relevant to them. Consider adding a personalized banner that surfaces the right piece of content to the right visitor.</p>
<p>Banners are a great way to capture the attention of target accounts during the evaluation stage. And banners promoting white papers or linking to analysts reports are relatively quick and easy to implement.</p>
<p>When creating your banner content, keep the copy in the banner brief and clear — a short, crisp sentence that engages interest. Your CTA should be strong and actionable and tell the visitor what they’ll be getting.</p>

<h2>Invite prospects to an event with their peers</h2>
<p>Creating a peer set focused on solving common challenges is a powerful event tactic that we’ve used. We’ve also seen it in use by companies like Segment.</p>

<h2>Leverage your prospect’s competitors</h2>
<p>We’re going to go out on a limb and guess that whatever business you’re in, you pay special attention to the moves your competitor makes. Here&#8217;s another crazy idea: The same is true for your target accounts.</p>
<p>Use this inherent drama to create personalized banners that drive to a case study showing target accounts how their competitor is using your product. While implementing this can be fairly straightforward, it will still take some leg work to create the competitor case study for each target account vertical.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the average cost of a ride on Uber, Lyft and other &#8220;rideshare&#8221; services has risen over the years, it&#8217;s become clear these companies were never entirely forthright about their business models. Now a pair of studies suggests even the investor-subsidized prices don&#8217;t tell the whole story, with costs being borne by drivers and communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c01641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study is from Carnegie Mellon University</a>, which analyzed some of the less obvious costs and benefits of transportation network companies (TNC, the favored term in public and academic documents).</p>
<p>For instance, after collecting a variety of data on the activity of TNC cars and users, the researchers found that rideshare vehicles tend to contribute less per ride to air pollution. This is because, as lead author Jeremy Michalek <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2021/october/emissions-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains in a university news release</a>, &#8220;When a vehicle first starts up, it produces a high level of noxious air pollution until its pollution control system heats up enough to be effective.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215681" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since rideshare vehicles don&#8217;t usually need to do a cold start for a given ride, and are generally newer cars with lower emissions to begin with, it&#8217;s estimated that a TNC trip produces about half the pollutants as the same trip done in your personal car. That amounts in their estimate to about 11 cents&#8217; worth of value on average.</p>
<p>Good news, right? Well, kind of. The problem is that while the car may be more efficient in that specific way, the practice of &#8220;deadheading&#8221; (driving aimlessless or idling between jobs) and the need to drive to a pickup location pretty much wipe out those gains. Then when you factor in the increased traffic from cars technically not being &#8220;used&#8221; still being on the road, accidents, noise, etc., you end up with an estimated 45 cents per trip in costs to the community in general. So there&#8217;s a net increase in costs of about 34 cents per ride — a cost that is paid for by taxes or in lower quality of life.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215714" style="width: 985px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215714" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2215714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg" alt="Infographic showing the benefits of rideshare cars (lower emissions) versus the costs (many)." width="975" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg 975w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/emissions-study-02-min.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2215714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CMU</p></div></p>
<p>The suggestion the researchers make is to pool rides or use mass transit whenever possible — though of course in pandemic times those have their own drawbacks. Electrification of fleets would help, but that too has major immediate and long-term costs.</p>

<p>Drivers themselves are carrying the weight of this &#8220;decentralized&#8221; industry as well. In a survey conducted among unionized drivers in Seattle, the University of Washington&#8217;s Marissa Baker found that most felt they received little or no support from the companies they work for.</p>
<p>Almost everyone was worried about getting COVID-19, obviously, and 30% thought they&#8217;d already caught it. Most had lost income, not surprisingly, and had spent their own money on PPE — less than a third said they&#8217;d received masks or sanitizer from the company. And those who stopped driving during the pandemic reported having trouble getting unemployment benefits. Notably in Seattle, drivers are overwhelmingly black men and often immigrants, groups that face their own compounding challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;For workers who are in this kind of employment during the pandemic, they receive very little support from the companies that they drive for, and this is a population that had a lot of awareness of the potential exposures they could be facing,&#8221; said Baker in <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/10/01/uw-study-provides-rare-window-into-work-life-of-app-based-drivers-during-pandemic/">the release accompanying the study</a>. In Seattle drivers are lucky to have additional protections not available in many cities, so folks in other locations may have it worse. (Delivery drivers were found last year to be <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/on-demand-and-on-the-edge/">facing many of the same problems</a>.)</p>
<p>These studies are only a peek at the hidden costs and soft economics of the &#8220;gig economy.&#8221; Consumers most often hear from the companies themselves a version of these things viewed through rose-colored glasses, so independent inquiry, even if it&#8217;s just a survey or rough estimate of undocumented costs and behaviors, is incredibly valuable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No one&#8217;s going to tell you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/finding-product-market-fit-from-the-earliest-stages-through-growth/">when your startup has reached product-market fit</a> — there are no flashing lights, no siren, no balloons falling from the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Especially for first-time founders, assessing product-market fit at a stage where it’s mostly anticipation can be as much art as science,” writes News Editor Darrell Etherington, who interviewed three VCs about the topic for TechCrunch Disrupt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heather Hartnett, Human Ventures</li>
<li>David Thacker, Greylock</li>
<li>Victoria Treyger, Felicis</li>
</ul>
<p>“In the early days and the ideas phase, founders lean a little bit heavier into what’s happening in the world in macro and in your industry that really makes this problem,” said Treyger.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>Thacker said entrepreneurs should be open to raising as much as possible during the concept phase to make sure they have freedom to tinker and iterate.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen some founders — as a VC, this is gonna sound self-serving me saying this — but I’ve seen some founders that raise way too little capital in their pre-seed round or their seed round. And they don’t give themselves enough time or enough runway to experiment.”</p>
<p>As with the other Disrupt recaps, there’s also a complete video of their conversation. We&#8217;re planning to post the remaining rundowns next week, so watch this space.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+ this week; I hope you have a relaxing weekend.</p>

<p>This year, investors pumped a record amount of venture capital into the world’s startups: In Q2 2021, VCs invested $156 billion, upping that to $158 billion in Q3.</p>
<p>“The numbers are effectively a tie, meaning that we’ve just lived through the two strongest periods for investment into private companies in the history of startups,” write Anna Heim, Ryan Lawler, Mary Ann Azevedo and Alex Wilhelm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Udemy filed to go public this week in the wake of Duolingo’s successful flotation earlier this year, and Alex Wilhelm’s read of its S-1 is that the edtech firm will likely price above its final private-market valuation.</p>
<p>“Udemy is a somewhat stable consumer edtech offering inside a recurring-revenue B2B product,” he writes.</p>
<p>“If we only valued Udemy on its business revenues, at its final private-market valuation, it would be worth 4.5x its Q2 2021 ARR. That’s incredibly cheap. And its consumer business has value as well.”</p>

<p>The last few years included a delayed IPO filing and a proxy battle with a major shareholder, but events are unfolding nicely for Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie these days.</p>
<p>Enterprise reporter Ron Miller says this is “a pivotal moment for the cloud content management company,” so he interviewed Levie to learn more about his plans, particularly in light of the company’s recent revenue growth.</p>
<p>For balance, Ron also spoke to Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis.</p>
<p>“The next year is pivotal for Box,” he said. “It has to prove that it was right to win the proxy fight. To do that, it has to evolve the Box platform and grow steadily but surely and continue to carve out a niche for itself in the market.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Nathan Lustig, managing partner, Magma</li>
<li>Julio Vasconcellos, managing partner, Atlantico</li>

<p>Rebecca Bellan interviewed Sila Nano founder Gene Berdichevsky about how founders who work on emerging tech should think about scaling, should approach funding and why they should go after the hardest problem first.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to just go for the teeth of the dragon, so to speak,” said Berdichevsky, who led the development of the Tesla Roadster’s battery pack.</p>
<p>“Because if you get knocked out, you can get back up and hopefully you still have the motivation to do it again.”</p>

<p>As he looked at Q4’s cohort of IPO candidates, Alex Wilhelm examined Rent the Runway’s recently filed S-1 to see how well a company that offers gowns on loan has performed in an era where formal wear is more likely to mean a pair of sweatpants than a strapless Monique Lhuillier.</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a tough time for the company, he found. Additionally, “the gap between gross profit and gross profit excluding the cost of clothing depreciation is huge.”</p>

<p>In a recent episode of TechCrunch Live, Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan reviewed the earliest pitch deck for social gaming company Rec Room with Nick Fajt, its founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Since Sequoia placed its bet on Rec Room, the company has raised nearly $150 million.</p>
<p>“I think Nick did a wonderful job of setting the tone for the type of social platform Rec Room wanted to be from the start,” said Zhan.</p>
<p>“What type of social identity do we want people to have? What type of interactions do we want people to be able to have? I think it’s been a huge differentiator for Rec Room from the start.”</p>

<p>After a report from The Information stating The Athletic “hemorrhaged” $100 million between 2019 and 2020 inspired lots of Twitter chatter, Alex Wilhelm studied the subscription sports media site’s publicly available metrics and failed to find much of a problem.</p>
<p>“A company doing nine figures of recurring subscription revenues is valuable, even if we presume that The Athletic has far lesser gross margins than your average software outfit,” he wrote.</p>

<p>For the Pitch Deck Teardown at TechCrunch Disrupt, Managing Editor Danny Crichton reviewed two decks, “one consumer and one enterprise,” with three VCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maren Bannon, co-founder and managing partner, January Ventures</li>
<li>Vanessa Larco, partner, NEA</li>
<li>Ben Ling, founder and general partner, Bling Capital</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the most exceptional pitch decks will receive more than a few minutes of attention, so Danny selected four slides “that provoked our panelists to show how VCs can have radically different views on the same material.”</p>

<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted a Twitter thread this week suggesting that the U.S. could be at risk of stifling its future CEO talent because “the number of rounds of attacks from press, politicians and trolls on CEOs (and rounds of congressional testimony) makes the job not fun.”</p>

<p>“There are a great many things to discuss in the above. As far as hot takes go, this is a collection of scorchers.”</p>

<p>Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm interviewed Techstars CEO Maëlle Gavet to learn more about why the accelerator is launching new European programs in Paris and one in Stockholm.</p>
<p>After noting that Techstars isn’t yet present in every European national capital, she said that “there is enough space for some of [those] cities to have six, seven, eight, up to 10 programs per year,” and that “there are multiple cities in Europe that [could] easily accommodate between 50 and 100 pre-seed investments by Techstars every year.”</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem that the outage lasted long, as services were back up and running for some less than 30 minutes after Facebook tweeted about it. But after this week&#8217;s more serious outage, the repeated lapse might spark concerns about the reliability and safety of the app. Repeated outages are especially concerning for small business owners who use Facebook&#8217;s tools to communicate with customers, or international users who use WhatsApp as their primary texting app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monday&#8217;s outage was caused by <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/">configuration changes</a> to the routers in Facebook&#8217;s data centers. Facebook told TechCrunch that today&#8217;s outage was also due to configuration changes, which impacted people globally, but that it was unrelated to Monday&#8217;s downtime.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture-backed fintechs raised a record<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q2-2021/"> $30.8 billion in the second quarter of this year</a>, up 30% over the same quarter last year. And they&#8217;re raising more, and faster, than ever — the average deal size stands at $47 million this year.</p>
<p>So, with fintech founders now sitting on mountains of cash as a result, just how are they spending it all?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data across private and public companies generally doesn&#8217;t show discernible trends in how these dollars are spent. That said, perhaps some answers to the question of how well capital can be allocated are hiding in plain sight.</p>
<h2>Looking to the leaders</h2>
<p>There are now a slew of fintech startups approaching or far surpassing $10 billion in value — the table below has a selection of the most prominent — so we can glean some insight into their capital allocation strategies by considering how they have spent to achieve their position in the ecosystem. Some may argue that the differences in business models among these companies, their disparate markets, and studying a ten-year span of capital raising might make it challenging to extract any relevant insights. But their fundraising and business building behaviors indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Studying this selection of fintech &#8220;leaders&#8221; can give us core takeaways on how they have funded and built their businesses. Most of these companies built their business over the course of two years before launching their product and scaling rapidly with limited capital, sometimes even before a Series A — quite a departure from what&#8217;s happening in today’s fundraising environment.</p>
<p>Many of these companies nurtured early champions of their product in both customers and distribution partners, which allowed them to grow and scale without needing to sell to enterprises. All of them eventually raised monster rounds — at an astounding 174x multiple of the capital raised before launch — but they waited to do so until after their product had already been adopted by the market.</p>

<p>All of these businesses share three common traits.</p>
<h2>A valuation inflection point</h2>
<p>Despite having different business models, end markets, and being founded at different times, this sample showed a consistent valuation inflection point. Generally, these companies launched their product just after the Series A, used their Series B to pour fuel on the fire, and then hit a 5x valuation uptick at the Series C.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of <a href="https://isoplexis.com/">IsoPlexis</a>, a company creating tools to zoom in on the flurry of protein activity surrounding a single cell, began trading on Friday. The company aims to raise about $125 million with the IPO, which will be used to build the commercial team and advance the company’s plans to play a bigger part in the creation of precision medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IsoPlexis was founded in 2013 and fits into the category of companies you might find in a lab during the drug research process. The company is primarily focused on single-cell proteomics (basically the study of proteins and their interactions). The company has developed instruments and software to analyze the proteins secreted by cells, from immune cells to tumor cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the instruments can be used to identify cells that excrete many different types of proteins. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These data sets could then be used to develop new treatments or understand how people may respond to existing ones. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215634" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our instrument we invented is able to identity subsets of cells in the body we call superhero cells,” explains CEO and co-founder Sean Mackay. &#8220;And these superhero cells are defined by a lot of activity coming from small subsets of cells you would normally miss with existing technologies today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mackay says there are about 150 IsoPlexis units on the market as of the first half of this year. Customers include 15 global pharmaceutical companies, and, </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1615055/000162828021014106/isoplexis-sx1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per SEC filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly half of the comprehensive cancer centers in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IsoPlexis has raised a considerable amount of funding in the past from some notable investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-IPO, the company had secured about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/isoplexis">$205.5 million</a> in funding, per Crunchbase. The most recent <a href="https://www.newhavenbiz.com/article/isoplexis-closes-on-135m-in-financing">Series D round</a> totaled about $135 million in financing (about $85 million in equity securities and $50 million in debt financing), and included participation from Perceptive Advisors, Ally Bridge Group and “funds and accounts” managed by BlackRock. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, shares were initially priced around $15 each, but have slid to about $12 as of writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major part of the IsoPlexis thesis is they’re the first to use proteomics and single-cell biology to link the function of cells to patient outcomes. Or in other words, among the first to show that we might be able to tell how well someone like a cancer patient may fare, by examining how individual cells and proteins interact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is published evidence that IsoPlexis’ instruments have been used to this effect, particularly when it comes to cancer treatments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01436-0#Sec13">one 2021 </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Medicine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study used IsoPlexis instruments to examine immune cell activity in lymphoma patients. These patients had cancers resistant to treatment, or that had returned after remission. Specifically, they were receiving CAR-T cell therapy &#8212; a form of treatment where genetically engineered immune cells are injected into a patient, where they then help target cancerous cells. Ultimately, the study found that cytokine production (proteins involved in cell signaling), by those CAR-T cells was an important indicator of how potent those CAR-T cells actually were. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, it showed that IsoPlexis’ device might help uncover the signals that tell scientists how well CAR-T cell therapy was working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve seen is that the unique cells we identify are indicative of a long-term response in patients,” says Mackay. “We published studies in various cancers where, if patients have these types of unique immune cells, these superhero cells we detect, we know that those patients are going to have this long term outcome.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people particularly interested in the minutia of cells, IsoPlexis technology might sound similar to flow cytometry &#8212; a well-established method of counting cells, identifying them and measuring specific cell characteristics. There are some large established players in the flow cytometry world, like Thermo Fisher Scientific. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IsoPlexis, though, argues it can offer a whole new layer of information, largely protein-based information, that flow cytometry misses. The company has licensed an invention that allows the devices to barcode protein activity present in each individual cell (now called IsoCode). One </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Reviews Chemistry</span></em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-020-0162-7"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">paper suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that barcoding is useful because it can analyze many different proteins at once, across thousands of cells, and cells can be recovered to be used in other experiments &#8212; but that this technology can still only capture a piece of the overall action of the proteome, so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That new layer of data, for an individual cell is very different from the technology that is on the market today,” Mackay adds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company has a long way to go before it can reach profitability. Per SEC documents, the company has been running at a loss for the past several years. Though the company pulled in $7.5 million in revenue in 2019 and $10.4 in 2020, it lost about $13.6 million and $23.3 million in those years, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the path to growth largely means getting more instruments into more researchers’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to continue to move forward at a fast clip, expanding the same type of customers we have currently, but with more depth, and that’s really by continuing to build a commercial team,” he says. </span></p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-yoo/">Diane Yoo</a> is a results-driven entrepreneur and venture capitalist with more than 15 years of experience.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Without a doubt, the COVID-19 pandemic created catastrophic effects in our communities, educational systems and, most importantly, our careers and overall global economy.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also had a disproportionate effect on women’s careers: We are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/covid-19-and-gender-equality-countering-the-regressive-effects">1.8 times more likely</a> to be laid off than men. It is also important to note that the pandemic caused a significant rise in the need for at-home childcare services.</p>
<p>Women, traditionally expected to be homemakers, were twice as likely to leave their jobs than men in order to stay home, and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">data</a> collected as recently as 2020 shows a significant decrease in venture capital funding for women-led startup companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In 2019, nearly 2.8% of VC funding was used to invest in women-led startups. While considered a relatively low statistic, this was an all-time-high investment rate for women. However, 2020 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">Crunchbase</a> statistics revealed that the amount of VC funding that went toward women-led startups dropped to 2.3%. When viewed realistically, this “minor” setback actually delayed women’s progress in VC by five to 10 years.</p>
<p>Many women in venture capital know that waiting for opportunities to come is never as efficient as creating your own. As a seasoned investor, venture capitalist and founding partner, I have been presented with a variety of unique opportunities to invest in different industries and niches. While I have spent years creating my own opportunities in venture capital by raising and launching funds, I have found it impossible to ignore the impacts women in VC have faced throughout the course of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, women were making consistent and tremendous strides in VC. As of 2019, women in VC<a href="https://www.axios.com/women-venture-capital-gender-equality-3811e58d-6d89-48ea-bd13-6dc3e03a8911.html"> made up nearly 12.4%</a> of all decision-makers at venture capital firms in the United States, up nearly 3.5 percentage points from data collected in 2018. Despite the rise of women entering the VC workforce, not all women working in VC are allowed to make decisions at their firms. Out of 351 venture capital firms in the United States, only 34 firms had two or more women in decision-making positions, according to an Axios analysis.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, I believe there is a strategic and collaborative approach to creating more opportunities for women in the aftermath of COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Venture capital is growing exponentially. For instance, Crunchbase statistics show that venture capital in my hometown of Houston, Texas, has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/houston-venture-capital-investors">tripled in value</a> over the last four years. Investments went from $284 million in 2016 to nearly $800 million in 2021. This tremendous growth requires the support of diverse talents from all backgrounds in order to continue to build long-term, stable investments in the future.</p>
<p>As of 2021, only 6% of the VC industry is made up of women of Asian descent, such as myself, so I deeply empathize with the challenges and hardships associated with breaking barriers in VC.</p>
<p>I have made it my mission to empower and uplift individuals of all backgrounds, especially women. This ultimately led me to create a diverse team of seasoned experts, with 90% of those individuals coming from diverse ethnic backgrounds. By investing in a diverse team, we ultimately yield greater results in both revenue and diversity levels throughout VC.</p>
<p>When women venture capitalists are put in positions with decision-making power, they are actually twice as likely to invest in diverse, women-led founding teams or startups. Moreover, women have personal experiences that men often overlook. These experiences are incredibly valuable to women in VC because they allow us to further identify overlooked problems and understand market size. Additionally, women investing in women can increase the chances of a women-led firm building a record-breaking or category-defining company in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, a study conducted by <a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/women-vcs-invest-in-up-to-2x-more-female-founders">Kauffman Fellows</a> found that when women-led startups receive funding, they are more likely to deliver higher revenue rates at nearly twice the value of the original investment. Because women are told “no” more often than they are told “yes,” women are more likely to create stronger, more concrete business plans to execute their goals and strategies. Over the course of women’s careers, I have also found an increase in resilience, adaptability and innovation &#8212; all of which are extremely valuable traits when working in VC.</p>
<p>The Kauffman Fellows study also found that women founders or women in VC are twice as likely to hire women as employees for their startup companies. This study also stated that women are drawn to work for companies that focus on making a global impact or societal contribution, as well as building long-lasting relationships with their workforce.</p>
<p>The same study found that startups with both a female and male founder would be nearly six times as likely to hire female staff members.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the solution behind creating more opportunities for women in VC, even during a post-COVID society, does not come from merely supporting women-owned businesses, but from debunking the institutional and systemic myths, biases, prejudices and thinking patterns that prevent VC firms and men in decision-making roles from investing in women-led startups.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, the best approach would be to focus on human-centered business models. These models stand out because they tend to focus on fulfilling societal needs such as creating additional job functions, increasing employee satisfaction rates and creating a healthy work environment that supports and empowers employees through career advancement opportunities.</p>
<p>Venture capital is not a safe industry, by any means. It takes courage, empathy, intuition, determination and resilience to truly break through as an investor and become successful over time. Given the risky nature of VC, there is no way to know for sure what will bring success and profitability.</p>
<p>However, my own experience in VC has only proven that taking risks leads to further innovation and evolutionary strides. It’s time to take that risk on women and bet on a brighter future in VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether or not we&#8217;re at some kind of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">tipping point</a> right now, venture investors, old and new, have done very well in recent years, with their limited partners notching the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-endowments-mint-billions-in-golden-era-of-venture-capital-11632907802">biggest gains in decades</a>.</p>
<p>Among the newer VCs to be having a time of it is Bradley Tusk, the political strategist, lobbyist and founder of Tusk Ventures, whose firm is just six years old but whose exits already include the insurtech company Lemonade, which<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/lemonade-lmnd-ipo-shares-more-than-double-in-public-debut.html"> went public</a> in July of last year; the smart lock company Latch, which went <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/06/07/proptech-firm-latch-gains-in-first-day-of-trading/">public this year</a> through a blank-check company; FanDuel, which <a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46229/flutter-acquire-remainder-fanduel/">was acquired</a> and may now get spun off into a public company <a href="https://www.onlinepokerreport.com/55304/fanduel-ipo-2022-preview/">next year;</a> and Coinbase, which staged a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/how-did-coinbase-stock-do.html">highly successful</a> direct listing in April. Tusk Ventures has more companies set to become publicly traded, too, through tie-ups with blank-check companies, including the mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/">Bird</a> and, if it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/crypto-firm-circle-says-it-got-subpoena-from-u-s-sec-in-july">passes muster</a> with the SEC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/">Circle Financial</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; says Tusk. &#8220;It&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh, yeah, of course, that&#8217;s how [venture investing works] works.&#8217; And people who&#8217;ve been VCs for a long time are like, &#8216;No, that&#8217;s not how it works. We&#8217;re in the middle of a crazy market right now.&#8217; &#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We talked with Tusk earlier this week about some of his most recent bets, including that Andrew Yang would become mayor of New York (a Tusk deputy was Yang’s co-campaign manager). He also let slip that he is helping to incubate a new social network with a focus on religion and that on the heels of a $300 million SPAC he formed last year, he has another up his sleeve. Excerpts from our conversation follow, edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because it was just in the news, I&#8217;m seeing you were blamed by &#8220;<a href="https://www.theuprising.info/p/yang-presidential-campaign-advisers">multiple sources</a>&#8221; in Yang&#8217;s camp who say your team was responsible for his disappointing finish in the race. How do you feel about that, and what went wrong?</strong></p>
<p>BT: Whenever you win a campaign, you get the credit. So if you lose a campaign, you deserve the blame, and I&#8217;ll take it, I recruited Andrew into the race because I felt like New York City just needed a better option than the people who are running for mayor [and that] he&#8217;d be able to hire based on talent; he&#8217;d be able to attract really talented people. But halfway through the campaign, two things happened. One, the vaccine became available, and violence and crime really spiked in New York City. So the zeitgeist shifted from COVID recovery to crime and violence, and Eric Adams, who won the race, had been a police officer for 22 years and was far and away the candidate most associated with being able to deal with that one issue, and my hope is that he will be a good mayor.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Wearing your political strategist hat, if you were marshaling Facebook&#8217;s lobbyists, how would you try and respond to the testimony this week of whistleblower Frances Haugen?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BT: Obviously, they don&#8217;t listen to me. But I would take a step back and just stop the charade. Part of the reason why people don&#8217;t trust Facebook is they are endlessly pretending you can have your cake and eat it too. And everyone knows that&#8217;s not true. You are making a transaction with them, where in order to use this free service, you&#8217;re allowing them to monetize your data and to sell that to advertisers to pitch you on stuff. I actually think consumers can handle that trade-off. Instead, by Facebook constantly lying and saying, &#8216;No, no, no, we&#8217;ve got you covered, we&#8217;re not doing any of that,&#8217; no one believes it about anything.</p>
<p>Facebook just needs to level with the people and say, &#8216;Look, this is our business model. This is how we make money. If you want it to be for free, here&#8217;s what we need to do. If you&#8217;d rather pay for a subscription, we could do that instead.&#8217; I think until they do that, all the spin and all the lobbying in the world isn&#8217;t going to change [people&#8217;s perception of the company].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you see broader cultural changes happening in the startup world?</strong></p>
<p>BT: Yes and no. When I think what we talk to our founders about &#8212; and we&#8217;re talking about politics and regulation and media &#8212; it&#8217;s a lot more cautionary than it probably would have been 10 years ago. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re an Uber or Lyft &#8212; whoever it is &#8212; and your ability to operate depends on whether or not you get permission from government or you just go ahead and launch anyway, if it&#8217;s existential, you&#8217;re still going to take that risk. Because if you don&#8217;t take the risk, you don&#8217;t exist in the first place.</p>
<p>But the demise of Facebook&#8217;s reputation &#8212; and the same thing for Google and others &#8212; has created an opportunity to have startups that really are more privacy focused. I&#8217;m working on a social media platform right now for religion, where it is built by religious leaders for people in the religious community, and the idea is to be the anti-Facebook and we protect your data. We don&#8217;t monetize it. We don&#8217;t even have control over it; the community manager and leader do, and so there are business opportunities to come out of [this backlash].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does &#8220;working&#8221; on this social network mean you are helping to build it or you&#8217;re investing in it?</strong></p>
<p>BT: We came up with the idea, we diligenced it, we funded the seed round and we&#8217;re now in beta testing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is incubating startups something new for Tusk Ventures?</strong></p>
<p>BT: It&#8217;s the first incubation that we&#8217;ve done out of Tusk. We&#8217;re working on a new one now in the esports gambling space. When we see a hole in the marketplace, especially because people are misunderstanding the regulatory climate, sometimes the answer is just go ahead and build it yourself. And I think we now have the infrastructure here, the talent, and the money to do that. And so we&#8217;ve gotten our first couple going, and our hope is to probably incubate about two companies a year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have such a range of investments. You&#8217;ve got a men&#8217;s wellness company, Ro, a lawn care company, Sunday. I used to think of the outfit as one that finds startups that could use your political expertise, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be uniformly the case anymore.</strong></p>
<p>BT: It&#8217;s still the case. As an early-stage investor, we&#8217;re looking for all of the same things as every other early-stage investor. We&#8217;re looking at the founder and the TAM and the underlying technology, but then we&#8217;re also asking ourselves two other questions. One, is there a gating regulatory issue or opportunity that if it were solved, could really drive growth and valuation? And two, if so, can we solve it?</p>
<p>Using Ro as an example, [co-founder] Zach Reitano really wanted to be able to offer people prescriptions obtainable via text message as opposed to having to go see your doctor . . . and our view was like, yes, if you can prescribe via text, it really will lead to an increase in business. Other times &#8212; take Sunday, as an example &#8212; the original idea was that we would run campaigns in really left-wing cities like Portland or Austin, where we would mandate the use of organic fertilizer and use that to really create a market for the product. But it turned out that Sunday grew so fast, so quickly, they just never needed to do it. Sometimes you just get lucky and the political problem that you think you&#8217;re going to have never really materializes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mention having enough money to invest. You closed your last fund with $70 million in 2019. Is there a new fund announcement coming?</strong></p>
<p>BT: I can&#8217;t really talk about it. We are investing out of our third fund, and the fund that you&#8217;re talking about is fund two. So, by deduction, yes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: By deduction, based on the growth of funds generally, is it safe to assume this will be at least twice the size of that second fund?</strong></p>
<p>BT: [It&#8217;s] significantly bigger to allow us to hopefully lead at least half the deals that we do. But at the same time, we still really like being an early-stage fund. Every deal that we do we think has to be able to return to find, and you can only take those swings at the seed and A stage. So while on the one hand, it&#8217;s good to be well-capitalized, valuations are increasing so much that you need more and more capital now to be able to win deals. If you have a $400 million Series A fund, then you&#8217;ve gotta have like five Birds in your portfolio just to hit a 3x. I&#8217;d rather just raise more and more funds and have them be smaller and be able to with a couple of clear winners in each fund to deliver a really good return to my investors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also raised a <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/70929/Leisure-SPAC-IG-Acquisition-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO">$300 million</a> SPAC last year. You&#8217;ve already told me you can&#8217;t talk about this. Out of curiosity, is another SPAC coming?</strong></p>
<p>BT: There&#8217;s another one that we&#8217;ve lined up. The combination of not having announced the first deal yet, plus the SPAC market obviously taking a beating right now, has caused us to not go ahead yet and raise the money. But there are lots of places where the right regulatory expertise, combined with the right company &#8212; and this is true whether we&#8217;re incubating something or investing out of out of the fund or doing a SPAC &#8212; can be really valuable. It&#8217;s really limited mainly by how hard I work, and I&#8217;m willing to work pretty hard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is announcing <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-brands-unlock-the-power-of-music-and-sound-on-tiktok">new partnerships</a> aimed at making it easier for brands to tap into music and sound on the platform. The company has expanded its TikTok Marketing Partners program and introduced six certified partners that will help brands create &#8220;sound-on&#8221; strategies for the platform. TikTok notes that it essentially wants to connect brands with trusted partners that will be able to help them leverage its &#8220;sound-on&#8221; environment to engage with consumers.</p>
<p>The company’s new sound partners will offer audio with two categories: custom sound and subscription sound. The new custom sound partners are KARM, MassiveMusic and The Elements Music. TikTok notes that custom sound partners create tracks that aim to increase community participation around challenges and campaigns.</p>
<p>The new subscription sound partners are Epidemic Sound, Songtradr and UnitedMasters. These new partners offer music offerings through monthly, yearly or project-based licensing plans. TikTok says the two categories will support a variety of campaign objectives for brands on its platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Sound is the universal language of TikTok, and brands need to embrace music and sound in order to show up authentically on the platform. Our new Sound Partners have a proven track record of helping marketers develop strategies for TikTok, and offer scalable options for brands of all sizes,” Tiktok’s head of ecosystems, Melissa Yang, said in a <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-brands-unlock-the-power-of-music-and-sound-on-tiktok">blog post</a>. “We&#8217;re excited to see more brands tap into sound on TikTok and make meaningful connections with the community through creative, sound-on strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok prides itself on having a sound-on environment that allows brands to get involved with audiences by remixing trending sounds or creating their own jingle. Although some marketers may be used to creating sound-off advertising to reach more people, TikTok says sound on its platform has introduced a new storytelling dynamic for brands. For instance, TikTok notes that 65% of users prefer content from brands that feature original sounds, while 68% say they remember brands better if they feature songs they like in their ads.</p>
<p>TikTok has been looking for ways to make it easier for brands on its platform to connect with users while also bringing on more brands to its roster. Last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/tiktok-new-ad-products-invite-users-to-interact-with-taps-swipes-likes-and-more/">introduced plans to launch</a> new interactive ad formats, ranging from clickable stickers to “Choose Your Own Adventure”-type ads. Further, this latest sound partner expansion comes a week after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">announced a slate of new brand partners</a> for TikTok Shopping, including Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop. TikTok plans to add Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE soon.</p>
<p>The platform is among several digital giants looking for ways to help brands reach more audiences and connect better with users with a differentiated feature set. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/pinterest-rolls-out-new-shopping-features-for-advertisers/">Pinterest rolled out new shopping features</a> for brands earlier this week aimed at getting users to purchase more items at once. Additionally, YouTube made ads on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/youtube-making-ads-on-connected-tvs-more-shoppable/">connected TVs more shoppable</a> earlier this week to help advertisers drive more online sales and grow their businesses. As digital companies continue their push into e-commerce, they&#8217;re finding ways to keep both brands and users engaged on their platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The outlook for managed services providers (MSPs) remains positive, as increasing complexity and security concerns — driven by the work-from-anywhere environment and high-profile hacking incidents — have moved IT management from being a cost center to a core strategic priority for the C-suite.</p>
<p>A key driver of the growth of such providers is the fact that the requisite skills needed to manage and secure complex IT environments are in high demand, making it difficult for many businesses to develop and maintain internal IT teams that are up to the task.</p>
<p>As a result, an increasing number of companies will continue to outsource some, or all, of their IT management to highly skilled managed service providers. Some industry insiders estimate that only 30%-40% of the managed services market has been penetrated, so there is a huge gap that MSPs can fill.</p>
<p>Private equity investors have taken notice of these tailwinds and many are highly interested in investing in the sector, which will fuel the currently ongoing consolidation.</p>
<p>MSPs have all the ingredients that private equity loves — a strong demand trend, low risk of obsolescence, a &#8220;sticky&#8221; service that attracts long-term customers and high recurring revenues, strong cash flow margins and a relatively &#8220;asset-light&#8221; business. In addition, with approximately <a href="https://www.mspresources.org/blog/how-many-msps-in-the-us-and-worldwide">40,000</a> MSPs in the U.S. [as of 2019], the industry remains very fragmented, leaving massive opportunities for private equity players to build large companies via acquisitions.</p>
<p>Many private equity firms are already invested in the sector. Cowen tracks approximately 50 private equity-owned MSPs, many of which have already acquired other MSPs. The table below shows a few such private equity-backed MSPs that are expected to be catalysts for continued consolidation in the sector. Most of these firms have already completed multiple acquisitions.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Having spent time in the trenches with many startups, I’ve been lucky to see why many growth marketing engines don’t work correctly. I say I’m lucky because the issues I’ve seen have taught me an immense amount about what makes a well-oiled, polished growth marketing engine fire on all cylinders. My experience at Postmates taught me more through mistakes than triumphs, and I learned how to correctly scale a growth engine while marching us toward an exit.</p>
<p>A common thread of mistakes connects most startups that try their hand at growth marketing. Some frequent errors include performance metrics not being correctly measured, product and growth teams working in silos, low testing velocity and failure to consider the entire marketing funnel.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there aren’t unique problems at each startup. I&#8217;m only saying that there a few that are ubiquitous.</p>
<h2>Low testing velocity</h2>
<p>The day is far in the future when you&#8217;ll be able to flip a switch for paid acquisition, lifecycle, social media and content, and have all of it run automatically. Until that day arrives, the need to continue testing is paramount.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215221" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215221" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2215221 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png" alt="A visualization of how a “rapid testing” framework can accelerate CAC reductions." width="882" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visual-look-at-rapid-testing.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215221" class="wp-caption-text">A visualization of how a “rapid testing” framework can accelerate CAC reductions. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>It’s simple: Test more and the results will come to fruition sooner. While the concept is simple, you will need a proper testing framework — one that defines the number and type of weekly tests that are being deployed. A sample weekly test plan can look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid acquisition: Two creative concepts x three copy iterations = six creative assets.</li>
<li>Lifecycle: Two copy variations x five emails = 10 email variations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a testing framework and, most importantly, stick to it. The results will follow.</p>
<h2>Reliance on incorrect measurements</h2>
<p>When measuring the success of a campaign, whether on social media for paid acquisition or with a retention series on lifecycle, it’s vital to have the correct metrics before taking action — this is the foundational pillar of any growth marketing stack.</p>
<p>But what if your performance metrics are inaccurate? And if they are, why? I’ve listed the top three reasons for not having correct metrics below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribution source.</li>
<li>Attribution loss.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An environmental document that needs U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval before SpaceX can begin testing the world&#8217;s largest rockets is missing key details about where its fuel will come from, experts say.</p>
<p>The draft programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) for SpaceX&#8217;s Starship and Super Heavy launch vehicles, which Elon Musk hopes will soon be shooting into orbit and then on to Mars, was issued last month by the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/">FAA for public comment</a>. The 142-page document covers construction and daily operations at SpaceX&#8217;s Boca Chica facility in Texas, which Musk is hoping to incorporate as a city called Starbase. These include pre-flight operations, rocket tests, launches and landings, as well as fuel, water and electricity supplies.</p>
<p>A new pre-treatment system will purify and cool natural gas into liquid methane fuel for the Starship and Super Heavy rockets. Much more gas will be needed for a new 250-megawatt gas-fired power station. A power plant this big typically serves over 100,000 homes and can <a href="https://www.powermag.com/new-michigan-gas-fired-plant-will-replace-existing-coal-plant/">cost hundreds of millions of dollars</a>. But while rocket launches get a lot of coverage in the PEA, the new power plant receives only a cursory mention. In particular, it is unclear how the <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1209/ML120960701.pdf">tens of millions of cubic feet of gas</a> required daily will get to SpaceX&#8217;s remote facility near the Mexican border.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215332" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Failing to mention this in the PEA is unusual, and possibly contravenes the federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), says Pat Parenteau, professor of law and senior counsel in the Environmental Advocacy Clinic at Vermont Law School.</p>
<p>&#8220;NEPA is what we call the look-before-you-leap law,&#8221; Parenteau said. &#8220;It&#8217;s designed to inform federal decision-makers about the environmental impacts of their actions and ways to avoid them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pipeline is the usual way to transport natural gas to a power station. A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n official at a federal agency told TechCrunch that earlier this year SpaceX inquired about reusing a defunct natural gas pipeline running through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They want to reactivate the pipeline for transporting methane via pipeline rather than by truck as they do now,&#8221; wrote the official, who asked not to be named.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, that pipeline was permanently abandoned in 2016, according to the official <a href="https://gis.rrc.texas.gov/GISViewer/">and state records</a>. The official told TechCrunch that the defunct pipeline now houses fiber optic cable for a University of Texas Rio Grande Valley internet connection.</p>
<p>Trucking in enough natural gas to support both a large power plant and regular rocket launches would be a considerable undertaking. It would require thousands of tanker deliveries every year, according to one engineer TechCrunch spoke to.</p>
<p>SpaceX has even suggested that it would be interested in drilling for gas itself, as first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/spacex-plans-to-drill-for-natural-gas-next-to-texas-launchpad">reported by Bloomberg</a> earlier this year. In a dispute over the ownership of some abandoned gas wells, the company later wrote: &#8220;SpaceX [has] a unique ability to utilize natural gas with different economic incentives that do not depend on transportation or sale to gas markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless of which method SpaceX opts for, the environmental impact should have been disclosed in the PEA, according to Parenteau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas and the courts have said, whenever you&#8217;re proposing a project that involves methane, you have to look all the way back to the wells, at distribution through pipelines, and at the downstream effects where the gas is burned,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://esghound.substack.com/p/spacex-2-the-gang-solves-the-gas">blog of an environmental engineer</a> who has been studying the Starbase, the PEA also makes no mention of other equipment that would be typical for gas power stations and gas treatment plants, including a thermal oxidizer, ammonia storage tanks and gas flare. All of these have environmental impacts, including a carbon footprint and air pollution.</p>
<p>The FAA provided the following statement: &#8220;The draft assessment was written in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other applicable environmental laws and regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment, but Musk did refer to the company&#8217;s reliance on fossil fuels at a Tesla shareholders&#8217; meeting on Thursday. &#8220;People say a carbon tax would benefit Tesla,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yeah, but it would hurt SpaceX.'&#8221; He then noted that (atmospheric) methane eventually breaks down into carbon dioxide. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry too much about methane,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>Although the gas power station&#8217;s exact location is still uncertain, it will be about 5.4 acres in size, have structures up to 150 feet tall, and operate continuously year-round, day and night. There is also a small (1 megawatt) solar farm that SpaceX hopes to expand, according the PEA report<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>SpaceX needs the gas power station to run a new desalination plant that will produce the millions of gallons of fresh water needed annually for sound and fire suppression during launches. Large amounts of electricity will also be used to make liquid oxygen from the air.</p>
<p>NEPA is not the only federal rule that applies. A 250-megawatt power station would normally qualify as a major new source of air pollution under the Clean Air Act, according to Parenteau and another expert. This would trigger another lengthy environmental review.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 50 years after NEPA [was enacted], I&#8217;m pretty surprised to see an agency doing this,&#8221; Parenteau said. &#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;re hoping that nobody notices?&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the close of the public comment period on November 1, the FAA will either issue a final PEA that will clear SpaceX to proceed &#8212; subject to the FAA&#8217;s safety findings &#8212; or declare its intent to prepare a much more detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which usually takes years to prepare.</p>
<p>If the final PEA does not appear to meet the requirements of NEPA or the Clean Air Act, local community or environmental organizations could sue to force the FAA to prepare an EIS, potentially delaying a Starship orbital launch further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.productfy.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productfy Inc.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that aims to build “DeFi for traditional finance,” has raised $16 million in a Series A round of funding led by CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Point72 Ventures, 500 Startups and Envestnet | Yodlee also participated in the financing, which brings its total raised since its 2018 inception to nearly $19 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a growing number of BaaS companies, which all essentially have the same end goal &#8212; to make it faster and easier for fintechs and other companies to launch financial services and products. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215382" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productfy aims to stand out with its mission to build DeFi for traditional finance, according to founder and CEO Duy Vo. From a product architecture standpoint, Productfy has been built “from the ground up,” he said, to operate with multiple banking partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not something our competitors are built for,” Vo said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional banks will not last if they can&#8217;t decentralize.” (More on this topic later.)</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QDQwVQ2Vni"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/">Who needs a BaaS partner, anyway?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who needs a BaaS partner, anyway?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/embed/#?secret=QDQwVQ2Vni" data-secret="QDQwVQ2Vni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, Productfy wants to be the “Shopify of embedded finance.” The company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims that with its platform, developers can “configure in hours, integrate in days, and go from idea to full stack deployment in as little as three weeks.”  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Productfy, unlike many other BaaS companies, is not just focused on developers. Its team is building beyond the API layer to produce more white label user interfaces. So while the company, of course, wants to be robust for developers, Vo says it is even more focused on brands that lack technical resources or domain expertise. Since July, the startup has seen 119% month over month revenue growth. It currently has eight clients, including HatchCard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CM Ventures evaluated a number of BaaS and embedded finance companies and had discussions with around “30 different players” before deciding to place its bet on Productfy, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vagan Khranyan, managing partner of lead investor CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We concluded that Productfy has the only market-ready solution to be sold to customers,” Khranyan told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see massive parallels in what Productfy is building and larger movements in distributed and decentralized finance across the industry.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, he said, is working to simplify an otherwise complicated process with multiple bank partners, data and card vendors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Productify’s partners include Equifax, card issuing platform Marqeta, card fulfillment partner Arroweye and financial data provider Envestnet | Yodlee. The startup has also teamed up with Stearns Bank National Association as it works on developing “expanded access” to money movement, digital banking and card issuance products “via easily embeddable APIs, widgets and pre-approved customer interfaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Productfy platform is unlike any we’ve seen in the market,” said Josh Hofer, chief risk and information security officer of Stearns Bank. “Aligning our technology roadmap with the Productfy platform enables both companies to succeed by making banking products more accessible and scalable for the entire ecosystem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the startup says that its partnership with Stearns Bank gives fintech entrepreneurs and non-fintech businesses a way to launch money movement and card programs with stacked workflows and unified due diligence, “eliminating months of development, compliance hurdles, and third-party integrations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been building our basic infrastructure and compliance and technology,” Vo told TechCrunch. “When we launched these programs, we learned a ton. Now, we’re taking those learnings to build the next iteration of our product, which will essentially be a white label ‘fintech in a box’ solution, which will allow any organization to launch a financial product or retail banking experience within days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vo says he was motivated to start Productfy because he believed that the financial services industry has “largely failed the most vulnerable people in our society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re always asking ourselves how can we create a financial ecosystem that is kinder, more compassionate and more socially just,” Vo said. “The way that we believe that we can solve this problem is to create a decentralized financial infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes that while DeFi has traditionally been associated with cryptocurrency, his startup has “nothing to do with cryptocurrency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re creating a DeFi for traditional banking,” Vo told TechCrunch.” Because banks are the origin servers, and if AWS can dynamically route traffic based on usage, that takes power away from users and spreads it around to small banks and the organizations that work with end users.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vo’s goal is that if this can be nailed down in the U.S., Productfy could add a node in countries such as Uganda and Libya and create the “first true distributed financial infrastructure” that would allow for near-instant funds transfers, for example, “easily, securely and at less than a penny globally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup will use its new influx of capital to further scale its offerings and compliance-as-a-service capabilities and continue improving its core data and card issuance offering, with a focus on building new integrations and partnerships and launching its first cohort of customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fourth quarter, Productfy plans to launch a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Card-Issuance-as-a-Service solution, dubbed “Latinum,” aimed at helping brands improve their customer experience and build greater loyalty. The idea around the branded debit card is to give say, members of a church congregation, the ability to use a card where the interchange fees would be used to lend money to fellow congregation members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Productfy’s target is to allow brands to go live in as little as three weeks. Today, they still have to have an engineering team to do that. But by the fourth quarter, Vo says, they won’t need engineering or compliance teams because its white-label solution will be available. And the process will only take days, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re moving the ability to offer retail banking services to the edge,” Vo said. So that religious organizations, schools, gaming companies, e-commerce brands or any organization with “a strong following” can launch a debit card program with deposits, money movement, KYC (Know Your Customer), compliance and servicing built in.</span></p>
<p>Other BaaS companies that have raised capital this year include Unit, which in June raked in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/">$51 million in a Series B round</a> to further its goal of making it possible for companies and fintechs alike to build banking products “in minutes.” In July, Solarisbank, a Berlin startup that provides a range of financial services by way of some 180 APIs that others use to build end-user-facing products, raised $224 million at a $1.65 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has said it will provide 10,000 &#8220;high-risk&#8221; users with free hardware security keys, days after the company warned thousands of Gmail users that they were targeted by state-sponsored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hackers/">hackers</a>.</p>
<p>The warning, sent by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), alerted more than 14,000 Gmail users that they had been targeted in a state-sponsored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> campaign from APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, said to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/justice-department-charges-fancy-bear-hacking/">made up of operatives</a> of Russia&#8217;s GRU intelligence agency. Fancy Bear has been active for more than a decade but it&#8217;s widely known for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/dnc-discovers-russian-hackers-yearlong-access-to-data/">hacking into the Democratic National Committee</a> and its disinformation and election influencing campaign in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>&#8220;These warnings indicate targeting not compromise. If we are warning you there&#8217;s a very high chance we blocked,&#8221; Google&#8217;s TAG director Shane Huntley <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1446103822250565638">wrote in a Twitter thread</a> on Thursday. &#8220;The increased numbers this month come from a small number of widely targeted campaigns which were blocked.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215346" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Huntley added that these warnings are normal for individuals such as activists, journalists and government officials because that’s who government-backed entities target. &#8220;If you are an activist/journalist/government official or work in [national security], this warning honestly shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise. At some point some [government] backed entity probably will try to send you something,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Google said <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/delivering-10000-security-keys-high-risk-users/">in a blog post</a> that it will send out the security keys throughout 2021 to encourage users to enroll in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/googles-advanced-protection-program-for-high-risk-users-now-includes-malware-protection/">its Advanced Protection Program (APP)</a>, which safeguards users with high visibility and sensitive information who are at risk of targeted online attacks. Security keys make it harder for phishing attacks to work as security keys can only be used to unlock accounts on legitimate websites.</p>
<p>Additionally, Google also announced new and extended partnerships with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), UN Women and nonprofit Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) in order to shore up security for its most at-risk users.</p>
<p>Through its collaboration with the latter, Google said it has already provided Titan Security Keys to more than 180 eligible federal campaigns during the 2020 U.S. election season, adding that it is now working with the organization to provide further protection for state-level campaigns and political parties, committees and related organizations including workshops and training on how to protect against cyberattacks.</p>
