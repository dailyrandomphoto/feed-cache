										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Add Soft Robotics to the long list of automation companies that have seen a boost in investment interest amid the pandemic. The New England-based firm <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/food-robotics-leader-soft-robotics-raises-10m-to-meet-pandemic-induced-demand-and-bring-its-3d-vision-and-ai-powered-solutions-to-market-301321728.html">announced this morning</a> a $10 million raise that serves as an extension of the $23 million Series B it announced in January of last year.</p>
<p>The extension was led by Material Impact, Scale Venture Partners and Calibrate Ventures and featured existing investors Tekfen Ventures and industrial robotics giant ABB. The latest round brings the company’s total funding to around $58 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, the company takes a novel approach to picking machines, with a soft, pneumatic-powered gripper that’s ideal for fragile food stuffs that might otherwise be damaged by rigid robotics. Food, of course, has been a prime target for interest in automation during the pandemic, due to labor shortages and fears of disease transmission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jnsv10t1nc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s industrial robots are unable to deal with product variability or unstructured environments typically found across the labor challenged food supply chain in areas such as agriculture, food processing, and logistics,&#8221; Soft Robotics COO Mark Chiappetta said in a release. &#8220;With our revolutionary soft grasping, 3D perception, and AI technologies, Soft Robotics unlocks robotic automation by augmenting widely available industrial robots with true hand-eye coordination allowing them to perform tasks that traditionally could only be performed by human workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round also sees Tyson Food’s investment wing, Tyson Ventures joining the fold. Tyson, which produces poultry, beef and pork in massive volumes, is an existing customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Tyson Ventures, we are continually exploring new areas in automation that can enhance safety and increase the productivity of our team members,&#8221; Tyson Ventures’ Rahul Ray said in the release. &#8220;Soft Robotics&#8217; best-in-class robotic technology, computer vision and AI platform have the potential to transform the food industry and will play a key role in any company&#8217;s automation journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bees are absolutely critical to the health of our agricultural system, ecosystem, and overall wellbeing as a species here on Earth. And yet bee <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/bee-extinction-worries-grow-as-species-numbers-drop">populations are decreasing and extinction concerns are growing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beeflow.com/">Beeflow</a>, a startup that today announced the close of a $8.3 million Series A round, is looking to both save the bees and help farmers be more efficient and effective at the same time.</p>
<p>The startup uses proprietary scientific technology that essentially makes bees healthier, particularly in cold weather. A wealth of research led the company to understand that certain plant-based foods and molecules, when fed to the bees, can reduce the mortality rate of bees by up to 70 percent, and help them perform better in colder weather.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might be wondering what I mean by performance. That&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>Bees are the planet&#8217;s natural pollinators. They turn flowers into fruit, spreading pollen from one landing spot to another. Many farmers will &#8216;rent out&#8217; bees from beekeepers to hang out on their farms and pollinate their plants. In almost every way, the effectiveness of this can&#8217;t be measured, and the bees themselves can&#8217;t truly be controlled.</p>
<p>Beeflow&#8217;s technology ensures that the bees are healthy and strong, and can fly up to 7x more during colder weather than they&#8217;d be able to without it. This means that those bees are much more likely to effectively and efficiently pollinate crops for the farmers.</p>
<p>Beyond reducing the mortality rate of bees, the company also offers a second product called ToBEE, which trains the bees to target a specific crop, such as blueberries or almonds.</p>
<p>Combined, these Beeflow products have increased crop yields for farmers up to 90 percent.</p>
<p>Beeflow&#8217;s business model is two-fold. They have their own bees that they loan out to farmers for pollination, and also work with beekeepers to bring them into the Beeflow network. Bee keepers do not pay for Beeflow&#8217;s technology, but do hand over the rights to their relationships with farmers.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Matias Viel, who is from Argentina, and is mostly operational in Latin America and the West Coast of the U.S., with plans to expand to the East Coast and Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is operational and around execution,&#8221; said Viel. &#8220;There is so much demand and we need to scale our team and our operations now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financing round was led by Ospraie Ag Science, with participation from Future Ventures&#8217; Steve Jurvetson, Jeff Wilke, Vectr Ventures, SOSV&#8217;s IndieBio and Grid Exponential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced a new feature that will turn Alexa into a reading companion for children as well as new support for Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids, which personalize the child&#8217;s Alexa experience across all Echo devices in the household. The two features go hand in hand, as the Voice Profile allows Alexa to identify who&#8217;s speaking, so the device can appropriately respond to a request like &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s read.&#8221; Alexa will then start the reading companion experience, which Amazon is calling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse/21556915011">Reading Sidekick</a>.</p>
<p>This feature isn&#8217;t available to all Alexa device owners, as it requires an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home">Amazon Kids+ subscription</a>. This is the $2.99 per month subscription service that also provides families with children access to thousands of kid-friendly books, TV shows, movies, educational apps and games, in addition to premium content for Echo devices, like ad-free radio stations and playlists, Audible books, and exclusive Alexa skills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171383" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171383" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171383" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once subscribed, the child can then direct Alexa to read with them and they&#8217;ll pick up a compatible book or ebook to get started. Alexa will ask what book they&#8217;re reading and how much does the child want to read: a lot, a little, or taking turns? The feature works with the hundreds of children&#8217;s books for ages 6 to 9 that are included as part of the Amazon Kids+ subscription, including both the print or digital versions. When it&#8217;s the child&#8217;s turn reading. Alexa will listen and provide encouragement when the child is doing well, and will offer support when the child is struggling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, support for new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids will also begin rolling out, starting today. This opt-in feature allows parents or guardians to create a voice profile for each child in their family (up to 4 kids). When enabled, the Alexa experience will be personalized to the individual speaking. That means Alexa will automatically apply the appropriate parental controls that have been configured, automatically filter explicit music, limit calls and messages sent through Alexa only to approved contacts, and restrict the child only to the Alexa skills parents have pre-approved. Alexa will also provide the child with access to kid-friendly games, skills, music, and videos and will provide kid-friendly responses to kids&#8217; inquiries.</p>
<p>While features like these can make the Alexa experience more fun and useful for families, parents have to weigh their comfort with having their children&#8217;s voices recorded and analyzed and determine how long they would want such recordings stored. Today, Amazon uses kids&#8217; voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems in order to improve Alexa&#8217;s ability to understand children&#8217;s questions and requests. In some number of cases, these recordings are also manually reviewed. Parents who don&#8217;t want to participate can delete recordings associated with their child&#8217;s history either one-by-one or all at once via the Alexa app Settings. They can also set recordings to automatically delete on an ongoing 3-month or 18-month basis and can delete recordings via voice requests.</p>
<p>However, if the parent chooses not to save the child&#8217;s recordings, they&#8217;ll not be able to go back through the history to see the requests their child has made over time from the <a href="https://parents.amazon.com/">Parent Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Every parent will need to make a decision about what&#8217;s right for their own household before enabling features like Reading Sidekick or Voice Profiles, or, more broadly about whether they want to bring a smart speaker of any kind into their home.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids should reach all Amazon customers by Friday, July 2. Reading Sidekick is available today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ask anyone looking to sell online about their customer acquisition costs compared to a few years ago, and you&#8217;ll hear a tale of woe. Channels that were once a cost-effective ground for acquiring customers, like various social networks, have become increasingly pricey real estate. Facebook&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1409609918055956483">broaching of the $1 trillion market cap threshold</a> attests to the fact.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.coopcommerce.com/">co-op</a> wants to shake up how online sellers find new customers, and it wants to do so with a spirit of collaboration at a discount. The startup announced a $5.8 million round today that closed earlier this month, evidence that it has found backers for its model that has already collected 500 brands.</p>
<p>That final figure matters because co-op is an almost uniquely collaborative company. Brands that sign up to be part of co-op include its technology on their post-purchase page, allowing for other, related items to be shown to customers who just finished buying something. By including the widget, a company&#8217;s product will be shown on the post-purchase page of another company.</p>
<p>That sounds anti-capitalist at the very least, which wouldn&#8217;t work in a venture-backed world. So, what&#8217;s the twist? The post-purchase page widget shows three or four products, giving it extra inventory that it can sell to its partnered brands. Presto, revenue.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connersherline/">Conner Sherline,</a> told TechCrunch that his startup can deliver advertising space at around half the cost-per-action of Facebook and other channels; how the economics of its model scale as more brands join will be fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>The startup also offers software tooling, including a post-purchase survey feature that costs 5 cents per order for customers to leverage.</p>
<p>Sherline&#8217;s startup appears to be growing quickly. When it raised pre-seed capital last July, it had around 20 brands onboarded to its service. Today, the company is adding another 50 to 100 each month. At that rate, it could reach 1,000 brands in total by the end of the year, barring any deceleration in its ability to attract new brands to its network.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s early progress attracted <a href="https://sugarcap.com/">Sugar Capital</a> to lead its latest round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and online e-commerce giant Shopify. The Shopify check is interesting; co-op already <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/co-op-commerce-1">exists on the Shopify app store</a>, for example. TechCrunch will keep an eye out for more integrations between the two companies, something that could turbo-charge the startup&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>There are a number of places for co-op to expand into. Sherline told TechCrunch in an interview that its collaborative network is the first thing that the company is working on. But with lots of sales data and a wealth of partners, co-op could build out partner networks aimed at other parts of the e-commerce sales life cycle pretty easily, we reckon.</p>
<p>Regardless, the company now has a multiple of the $1.6 million that it had raised before. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale its brand base with the new funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://arrows.to/">Arrows</a>, a startup building software to help software companies onboard their customers, announced that it has raised a $2.75 million round led by <a href="https://www.gradient.com/">Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures</a>. The round was joined by a host of angels, including funds from Sprout Social founder and CEO Justyn Howard.</p>
<p>Per Arrows CEO Daniel Zarick, the company had bootstrapped until this round. That allowed the startup to allow dozens of smaller investors to take part in this funding event, including 28 micro-checks that it rolled into a single cap-table line-item thanks to an AngelList service that allows for smaller investments to be combined.</p>
<p>Arrows sells to software CEOs and heads of customer success, the people who care the most about ensuring that new customers get up and running with new digital products as quickly as possible. Per Zarick, successful customer onboarding to a new product or service can speed up adoption, helping boost revenue from usage-based products; it&#8217;s also generally known that stronger onboarding can also lead to better adoption inside of customer organizations, potentially limiting later churn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the scale of the modern software market, Arrows is selling into fertile ground. That&#8217;s the reason that Zarick and his co-founder Benedict Fritz decided to stop being a two-person shop, and raise more capital. They were worried, Zarick explained, about suffocating their company without more capital.</p>

<p>Luckily for Arrows, one investor had already taken a keen eye to their work. Namely Gradient Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/darian314">Darian Shirazi</a>, who had reached out a number of times before the startup was even considering raising external funds. Per the Arrows CEO, Shirazi had already sent the startup his own portfolio companies as leads before he invested, some of whom have become customers. So, when Zarick and Fritz decided to pursue venture capital, there was a leading name already on hand.</p>
<p>The $2.75 million round was raised using a SAFE at a single cap, sans discount.</p>

<p>Arrows initially <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/arrows-3">launched its service in March</a>, but is revamping its pricing this week, closing its self-serve model for the near-term.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to listen to the CEO of a seed-stage startup discuss evolving from a bootstrapped model to one backed by a good-sized amount of venture funding. Zarick described to TechCrunch in an interview how much his job was changing now that the company is working to scale up to a team of around eight. The company intends to stay at that human scale for a little while.</p>
<p>Per its CEO, Arrows can get along for two years with its current capital sans revenue growth; though we&#8217;d expect that now that it has attracted seed capital, other VCs will look to pile on &#8212; a trend that we&#8217;ve seen often in recent weeks and months.</p>
<p>The Arrows product is also going to evolve in the coming months. While attacking customer onboarding teams&#8217; use of spreadsheets with modern software has worked thus far, the startup has lots of planned work ahead of it, including more integrations with external software. Let&#8217;s see how quickly we hear from Arrows again. I&#8217;ll wager anyone a high-five that it&#8217;s before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based construction startup <a href="https://www.toggle.is/">Toggle</a> this morning announced that it has raised an $8 million Series A. The round was led by Tribeca Venture Partners and featured Blackhorn Ventures, Point72 Ventures, New York State and Twenty Seven Ventures. It follows a $3 million seed round raised in late-2019.</p>
<p>Robotics in general have been a massively popular investment target during the pandemic. Construction startups have also begun to heat up. Early this month, Dusty announced a $16.5 million raise for its Field Printer device.</p>
<p>Toggle automates an entirely different part of the construction process. The company’s robotics technology specifically targets rebar, using robotics to assemble the foundational building material at a fraction of the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At a time when global construction is accelerating to an unprecedented pace, Toggle offers a way to add capacity while saving time and cost on some of the largest types of projects,” cofounder and CEO Daniel Blank said in a statement, “We are especially grateful for our partners who are helping us to bring new tools and approaches to the fundamental building block of our built environment with a focus on renewable energy and sustainable urban development.”</p>
<p>Toggle says the new round will go toward expanding production on the tech. That includes increasing headcount and upgrading the production space to a new 50,000 square foot facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch has covered Acceleprise several times over the years, including a look at its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/"> mid-2020 accelerator startup batch</a> from its three accelerators. The firm has long focused on business-to-business SaaS startups, helping them get their start in a competitive global software market.</p>
<p>As of today, Acceleprise is now Forum Ventures, according to the group&#8217;s CEO and managing partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/mgcardamone?lang=en">Michael Cardamone</a>, and it has a bushel of funds to power its work. And befitting its new name, the company is now more than merely a collection of software-focused accelerators.</p>
<p>In addition to a new, larger $17 million fund for its pre-seed work, Forum Ventures has also raised its first seed fund. The new seed vehicle totals $13.2 billion, with Cardamone telling TechCrunch that the group intends to write checks ranging from $100,000 to $650,000 into rounds valued between $1 million and $4 million. It&#8217;s an actual seed fund, in other words.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s interesting that Forum has put together a seed fund that will invest both in its accelerator graduates and other SaaS companies, the firm&#8217;s new pre-seed investing vehicle is noticeably larger than its preceding accelerator fund. Why is it so much bigger? Per Cardamone, the group added a third accelerator since its last fund, helping explain the size shift.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5CWpdfu47R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">Acceleprise announces 26 SaaS startups from its trio of accelerators</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acceleprise announces 26 SaaS startups from its trio of accelerators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/embed/#?secret=5CWpdfu47R" data-secret="5CWpdfu47R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The technology market is also simply more expensive in every way than it was, and Forum has expanded its staff, so more capital under management makes sense.</p>
<p>There is synergy between the pre-seed and seed funds, of course. Forum can now better defend early ownership in standout companies from its accelerator batches. But why keep the door open to investing in other startups that it didn&#8217;t help incubate? It comes back to the company&#8217;s new name, it turns out. Cardamone and the team chose Forum Ventures because of the work it has done to build a SaaS community that from time to time spins up companies that didn&#8217;t go through Forum&#8217;s programs, he said, and it wants to invest in some of them.</p>
<p>Reasonable.</p>
<p>Undergirding Forum&#8217;s new raise are results from its earlier funds. Its first accelerator fund, deployed from the end of 2014 through the next two years, has returned &#8220;86% of committed capital to date and the rest of the fund is marked at 3.36X and growing with 18 companies still live at various stages,&#8221; the firm shared in an email.</p>
<p>Funds 2 and 3 are a bit nascent yet to have similarly concrete returns; we&#8217;ll have to wait a bit to see how they perform.</p>
<p>But TechCrunch did want to know, regardless, what impact COVID-19 had on Forum and its various funds and batches. Did they catch a COVID-induced wave? We wondered if some good recent results may have helped the firm raise not only larger funds, but two of them at the same time.</p>
<p>According to Cardamone, the answer is <em>somewhat</em>. In its most recent pre-seed fund, the CEO said that its accelerator cohorts are seeing more startups raise faster seed and Series A rounds. And, as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">has written lately</a>, they are, at times, raising Series A deals at lower ARR thresholds than we might have expected. So, it&#8217;s a good time to be putting pre-seed dollars to work, we reckon, provided that you have the deal flow.</p>
<p>Forum is now 11 people, including six women and one nonbinary individual. That&#8217;s about as diverse in gender terms as we&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS venture capital world. From its new seed fund, 53% of Forum&#8217;s investments have had a woman or otherwise underrepresented founder. Not bad.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see if Forum can replicate its early accelerator returns with more capital, more financial vehicles and more people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://orum.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to speed up the amount of time it takes to transfer money between banks, announced today it has raised $56 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel and Canapi Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from existing backers Bain Capital Ventures, Inspired Capital, Homebrew, Acrew, Primary, Clocktower and Box Group. The financing comes barely three months after Orum announced a $21 Series A, and brings <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orum-the-platform-for-frictionless-financial-infrastructure-raises-56m-in-series-b-funding-from-accel-and-canapi-ventures-to-transform-how-money-moves-301322041.html">its total raised</a> to over $82 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum CEO Stephany Kirkpatrick launched the company in 2019 after working for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several years at LearnVest, a personal finance site founded by Alexa von Tobel that was acquired by Northwestern Mutual in 2015 for an estimated $375 million. Tobel went on to form Inspired Capital, a venture capital firm that put money in Orum’s </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/orum-io-seed--f13df00c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.2 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last August. Prior to that, the firm also provided Orum</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with an &#8220;inspiration check&#8221; that was the first money into the business.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="gs">
<div class="">
<div id=":5av" class="ii gt adO">
<div id=":5am" class="a3s aiL ">
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<div id=":5b2" class="ajR" tabindex="0" role="button" data-tooltip="Show trimmed content" aria-label="Show trimmed content" aria-expanded="false"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As a certified financial planner, Kirkpatrick says she saw firsthand what she describes as “deep cracks” in this country’s financial infrastructure. The fact that it takes days for money to move from one bank to another is not only inconvenient for many, but unnecessary, she believes.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Americans are not familiar with the intricacies of ACH [automated clearing house) or why it takes multiple business days to move money between accounts,” Kirkpatrick said. “But none of us can allow money to wait 5-7 days to hit our accounts. It needs to be instant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mission with Orum is straightforward even if the technology behind it is complex. Put simply, Orum aims to use machine learning-backed APIs to “move money smartly across all payment rails, and in doing so, provide universal financial access.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum’s first embeddable product, Foresight, launched in September of 2020. It’s an automated programming interface designed to give financial institutions a way to move money in real time. The platform uses machine learning and data science to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predict when funds are available and to identify any potential risks. Its Momentum product “intelligently” routes funds across payments rails and is powered by banking providers JPMorgan Chase and Silicon Valley Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They power the back end of our Momentum platform that allows the money to move on a multirail basis,” Kirkpatrick told TechCrunch. “They power our access to real-time payments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orum says it serves a range of enterprise partners, including Alloy, HM Bradley, First Horizon Bank and Zero Financial (which was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/avant-doubles-down-on-digital-banking-with-acquisition-of-zero-financial-and-its-neobank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently acquired by Avant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volume of transactions being conducted with Orum is growing 100% month over month, Kirkpatrick said. Most of its early growth has come from word of mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remote-first company prides itself on diversity — in both its employee and investor base. For one, 48% of its 55-person headcount are female, and 48% are “nonwhite,” according to Kirkpatrick. Orum also recently joined the </span><a href="https://captablecoalition.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cap Table Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a partnership between high-growth startups and emerging investors who want to work to close the racial wealth gap — to allocate over 10% of its Series B round to underrepresented founders. For example, the financing includes investors such as the Neythri Features Fund, a group of South Asian women investing in the next generation of female founders and diverse teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Reitman, partner at Canapi Ventures (a firm whose LPs mostly consist of banks), told TechCrunch that those bank LPs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conduct hundreds of millions of ACH transactions annually, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need a path to achieving a state where funds can be transferred instantly,” he said. “Orum’s product paves the path for many players in financial services and fintech — and beyond — to partake in faster money movement without compromising key risk principles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reitman, the company’s major differentiators are its team, which he describes as consisting of “the best group of data scientists and engineers in the space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of their customers consider the team to be instrumental in helping to set the risk dials on how they fund transactions by teasing out key data and insights from historical transaction data,” he said. “Second, Orum is building one of the densest and most comprehensive data sets around the risks of money movement. Better data means better risk models, and it will be hard for other offerings to match Orum’s approach to building this rich data set.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner Sameer Gandhi, who joined Orum’s board as part of the latest financing, agrees. He believes that in an 18-month period, Orum has built “game-changing technology and an exceptional team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orum is tackling financial infrastructure from its foundation,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of work has changed massively in the last year, and with it a rush of startups have emerged with new technology and approaches to improve how it is shaped, and specifically how human resources departments do their jobs. In the latest chapter, <a href="https://www.visier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visier</a>, a Canadian startup that has built a big-data engine to ingest and analyze information from disparate human resources and related applications to develop more accurate profiles of people and departments &#8212; useful when considering remuneration, promotions, and wider hiring budgets &#8212; has raised $125 million (USD), a Series E that the company confirms now values it at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of the company seeing massive growth in particular in the last year, with companies scrambling more than ever before, in a new world of more hybrid and remote work, to get a better grip on how and what teams and individuals are doing. Visier said it now processes employee records for 8,000 customers, large and high-profile enterprises like Adobe, BASF, Bridgestone, Electronic Arts, McKesson, Merck KGaA and Uber that collectively represent some 12 million individual users across 75 countries.</p>
<p>New backer Goldman Sachs Asset Management is leading the round, with previous investors Sorenson Capital, Foundation Capital, Summit Partners, and Adams Street Partners also participating. Visier &#8212; pronounced &#8220;busier,&#8221; which co-founder and chairman John Schwarz joked you are <em>not</em> supposed to be when using its product &#8212; has now raised just under $220 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Schwarz described it to me, the challenge that Visier is addressing is that while everyone uses HR management tools like Workday, Success Factors, any number of payroll applications and more &#8212; on average 20 applications per department, he said &#8212; to chart a lot of basics of how an employee works day to day or month to month, a lot of that data remains in silos and so it&#8217;s hard to get a &#8220;360&#8221; view based on all of it, and that&#8217;s before considering how to take that information and benchmark it against other information outside the business.</p>
<p>The solution that Visier provides to address that is a big-data engine that it has built that can connect to any and all of those apps, ingest the data contained in it, match it up to provide visualizations of the current state of things, and increasingly also predictive insights. Today, this is done typically for HR departments, but this has applicability to managers, finance departments and really the employees themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future we want to help everyone understand the policy today, which impacts the outcome tomorrow,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="p1">The move to build big data analytics targeting particular areas of an organization has been an interesting trend that has played out in other departments too such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/dooly-raises-80m-more-for-its-ai-tools-to-help-salespeople-manage-their-busywork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/tidemarks-latest-release-uses-big-data-to-help-finance-look-forward-instead-of-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finance</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/quantexa-raises-64-7m-to-bring-big-data-intelligence-to-risk-analysis-and-investigations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk analysis</a> and other areas. The idea here is not unlike what data scientists have been working on for years with wider analytics questions: tapping troves of data from disparate sources to order it better, match it up with each other, to provide insight into wider trends and activities within an organization.</p>
<p class="p1">As data science becomes more democratized &#8212; and thanks to advances in no-code and low-code tooling, turned into tools that even non-technical people can implement and use &#8212; we will likely see many more use cases where this idea gets applied. After all, data is the new oil, but unlike actual oil, we seem to be supplied with an endless amount of it these days.</p>
<p class="p1">And yes, we&#8217;ve seen a real rush of HR tools come to the market in recent years &#8212; and see a lot of funding in the current climate as their businesses see customer interest rise &#8212; they include HR platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hibob-raises-70m-on-a-500m-valuation-for-its-new-take-on-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hibob</a>, HR aimed at particular verticals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personio</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factorial</a>, or for distributed workforces like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/oyster-an-hr-platform-for-distributed-workforces-snaps-up-50m-on-a-475m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oyster</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote</a>, or those that are building supercharged org-charts like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/charthop-raises-35m-for-its-internal-org-chart-and-people-analytics-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChartHop</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">But Visier believes that there are no big-data players looking not to be primary-source repositories of information but big data integrators from other platforms. Schwarz notes that in most cases, the &#8220;competition&#8221; will be custom-made implementations built by systems integrators using Tableau or something similar but not the same as what it provides in terms of real-time analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about using data from other sources,&#8221; he said, pointing out that it&#8217;s telling that Workday tried to build something like what Visier provides, but that more than half of Visier&#8217;s customers also use Workday (meaning whatever is there is not quite doing the trick).</p>
<p>“Access to information about employees and the health of an organization has never been more critical,” said Holger Staude, managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We’re excited to partner with Visier at this pivotal moment and support the company’s continued growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gympass, the exercise and corporate wellness unicorn that originated in Brazil, today announced a $220 million Series E. The company has seen tremendous growth in the last few months, as more and more people are vaccinated and flocking back to the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://site.gympass.com/web/us">Gympass</a> is like ClassPass, but on steroids. However, unlike ClassPass’ BTC model, Gympass partners with employers who then pay a flat fee for the platform (an app) which then allows their employees to choose from several wellbeing plans that give them access to myriad in-person gyms and studios, and a directory of health apps, such as Calm. The offerings are broken up into the following categories: physical health, emotional health, nutrition and sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, in May, Gympass saw a record 4 million monthly check-ins across its network of more than 50,000 global partners. In fact, for some of the partners, usage hit above pre-COVID levels. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between increased anxiety rates and documented weight gain during the pandemic, it’s clear that people are eager to get active again with the hopes of improving their mental health and their waistlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GymPass is the brainchild of Cesar Carvalho, a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant in Brazil who was always on the road and yearned for a corporate wellness product that would comply with his hectic work schedule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some days I worked from home, other days I worked from the office, and then there was the time I was traveling. I could never go to the gym in one place,” Carvalho told TechCrunch. “I realized that my needs were the same as others,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He decided to pursue his business idea while he was at Harvard Business School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m one of those crazy entrepreneurs that drops out of their MBA to start a company, but looking back now, it worked out okay,” he said, later telling TechCrunch that Gympass is now in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the U.K. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in São Paulo in 2012, the company achieved product-market fit fairly quickly, and its growth and expansion have been largely organic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, Gympass was a BTC concept, and one of its first clients was an executive at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Brazil. He liked the product so much that he eventually said to Carvalho, “Can’t I communicate this to my 5000 employees in all the cities where we have offices in Brazil?” With that question &#8211; and offer &#8211; Carvalho saw the need to pivot and build a B2B company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After only three years in Brazil, one of his biggest Brazilian clients asked Carvalho to expand to Mexico, because his company had a large presence there and he wanted to offer Gympass to its employees. And so follows most of the expansion stories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expanded to Spain, because we worked with a Spanish bank in Mexico, and they wanted their employees in Spain to have access to our product,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round, which doubles the company’s valuation to $2.2 billion, includes participation from SoftBank, General Atlantic, More Strategic Ventures, Kaszek Ventures and Valor. Carvalho plans to use the money to grow the company in the U.S., expand its offerings, and work on making the tech smarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want [the app] to be able to recommend the best partners for your complete well-being journey based on your workout patterns, for example: ‘This is the best meditation app for you to use with your workout profile,’” Carvalho said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic significantly changed how we do medical research, and now companies are trying to figure out what trends will stay and which ones will go. One that 4G Clinical is hoping will survive the pandemic is a need for speed and flexibility in therapeutics trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G Clinical creates software to run the back-end of a clinical trial. That means randomizing patients into treatment and placebo groups, locating medicines and placebos, keeping the supply of those medicines stocked, and, at least during the pandemic, delivering those medicines to patients. All of these tasks fall under the umbrella of Randomized Trial Supply Management, or RTSM for short. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, 4G Clinical&#8217;s software, called Prancer, uses natural language processing to take specific requirements needed to manage a clinical trial, which are often written in long, complex documents, and configures them into a platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fastest the company has been able to move from a phone call to the first dose in a clinical trial was 6 days – a sprint that created the software needed for a COVID-19 study during the pandemic. That was an exceptionally fast case, but in general, 4G Clinical says it can beat standard timelines by considerable margins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most vendors in the world would say that they are probably, you know, between 10 and 16 weeks from, you know, from the kicking off a study until they can dose a patient,” says Dave Kelleher, a company co-founder. “Our typical timeline is generally four to six weeks post spec signature.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, large pharmaceutical companies are capable of creating these trial management systems internally. Small companies, however, may not have the capability to do so. 4G Clinical goal is to provide a service that can be of use to both. 4G Clinical has currently designed systems for over 230 companies – though the company would not disclose the specific trials in which its systems are being used. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 strategies for building a digital health unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/4-strategies-for-building-a-digital-health-unicorn/embed/#?secret=Y1OUCuhR4C" data-secret="Y1OUCuhR4C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G clinical is also announcing over $200 million in a growth equity round led by Goldman Sachs. Before Goldman, the primary investment came from Boston-based Schooner Capital and First Analysis, a VC firm out of Chicago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelleher declined to say what the plans for the round were, other than company has plans to pursue more go-to-market strategies and R&amp;D, and ultimately aims to “take up as much air” in the eClinical and RTSM space as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eClinical market is expected to reach about </span><a href="https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/eclinical-solutions-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$14.7 billion by 2027</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. RTSM made up about 17 percent of market share in 2020. With the complexity of clinical trials increasing, and the number of trials growing – even after COVID-19 related issues shut many trials down in 2020 – there may be room for more growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before COVID-19, there was evidence that the amount of clinical trials had </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/trends"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steadily been increasing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2000, there were 2,119 clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. By 2010, 100,208, and by 2020, 362,532 registered by the end of the year (that includes massive slowdowns created by the pandemic for non-COVID research). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within that landscape, there is some evidence that sponsors of clinical trials are using more external applications to manage those clinical trials. Of 500 clinical operations professionals respondents </span><a href="https://www.veeva.com/eu/resources/clinical-operations-survey-report-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Veeva (another eClinical company, keep in mind) found that 63 percent were using an RTSM system, up from about 43 percent in 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G Clinical, generally, is looking to benefit from the increased public attention to the clinical trials process, and the flexibility that the pandemic has created for sponsors to get creative with clinical trial designs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic did encourage some innovation in this regard. Take, for example, the World Health Organization’s SOLIDARITY trial, which used an adaptive trial design in which multiple drugs could be tested at once. Drugs that showed no promise mid-way through the trial could be dropped (as hydroxychloroquine was in June 2020). The adaptive part, in short, allows for mid-trial tweaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the traditional design of the gold-standard randomized controlled clinical trial, but it did glean a significant amount of knowledge in a short period of time. </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2034294"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, three of four drugs tested showed no effect on mortality, whereas the fifth remdesivir, showed some limited promise. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9o43Rd0WAf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/the-health-data-transparency-movement-is-birthing-a-new-generation-of-startups/">The health data transparency movement is birthing a new generation of startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The health data transparency movement is birthing a new generation of startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/the-health-data-transparency-movement-is-birthing-a-new-generation-of-startups/embed/#?secret=9o43Rd0WAf" data-secret="9o43Rd0WAf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adaptive trial designs weren’t unheard of before the pandemic – the FDA had actually released guidance on adaptive clinical trials </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the post-pandemic landscape might encourage more flexibility in this regard, and with it, increase a need for software that can be tweaked to accommodate such changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that we saw some regulatory hurdles reduced as part of this process that allows for more creativity in study design,” says Kelleher. “Probably the most important thing for us is our flexibility, we can make changes to studies very rapidly – to live studies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4G Clinical and other RTSM software like it, are looking to hone tools that already exist within clinical trials – specifically software used to actually run them. It’s an area of research that the team itself has both a personal stake in, and strong industry knowledge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelleher was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 23 (a disease to which there is still no definitive cure), and previously founded the Portland-based ACME business consulting. His co-founder Ed Tourtellotte, lost his wife to breast cancer around the same time. Neither have a background in pharmacology, but rather, the team is tackling drug development through streamlining clinical trial software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, other companies aim to streamline clinical trial processes through A.I-based drug target identification, an especially hype-induced area of the space in which investment quadrupled to </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$13.9 billion between 2019 and 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Clinical trial management software may seem more mundane, but it’s still an essential part of running Phase III and most Phase II studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tourtellotte has designed bespoke software systems for major drug developers, including Pfizer’s Impala system (used in 80 percent of Pfizer’s clinical trials for the past 20 years, says Kelleher) and another system Trident, which was sold </span><a href="https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2010/10/20/BioClinica-to-launch-game-changing-IVR-IWR-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Bioclinica in 2009</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (along with Tourtoulette’s company, Tourtellotte Solutions). Trident was </span><a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/drug-discovery/gsk-to-use-bioclinica-tool-to-manage-clinical-trials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilized by GlaxoSmithKlein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for clinical trials in 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the company has declined to confirm a total amount of funding, but in 2020, revenue grew 110 percent with just ten percent of its portfolio focused on COVID-19 related projects. </span></p>

But I’ve altogether given up on testing them around here. Granted, living in Queens, NY presents a unique combination of obstacles, including population density, two major international airports and a prison – but restrictions have made it next to impossible to fly around here.</p>
<p>Knowing precisely where the nearest open airspace is can get tricky, particularly in large cities like New York. Today, Alphabet’s drone-delivery subsidiary Wing announced that it’s launching its OpenSky app in the U.S. on Google Play and the iOS App Store.</p>

<p>The app was launched in Australia back in 2019 for both hobbyist and commercial drone pilots, with help from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The U.S. version was created with input from the FAA for operation in Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) airspaces.</p>
<p>Using the app, drone operators can request approval to operate in spaces like those around areas, expediting a process that would traditionally take days or weeks to go through.</p>
<p>“Why is a drone delivery company investing in an operator app?” Wing asks rhetorically in a blog post. “Because with nearly two million registered drones in the U.S. already, regulatory compliance of all drones will allow them to share the sky safely. Moreover, compliance will ultimately expand the uses and benefits of drones &#8212; among them emergency response, commercial inspections and contactless delivery &#8212; to more people.”</p>
<p>The app is available for users in the U.S. starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Citizenry announced today that it raised $20 million in Series B funding in partnership with NextWorld Evergreen. A direct-to-consumer home decor retailer, <a href="https://www.the-citizenry.com/">The Citizenry</a> works with artisans from around the world to produce limited-edition runs of handcrafted, hand-numbered home goods. In October, The Citizenry opened its first brick-and-mortar store in New York City, and with this round of funding, The Citizenry hopes to accelerate its development into a whole-home brand.</p>
<p>Co-Founder Rachel Bentley got her start at Bain &amp; Company, where she worked in strategy consulting in global supply chains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a lot of the challenges that were coming as a result of that, tied to income inequality, human rights, and the environment,&#8221; Bentley told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I also saw the tremendous opportunity that connections of global supply chains can create to hopefully move communities forward.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bentley and fellow co-founder Carly Nance, a brand strategist, noticed that there was a gap in the market for premium, thoughtfully crafted home goods. They took the leap to leave their corporate jobs to start The Citizenry with the aim to make a positive global impact and set more socially conscious standards for the home decor industry.</p>
<p>These are lofty goals, but Bentley&#8217;s experience in global supply chain strategy helped her develop a business model that prioritizes the fair treatment of workers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170637" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170637" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170637" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4X6A9543-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170637" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Citizenry</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges in working with artisan communities is that companies are there for one season, they place a large order, and their goal is to get a really high volume at a very low price,&#8221; Bentley says. &#8220;We came in and took the opposite approach. We tried to identify groups we saw a long term potential with, that we could partner with for the next ten, twenty, fifty years, to really help grow their businesses. Having sustainable income day in and day out, not just seasonally, is where you really start to see change happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Citizenry is a member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), and for over eighteen months, they&#8217;ve been going through the process to become fully verified through the WFTO&#8217;s Guarantee System. This means that the WFTO reviews every partner and conducts several day, in-person examinations of the artisans&#8217; working conditions. On average, The Citizenry pays its artisans double the local minimum wage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170638" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170638" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170638" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Citizenry_Headshots1764.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170638" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Citizenry</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Social responsibility is much more important to our generation than previous generations,&#8221; Bentley said. &#8220;We want to feel good about the way a product was made, because we know we&#8217;re going to be living with the ramifications of how it was made, whether that&#8217;s environmentally or in terms of human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bentley says that the rise in farm-to-table food shopping is indicative of consumers&#8217; transition in values. But spending an extra few dollars on organic produce isn&#8217;t quite the same as shelling out $695 for a Portuguese leather headboard. So, The Citizenry may not undercut retailers like IKEA, but their price points are often cheaper than luxury home competitors like Williams-Sonoma, for example. The fact that The Citizenry can even compete with larger retailers while paying livable wages to artisans is a testament to their business model.</p>
<p>Since closing its Series A in 2019, The Citizenry has grown sales over 200%, with repeat customers driving 45% of sales. Over the same period, the company has supported 3,000 global artisan jobs. With its Series B funding, The Citizenry hopes to expand its furniture section &#8212; the most shopped category on its website &#8212; and invest in expanding its brick-and-mortar business after its SoHo store&#8217;s successful launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s upcoming Starship orbital test flight could end up being a veritable smorgasbord of its technological capabilities, as the company has filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to request approval to fly Starlink terminals on the spacecraft in order to &#8220;demonstrate high data rate communications&#8221; between the new launch system and the ground throughout the course of the trip to space and back.</p>
<p>SpaceX plans to show that its network of Starlink low-Earth orbit satellites can provide &#8220;unprecedented volumes of telemetry and enable communications during atmospheric reentry&#8221; even during the parts of the launch where communications signals are typically lost due to the presence of &#8220;ionized plasma&#8221; in the atmosphere during the re-entry phase (via <a href="https://twitter.com/nextspaceflight/status/1409743521964126213">Michael Baylor on Twitter</a>). If it works, it could provide better than ever live data for SpaceX during its test flight, which should help with the Starship and Super Heavy launch system&#8217;s development — and it could mean better, more spectacular views for those of us just watching from home via livestream, too.</p>
<p>Including Starlink as the communications method for telemetry and other communications during the launch is definitely a functional improvement for SpaceX if it works as described, but it&#8217;s even more of a flex for the company in terms of showing off Starlink&#8217;s capabilities. The FCC filing ones that the terminals to be installed on the spacecraft are basically just its existing consumer terminals with new exterior housings, so if it performs well that could attract the attention of more consumer broadband customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, SpaceX is also talking a lot about the capabilities of Starlink as a system to replace older, more distant geostationary satellites networks to provide things like connectivity on airplanes, on ships and in other in other transportation modals. Showing that it offers solid performance during a rocket launch is definitely going to encourage partners in those areas.</p>
<p>The filing does specific that its license to operate Starlink on Starship begin on August 1, which means either it&#8217;s planned for a launch after the one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/spacex-aiming-for-first-orbital-test-launch-of-starship-in-july/">SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the company is hoping to fly sometime in July</a>, or the date has already likely slipped to the following month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connected vehicle data startup Wejo has announced partnerships with Microsoft, Palantir and Sompo Holdings to improve its ability to collect, store and analyze data from millions of connected vehicles around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the GM-backed startup’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/gm-palantir-backed-wejo-to-go-public-via-spac/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB15j4_LLIgYipyT2vQvTXTKPis2yUVqj62qrz6u4mz0arn1auKNqwFb52kxhKtezYBd8s3W18C1p8Oia9zphszONZf9ao4dOKumFAkS1vehge_TMlAvQ6y9ibvaFaAYvFniAQ5QAs3Xh1MUF9IBavxqZsDlr4sCtErDV6xv6vzo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement that it would be going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virtuoso Acquisition Corp., which is expected to close later this year. A $25 million commitment from Microsoft and Sompo, combined with already-committed investors GM and Palantir, bring Wejo’s total PIPE financing to $125 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palantir has been a previous strategic investor in Wejo. In 2019, the software developer launched a Japanese joint venture with insurance provider Sompo. Now this venture’s partnership with Wejo will give the startup the chance to collect connected vehicle data in Japan, and perhaps the greater Asia-Pacific region. The company already has some live vehicles in Korea, but 95% of its data comes from the U.S., according to Richard Barlow, Wejo’s founder and CEO. Sompo will analyze Wejo’s connected vehicle data using the </span><a href="https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palantir Foundry data and analytics platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the company.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The vast majority of cars now sold globally have this ability to be connected, so there’s a huge opportunity,” Barlow told TechCruch. “We have 11 million live cars on our platform out of a supply base of about 50 million vehicles. We have over 17 OEM partners live on the platform, and we’re processing 16 billion data points a day, a peak of about 40,000 per second, which explains why we’re also excited to be backed by Microsoft and to be migrating to their Azure cloud platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barlow says Wejo can see 7% of all vehicles moving around New York, 6% around California and 20% around Detroit from partnerships with automakers like GM, Daimler and Hyundai. The company can either hand off raw, anonymized data — collected from vehicles with the consent of the owner — to businesses, developers or governments, or it can perform data analytics for them, which is also where the partnership with Microsoft can come in handy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Microsoft came up with a really compelling solution about how we can leverage their machine learning and AI capabilities to actually provide even more incredible products back to OEMs and key industries that want to use connected vehicle data,” said Barlow. “So Microsoft’s Azure doing that heavy lifting is really going to speed up our business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Wejo, initial applications might include traffic solutions, as well as remote diagnostics, integrated payments, advertising, retail and logistics. The two companies are also discussing the potential of using Wejo for Microsoft’s mapping solutions. Barlow says mapping companies are often typical buyers of Wejo’s data and expects to see more insurance providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen 11 million instances of two vehicles coming together, and in real time, we&#8217;re getting data from both those vehicles,” said Barlow. “So we&#8217;re starting to preempt and understand the characteristics or behaviours of before and after that collision or that interaction of vehicles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wejo collects data that can recreate a car crash, from how each driver stomped on the brakes to which airbags were deployed to the speed of impact and which sensors were destroyed. It can then share this kind of data back to the insurer to help speed up the claims and recovery process and make repairs be more accurate, said Barlow.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this data demonstrating human driving behaviors in a range of circumstances has been collected over the last seven years, making Wejo an attractive partner for companies developing autonomous technology.</span></p>

<p>Sunnyvale-based, Israeli-founded JFrog is publicly traded on Nasdaq, where it went public last September, and currently it has a market cap of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FROG?p=FROG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.65 billion</a>. Vdoo, meanwhile, had raised about $70 million from investors that include NTT, Dell, GGV and Verizon (disclaimer: Verizon owns TechCrunch), and when we covered its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/vdoo-raises-25m-more-to-develop-its-ai-based-security-for-iot-and-connected-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent funding round</a>, we estimated that the valuation was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million, making this a decent return.</p>
<p>Shlomi Ben Haim, JFrog&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said that his company&#8217;s turn to focusing deeper on security, and making this acquisition in particular to fill out that strategy, are a natural progression in its aim to built out an end-to-end platform for the DevOps team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we started JFrog, the main challenge was to educate the market on what we saw as most important priorities when it comes to building, testing and deploying software,&#8221; he said. Then sometime around 2015-2016 he said they started to realize there was a &#8220;crack&#8221; in the system, &#8220;a crack called security.&#8221; InfoSec engineers and developers sometimes work at cross purposes, as &#8220;developers became too fast&#8221; the work they were doing was inadvertently led to a lot of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>JFrog has been building a number of tools since then to address that and to bring the collective priorities together, such as its XRay product. And indeed, Vdoo is not JFrog&#8217;s first foray into security, but it represents a significant step deeper into the hardware and systems that are being run on software. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very important leap forward,&#8221; Ben Haim said.</p>
<p>For its part, Vdoo was born out of a realization as well as a challenging mission: IoT and other connected devices &#8212; a universe of some 50 billion pieces of hardware as of last year &#8212; represents a massive security headache, and not just because of the volume of devices: each object uses and interacts with software in the cloud and so each instance represents a potential vulnerability, with zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among some of the most common.</p>
<p>While connected-device security up to now has typically focused on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of it, Vdoo’s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves on top of that, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. Interestingly, this mirrors the kind of binary analysis that JFrog provides in its DevOps platform, making the two complementary to each other.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s notable is that this will give JFrog a bigger play at the edge, since part of Vdoo&#8217;s platform works on devices themselves, &#8220;micro agents&#8221; as the company has described them to me previously, to detect and repair vulnerabilities on endpoints.</p>
<p>While JFrog has built a lot of its own business from the ground up, it has made a number of acquisitions to bolt on technology (one example: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/jfrog-acquires-shippable-adding-continuous-integration-and-delivery-to-its-devops-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shippable</a>, which it used to bring continuous integration and delivery into its DevOps platform). In this case, Netanel Davidi, the co-founder and CEO of Vdoo (who previously co-founded and sold another security startup, Cyvera, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/palo-alto-networks-buys-cyber-security-company-cyvera-for-200m/">to Palo Alto Networks</a>) said that this was a good fit because the two companies are fundamentally taking the same approaches in their work (another synergy and justification for DevOps and InfoSec being more closely knitted together too I might add).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In terms of the fit between the companies, it&#8217;s about our approach to binaries,&#8221; Davidi said in an interview, noting that the two being on the same page with this approach was fundamental to the deal. &#8220;That&#8217;s only the way to cover the entire pipeline from the very beginning, when they go you develop something, all the way to the device or to the server or to the application or to the mobile phone. That&#8217;s the only way to truly understand the context and contextual risk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>He also made a note not just of the tech but of the talent that is coming on with the acquisition: 100 people joining JFrog&#8217;s 800.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;If JFrog chose to build something like this themselves, they could have done it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the uniqueness here is that we have built the best security team, the best security researchers, the best vulnerability researchers, the best reverse engineers, which focus not only on embedded systems, and IoT, which is considered to be the hardest thing to learn and to analyze, but also in software artifacts. We are bringing this knowledge along with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>JFrog said that Vdoo will continue to operate as a standalone SaaS product for the time being. Updates that are made will be in aid of supporting the JFrog platform and the two aim to have a fully integrated, &#8220;holistic&#8221; product by 2022.</p>
<p>Along with the deal, JFrog reiterated financial guidance for the next quarter that will end June 30, 2021. It expects revenues of $47.6 million to $48.6 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $0.5 million to $1.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.00 to $0.01, assuming approximately 104 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For Full Year 2021, revenues are expected to be $198 million to $204 million, with non-GAAP operating income between $5 million and $7 million and an approximately 3% increase in weighted average diluted shares. JFrog anticipates consolidated operating expenses to increase by approximately $9-10 million for the remainder of 2021, subject to the acquisition closing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">2U, a SaaS platform that helps non-profits and colleges run online universities, plans to acquire all the assets of Harvard and MIT-founded edX for a deal north of $600 million, according to multiple sources. 2U did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and its unclear if this is an all-cash deal. The combined forces of edX and 2U could reach over 50 million learners.</p>
<p><em>Update: 2U confirmed the deal, expected to close within 120 days subject to regulatory and governmental approvals, in a press release post-publication. It also confirmed that the price of the acquisition which will be an $800 million all-cash deal. </em></p>
<p>The deal gives 2U, <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/25/2u-files-for-100m-ipo-adds-ex-citigroup-chief-to-board-but-is-it-really-poised-to-be-the-next-big-education-technology-company/ ">a company that filed to go public in 2014 </a>and continues to be one of the rare U.S. edtech companies listed on the stock market, a new wave of collaboratively-built content to its software. Plus, 2U just acquired with stronger name recognition thanks to its Ivy League backers, which some see as a branding move that could help the public company with its own chunk of the market. The company&#8217;s last big acquisition was in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/2u-trilogy/">when it paid $750 million to acquire Trilogy education,</a> a company that builds in-person and online bootcamps in collaboration with universities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/02/harvard-mit-will-bring-classes-to-the-masses-with-their-edx-online-learning-initiative/ ">EdX was founded in 2012</a> amid a crop of massive open online course (MOOC) offerings, including Udacity and Coursera. The company, set up as a non-profit, had an alluring promise upon launch: it would help anyone in the world take a Harvard or MIT class, for free. The institutions, of course, have thrown in a cumulative $80 million in donations into edX to keep the operation free. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/02/harvard-mit-will-bring-classes-to-the-masses-with-their-edx-online-learning-initiative/">Its own launch</a> came weeks after Coursera announced that Princeton, Stanford, UPenn, and the University of Michigan would host courses on its own online learning platform. Now, edX&#8217;s acquisition comes months after Coursera went public.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Today, edX, led by president and professor Anant Agarwal, hosts over 3,000 courses led by 15,000 instructors and used by 35 million users. Open edX, the platform’s open source platform, is used by 2,400 learning sites worldwide,</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.edx.org/about-us"> according to the organization’s website.</a></p>
<p>EdX will turn into a public benefit corporation as part of this transaction. Per sources, proceeds from the transaction will go into another non-profit managed by Harvard and MIT, and the institutions will not profit off of the transaction. That said, an MIT statement reveals. that edX took a line of credit from MIT and Harvard, and those funds will be returned to both institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because edX is a public charity, the proceeds from its sale can only be distributed for a purpose consistent with edX’s mission, not to compensate those who contributed to the nonprofit,&#8221;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/mit-harvard-transfer-edx-2u-faq-0629"> the statement reads. </a></p>
<p>Part of this transaction, which has been in the works since February 2021, is colored by the fact that edX has been transparent with its own financial woes and journey to becoming a self-sustaining business. Then MIT Provost Rafael Reif, now the president of the school, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/02/harvard-mit-will-bring-classes-to-the-masses-with-their-edx-online-learning-initiative/">hinted at eventual revenue generation the program first launched</a>, saying in 2012 that “the drive is not to make money..that said, we intend to find a way to support those activities. There are several approaches we are considering, and we don’t want this project to become a drain on the budgets of MIT or Harvard.”</p>
<p>In 2018, the same fiscal year it <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/edx-2020-review/">had $37 million in revenue</a>, edX introduced<a href="https://blog.edx.org/furthering-the-edx-mission?track=blog"> a support fee, </a>alongside its ongoing offering that asks students to pay for a verified certification upon course completion. In announcement, the company wrote that &#8220;we believe that we need to move toward a financial model that allows edX and our partners to achieve sustainability and we acknowledge that means moving away from our current model of offering virtually everything for free.&#8221; The edX board also considered other options, MIT. said, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/mit-harvard-transfer-edx-2u-faq-0629">but decided those were</a> &#8220;not as beneficial to edX, its learners, or its partner institutions as the transaction with 2U.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new transaction and edX’s choice to turn into a public benefit corporation might become the financial model that it itself was looking for, indicating just how. hard it may be to monetize a MOOC. While 2U has committed to continuing edX’s free coursework for at least five years, as well as seeding a new non-profit, edX as it currently stands &#8211; a massive education non-profit &#8211; will no longer function as it currently does in the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Google today is launching a new suite of resources for people struggling with food insecurity across the U.S. The project includes the launch of a new website, &#8220;Find Food Support,&#8221; that connects people to food support resources, including hotlines, SNAP information, and a Google Maps locator tool that points people to their local food banks, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today is launching a new suite of resources for people struggling with food insecurity across the U.S. The project includes the launch of a new website, &#8220;<a href="http://g.co/findfoodsupport">Find Food Support</a>,&#8221; that connects people to food support resources, including hotlines, SNAP information, and a Google Maps locator tool that points people to their local food banks, food pantries and school meal program pickup locations, among other things.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/connecting-people-to-food-support">announcement</a>, Google explains how the Covid-19 pandemic fueled a worsening food crisis in the U.S., which led to some 45 million people &#8212; or 1 in 7 Americans &#8212; experiencing food insecurity at some point during 2020. That figure was up 30% over 2019, the company noted. And of those 45 million people, 15 million were children.</p>
<p>While the pandemic&#8217;s impacts are starting subside as businesses are reopening and in-person activities are resuming, many children will still go hungry during the summer months when school lunch programs become unavailable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To help address this need and others related to food insecurity, Google&#8217;s new website available at <a href="http://g.co/findfoodsupport">g.co/findfoodsupport</a> offers a combination of food support resources, YouTube videos about the problem of food insecurity in the U.S., and a Google Maps locator tool that will direct people to their nearby food bank or other food support locations.</p>
<p>Google says it worked with organizations including No Kid Hungry, FoodFinder, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to capture 90,000 places offering free food support across the 50 U.S. states. Using the online tool, website visitors can type in their location to see school meal program pickup sites, food banks and food pantries in their area.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171188" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171188" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171188" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171188" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The tool will display the location&#8217;s address, phone number and other details &#8212; like which days it&#8217;s open or business hours.</p>
<p>Although you can find this information in Google Maps directly, it can be more difficult if you don&#8217;t know the right keywords to use. For example, a search &#8220;food support&#8221; returned a combination of charities, food banks and public services alongside businesses with matching keywords, like &#8220;Food Lion&#8221; and &#8220;Lowe&#8217;s Foods.&#8221; A search for &#8220;food assistance&#8221; was more complete, but also returned unrelated results, like the &#8220;US Food &amp; Drug Administration.&#8221; The online tool&#8217;s search results will be more precise and accurate.</p>
<p>The new website also highlights other food support information, including SNAP benefit information; support for specific groups, like seniors, children, and families; state-by-state benefit guidelines; and food support hotlines. For those not facing food support issues, it offers information on how to donate money, time or food to those in need.</p>
<p>The site additionally features a handful of YouTube videos published by organizations across the country who are working to address food insecurity issues in their own communities. The videos aim to destigmatize food insecurity by showing how all types of people use food support &#8212; including military families, children, and seniors. Google says 1 in 9 active-duty military families experience food insecurity, as do 1 in 6 children, 1 in 3 college students, and over 5 million seniors, for example.</p>
<p>The new site is the result of an effort by Google&#8217;s &#8220;Food for Good,&#8221; headed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyjma/">Emily Ma</a>. Food for Good originally began as an early stage moonshot project (from Alphabet&#8217;s X, formerly Google[x]) <a href="https://blog.x.company/a-new-home-for-project-delta-a39f8286b6d7">known as Project Delta</a>, which focused on creating a smarter food system. The team wanted to find ways to keep food waste out of landfills by better directing food to those who need it most. In December 2020, Ma <a href="https://blog.x.company/a-new-home-for-project-delta-a39f8286b6d7">announced</a> Project Delta would be moving to Google to scale up its work. The core team then joined Google as &#8220;Food for Good,&#8221; while the food traceability team remained at X to work on broader issues.</p>
<p>Google says it will continue to add more food support locations to the food locator tool going forward, beyond the 90,000 it offers today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.accel.com">Accel</a> announced Tuesday the close of three new funds totaling $3.05 billion, money that it will be using to back early-stage startups, as well as growth rounds for more mature companies. Notably, the 38-year-old Silicon Valley-based venture firm is doubling down on global investing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement underscores both the robust confidence investors continue to have for backing startups in the tech sector and the amount of money available to startups these days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, today Accel is announcing its fifteenth early-stage U.S. fund at $650 million; its seventh early-stage European and Israeli fund also at $650 million and its sixth global growth stage fund at $1.75 billion. The latter fund is in addition, and designed to complement, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously unannounced </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/noteworthy/accels-latest-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.3 billion global &#8220;Leaders&#8221; fund</span></a> that is focused on later-stage investing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Accel closed in December.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel expects to invest in about 20 to 30 companies per fund on average, according to Partner Rich Wong. Its average investment in its growth fund will be in the $50 million to $75 million range, and $75 million and $100 million out of its global Leaders fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the firm is also still eager and “excited” to incubate companies, Wong said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll still write $500,000 to $1 million seed checks,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s important to us to work with companies from the very beginning and support them through their entire journey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, as TechCrunch recently reported, Accel has a history of backing companies that were previously bootstrapped (and often profitable) -– the latest example being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/lower-raises-100m-series-a-from-accel/">Lower</a>, a Columbus, Ohio-based fintech, which just raised a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/lower-raises-100m-series-a-from-accel/"> $100 million Series A</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Accel is often referred to some of these companies by existing portfolio companies (also in the case of Lower, whose CEO was referred to Accel by Galileo Clay Wilkes). More often than not, companies that Accel backs out of its early-stage and growth funds are bootstrapped and located outside of Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture firm has long looked outside of Silicon Valley for opportunities, and has had offices not only in the Bay Area, but in London and Bangalore for years. Part of its investment thesis is to “invest early and locally,” according to Wong. Examples of this philosophy include investments in companies based all over the world &#8212; from Mexico to Stockholm to Tel Aviv to Munich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the time of its last fund closure in 2019, the firm has seen 10 portfolio companies go public, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack, Austin-based Bumble, Bucharest-based UiPath, CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, Deliveroo and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/squarespace-files-for-a-direct-listing-on-the-nyse/">Squarespace</a>, among others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also had 40 companies experience an M&amp;A, including Utah-based Qualtrics&#8217;s $8 billion acquisition by SAP and Segment&#8217;s $3.2 billion acquisition by Twilio. Also, just last week, Rockwell Automation announced it was</span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210625005162/en/Rockwell-Automation-to-Expand-Industrial-Cloud-Software-Offering-with-Acquisition-of-Plex-Systems"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buying Michigan-based Plex Systems </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $2.22 billion in cash. Accel first invested in Plex, which has developed a subscription-based smart manufacturing platform, in 2012.</span></p>
<p>Recent investments include a number of fintech companies such as LatAm&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/">Flink</a>, Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/">Unit</a> and Robinhood rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">Public</a>. Accel has also backed as existing portfolio companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/webflow-raises-140m-pushing-its-valuation-to-2-1-billion/">Webflow, </a>a software company that helps businesses build no-code websites and events startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">Hopin</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wong says Accel is “open-minded but thematic” in its investment approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner Sonali de Rycker, who is based out of London, agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, we’ll look at automation companies, consumer businesses and security companies, but at a global scale. Our goal is to find the best entrepreneurs regardless of where they are,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has only been intensified by the recent rise of the smartphone and cloud, Wong said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before, companies were mostly selling to the consumer in their own country,” he added. “But now the size of the market is so dramatically bigger, allowing them to become even larger, which is one of the reasons why I believe we’re seeing investment pace at this speed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support this, it’s notable that Accel’s global Leaders fund is “dramatically” larger than the $500 million Leaders fund the firm closed in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, de Rycker points out, companies are staying private longer so the opportunity to invest in them until they sell or go public is greater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel is also patient. In some cases, the firm’s investors will develop “years-long” relationships with companies they are courting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“1Password is an example of this approach,” Wong said. “Arun [Mathew] had that relationship for at least six years before that investment was made. Finally, 1Password called and said ‘We’re ready, and we want you to do it.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so Accel led the Canadian company&#8217;s first external round of funding in its 14-year history &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/">a $200 million Series A</a> &#8212; in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the firm is open-minded, there are still some industries it has not yet embraced as much as others. For example, Wong said, “We’re not announcing a $2.2 billion crypto fund, but we have done crypto investments, and see some very interesting trends there. We’ll look at where crypto takes us.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">10club, a six-month-old Indian startup that is building a Thrasio-like venture, said on Tuesday it has raised $40 million in what is one of the largest seed financing rounds in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Fireside Ventures (a prominent Indian investor in consumer and hardware tech space) and an unnamed global investor, the Indian startup said, without revealing the other firm’s name. HeyDay, PDS International, Class 5 Global, Secocha Ventures, and founders of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/indian-electronics-and-lifestyle-brand-boat-raises-100-million-from-warburg-pincus/">hardware startup boAt</a> (Aman Gupta and Sameer Mehta) also participated in the round. It&#8217;s not clear whether the round also includes debt &#8212; as is popular among Thrasio-like ventures &#8212; and if the entire financing is being wired in one tranche.</p>
<p><a href="https://10club.team">10club</a> acquires small brands that sell their products on e-commerce platforms and scales those businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Great businesses are growing on the backs of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa and more. They get their foundational years right but find it difficult to scale, and understand that competition is hard to curb.That&#8217;s where we step in, allowing you &#8211; the entrepreneurs &#8211; to enjoy an exit and benefit from years of hard work,” the startup describes on its LinkedIn page.</p>
<p>10club is one of a few dozen firms that is <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/06/india-thrasio-amazon-flipkart-acquire-brands-mensa/">attempting to replicate</a> what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model in India. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> earlier this month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany’s Razor Group to raise capital.</p>

<p>&mdash; Osborne Saldanha (@os7borne) <a href="https://twitter.com/os7borne/status/1405143112763150343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell mid-range to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so under-appreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/">consolidated about 6,000 third party sellers</a> on Amazon as of earlier this year.</p>
<p>“India and online-first brands are at the cusp of the next revolution. We, at Fireside, believe that both VC and acquisition driven model will co-exist going forward and can turbocharge the growth of early-stage brands. Together with the team at 10Club, we will be able to drive this change and enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to realize the full potential of their brands,&#8221; said Vinay Singh, Partner at Fireside Ventures, in a statement. As part of the deal, Singh is also joining 10club&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Bhavna Suresh, co-founder of 10club and former chief executive of real-estate marketplace Lamudi, said the startup has already built its foundational pillars of the centralized platform and signed letters of intent worth $15 million from several firms and will deploy the fresh capital to operate the new businesses.</p>
