										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For edtech startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/">it’s always been easier to go direct-to-consumer</a> than it is to sell into school districts. The latter has stodgy and strict sales cycles, while the former has a bit more flexibility when it comes to opening up that wallet. The pandemic added validation to this dynamic by supercharging consumer companies like Quizlet and Outschool, bringing them into the unicorn club.</p>
<p>Despite this growth, many startups still think that going B2B, directly into schools, will have the biggest impact on students, especially those who may not be able to afford supplemental services out of school. And while it&#8217;s the long game, Montreal-based <a href="https://paper.co/">Paper,</a> an educational software provider that powers tutoring services in schools, just gave the sector a massive signal that venture-backed returns and school districts can exist in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Paper announced that it has raised $100 million USD in a Series C round led by IVP. Other investors include Framework Venture Partners, Bullpen Capital, Reach Capital, Birchmere Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, BDC Capital and ETW.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, founded in 2014, sells tutoring software to K-12 schools in the United States and Canada. Its software allows students to request live tutor help on-demand, which can then be delivered in four languages across 200 subject areas. In the last year, Paper has grown from 100 tutors to 1000 tutors.</p>
<p>“School districts are not necessarily comfortable working with a company where these educators who have access to all their children are just contractors popping online and disappearing,” said Paper CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/pacutler">Philip Cutler</a>. “[Our tutors] are held to all the same professional standards that a classroom teacher would be.” The company has made its tutors part-time workers, to add a layer of incentive and formality to the working relationship and potentially limit attrition.</p>
<p>Cutler sees Paper as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">an alternate pathway for teachers looking to make a living</a> outside of traditional school districts. However, scalability demands could inherently clash with what teachers came to the profession to do &#8211; prioritizing speed and number of finished queries instead of consistent, repeatable help.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/embed/#?secret=sClobbnHOH" data-secret="sClobbnHOH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, the flexibility around how Paper&#8217;s advice looks and arrives is compelling. Paper claims it has 24/7 support, and that a student can request live chat help for five minutes, or for hours depending on the nature of the assignment. Since the company goes in-district, teachers can see where students are struggling most and cater class time to problem areas.</p>
<p>The company embodies a lot of what companies like Quizlet, Course Hero and Brainly have somewhat only recently invested in:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/"> the rise of smart, not slow, tutoring sessions. </a>They’re all betting that that modern-day extra help may not look like a Zoom, but instead a live chat with a white board feature tacked on.</p>
<p>The company declined to disclose valuation, but instead pointed to other growth metrics to illustrate its positioning in the market. Paper grew its staff from 30 employees to 130 employees. It has also grown 40x in revenue over the past two years, which Cutler said is mostly fueled by strong renewals and the network effect within school districts.</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t want to be the last district in your community or your area to have it, so we&#8217;ve seen a lot of adoption from that perspective,” he said.</p>
<p>Cutler admitted that there hasn’t been too many breakout B2B edtech businesses for the sector, but he thinks Paper’s latest raise &#8211; its third in the past 18 months &#8211; could be a signal that the entrepreneurial energy of direct-to-consumer might finally be making its way into the hallway.</p>

<p>“I think school districts are more receptive than they&#8217;ve ever been to changing and trying new things, and the last month has really shown us that you can actually take risks and you can try different things in school.”</p>
<p>He added: “It’s been lost in education for a while, and I’m proud of what’s happened over the last year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous driving system developer Ghost Locomotion has raised a $100 million Series D funding round, led by Sutter Hill Ventures. Returning investor Founders Fund also participated in the round, along with Coatue. The money will be used toward R&amp;D as the company continues to develop its highway self-driving and crash prevention technology.</p>
<p>Ghost has been working on a universal collision avoidance technology. The system is premised on the idea that an autonomous driving system doesn’t need to recognize and categorize objects prior to avoiding them – a major paradigm shift. Most systems begin by identifying an object and then use image localization to determine its size, distance and other relevant features.</p>
<p>“We skip that step,” Ghost CEO John Hayes told TechCrunch. “We’re going to recognize anything, any mass that appears in the scene, and then we can get a distance and relative velocity to that. We can start making decisions directly off that data before we’ve classified anything.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ghost instead tracks the movement of clusters of pixels in a scene. Hayes pointed to instances where an object is misclassified, or objects that the system hasn’t trained on, as possible failure modes and a reason why classification does not need to be a prerequisite for collision avoidance. Much of this comes down to the certainty of the system’s decisions. According to Ghost, an autonomous system that starts from image recognition is one loaded with lots of opportunity for uncertainty – and it argues, less safe actions on the road.</p>
<p>One obvious counter-argument is that objects should be classified because they behave differently – a vehicle acts differently than a pedestrian, so classification is what allows a system to predict their behavior. But Hayes said that one shouldn&#8217;t start with classification, but collision avoidance. &#8220;And then if you want to make predictions, you can still do classification,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One benefit of its system, according to Ghost, is that it requires less computational power – an important consideration for vehicle owners, as higher processing demands can translate into less fuel efficiency. It’s also important for battery electric vehicles that have autonomous driving systems, as each watt of computer power demanded by the AV system can cause a reduction in driving range. Tesla, for example, revealed in 2019 that driving range could be reduced by up to 25% when the driver-assist system was enabled.</p>

<p>Ghost has performed most if its tests off-road, by setting up physical obstacles or by using augmented reality up against a real vehicle. It has not yet started testing its collision avoidance system in an urban environment, where decision complexity skyrockets considerably. Nor has it started testing on public highways – that will begin this year, and scale up next year, with a human safety driver behind the wheel, Hayes said.</p>
<p>The company seems to have slightly altered its market roadmap since it last talked to TechCrunch in 2019. Then, Ghost was developing a consumer kit that would give privately owned passenger vehicles autonomous driving capability on highways. It had estimated that it would debut the kit in 2020, for less than Tesla’s Autopilot package (which went for around $7,000 at the time).</p>
<p>The company hasn’t completely closed the door on this model – Hayes said that “we want to get this in front of customers” – but now it’s also talking about working with automakers directly to get its technology stack into vehicles before they’re even sold.</p>
<p>“We’ll find any path to market we can take,” he added. Under the straight-to-consumer model, the company is starting with a limited number of compatible models, and the cars must be relatively new due to the minimum technological requirements of the system.</p>
<p>Along with the funding news, Ghost also said it had brought on Jacqueline Glassman, former Chief Counsel and Acting Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as General Counsel. She joined the company in April and will likely play a key role as Ghost joins other autonomous driving technology developers in the path to commercialization.</p>

<p>No matter which event — or events — you choose, you’ll come away with invaluable information. That’s not just us tooting our own horn although, what the heck — beep, beep!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is embracing longer videos. The company announced this morning it will roll out the option to create videos of up to 3 minutes in length after first testing the change with a larger number of creators over the past several months. Previously, TikTok videos could be up to 60 seconds in length, after initially expanding from 15-second clips. This 60-second video format had since been copied by newer TikTok competitors, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Snapchat Spotlight</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">YouTube Shorts</a>.</p>
<p>According to TikTok, the company decided to expand its max video length based on feedback it heard from its creator community. For some kinds of content, creators wanted more time and flexibility when filming &#8212; like when they were filming cooking demos, beauty tutorials, educational content, and comedic sketches, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;With longer videos, creators will have the canvas to create new or expanded types of content on TikTok, with the flexibility of a bit more space,&#8221; explained TikTok Product Manager Drew Kirchhoff, in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/longer-videos">announcement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before the expansion to 3 minutes, many creators had worked around TikTok&#8217;s limitations by encouraging viewers to &#8220;like and follow&#8221; them for part 2 (or 3, or 4&#8230;) of their video series. That may have worked to gain some additional followers, but it became frustrating to viewers who didn&#8217;t want to scroll through the creators&#8217; other videos just to find the rest of the video content they had originally been interested in. It also made it clear how many TikTok creators were having to find a solution to an artificial limitation that didn&#8217;t need to exist.</p>
<p>This change to video length could make TikTok even more of a competitor to YouTube, which has been worried enough about TikTok&#8217;s growth to launch its own TikTok rival directly in its own app, YouTube Shorts. But TikTok understands its platform advantage isn&#8217;t how short the videos are, it&#8217;s the combination of features it offers &#8212; including its extensive library of special effects, AR tools, music catalog, and the dialog created among creators by way of specialized tools like stitches and duets.</p>
<p>Other rivals are also taking notice of the TikTok threat.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Instagram Head <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?s=21">Adam Mosseri said</a> the Facebook-owned app historically associated with photo-sharing would soon begin experimenting with making short, entertaining videos a more central part of the Instagram experience. He promised Instagram would test out with new ways to better embrace video, including &#8220;fullscreen, immersive, entertaining, mobile-first video.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, there&#8217;s some really serious competition right now. TikTok is huge. YouTube is even bigger,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>TikTok had first begun tests of 3 minutes videos <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnavarra/status/1334125358103277575?lang=en">late last year.</a> The company  says the option to film longer videos will roll out to global users over the weeks ahead. Users will be notified when they receive the update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most companies don&#8217;t announce their first venture investment after almost 20 years in the business, nor do they announce that round is the equivalent of a good startup&#8217;s entire private fundraising history. But <a href="https://articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, a SaaS training and development platform, is not your typical company and today it announced a whopping $1.5 billion investment on a $3.75 billion valuation.</p>
<p>You can call it Series A if you must label it, but whatever it is, it&#8217;s a hefty investment by any measure. General Atlantic led the round with participation from Blackstone Growth and Iconiq Growth. GA claims it&#8217;s one of the largest A rounds ever, and I&#8217;m willing to bet it&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>CEO Adam Schwartz founded the company with his life savings in 2002 and hasn&#8217;t taken a dime of outside investment since. &#8220;Our software enables organizations to develop, deliver, and analyze online training that is engaging and [interesting] for enterprises and SMBs,&#8221; Schwartz explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that the company started back in 2002 as a plug-in for PowerPoint. Today it is a software service with the goal of helping enable everyone to deliver training, even if they aren&#8217;t a training professional. Articulate actually has two main products, one is a set of tools for companies building training that connects to an enterprise learning management system or LMS. The other is aimed at SMBs or departments in an enterprise.</p>
<p>Its approach seems to be working with the company reporting it has 106,000 customers across 161 countries including every single one of the Fortune 100. Schwartz was loath to share any additional metrics, but did say they hope to use this money to grow 10x over the next several years.</p>

<p>Company president Lucy Suros, who has been with the organization for a decade, says even with this success, they see plenty of opportunity for growth and they felt taking this capital now would really enable them to accelerate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the most dominant player by far in course offering apps, but when you look at that whole ecosystem and you think about where companies are in transforming from instructor-led training to online training, they&#8217;re still really in the early innings so there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Anton Levy, co-president and managing director at General Atlantic, who is leading the investment for the firm, says that this is a &#8220;big, bold, incredible business&#8221; and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re making an investment of this size and scope. &#8220;The reason we&#8217;re stepping up in such a large way, and what&#8217;s such a large check for us, is because of the business they&#8217;ve built, the team they&#8217;ve built, and frankly the market opportunity that they&#8217;re playing in and their ambition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today the company has 300 employees and they have been working as a remote company long before COVID. With the new capital, that number could triple over the next several years. Suros says that when she started at the company, there were 50 employees, mostly male engineers and she went to work to make it a more diverse work environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve put emphasis and a lot of just structural things in place to ensure that we are bringing more [diverse] people to the table, and then supporting folks once they&#8217;re here,&#8221; she said. With the new capital, the company announced a lot of new benefits and she said those were developed with the idea of helping break down barriers for under-represented groups in their ranks including covering gender transition-related costs.</p>
<p>She says that one of the benefits of becoming more visible as a company is being able to talk about and their <a href="https://articulatehco.com/#/lessons/4QO-wAZFGaknlor-QI8Heibaff8OM7yF">human-centered organization framework</a>, the set of principles the company put in place to define its values. &#8220;[We think about] how that can impact the employees and drive human flourishing for its own sake, and that also happens to lead to better business outcomes. But we&#8217;re really also interested in it from [the standpoint that] we want to be good and do good in the world and promote human flourishing at work,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company seems to have been doing just fine up until now, but with this kind of capital, it aims to take the business to another level, while trying to be good corporate citizens as they do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany&#8217;s federal information commissioner has run out of patience with Facebook.</p>
<p>Last month, Ulrich Kelber <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/DokumenteBfDI/Rundschreiben/Allgemein/2021/Facebook-Auftritte-Bund.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1">wrote to government agencies</a> &#8220;strongly recommend[ing]&#8221; they to close down their official Facebook Pages because of ongoing data protection compliance problems and the tech giant&#8217;s failure to fix the issue.</p>
<p>In the letter, Kelber warns the government bodies that he intends to start taking enforcement action from January 2022 &#8212; essentially giving them a deadline of next year to pull their pages from Facebook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So expect <em>not</em> to see official Facebook Pages of German government bodies in the coming months.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="de" dir="ltr">Ein Hinweis auf das Rundschreiben des BfDI zu den Facebook-Auftritten von Bundesbehörden <a href="https://t.co/tDi5iIES1c">https://t.co/tDi5iIES1c</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ulrich Kelber (@UlrichKelber) <a href="https://twitter.com/UlrichKelber/status/1408380956495450114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While Kelber&#8217;s own agency, the BfDi, does not appear to have a Facebook Page (although Facebook&#8217;s algorithms appear to generate this <a href="https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=105963429443828&amp;__tn__=%2As-R">artificial stub</a> if you try searching for one) plenty of other German federal bodies do &#8212; such as the Ministry of Health, whose public page has more than 760,000 followers.</p>
<p>The only alternative to such pages vanishing from Facebook&#8217;s platform by Christmas &#8212; or else being ordered to be taken down early next year by Kelber &#8212; seems to be for the tech giant to make more substantial changes to how its platform operators than it has offered so far, allowing the Pages to be run in Germany in a way that complies with EU law.</p>
<p>However Facebook has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">a long history</a> of ignoring privacy expectations and data protection laws.</p>
<p>It has also, very recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">shown itself more than willing</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/">reduce the quality of information available to users</a> &#8212; if doing so further its business interests (such as to lobby against a media code law, as users in Australia can attest).</p>
<p>So it looks rather more likely that German government agencies will be the ones having to quietly bow off the platform soon&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LhJA8ggcdH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/">Facebook applies overly broad content block in flex against Australia&#8217;s planned news reuse law</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook applies overly broad content block in flex against Australia&#8217;s planned news reuse law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/embed/#?secret=LhJA8ggcdH" data-secret="LhJA8ggcdH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kelber says he&#8217;s avoided taking action over the ministries&#8217; Facebook Pages until now on account of the public bodies arguing that their Facebook Pages are an important way for them to reach citizens.</p>
<p>However his letter points out that government bodies must be &#8220;role models&#8221; in matters of legal compliance &#8212; and therefore have &#8220;a particular duty&#8221; to comply with data protection law. (The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">EDPS is taking a similar tack by reviewing EU institutions&#8217; use of US cloud services giants</a>.)</p>
<p>Per his assessment, an &#8220;addendum&#8221; provided by Facebook in 2019 does not rectify the compliance problem and he concludes that Facebook has made no changes to its data processing operations to enable Page operators to comply with requirements set out in the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>A ruling by Europe&#8217;s top court, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/europes-top-court-takes-a-broad-view-on-privacy-responsibilities-around-platforms/">June 2018</a>, is especially relevant here &#8212; as it held that the administrator of a fan page on Facebook is jointly responsible with Facebook for the processing of the data of visitors to the page.</p>
<p>That means that the operators of such pages also face data protection compliance obligations, and cannot simply assume that Facebook&#8217;s T&amp;Cs provide them with legal cover for the data processing the tech giant undertakes.</p>
<p>The problem, in a nutshell, is that Facebook does not provide Pages operates with enough information or assurances about how it processes users&#8217; data &#8212; meaning they&#8217;re unable to comply with GDPR principles of accountability and transparency because, for example, they&#8217;re unable to adequately inform followers of their Facebook Page what is being done with their data.</p>
<p>There is also no way for Facebook Page operators to switch off (or otherwise block) wider processing of their Page followers by Facebook. Even if they don&#8217;t make use of any of the analytics features Facebook provides to Page operators.</p>
<p>The processing still happens.</p>
<p>This is because Facebook operates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">a take-it-or-leave it &#8216;data maximizing&#8217; model</a> &#8212; to feed its ad-targeting engines.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s an approach that could backfire if it ends up permanently reducing the quality of the information available on its network because there&#8217;s a mass migration of key services off its platform. Such as, for example, every government agency in the EU deleted its Facebook Page.</p>
<p>A related <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Fachthemen/Inhalte/Telefon-Internet/Datenschutzpraxis/FacebookFanpages.html">blog post on the BfDi&#8217;s website</a> also holds out the hope that &#8220;data protection-compliant social networks&#8221; might develop in the Facebook compliance vacuum.</p>
<p>Certainly there could be a competitive opportunity for alternative platforms that seek to sell services based on respecting users&#8217; rights.</p>

<p>Discussing the BfDis intervention, Luca Tosoni, a research fellow at the University of Oslo&#8217;s Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law, told TechCrunch: &#8220;This development is strictly connected to recent CJEU case law on joint controllership. In particular, it takes into account the Wirtschaftsakademie ruling, which found that the administrator of a Facebook page should be considered a joint controller with Facebook in respect of processing the personal data of the visitors of the page.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not mean that the page administrator and Facebook share equal responsibility for all stages of the data processing activities linked to the use of the Facebook page. However, they must have an agreement in place with a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities. According to the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Facebook’s current data protection &#8216;Addendum&#8217; would not seem to be sufficient to meet the latter requirement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth noting that, in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/europes-top-court-sharpens-guidance-for-sites-using-leaky-social-plug-ins/">Fashion ID ruling</a>, the CJEU has taken the view that the GDPR’s obligations for joint controllers are commensurate with those data processing stages in which they actually exercise control,&#8221; Tosoni added. &#8220;This means that the data protection obligations a Facebook page administrator would normally tend to be quite limited.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Warnings for other social media services</h2>
<p>This particular compliance issue affects Facebook in Germany &#8212; and potentially any other EU market. But o<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ther social media services may face similar problems too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For example, Kelber&#8217;s letter flags an ongoing audit of Instagram, TikTok and Clubhouse &#8212; warning of &#8220;deficits&#8221; in the level of data protection they offer too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He goes on to recommend that agencies avoid using the three apps on business devices.  </span></p>
<p>In an earlier, <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/DokumenteBfDI/AccessForAll/2021/2019_Soziale-Medien-Deutscher-Bundestag.html">2019 assessment</a> of government bodies&#8217; use of social media services, the BfDi suggested usage of Twitter could &#8212; by contrast &#8212; be compliant with data protection rules. At least if privacy settings were fully enabled and analytics disabled, for example.</p>
<p>At the time the BfDi also warned that Facebook-owned Instagram faced similar compliance problems to Facebook, being subject to the same &#8220;abusive&#8221; approach to consent he said was taken by the whole group.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on Kelber&#8217;s latest recommendations to government agencies, Facebook did not engage with our specific questions &#8212; sending us this generic statement instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the end of 2019, we updated the Page Insights addendum and clarified the responsibilities of Facebook and Page administrators, for which we took questions regarding transparency of data processing into account. It is important to us that also federal agencies can use Facebook Pages to communicate with people on our platform in a privacy-compliant manner.”</p></blockquote>
<p>An additional complication for Facebook has arisen in the wake of the legal uncertainty following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">last summer&#8217;s Schrems II ruling</a> by the CJEU.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield arrangement, which had allowed companies to self-certify an adequate level of data protection, removing the easiest route for transferring EU users&#8217; personal data over to the US. And while the court did not outlaw international transfers of EU users&#8217; personal data altogether it made it clear that data protection agencies must intervene and suspend data flows if they suspect information is being moved to a place, and in in such a way, that it&#8217;s put at risk.</p>
<p>Following Schrems II, transfers to the US are clearly problematic where the data is being processed by a US company that&#8217;s subject to FISA 702, as is the case with Facebook.</p>
<p>Indeed, Facebook&#8217;s EU-to-US data transfers were the original target of the complainant in the Schrems II case (by the eponymous Max Schrems). And a decision remains pending on whether the tech giant&#8217;s lead EU data supervisor will follow through on a preliminary order last year to it should suspend its EU data flows &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">due in the coming months</a>.</p>
<p>Even ahead of that long-anticipated reckoning in Ireland, other EU DPAs are now stepping in to take action &#8212; and Kelber&#8217;s letter references the Schrems II ruling as another issue of concern.</p>
<p>Tosoni agrees that GDPR enforcement is finally stepping up a gear. But he also suggested that compliance with the Schrems II ruling comes with plenty of nuance, given that each data flow must be assessed on a case by case basis &#8212; with a range of supplementary measures that controllers may be able to apply.</p>
<p>&#8220;This development also shows that European data protection authorities are getting serious about enforcing the GDPR data transfer requirements as interpreted by the CJEU in Schrems II, as the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom flagged this as another pain point,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the German Federal Commissioner sent out his letter on the use of Facebook pages a few days before the EDPB adopted the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">final version its recommendations on supplementary measures for international data transfers</a> following the CJEU Schrems II ruling. Therefore, it remains to be seen how German data protection authorities will take these new recommendations into account in the context of their future assessment of the GDPR compliance of the use of Facebook pages by German public authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such recommendations do not establish a blanket ban on data transfers to the US but impose the adoption of stringent safeguards, which will need to be followed to keep on transferring the data of German visitors of Facebook pages to the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe/">recent judgment by the CJEU</a> reaffirmed that EU data protection agencies can, in certain circumstances, take action when they are not the lead data supervisor for a specific company under the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism &#8212; expanding the possibility for litigation by watchdogs in Member States if a local agency believes there&#8217;s an urgent need to act.</p>
<p>Although, in the case of the German government bodies&#8217; use of Facebook Pages, the earlier CJEU ruling finding on joint law controllership means the BfDi already has clear jurisdiction to target these agencies&#8217; Facebook Pages itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Primary care company One Medical has apologized after it sent out an email that exposed hundreds of customers&#8217; email addresses.</p>
<p>The email sent out by One Medical on Wednesday asked to &#8220;verify your email,&#8221; but one email seen by TechCrunch had more than 980 email addresses copied on the email. The cause: One Medical did not use the blind carbon copy (bcc:) field to mass email its customers, which would have hidden their email addresses from each other.</p>
<p>Several customers took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaggs/status/1410390055839944704">complain</a>, but also express sympathy for what was quickly chalked up to an obvious mistake. Some users reported varying numbers of email addresses on the email that they received.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">omg <a href="https://twitter.com/onemedical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@onemedical</a> just sent this out with 981 other recipients in the to: field. let&#39;s see if i know anyone else on this thread! <a href="https://t.co/9FdSYiEalE">pic.twitter.com/9FdSYiEalE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Evan Madow (@emadow) <a href="https://twitter.com/emadow/status/1410369514223542276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>We asked One Medical how many customers had their email addresses exposed and if the company plans to report the incident to state governments, as may be required under state data breach notification laws, but we did not immediately hear back.</p>
<p>In a brief statement <a href="https://twitter.com/onemedical/status/1410399594513567747">posted to Twitter</a>, One Medical acknowledged the mistake, said: &#8220;We are aware emails were sent to some of our members that exposed recipient email addresses. We apologize if this has caused you concern, but please rest assured that we have investigated the root cause of this incident and confirmed that this was not caused by a security breach of our systems. We will take all appropriate actions to prevent this from happening again.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the scale of security lapses, this one is fairly low down on the impact scale — compared to a breach of passwords, or financial and health data. But the exposure of email addresses can still be used to identify customers of the company.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based One Medical, backed by Google&#8217;s parent company Alphabet, went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/alphabet-backed-primary-care-startup-one-medical-files-to-go-public/">public last year</a> just prior to the start of the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting today, Pinterest will prohibit all advertisers from sharing ads that promote weight loss. This includes any language and imagery that encourages weight loss, promotes weight loss products, idealizes certain body types, or references the BMI (which is often <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/the-bizarre-and-racist-history-of-the-bmi-7d8dc2aa33bb">a poor indicator of overall health</a>). This makes Pinterest the first major social media platform to take this stance.</p>
<p>Social media has played a role in promoting harmful beauty standards for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/over-a-year-after-new-content-policies-self-harm-social-media-still-thrives/">as long as it&#8217;s existed</a>. But even as &#8220;body positivity&#8221; has eclipsed the &#8220;thinspo&#8221; that proliferated on Tumblr a decade ago, sometimes, the trend can be a thin veil for weight stigma. Take a company like Weight Watchers, for example, which <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/03/weight-watchers-name-change-ww-dieting-culture.html">re-branded</a> to WW (&#8220;Wellness That Works&#8221;) in 2018, yet continues to boast its members&#8217; weight loss stories on its website. Even when online content about weight loss is well-meaning, it often contributes to a rise in disordered eating behavior rather than healthy habits, which is why <a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1256525/the-wellness-industry-thrives-on-the-fear-of-death/">the wellness industry can be so harmful</a>.</p>
<p>Pinterest developed its updated ad policy with guidance from the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/">National Eating Disorders Association</a> (NEDA), which has also worked with platforms like Tumblr and Facebook in the past. Since March 2020, the onset of the pandemic in the US, NEDA has experienced an increase in activity on its helplines for people struggling with eating disorders. As Vox&#8217;s Rebecca Jennings <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22226997/body-positivity-instagram-tiktok-fatphobia-social-media">pointed out</a>, people started spending even more time online during lockdown, which means more exposure to content that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/limiting-social-media-use-reduced-loneliness-and-depression-in-new-experiment/">makes us feel bad</a> about ourselves. Even the TikTok-famous sixteen-year-old actress Sissy Sheridan <a href="https://twitter.com/sissysheridan/status/1261075790168576000">tweeted</a>, &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">i liked my body before i downloaded tik tok.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2172399" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172399" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172399" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pinterest-bodyneutrality.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172399" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">Pinterest&#8217;s new policy can make a tangible difference, especially if it sets a precedent for other major platforms to follow suit. Social media platforms have a responsibility to minimize the harmful activity that happens on their apps, but how far can the impact of these new policies extend? Pinterest reported that searches for &#8220;body neutrality&#8221; are up 5x since last year, offering an alternative to the &#8220;body positivity&#8221; movement, which is often just diet culture in a trench coat. But especially on algorithm-driven apps like TikTok, we can&#8217;t always control the content that comes up on your For You page. If you like to cook, TikTok will show you cooking videos, but the AI isn&#8217;t smart enough to filter out cooking accounts with &#8220;weight loss&#8221; in their bios if you don&#8217;t engage with that content. Pinterest recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">its own TikTok competitor</a>, and of course, Instagram is trying to capture the success of TikTok through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/new-instagram-insights-make-its-tiktok-competitor-reels-more-appealing/">Reels</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">Pinterest&#8217;s ad policy update is a good start, and one that can only have a positive impact if other platforms follow its lead. But social media reflects our culture back to us, and until there&#8217;s a broader cultural shift to understand that &#8220;weight loss&#8221; and &#8220;wellness&#8221; aren&#8217;t synonymous, an ad policy can only go so far.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.codat.io/">Codat</a>, a startup that provides APIs to link small-business fintech data to external services, announced that it has closed a $40 million round led by Tiger Global. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/codat-raises-10-million-to-aggregate-all-financial-data-from-small-businesses/">raised $10 million in a Series A around a year ago</a> that Index led; Codat also raised some strategic capital in the interim, but declined in an interview to provide more detail.</p>
<p>The company also declined to provide any guidance regarding how much its valuation changed in the last year between lettered rounds.</p>
<p>That Codat managed to raise more money is not a surprise, as the startup told TechCrunch that it grew its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 3x from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. The company&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterdeveloper/">Pete Lord</a> disclosed that the company is on track to repeat the feat this year. Such growth would imply a 9x gain in revenue at the end of 2021 compared to the result from two years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things are going well at Codat, in other words.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s API connects corporate data from internal SMB systems &#8212; QuickBooks, iZettle etc. &#8212; to external providers. The use cases for the service are easy to understand. If a small business wants to apply for a loan, the ability to provide a potential lender with its financial data in a quick, digital fashion would be useful. Codat would happily facilitate that data linkage.</p>
<p>The startup sells to financial service players, unsurprisingly, and vertical SaaS companies; serving the vertical SaaS space is big business, given that this is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/2171608/">second piece of news</a> targeting the software varietal that TechCrunch has seen this week.</p>
<p>Building the Plaid for SMB data is a big job, so it&#8217;s not surprising that Codat has been busy hiring. From around 50 employees at the time of its Series A, the startup is now quickly approaching the 150-employee mark. Lord said that the company is hoping to end the year with around 250 staff.</p>

<p>The startup has an interesting array of products that are not its API service. Codat offers a visualization tool, for example, to display single-company data for customers in a more digestible format. And, the startup that it released a service called &#8220;Insights&#8221; that provides a method of cross-referencing ingested data from different services. Per Lord, Codat is bundling its other pieces of software with its API today. Asked why the startup isn&#8217;t charging separately for the tools, the CEO said that Codat is more focused on maximizing usage of its core service.</p>
<p>This leaves us with two questions regarding the future of Codat. The first is when &#8212; perhaps <em>if</em> &#8212; the startup charges for its non-core services that make its API tool more useful. And the second deals with the size of companies&#8217; data that it hopes to provide the connective tissue for. Today Codat focuses on SMBs, though it is creeping higher in terms of the size of companies that might to pass their data through its API to other groups.</p>
<p>The two questions are linked. Codat wants to maximize its API usage because it charges customers based on the number of companies that they are connecting to; there are many more SMBs than large companies, so going after that slice of the larger corporate landscape makes sense. As does offering value-add services on top of its API if it keeps its SMB-focus.</p>
<p>But as Codat builds out its service, data from larger companies may more land inside its remit. And if they do, the company&#8217;s current model would prove slightly dissonant. A different pricing scheme for connecting to larger companies might work. Or a focus on charging for <em>data passed</em>, and not <em>companies connected</em> more generally. It will be interesting to watch the company&#8217;s business model evolve over time.</p>
<p>Regardless, the company is busy hiring in San Francisco, New York, and London. Let&#8217;s see how far its new Tiger check can take it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karin Tsai joined Duolingo in 2012 and is now the director of engineering. Yesterday, at TechCrunch’s City Spotlight: Pittsburgh, she spoke on the company’s extensive development process and unique culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This interview was pre-recorded and aired a day after the company filed its SEC Form S-1 ahead of its initial public offering. As per SEC regulations, the company is now in a quiet period and it’s fair to say that Tsai gave the company’s last interview for quite a while.</p>
<p>This interview is the latest in TechCrunch’s deep dive into Pittsburgh’s Duolingo. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">we published a four-part series on the company</a> that includes Duolingo’s origin story, it’s product-led growth strategy, monetization plan, and how develops and implements new initiatives and features.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="60dcd23f4659554a276adba5" post-id="2172376"></div> </p>
<h2>And it all starts with an A/B test</h2>
<p>Tsai works with the some 170 engineers at Duolingo, which make up the vast majority of the company. That composition has led to A/B testing turning into a key part of Duolingo&#8217;s strategy, as it works to create an app that has effective yet inclusive gamification. At any given time, there might be 100 different A/B tests running, which caused Duolingo&#8217;s analytics team to even build a dashboard to track impact of experiments. Tsai walked us through an early realization of the common test below:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">[A/B testing] has been such a key lever in our success as a company. I think one of the things that was important for us was to keep an open mind to tests that fail. So I think one of the temptations we have is to come with a preconceived notion of what should win when we run the test. If it doesn&#8217;t win, we just assume [that] there was some bug or some error, and not really pause to think </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">why</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> did that experiment lose. So, I would recommend for any startups looking to really integrate A/B testing into the fabric of their decision making: keep an open mind on what you might be missing about what your users are telling you through the data. Also, always be open to improving what you actually measure. At the beginning, we just kind of flatly measured learner retention [and] how many daily active users we had. But after a while, we decided to be a little more fine-grained about what we measured. So we measure new user retention versus existing user retention to sort of see the difference between how our new users are perceiving Duolingo, etc. And over time, you add more and more of these metrics, you could get a fuller picture of what what your changes actually doing. </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong>(Timestamp: 2:53)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">One quirk that came up during the Duolingo EC-1</a> is that Duolingo&#8217;s product team usually A/B tests new features in the French course for English speakers. It&#8217;s not because of any secret preferences, but because the course is so popular that it makes more statistical sense to test it out in this course before rolling it out to other languages. In contrast, if a team tested a feature in the Hindi course for English speakers, it would take a longer time to get useful results.</p>
<p>An A/B experiment that stands out in Tsai&#8217;s mind has to do with the subscription page, and saying no to increasing the bottom line.</p>
<blockquote><p>On our subscription page, we offer a free trial of the subscription. Before, the button used to say &#8216;start your seven day free trial.&#8217; We changed it to &#8216;start using Duolingo for free for a week&#8217; just to play around with copy. And we didn&#8217;t really expect too much from that, we just wanted to shorten the text.</p>
<p>It turns out that this ended up making us a lot more revenue per day. However, learner retention took a hit, and especially new user retention. Our hypothesis was that actually changing from &#8216;start my free trial&#8217; to &#8216;start my free week&#8217; made people think that they had to pay to use Duolingo. So, a lot more people actually subscribed because they thought they needed to pay. But we lost some learners, because they thought the experience was just overall not free. So we actually reverted that change, even though it made us some money. We learned a lot about how precise copy really needs to be to convey meaning. So, it was a really great learning to find that actually being more transparent with how you monetize, actually led to more modern successful monetization. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:47)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>On prioritizing monetization</h2>
<p>Duolingo notoriously launched with a bold promise: no advertisements, subscriptions or in-app purchases — approaches that now all exist on the platform. While the company appears to be doing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/?tpcc=ECTW2020">just fine financially now</a>, the choice to start charging was not easy, and felt directly in conflict with Duolingo&#8217;s mission to provide free education.</p>
<p>Tsai, who watched the company grow from 15 people to 400 plus, explained how she personally felt the company resolved that tension and ultimately made the move to charge some of its users, about 5%, money.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the way that we approach this is maybe idealistic. I can just speak for myself: oftentimes, it&#8217;s tempting for companies to either turn evil or feel like they&#8217;re turning evil once they start to monetize, right? But the reality is, hosting costs, salaries, etc, do cost a lot of money. If you want to continue hiring top talent, you need to make revenue and be able to support that. And the way that we approach it at Duolingo is that we know we can&#8217;t actually accomplish our mission without also being a sustainable company. If Duolingo continued being on VC funding the whole time, we would not be sustainable in the long term. If we do buy in so much, and love our products so much that we do want it to last hundreds of years. And to do that, we need to make sure we&#8217;re monetizing in a sustainable way. So I think that the way that we resolve tension in the company is that no matter what area you are working in, everyone has a common purpose to that end.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of benefit of the doubt that you kind of get for free by having a strong culture. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 8:21)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>How debate can live harmoniously within a startup</h2>
<p>The strong culture that Tsai is talking about was re-invented during the pandemic, when Duolingo along with many tech companies turned to distributed work.I wondered if remote work can make debate and disagreement, on something as small as an A/B test or as big as a monetization opportunity, difficult. Tsai mentioned a weekly e-mail from co-founder Luis von Ahn that made all the difference, as well as some transparency on failure.</p>
<blockquote><p>Luis our CEO sent started sending us a weekly company update every Monday morning. One of the first updates he gave was just a reminder to have empathy for your fellow what we call Duo&#8217;s, or fellow Duolingo employees. He sent those reminders often. I think this culture of empathy and constant reminders says that in a remote world, it&#8217;s harder to read social cues, body cues and it&#8217;s easier to bring more to work than maybe you normally would. I think during those times where there was maybe debate, we always were just reminded to have empathy, to realize that there&#8217;s a lot going on in everyone&#8217;s lives at the moment, and that what is being communicated may not be the entire picture of what someone&#8217;s going through. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 11:45)</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another aspect that actually helps a lot is that we send out every single experiment result that gets launched or killed. So the entire company continues to know how we make decisions and which way they go. So by the time someone&#8217;s running their own experiments and making these decisions, they would have seen hundreds of examples of calls we made in the past. And we tend to emphasize the more controversial ones as well, so that the entire company could be in line with how we make decisions. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:11)</strong></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>We ended up a conversation about opinions. From the jump, Duolingo has been an opinionated company &#8211; from where its based to how much it raised to how it wants to monetize (and differentiate from competitors). But that is easier said than done, especially in a polarized world.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s important to be strong about what you believe in. I think it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing to be opinionated, but I think it is important to also be open minded that not everyone will agree to be respectful of those positions. As a company, [your opinions] really needs to be [clear] from the beginning because it is always harder to add on. Suddenly, sudden opinions are in contrast with what a company has demonstrated through its actions. So I think avoiding hypocrisy is the most important thing when you do have strong opinions, and Duolingo has strong opinions about many things. I think [our opinions] are all consistent with how the company has operated from the beginning. And that has really helped us. And we tend to attract talent that believes in those missions. We&#8217;ve encoded those operating principles and actually written them down. And it is okay and reasonable for someone to disagree with this approach, but this is at least how we&#8217;ve decided to do it at Duolingo. And that makes it clear to people that we&#8217;ve intentionally made the decisions to go one way or the other on these things. So that has really helped, I think, unify everyone and understanding how that company operates.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 19:46)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also comes after an impressive first half of the year for the company. Between January and May 2021, Mercado Bitcoin says that about 700,000 new customers signed up to use its services, bringing its customer base to 2.8 million. That’s more than more than </span><a href="http://www.b3.com.br/pt_br/market-data-e-indices/servicos-de-dados/market-data/consultas/mercado-a-vista/perfil-pessoas-fisicas/faixa-etaria/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of the entire individual investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> base on Brazil’s stock exchange, according to the company. Also, during the first five months of the year, Mercado Bitcoin saw its trade volume surge to $5 billion, which is more than the total volume it saw in its first seven years combined. It’s also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 times the volume experienced during the same period in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by brothers Gustavo and Mauricio Chamati in 2013, Mercado Bitcoin was the first crypto exchange in Brazil. The company has been profitable since 2018, and until January 2021 had been bootstrapped from inception, reinvesting its cash generation into growth and portfolio expansion, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and 2TM Group Executive Chairman Roberto Dagnoni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This makes us a somewhat unique case in the ecosystem and among our fintech peers in general &#8211; few companies have managed to reconcile over 100% year-over-year growth with a positive bottom line,” he told TechCrunch, describing Mercado Bitcoin as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the crown j</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ewel” of 2TM Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holding company owns a number of other entities such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meubank, a multi-asset wallet and account service currently waiting for a Brazilian Central Bank license; Bitrust, a qualified digital custodian and Clearbook, an equity crowdfunding platform, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, 2TM Group became the first company in the world to tokenize public debt assets. Then in 2020, the company issued Futecoin, the world’s first digital asset based on FIFA&#8217;s solidarity mechanism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have also tokenized or distributed private debt, carbon credits and a variety of utility and DeFi tokens,” Dagnoni said. This year, Bitrust will extend the first Latin America based Digital Custody service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a lot more to come, and the series B round will be a relevant factor in supporting continuous innovation,” Dagnoni added. While he declined to reveal the amount of the Mercado Bitcoin’s Series A round, he said it allowed the company to invest around $40 million in expanding its operations in Brazil this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Mercado Bitcoin has about 500 employees. That compared to around 200 a year ago. By year’s end, Dagnoni projects it will have a headcount of about 700.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides hiring, he said that Mercado Bitcoin/2TM will also use the new capital toward expanding its service offerings and investing in infrastructure “to meet the soaring demand for crypto in the region.” In particular, the company will be focusing on acquiring new customers and product listings as well as expanding to other countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Chile “through a combination of M&amp;A and greenfield operations,” according to Dagnoni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly has driven so much growth for Mercado Bitcoin? Dagnoni believes there are a number of factors behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people around the world are realizing that digital assets and cryptocurrencies are both innovative in their technological foundations and are efficient in storing of value, and Brazil is no exception to this trend,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the country has seen some of the lowest interest rates on record, which he said has fueled the development of the alternative assets industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crypto is taking advantage of this trend, which is also on display for other asset classes, such as VC and private equity,” Dagnoni said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he believes that the fact that Brazil’s financial services industry is so concentrated has spelled opportunity for fintechs in general in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paulo Passoni, managing partner at SoftBank’s SBLA Advisers Corp<b>.</b> (which manages the SoftBank Latin America Fund) described Mercado Bitcoin as a “regional leader in the crypto space” that is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapping into a huge local and regional addressable market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added: “At SoftBank we look to invest in entrepreneurs who are challenging the status quo through tech-focused or tech-enabled business models that are disrupting an industry – Mercado Bitcoin is doing just that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>SoftBank has been active in Latin America as of late. In early June, the Japanese investment conglomerate said it would invest &#8220;up to $150 million&#8221; in Grupo Bursátil Mexicano (GBM), a 35-year-old investment platform in the Mexican stock market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to back Indian embedded finance startup Yap, according to more than half a dozen people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The New York-headquartered firm is in talks to lead a $35 million financing round in Yap &#8212; also known as YapPay and M2P &#8212; that values the Bangalore-headquartered startup at about $350 million, up from about $67 million in March this year (per data insight platform Tracxn), the people said.</p>
<p>At the current stages of negotiation, Tiger Global plans to invest between $25 million to $30 million in the new round (a Series C), some of the people said. The round hasn&#8217;t closed, so the deal size could become larger and other terms too may change, people said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yap operates an API infrastructure platform that allows other startups to support and build payments services. Yap, which has raised about $15.9 million to date, counts Better Capital, BeeNext, AngelList, Omidyar Network, 8i among its existing investors.</p>
<p>If the deal materializes, it will be the latest investment from Tiger Global in India, where it has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">backed over a dozen startups this year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a>, the startup based out of Turkey that has built a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.5 billion business</a> out a mobile app that lets consumers buy groceries and get them delivered in minutes, has grown its business up to now organically: targeting urban markets across Europe (and soon the U.S.) where it is disrupting the well-stocked cornershop with a service that needs even less effort and time from the average shopper. Now, it&#8217;s changing up that strategy with its first acquisition to break into three more countries.</p>
<p>The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.theblok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blok</a>, another &#8220;instant delivery&#8221; grocery service based out of Barcelona. Financial of the deal are not being disclosed but from what I understand, Blok (previously called Huvi Technologies) was bootstrapped, fairly new and small (launching only in February 2021), and was already shopping itself around.</p>
<p>Founded by Vishal Verma, Hunab Moreno and Varun Kapoor, Blok is active in Spain and Italy, where its biggest markets were Madrid, Barcelona and Milan. Portugal was on its roadmap pre-Getir, and it will also launch there soon. More than 120 employees will be joining Getir as part of the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getir has been around since 2015 and is profitable in Turkey on a mix of services that started with its fast delivery but has since expanded to other categories like wider grocery options (GetirMore, with longer delivery turnarounds), restaurant delivery (GetirFood), local business delivery (GetirLocals), and&#8230; water delivery (GetirWater).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s given Getir momentum it is now using to expand its flagship fast grocery model into other markets like the UK &#8212; I see its mopeds around my neighborhood in London <em>all</em> the time &#8212; the Netherlands, and Paris and Berlin. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions that it&#8217;s raised this year</a> (Getir has raised about $1 billion in total now) will also be used to get the company into the U.S. market, where it will go head to head with homegrown rivals in the same space such as GoPuff.</p>
<p>But while it may be one of the earliest movers and possibly the best capitalised, Getir is by no means the only player of its kind.</p>
<p>The European market is positively flush right now with startups that are building services around the same basic principles of super-fast delivery across an assortment of around 1,500 goods &#8212; typically much smaller than what you might find in a grocery store (17,000 is a normal number there), and closer to what you might get in the kind of quick-stop small market that exists throughout urban centers in Europe.</p>
<p>These startups, which include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapp</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cajoo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weezy</a> and many others have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars &#8212; but still less than $2 billion, Getir CEO and co-founder Nazim Salur estimated to me &#8212; to scale their operations.</p>
<p>Take up has been fairly enthusiastic, in part fueled by the pandemic and the fact that many people have been living under stay-at-home orders, or simply keen to stay out of public places to minimize Covid-19 spread; but also fueled in part by getting good traction with millennial and other younger consumers, who have really taken to using their mobiles for all practical chores, which get turned into leisure activities when they become apps.</p>
<p class="p1">Before Covid, Getir was seeing threefold growth annually, with some years, such as 2017, the company growing fivefold, Salur said. &#8220;During Covid we also grew 5x but without it, it would have been 4x. It accelerated our growth but Covid is not the main reason people use us. It&#8217;s mainly because we&#8217;re a big convenience. It means we can grow. In Turkey, life&#8217;s back to normal but every month we still grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, is it a big enough market for all these players? We&#8217;ve already heard of at least one that is struggling to raise more to compete &#8212; capital is key, given the balance of logistics and delivery, dark stores to stock items, having the items themselves to sell, not to mention the heavy competition &#8212; and is looking for a buyer as a result.</p>
<p>In that context, it might not be a surprise to hear that Blok hadn&#8217;t raised any notable funding itself and while it had built out some technology and a team of people, it was ready to sell up less than six months after launching.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are very excited to join hands with the pioneers of ultrafast delivery on our shared goal to lead the on-demand grocery market in Southern Europe,&#8221; said Verma from Block, in a statement. &#8220;This acquisition allows us to leverage Getir’s deep industry know-how, relationships and technology, while combining that with our world class team and execution capabilities to create a formidable leader in this part of the world. We’ve had a great response from all our launches in Spain and Italy and can&#8217;t wait to double down on our efforts alongside Getir.&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite this pretty obvious picture of consolidation-in-the-making, Getir isn&#8217;t going to get into the business of consolidating all that, though &#8212; well, not yet, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getir will not become an acquisition company, acquiring one after the other. That&#8217;s not the way we operate,&#8221; Salur, who co-founded the company with Serkan Borancili and Tuncay Tutek, said in an interview. &#8220;But, it’s a free market and if there is a good reason, a solid good reason, we might consider it. We won’t be going after ten different companies in this world, but if the right opportunity shows itself we’ll talk to people.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies scrambled to re-orient themselves last year during the pandemic, one thing was clear: the shift to remote working had come sooner than anyone expected. With this came a fundamental shift in how businesses would have to hire new talent. And the question was, were managers going to laboriously sift through CVs in a crisis situation, or would the need to hit the ground running fast force them towards assessing skills over CVs?</p>
<p>One startup decided to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>HR tech startup from The Netherland, <a href="https://www.testgorilla.com/">TestGorilla</a>, came up with a way of hiring people through short, skills-based tests, which had the added advantage of removing the unconscious bias brought about by snappy CVs which might help a very non-skilled person get ahead, and keep out skilled but less qualified recruits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup says its bet paid off and 9 months later they claim to have garnered over 1,500 corporate clients, including the NHS, Sony, PepsiCo, and Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>TestGorilla has now raised $10 million in a Seed funding round, led by SaaS-specialist VC, Notion Capital, Partech, Jeff Weiner´s Next Play Ventures, and Indeed co-founder Paul Forster, Peakon co-founder Phil Chambers, and Justworks co-founder Isaac Oates.</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands that the round was hotly contested, with the round closing in only two weeks after receiving multiple separate offers.</p>
<p>Launched by serial entrepreneur, Wouter Durville, and former Bain &amp; Company Partner, Otto Verhage, TestGorilla remotely assesses cognitive abilities, soft skills, specific job skills, culture fit, motivation, and language proficiency. By replacing CV screening, it also aids the removal of unconscious biases in the hiring process.</p>
<p>Wouter Durville, Co-Founder of TestGorilla told me over a call: “We’re removing bias because we&#8217;re making hiring very data-driven. Instead of just looking at a CV and looking at the big brands mentioned or the picture version of the person or how connected you are to a person, we are saying, hey, use these tests and test for different things that predict job success like cognitive ability or personality to fit with your culture. Then based on all the data you can automatically sort to see all your candidates, from the best to the worst, then make a decision on who you will invite into your recruiting process.”</p>
<p>Jos White, General Partner at Notion Capital said: &#8220;This is a big deal! A super competitive round that almost every VC wanted to get into. They are literally upending the hiring process with a platform that is more democratic, more global and ultimately a much better predictor of job success. Companies are in a major war for talent and yet only armed with a penknife. TestGorilla can open up new talent pools, break down barriers and help candidates and companies find each other. We are leading the round but the angel investors are literally a who&#8217;s who of HRtech because they know that this company is the future of hiring and addresses so many of the challenges that companies are facing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Icon group is a new $30M VC fund being launched out of Germany&#8217;s iconmobile group, a WPP network agency. This means a reorganization of the company from a full-service innovation agency into also offering VC backing.</p>
<p>iconmobile has garnered a reputation as an innovative technology, design, and sustainability agency, but the turnaround means it will now, instead, back tech startups that enable traditional companies to &#8220;reinvent their business models and the way they reach their consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The icon ventures VC fund will be accompanied by new company arm: &#8216;icon impact&#8217;, the continuation of iconmobile’s well-established product and experience innovation arm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Previous iconmobile properties now fall under the icon ventures umbrella include:</p>
<p>• D[AI]TA, a white label sustainable laundry system that filters microplastic fibers via smart washing machines, reduces chemical contaminants, and uses &#8216;smart grid’ washing to save energy. It also tracks what items have been washed, and worn, and sends that data to retailers.</p>
<p>• banbutsu, that does sustainable last-mile fulfillment</p>
<p>• icon incar  a mobility experience company</p>
<p>Thomas Fellger, Founder of icon group said: “Whether it’s creating the first connected toothbrush for Oral-B or UX/UI design for the world&#8217;s leading automotive brands, icon group works to bring innovation from idea to scale…. Now, with the inclusion of a venture fund, we can create the things we believe in without waiting for permission or additional budget allocations by investing in opportunities where we have deep knowledge and proven impact, something that sets us apart from the big five firms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call he added: “We are more capable than most companies to convert our knowledge of R&amp;D into a fast business opportunity. For example, we found an infrared sensor, which can be used to measure air quality in Egypt. Because we knew we needed that kind of quality of air data, we were able to create a whole new product. And that&#8217;s what we will be good at &#8211; connecting the dots of different products services across industries to create for that industry, a new way of looking at their business by changing the business model, or even extending the services which they couldn&#8217;t do before.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Instant&#8221; grocery delivery has been a big theme among food startups in Europe, where customers can order from a limited assortment of items and get their purchases packed from &#8220;dark stores&#8221; and delivered in sometimes as little as 10 or 15 minutes. But today a startup that&#8217;s built a much bigger proposition &#8212; a virtual supermarket of 17,000+ items that it delivers in as little as two hours &#8212; is announcing some funding as it expands in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://rohlik.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a>, a Czech startup that has built an online grocery ordering and delivery business selling grocery fare — which it procures itself wholesale, or in partnership with established businesses, combining that with items sourced from local small businesses &#8212; has picked up €100 million ($119 million at today’s rates). This Series C investment values Rohlik at €1 billion ($1.2 billion).</p>
<p>The round is being led by Index Ventures, which was also part of Rohlik&#8217;s $230 million Series B that it raised only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three months ago</a>. Previous backers including Partech and Quadrille Capital also participated in this latest round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason for the rapid fundraise is to strike while the iron is hot and put the gas on expansion, said Tomáš Čupr, Rohlik&#8217;s founder and CEO.</p>
<p>The Czech startup has already expanded to Hungary and Austria and is planning its first launch in Germany, in Munich, in the coming months. With this extra funding boost, he said that Romania, Italy, France and Spain now on the list as well.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;They were all in the first plan we wanted to present to investors, but we felt we were unproven coming from Eastern Europe,&#8221; Čupr said in an interview. &#8220;Now we feel like we can unleash what we saw before, which is that with the high penetration of mobile shopping, we have a chance to disrupt groceries in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a giant impact on how we eat &#8212; and one aspect of that has been that many more people started to buy food &#8212; ready-made, groceries, and everything in between &#8212; online and get it delivered to their homes rather than picking it and paying in person. As established online and offline services buckled under the weight of customer demand, that represented a big opportunity for tech companies building more efficient models to get people the same goods (and sometimes even a more interesting selection, or a more convenient service) to fill the gap.</p>
<p>Rohlik was actually around and growing steadily for six years in its home market of the Czech Republic before raising money &#8212; and it&#8217;s actually already profitable there &#8212; but its star really started to rise with that bigger shift in consumer demand.</p>
<p>Rohlik&#8217;s revenues in 2020 passed €300 million, with over 750,000 customers; it&#8217;s not yet disclosing any figures for 2021 that would speak to how well its expansion is going, but the funding seems to point to traction. Currently, the average shop is in the range of €60 to €100 per order, with customers typically shopping about once per week, Čupr said.</p>
<p class="p1">While Rohlik&#8217;s name may change with each new market &#8212; in Hungary it&#8217;s <a href="http://kifli.hu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">Kifli.hu</span></a>, in Austria its <a href="http://gurkerl.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">Gurkerl.at</span></a>, and in Germany it will be called <a href="http://knuspr.de/"><span class="s3">Knuspr.de</span></a> &#8212; what is staying consistent is the company&#8217;s basic formula, a mix of its own-purchased-in wholesale items, goods from partners like Marks &amp; Spencer, and products sourced from smaller and local businesses, a mix that might be rebalanced or personalized depending on market demand, and potentially pushed out for some interesting economies of scale using Rohlik&#8217;s logistics operations to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">This is an interesting point. As someone who has lived both in countries like the U.S. where small food businesses like fishmongers are essentially nonexistent, except for in the biggest of metropolises; and in places in Europe, where it&#8217;s not uncommon for even the smallest villages to have independent, well-used shops for basics, this is where Rohlik stands out for me, as a rare example of a tech company that is trying to bring more growth to those small businesses rather than providing a service that eventually puts them out of business.</p>
<p class="p1">Čupr described a &#8220;failing in the online grocery business in the last few years,&#8221; where the offerings were essentially just what you got in a basic large supermarket. Rohlik is changing that up by incorporating local enterprises. His example: an independent pasta-making shop in Italy might now be able to, for the first, time, also sell its ravioli and pappardelle to a buyer in Austria or Hungary through Rohlik.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has absolutely been the playbook. You will see the same pattern with our assortment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Local butchers, bakers, fishmongers and pharmacies, but also M&amp;S clothes, kitchenware. It&#8217;s basically our &#8216;near food&#8217; approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a journey to a cornershop that we are trying to cut out,&#8221; he continued, in reference to the profusion of fast-delivery startups that have all hit the market. Instead, he referred to another major European shopping practice of saving it all for the weekend. &#8220;We want to save your Saturday in a few clicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And given that there are still countries, like France, where online groceries have been quite slow to take off, that speaks of a lot of growth potential. All of this likely resonates strongly with European investors who would likely know those routines as part of their own cultures.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of three things that got validated here,&#8221; said Jan Hammer, a partner at Index who led this deal. &#8220;First, it&#8217;s the incredible market opportunity, and we’re only scratching the surface. Then, it&#8217;s Rohlik&#8217;s formula and business model, a unique combination, and customers love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether consumer habits are shifted for good will be something to watch, as will how others in the market respond, particularly more localized players that have carved out their own leadership over years, and in cases where they may have brick-and-mortar as well, generations. That loyalty to traditional businesses is ultimately what Rohlik champions, but also what might most challenge it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kevin Novak joined Uber as its 21st employee its seventh engineer in 2011, and by 2014, he was the company&#8217;s head of data science. He talks proudly of that time, but like all good things, it ran its course and by the end of 2017, having accomplished what he wanted at the company, he left.</p>
<p>At first, he picked up the pace of his angel investing, work he&#8217;d already begun focusing on during weekends and evenings, ultimately building a portfolio of more than 50 startups (including the fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/pipe-which-aims-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue-raises-more-money-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe</a> and the autonomous checkout company <a href="https://standard.ai/blog/standard-raises-150-m-in-its-series-c-becomes-worlds-first-autonomous-checkout-unicorn/">Standard Cognition</a>).</p>
<p>He also began advising both startups and venture firms &#8212; including Playground Global, Costanoa Ventures, Renegade Partners and Data Collective &#8212; and after falling in love with the work, Novak this year decided to launch his own venture outfit in Menlo Park, Ca., called <a href="https://rackhouse.vc/">Rackhouse Venture Capital</a>. Indeed, Rackhouse just closed its debut fund with $15 million, anchored by Uber&#8217;s first head of engineering, Curtis Chambers; Steve Gilula, a former chairman of Searchlight Pictures, and the fund of funds Cendana Capital. A lot of the VCs Novak knows are also investors in the fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We caught up with Novak late last week to chat out that new vehicle. We also talked about this tenure at Uber, where, be warned, he played a major role in creating surge pricing (though he prefers the term &#8220;dynamic pricing.&#8221;) You can <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/former-uber-data-science-head-kevin-novak-on-his-leap-into-vc/id1498270180?i=1000526925113">hear</a> that fuller discussion or check out excerpts from it, edited lightly for length and clarity, below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were planning to become a nuclear physicist. How did you wind up at Uber?</strong></p>
<p>KN: As an undergrad, I was studying physics, math and computer science, and when I got to grad school, I really wanted to teach. But I also really liked programming and applying physics concepts in the programming space, and the nuke department had the largest allocation of supercomputer time, so that ended up driving a lot of my research  &#8212; just the opportunity to play on computers while doing physics. So [I] was studying to become a nuclear physicist was funded very indirectly through the research that eventually became the Higgs boson. As the Higgs got discovered, it was very good for humanity and absolutely horrible for my research budget . . .</p>
<p>A friend of mine heard what I was doing and sort of knew my skill set and said, like, &#8216;Hey, you should come check out this Uber cab company that it&#8217;s like a limo company with an app. There&#8217;s a very interesting data problem and a very interesting math problem.&#8217; So I ended up applying [though I committed] the cardinal sin of startup applications and wore a suit and tie to my interview.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re from Michigan. I also grew up in the Midwest so appreciate why you might think that people would wear a suit to an interview.</strong></p>
<p>KN: I got off the elevator and the friend who&#8217;d encouraged me to apply was like, &#8216;What are you wearing?!&#8217; But I got asked to join nonetheless as a computational algorithms engineer &#8212; a title that predated the data science trend &#8212; and I spent the next couple of years living in the engineering and product world, building data features and . . .things like our ETA engine, basically predicting how long it would take an Uber to get to you. One of my very first projects was working on tolls and tunnels because figuring out which tunnel an Uber went through and how to build time and distance was a common failure point. So I spent, like, three days driving the Big Dig in Boston out to Somerville and back to Logan with a bunch of phones, collecting GPS data.</p>
<p>I got to know a lot of very random facts about Uber cities, but my big claim to fame was dynamic pricing. . . and it turned out to be a really successful cornerstone for the strategy of making sure Ubers were available.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does that go over, when you tell people that you invented surge pricing?</strong></p>
<p>KN: It&#8217;s a very quick litmus test to figure out like people&#8217;s underlying enthusiasm for behavioral econ and finance. The Wall Street crowd is like, &#8216;Oh my god, that&#8217;s so cool.&#8217; And then a lot of people are like, &#8216;Oh, <em>thank</em> you, yeah, thank you so much, wonderful, you buy the next round of drinks&#8217; type of thing. . . [Laughs.]</p>
<p>But data also became the incubation space for a lot of the early special projects like Uber pool and a lot of the ideas around, okay, how would you build a dispatching model that enables different people with pooled ride requests? How do you batch them together efficiently in space and time so that we can get the right match rate that [so this] project is profitable? We did a lot of work on the theory behind the hub-and-spoke Uber Eats delivery models and thinking through how we apply our learnings about ride-share to food. So I got the first person perspective on a lot of these products when it was literally three people scribbling on a notepad or riffing on a laptop over lunch, [and which] eventually went on to become these big, nationwide businesses.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were working on Uber Freight for the last nine months of your career with Uber, so there when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/23/anthony-levandowski-google-uber-self-driving-cars-lawsuit">this business</a> with Anthony Levandowski was blowing up.</strong></p>
<p>KN: Yeah, it was it was very interesting era for me because more than six years in, [I was already developing the] attitude of &#8216;I&#8217;ve done everything I wanted to do.&#8217; I joined a 20-person company and, at the time, we were closing in on 20,000 people . . .and I kind of missed the small team dynamic and felt like I was hitting a natural stopping point. And then Uber&#8217;s 2017 happened and and there was Anthony, there was Susan Fowler, and Travis has this horrific <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/5/27/15705290/bonnie-kalanick-mother-uber-ceo-dies-boating-accident">accident</a> in his personal life and his head was clearly not in the game. But I didn&#8217;t want to be the guy who was known for bailing in the worst quarter of the company&#8217;s history, so I ended up spending the next year basically keeping the band together and trying to figure out what I could do to keep whatever small part of the company I was running intact and motivated and empathetic and good in every sense of the word.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You left at the end of that year and it seems you&#8217;ve been very busy since, including, now, launching this new fund with the backing of outsiders. Why call it Rackhouse? You used the brand Jigsaw Venture Capital when you were investing your own money.</strong></p>
<p>KN: Yeah. A year [into angel investing], I had formed an LLC, I was &#8220;marking&#8221; my portfolio to market, sending quarterly updates to myself and my accountant and my wife. It was one of these exercises that was a carryover from how I was training managers, in that I think you grow most efficiently and successfully if you can develop a few skills at a time. So I was trying to figure out what it would take to run my own back office, even if it was just moving my money from my checking account to my &#8220;investing account,&#8221; and writing my own portfolio update.</p>
<p>I was really excited about the possibility of launching my first externally facing fund with other people&#8217;s money under the Jigsaw banner, too, but there&#8217;s actually a fund in the UK [named Jigsaw] and as I started to talk to LPs and was saying &#8216;Look, I want to do this data fund and I want it to be early stage,&#8217; I&#8217;d get calls from them being like, &#8216;We just saw that Jigsaw did this Series D in Crowdstrike.&#8217; I realized I&#8217;d be competing with the other Jigsaw from a mindshare perspective, so figured before things go too big and crazy, I&#8217;d create my own distinct brand.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did you roll any of your angel-backed deals into the new fund? I see Rackhouse has 13 portfolio companies.</strong></p>
<p>KN: There are a few that I&#8217;ve agreed to move forward and warehouse for the fund, and we&#8217;re just going through the technicalities of doing that right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And the focus is on machine learning and AI.</strong></p>
<p>KN: That&#8217;s right, and I think there are amazing opportunities outside of the traditional areas of industry focus that, to the extent that you can find like rigorous applications of AI,  are also going to be significantly less competitive. [Deals] that don&#8217;t fall in the strike zone of nearly as many [venture] firms is the game I want to be playing. I feel like that that opportunity &#8212; regardless of sector, regardless of geography &#8212; biases toward domain experts.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I wonder if that also explains the size of your fund &#8212; your wanting to stay out of the strike zone of most venture firms.</strong></p>
<p>KN: I want to make sure that I build a fund that enables me to be an active participant in the earliest stages of companies.</p>
<p>Matt Ocko and Zack Bogue [of Data Collective] are good friends of mine &#8212; they&#8217;re mentors, in fact, and small LPs in the fund and talked with me about how they got started. But now they have a billion-plus [dollars] in assets under management, and he people I [like to back] are two people who are moonlighting and getting ready to take the plunge and [firms the size of Data Collective] have basically priced themselves out of the formation and pre-seed stage, and I like that stage. It&#8217;s something where I have a lot of useful experience. I also think it&#8217;s the stage where, if you come from a place of domain expertise, you don&#8217;t need five quarters of financials to get conviction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nodeslinks.com/">Nodes &amp; Links</a> is a scheduling platform for large-scale infrastructure projects which works out when the nuts and bolts for the bridge (for example) should be delivered, and in what order. Unsurprisingly, complex infrastructure projects often get this wrong. The company has now raised an $11 million Series A funding round led by urban sustainability-focused fund <a href="https://www.2150.vc/">2150</a>, alongside Zigg Capital and Westerly Winds, with participation from existing investors Entrepreneur First, ADV and Seedcamp.</p>
<p>Launched in 2018, the company’s Aegis platform is used by Balfour Beatty, Costain and BAM Nuttal, and claims to have delivered millions in cost savings on infrastructure projects, because the building materials and assembly ends up being organized in the right order. Given that most major projects run significantly over time and over budget, scheduling correctly can make a huge difference to costs, as well as the impact on the environment.</p>
<p>The company quotes a survey by Oxford University that found that only 8% of infrastructure projects get delivered on time and on budget.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Complex projects account for over 4% of the world’s GDP, yet only 8% of them complete on budget and on time,&#8221; Nodes and Links CEO Greg Lawton said. &#8220;This is largely because humans are responsible for all tasks within projects, even the repetitive and complex ones they’re unsuited to, instead of the high-value, creative activities people are uniquely qualified for. By expanding our workforce to include machines, better decisions will be made and better projects delivered. We firmly believe that the work we’re doing is going to have the same impact as automation did in manufacturing and this new investment will help us accelerate its adoption for the common good.”</p>
<p>Nodes &amp; Links competes with large infrastructure software such as Oracle Primavera, as well as plain old Excel spreadsheets, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>“The world is accelerating its investment into linear infrastructure, much of it with a focus on sustainability and resilience,&#8221; Christian Hernandez, Partner at 2150 said. &#8220;Time is the biggest lever available to ensure that trillions of dollars of projects starts delivering benefits to our planet and Nodes &amp; Links has proven that they can help large and complex engineering projects deliver on that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vividq.com/">VividQ</a>, a UK-based deeptech startup with technology for rendering holograms on legacy screens, has raised $15 million to develop its technology for next-generation digital displays and devices. And it&#8217;s already lining up manufacturing partners in the US, China and Japan to do it.</p>
<p>The funding round, a Seed extension round, was led by UTokyo IPC, the venture investment arm for the University of Tokyo. It was joined by Foresight Williams Technology (a joint collaboration between Foresight Group and Williams Advanced Engineering), Japanese Miyako Capital, APEX Ventures in Austria, and the R42 Group VC out of Stanford. Previous investors University of Tokyo Edge Capital, Sure Valley Ventures, and Essex Innovation also participated.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to scale VividQ&#8217;s HoloLCD technology, which, claims the company, turns consumer-grade screens into holographic displays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017, VividQ has already worked with ARM, and other partners, including Compound Photonics, Himax Technologies, and iView Displays.</p>
<p>The startup is aiming its technology at Automotive HUD, head-mounted displays (HMDs), and smart glasses with a Computer-Generated Holography that projects &#8220;actual 3D images with true depth of field, making displays more natural and immersive for users.” It also says it has discovered a way to turn normal LCD screens into holographic displays.</p>
<p>“Scenes we know from films, from Iron Man to Star Trek, are becoming closer to reality than ever,&#8221; Darran Milne, co-founder and CEO of VividQ, said. &#8220;At VividQ, we are on a mission to bring holographic displays to the world for the first time. Our solutions help bring innovative display products to the automotive industry, improve AR experiences, and soon will change how we interact with personal devices, such as laptops and mobiles.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172319" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172319" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172319" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PlanePRImage300DPI.jpg" alt="VividQ" width="613" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PlanePRImage300DPI.jpg 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PlanePRImage300DPI.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PlanePRImage300DPI.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PlanePRImage300DPI.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172319" class="wp-caption-text">VividQ</p></div></p>
<p>Mikio Kawahara, chief investment officer of UTokyo IPC, said, “The future of display is holography. The demand for improved 3D images in real-world settings is growing across the whole display industry. VividQ&#8217;s products will make the future ambitions of many consumer electronics businesses a reality.”</p>
<p>Hermann Hauser, APEX Ventures’ advisor, and co-founder of Arm added: “Computer-Generated Holography recreates immersive projections that possess the same 3D information as the world around us. VividQ has the potential to change how humans interact with digital information.”</p>
<p>Speaking on a call with me, Milne added: “We have put the technology on gaming laptops that can actually take make use of holographic displays on a standard LCD screen. So you know the image is actually extending out of the screen. We don&#8217;t use any optical trickery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we say holograms, what we mean is a hologram is essentially an instruction set that tells light how to behave. We compute that effect algorithmically and then present that to the eye, so it&#8217;s indistinguishable from a real object. It&#8217;s entirely natural as well. Your brain and your visual system are unable to distinguish it from something real because you&#8217;re literally giving your eyes the same information that reality does, so there&#8217;s no trickery in the normal sense,” he said.</p>
<p>If this works, it could certainly be a transformation, and I can see it being married very well with technology like <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/">UltraLeap</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 30, 2021. It’s the last day of the quarter. It’s the last day of the first half of the year. It’s the halfway mark for your New Year’s resolutions. The kickoff of Q3 means that we are heading into yet another earnings season. To close the second quarter, a number of companies went public including Didi and SentinelOne. The TechCrunch take is that we’re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/for-us-and-chinese-startups-the-ipo-market-is-increasingly-a-two-tier-affair/">seeing some interesting pricing differentials</a> between companies from the United States compared to China. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robinhood fined ahead of IPO:</strong> While we count down to Robinhood’s IPO filing, long expected <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/">after a strong first quarter</a>, the company was hit with <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial">$70 million in fines and penalties</a> today for what the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) described as “widespread and significant harm suffered by customers.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bessemer-replaces-board-member-at-hinge-health-following-competitive-tensions/">Venture capital drama:</a> </strong>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> scooped that SF-based Hinge Health booted a board member after they invested in what the company considered to be a competitor. The news is notable by itself, but also underscores how founder-friendly the market truly is today; this might not have happened back when venture capitalists held more power.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/india-startup-byju-student-data/">Byju’s leaks student data:</a></strong> Today’s breach involves a startup called Salesken.ai, an exposed server, and Byju’s user data. Byju’s is an Indian edtech company, and a very highly valued one at that. Salesken provides what TechCrunch describes as “customer relationship technology,” which helps explain why it might have had the other company’s data. No excuse, however.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s start our startup coverage today with three space-related stories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/virgin-orbit-successfully-launches-its-first-commercial-payloads-to-space/"><strong>Virgin Orbit completes first commercial launch:</strong></a> Sure, SpaceX exists, but competition is a good thing and thus it’s nice to hear that another company is able to put important bits of tech into orbit.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rocket-startup-gilmour-space-raises-46m-series-c-to-take-small-launch-vehicle-to-orbit/"><strong>Gilmour Space wants in on the same action:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And the launch company has just raised a $46 million Series C to get to space next year. Gilmour’s rocket is smaller than others that you might be familiar with. But, again, more competition is good. It means lower prices and better service.</li>
<li>Remember that 3D rocket-printing company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/relativity-space-launches-its-valuation-to-4-2b-with-650m-in-new-funding/">raised $650 million Series E earlier this year</a>? It’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/relativity-space-will-open-a-1-million-square-foot-factory-to-scale-terran-r-production/">building out a 1,000,000 square foot factory for production</a>. Bring on the cheap rockets. I want to go to space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, the creator economy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/pietra-raises-15m-from-founders-fund-to-help-creators-launch-their-own-product-lines/"><strong>Pietra raises $15M to help creators build product lines:</strong></a> Wagers are still being placed on creators making and selling their own goods, it appears. Which makes sense if you consider the creator economy as still in its nascency and thus has lots of room to grow.</li>
<li>But while that’s a popular perspective, the passion economy &#8212; call it what you will &#8212; is not all big checks and instant success. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dear-economy-creators-arent-fragile-plants/">explored the sector today on the Equity podcast</a> with Alexis Gay joining us for the ride.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that wasn’t all. Here’s more from today’s critical startup coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/daylight-raises-millions-to-build-a-digital-banking-platform-designed-for-and-by-the-lgbtq-community/"><strong>$5M for a LGBTQ+ neobank:</strong></a> While many neobanks are targeting the population at large, others are taking a more targeted approach. Such is the case with Daylight, which wants to provide banking services to the queer community. It joins startups like Fair and others in taking a slightly more niche approach to the popular fintech model.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/zipline-raises-250m-at-2-75b-valuation-to-build-out-its-instant-logistics-service/"><strong>$250M for drone logistics:</strong></a> Remember that startup that was using drones to deliver medical supplies in Africa? It was called Zipline. And it has since expanded its goals, technology, and, today, capital base.</li>
<li>And then there was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/2171608/">news from Gusto</a> that the HR-tech unicorn is breaking out pieces of its core technology so that other companies can embed payroll services and the like. While this is cool, what we really want is a Gusto S-1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demand Curve: 7 ad types that increase click-through rates</h2>
<p>One perennial problem inside startups: Because no one on the founding team has significant marketing experience, growth-related efforts are pro forma and generally unlikely to move the needle.</p>
<p>Everyone wants higher click-through rates, but creating ads that &#8220;stand out&#8221; is a risky strategy, especially when you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. This guest post by Demand Curve offers seven strategies for boosting CTR that you can clone and deploy today inside your own startup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one: If customers are talking about you online, reach out to ask if you can add a screenshot of their reviews to your advertising. Testimonials are a form of social proof that boost conversions, and they&#8217;re particularly effective when used in retargeting ads.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we ran another post about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/demand-curve-email-marketing-tactics-that-convert-subscribers-into-customers/">optimizing email marketing for early-stage startups</a>. We&#8217;ll have more expert growth advice coming soon, so stay tuned.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>From tech’s biggest companies, we have three stories for you today. Let’s proceed in descending order of market cap, shall we?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/"><strong>Amazon doesn’t want to be regulated:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And it may be worried to boot. That’s our takeaway from news that the company is trying to sideline the current FTC chair. Tough, is our first read of the company’s complaints and demands.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/"><strong>Instagram wants in on paid following:</strong></a> Following in Big Tweet’s footsteps, Instagram is “building its own version of Twitter’s Super Follow with a feature that would allow online creators to publish &#8216;exclusive&#8217; content to their Instagram Stories that’s only available to their fans.” So it would be stuff, <em>only</em> available for <em>fans</em>? How interesting. There’s another service that has a similar effort. And Twitter allows for adult content. Instagram does not. Hmm.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/"><strong>Twitter makes NFTs, because why not:</strong></a> Want to know when something jumps the shark? When a major social network buys in, right? Major social networks are the boomers of the technology world &#8212; extending the analogy, Oracle is a ghost that haunts your attic &#8212; meaning that they are inherently uncool. And now Twitter has NFTs. Yay, or something.</li>
</ul>
