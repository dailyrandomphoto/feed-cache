										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SolarWinds is back in hot water after a shareholder lawsuit accused the company of poor security practices, which they say allowed hackers to break into at least nine U.S. government agencies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">hundreds of companies</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit said SolarWinds used an easily guessable password &#8220;solarwinds123&#8221; on an update server, which was subsequently breached by hackers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">&#8220;likely Russian in origin.&#8221;</a> Former SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna, speaking at a congressional hearing in March, blamed the poor password on an intern.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			There are countless cases of companies bearing the brunt from breaches caused by vendors and contractors across the supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Experts are still trying to understand just how the hackers broke into SolarWinds servers. But the weak password does reveal wider issues about the company&#8217;s security practices — including how the easily guessable password was allowed to be set to begin with.</p>
<p>Even if the intern is held culpable, SolarWinds still faces what&#8217;s known as vicarious liability — and that can lead to hefty penalties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While London, Paris, Berlin and Stockholm feature regularly in tech coverage, the rest of Europe has been busy.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic may be better known for beer, hockey and the sights of Prague, but its entrepreneurial community is as ambitious as any. Pipedrive is an EU-based CRM company with offices in eight countries, but it has a Czech co-founder in VP of Product Martin Henk, one of several founders to emerge from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Then there was Integromat, which did not raise any external capital but sold for around 2.5 billion crowns ($114 million), making its seven Czech founders into multimillionaires. Prague&#8217;s Memsource is valued at approximately 1.3 billion crowns or $59 million. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To unpack this rare gem of Europe’s startup scene, we spoke to eight area investors.</p>
<p>Among the trends they identified are startups in B2B, business automation processes, e-commerce, AI, SaaS and COVID-19-related solutions, as well as &#8220;smart&#8221; everything: factories, cities, offices, etc. Other themes included cybersecurity, AR/VR, remote work, and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Saturated areas included cryptocurrency, blockchain, fintech and martech. The people we spoke to said they see travel, dating apps and other businesses traditionally based on physical interaction as weaker segments. Still, new opportunities are popping up in remote work, psychedelics and wellness.</p>

<p>Respondents said they invest around 50% inside Czechia and 50% across Central and Eastern Europe, while some are more focused across CEE generally, with some percentage of the fund supporting startups that have scaled to the U.S.</p>
<p>Most said their investments hadn&#8217;t been significantly impacted by COVID-19, but future uncertainly is a concern. The advice is to “be frugal to accommodate to the new situation and roll on.”</p>
<p>As far as green shoots, COVID-19 has “played a role of an accelerator for innovation in many business areas and even e-government and other rigid/conservative industries,” said one. D2C startups have benefitted and “Zoom selling&#8221; now seems “totally plausible.”</p>

<h2>Ondrej Bartos, founding partner, Credo Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Automation, AI, enabling remote, authentication.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
TypingDNA.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Outstanding founders tackling big opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
VR/AR has been an area with lots of investment, therefore very competitive. AI is overhyped but most AI are actually not that intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Less. We focus on Central Europe as a region (if that would count as local, then more than 50%).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Central Europe is well positioned in automation, security, developer tools and analytics. I&#8217;m most excited about UiPath, Productboard, Pricefx, TypingDNA, Spaceflow, Around (in our portfolio). Best CE founders are in my view Daniel Dines, Hubert Palan, Marcin Cichon plus Oliver Dlouhý (Kiwi.com).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
There are a lot of great developers in Prague, good energy and enough success stories and role models to follow. There is a lot of investment capital there (just as everywhere else I guess), not too much smart money yet, so definitely opportunity for good VCs to take a look (and they are looking).</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I have no doubts that the pandemic has been accelerating remote work, which ultimately should lead to more remote-first startups which might benefit new geos.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel and hospitality seem most fragile and unpredictable due to COVID-19. Remote and enabling remote seem like the biggest opportunity; automation and enabling digital transformation are attractive as well.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy is unchanged; actually we&#8217;ll double down on it. There is a lot of opportunity for good tech startups, technology is what&#8217;s helping people and countries to get out of crises faster with less damage. Our advice to startups is still the same: Focus on your cause and try to solve problems in your space better than anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
We definitely see green shoots in some of the enterprise software companies. &#8220;Zoom selling&#8221; now seems totally plausible, sales cycles shortened in some verticals as companies need to digitize and enable remote work.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve always had hope. Yes, there have been low moments especially when quarantined, but overall I haven&#8217;t lost hope for people to cope with this unprecedented situation, and for technology to play a significant role in the recovery. I still have this hope :)</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
I feel like I had been traveling too much, two- or three-day transatlantic trips make little sense and I think I won&#8217;t go back there. Also, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go back to 5+ days in the office every week, home office works fine with me and it will stay with me and the company in some capacity. That being said, it is what I feel now. I may be wrong and things may go back to &#8220;old normal&#8221; — which I would consider a big mistake and lost opportunity.</p>

<h2>Osman Salih, associate, Bolt Start Up Development a.s.</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We are looking for synergies with our parent company O2 Czech republic and other companies under the PPF Group.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
IP Fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
We would like to see more insurtech startups in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are looking for synergies with our partner companies rather looking into a specific branch.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Fintech is oversaturated with very low margins.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We mostly invest locally, but our most successful investment was in Taxify (now Bolt).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Definitely security domain is best positioned. We are excited about IP Fabric (founder is ex-Cisco CEO Pavel Bykov), Whalebone (R. Malovič), Wultra (P. Dvořák).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The interest is bigger, a lot of successful startups raise demand for opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
We don&#8217;t think so, local network is important. Remote work is not for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
There will be shifts in retail. This is an opportunity for startups like Pygmalios, which provide analytics for retail.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Luckily the impact is not big. Biggest worries are about difficulties with travel abroad for business meetings. Our advice is hold the runway longer :-)</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, demand for call center tools like omnichannel solution mluvii.com, which works at the home office move up significantly.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
At spring our country was &#8220;best in COVID&#8221; and now it is &#8220;worst in COVID.&#8221; Last spring thousands of people from the startup community helped and came up with brilliant ideas, apps and solutions but at the end most outcomes (like <a href="https://erouska.cz/en">eRouška</a> and <a href="https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/en/">https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/en/</a>) were screwed by slow or faulty decisions of government. Instead of hope I&#8217;m disappointed, but I believe that vaccination will help us to get life back on the track.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />

<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Prague is great and safe city for living — when you setup a branch in Prague you can attract people from all of the CEE region to move in.</p>
<h2>Lukáš Konečný, principal, Y Soft Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Anything that helps businesses run smarter is something we would like to take a look at. More specifically we are interested in areas such as Internet of Things, smart factories, smart cities, smart office, cybersecurity, big data and AR/VR. And especially when there is some kind of hardware involved — that something we really love.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="https://vrgineers.com">VRgineers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
It would be great to see more startups focusing on hardware. Admittedly, creating hardware and scaling-up a hardware-focused business is always a bigger challenge, but the opportunities are so vast and many are yet untapped.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Apart from the &#8220;obvious&#8221; aspects such as innovativeness, global potential, scalability, strong team and fit with our investment thesis, we look for founders who show great strategic thinking and execution skills, who really understand the market and their customers&#8217; needs and listen to feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Considering our focus on B2B, we have better overview of this part of the economy. Lately, we have seen a huge number of startups using AI/ML for computer vision or natural language processing use cases creating very similar products, meaning it will be rather difficult for them to differentiate and outperform the rest of the competition. But that does not mean that a new revolutionary idea cannot appear.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our focus is on the Central European region — so far we have invested in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but we are open to founders from other neighboring countries as well. The majority of our portfolio is located in the Brno/South Moravia region, where Y Soft is based. It is not an outcome of an intentional strategy, but just the reality of which startups interested us the most.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Generally, the Czech startup ecosystem is getting more mature, especially thanks to serial entrepreneurs as well as more experienced first-time founders, and the developing business angel/VC ecosystem. It is hard to pick just one industry, as the spectrum of companies is very vast.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
From the investors&#8217; point of view, the Czech startup ecosystem can provide a lot of interesting opportunities, and especially for foreign investors the investments can be a &#8220;good value for money,&#8221; even though the VC ecosystem has become more competitive in the last years due to influx of new money. The seed and partly Series A segment can be seen as rather saturated, but there is a significant potential in the larger Series A or later-stage investments.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The main Czech hubs, Prague and Brno, are probably not going to see their status weakened, as they are not only business centers, but also have the main universities where the talented people are and are hearts of the cultural life that is attractive to many. But we will see a shift toward remote woking, allowing founders to tap a wider talent pool.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We believe that after the shock caused by COVID-19 fades away, there will be more opportunities for the companies in segments we invest in, as the induced trends are only forcing businesses to run smarter. The trends most relevant to us will be those associated with accelerated digital transformation, changes in supply chains and evolution of workspaces.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not impacted our strategy. The only changes were on the tactical level, as for a certain period of time we shifted more capacities to portfolio support. Most of our founders had to deal with a negative impact on their sales funnel, as some customers postponed or cancelled the planned deals. Some of the founders had to deal with disruptions in the distribution channels, as some of their partners&#8217; businesses were hit rather hard, and a small number of companies had to resolve issues with their supply chain. These challenges are still, to an extent, worries to our portfolio companies, as the economic development is still uncertain. To deal with the situation, cash flow became the main focus, together with more active communication with key business partners throughout the value chains.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
We have seen a lot of positive signals in retention and some green shoots regarding revenue, but the situation is still too fragile.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
It is hard to find glimmers of hope lately, as the situation in the Czech Republic is really not developing well. However, I was recently able to participate in several online events that young entrepreneurs, in some cases even high school or university students, attended to present their projects or to improve their business skills. And it was great to see people who are still deeply interested in — and invested in — the entrepreneurial path, regardless of the current situation.</p>

<h2>Vaclav Pavlecka, managing partner, Air Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We are sector agnostic, so it&#8217;s not so much about &#8220;trends,&#8221; rather than other aspects of startups in our pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Cross Network Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Many sectors are &#8220;to-be-disrupted yet&#8221; but for example I believe that the predictive medicine (that helps you avoid the problem instead the one that is helping to solve the problem that is already there) will be one of the major trends for the near future.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Distinctive unique selling proposition, market-oriented and sales-hungry team, disruptive potential, upmarket potential.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Social networks in general are the type of services I am concerned about due to a long-term impact on one&#8217;s mental health and due to social confirmation bias and decreasing ability for a healthy unheated critical discussion in society. As for oversaturation, it is hard to generalize, since every industry still has its niches. But a top of my mind idea for an oversaturated market is the marketing technologies sector (as well as many other software products). Solutions are easily replicable (think chatbots) and successful only at the limited market.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We tend to focus on companies with the local strings (with exceptions made — e.g., Californian clothing startup Nahmias).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We see a huge potential of local talents in cybersecurity, industry automation (due to the fact that Czechia has one of the densest &#8220;per capita&#8221; car production in the world), gaming industry (including esports), crypto and health. As for companies I think Apiary, Beat Games, Warhorse gaming studio, Mews.com, Kiwi.com, Snuggs, Prusa Research, Productboard, Rossum, Integromat and Alheon.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
&#8220;Local&#8221; VCs and investors are definitely willing to make meaningful connections and co-invest. The ecosystem is more mature every year and grows stronger. Prague and the surrounding region also has its charm that attracts many talents as the city has an ideal balance between the life quality and costs in comparison to other metropolitan areas.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I believe that we will see a big &#8220;return to the good part of the old system&#8221; in the end of this year/early 2022, so I won&#8217;t expect the big shift in the sense of geographic &#8220;founder density&#8221; outside of the major cities. If, however, the COVID-19 restrictions should last more years, then many social changes can be sparked, including geographic mobility and flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
No surprise there — the whole travel industry, gastronomical industry and culture tech are in the deepest crisis in decades. Many other industries are under big pressure to increase the speed of change, e.g., the education industry, the entertainment industry. Also in general small to medium businesses are having tough times locally, since the government restrictions are not being implemented efficiently and their communication isn&#8217;t built around a sound strategy.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy is built around long-lasting principles and therefore we didn&#8217;t have to change it completely. Of course the investment appetite in sectors hit by crisis decreased significantly but other opportunities emerged. As for portfolio impact, proptech vertical was hit heavily and some of our companies had to reiterate their product offering. Our general advice to any startup in our portfolio is to boost the dialogue with their customers, learn how their needs are shifting (if so) and try to steer the wheel in the right time. If needed, we are ready to support our founders financially and also teamwise, since we are hands-on investors.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
D2C startups with a sound unit economy and their own strong distribution channels are thriving (not only locally). This includes our portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Not losing hope really. I think people were in much deeper crises and that we refer to the current situation as we do only due to lack of historical comparability. We are still living in times of prosperity and the pandemic will eventually go away thanks to the scientific progress people have achieved. So I think the beacon of positive change are all the RNA vaccines out there. I am thrilled by the restless work of scientists involved in their development and I believe they should receive much greater social credit than they do nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Cedric Maloux, Lubo Smid, Dita Formánková, Tomas Cironis, Ondrej Bartos.</p>
<h2>Roman Horacek , partner, Reflex Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
B2B, business automation processes, e-commerce, AI, SaaS, COVID-19-related solutions — across verticals (remote work, conferencing, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Webnode, SignageOS and some others that unfortunately cannot be disclosed yet :)</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I would like to see more AI startups (actually using AI).</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Rockstar founders, existing and real market need, scalable solution with solid IP.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Cryptocurrencies, blockchain, talent marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
As of now our portfolio is approximately 75%/25% (75% CEE and 25% USA/other).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Our companies — APIFY, Productboard, Smartlook, Alice Technologies, SingageOS. Other companies — DoDo, Around, UiPath, Pex,</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Great technical talent with superb ideas falling behind with go-to-market and sales skills.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think so, I believe the talent will still be attracted by existing major hubs. Smaller the team, more interaction is needed. Despite all the innovations in remote work one-to-one interactions and social time cannot be fully replaced (yet).</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Exposed — travel, dating apps … all businesses traditionally based on physical interaction. Not a surprise I guess :) Opportunities — remote work applications, psychedelic applications, well-being startups, life science solutions, logistics and related industries, e-commerce for SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>Has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really. Our No. 1 investment criteria is strong founders. Most of them were able to adjust their business models to the new market conditions. Spring 2020 advice was cash is king, stay frugal and adjust your business to the new market conditions ASAP or others will.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes. I believe COVID-19 played a role of an accelerator for innovations in many business areas and even e-government and other rigid/conservative industries.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Given all the events of 2020 we had a solid year as a fund. What was inspiring — seeing founders coming across whatever obstacles thrown under their legs … overcoming them with new ideas/inventions and unbreakable entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Hard to name one or a few … every single player plays a different role and one individual is unimportant without others. Same as in nature, even the strongest/biggest predators cannot thrive without a thriving ecosystem as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says there is no room for a new social network?</p>
<p>Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a round of $15 million to $20 million in seven-month-old Kutumb that values the Indian startup at about $170 million, four people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The American investment firm has offered a termsheet to the Indian startup but the deal &#8212; a Series A &#8212; has not closed yet, some of the people said on the condition of anonymity as the talks are private. Usual caveat: Terms may change, or the deal may not materialize.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://kutumbapp.com/">Kutumb</a>, which means family in Hindi, has built a “private social network like Reddit” that connects communities based on “culture, creed, beliefs, interests, [and] professions.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s eponymous six-month-old app has amassed over 11 million monthly active users, up from about 550,000 in December last year, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>Kutumb was valued at about $15 million late last year when it raised funds from Sequoia Capital India’s Surge accelerator. It raised about $2.5 million in its seed financing round, according to insight firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>Tiger Global declined to comment. One of the co-founders of Kutumb didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year. The larger HomePod offered a beefier sound space but the mini has been very well received and clearly accomplishes many of the duties that the larger version was tasked with. The sound is super solid (especially for the size) and it offers access to Siri, Apple&#8217;s assistant feature.</p>
<p>The original HomePod was a feat of audio engineering that Apple spent over five years developing. In order to accomplish its development, the team at Apple built out a full development center near its headquarters in Cupertino, with a world-class development environment with a dozen anechoic chambers, including one of the bigger anechoic chambers outside of academic use in the US. I visited the center before its release, noting that Apple took it the extra mile to get the incredibly complex series of tweeters and woofer that built its soundspace:</p>
<blockquote><p>But slathered on top of that is a bunch of typically Apple extra-mile jelly. Apple says that its largest test chamber is one of the biggest in the US, on a pad, suspended from the outside world with nothing to pollute its tests of audio purity. Beyond testing for the acoustic qualities of the speaker, these chambers allowed Apple to burrow down to account for and mitigate the issues that typically arise from having a high excursion subwoofer in such a small cabinet. Going even further, there are smaller chambers that allow them to isolate the hum from electronic components (there is a computer on board after all) and make attempts to insulate and control that noise so it doesn’t show up in the final output.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I found it to be one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/a-four-sentence-homepod-review-with-appendices/">best speakers ever made</a> for the home when I reviewed it in 2018. From the booming base and well-shaped nature of the tweeter assembly inside; the cloth cover that was specially shaped to avoid interfering with sound quality in any way; the way that it sensed the way that audio was being shaped by walls and other obstructions and adjusted its output to compensate. It was the definition of &#8216;no effort spared&#8217; in the speaker department.</p>
<p>The major gripe for the speaker at the time was the $349 price, which was at the top end of the home speaker market, especially those with embedded home assistants. A price drop to $299 mitigated that somewhat, but still put it at the top of the pricing umbrella for the class. Apple&#8217;s HomePod mini, launched last year, has been well received. Our Brian Heater said that it had &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/apple-homepod-mini-review-remarkably-big-sound/">remarkably big sound&#8217; for the $99 price.</a></p>
<p>Apple gave TechCrunch a statement about the discontinuation:</p>
<blockquote><p>HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Existing HomePods will continue to be sold but Apple&#8217;s website is already out of Space Gray. It will continue to provide support for existing HomePods. Apple seems to be betting on the mini going forward, which could point to their desire to fill every room with &#8216;good enough&#8217; sound rather than to focus on the living room with &#8216;truly unbelievable&#8217; sound. The HomePod itself never quite got to the level where it could act as a full home theater replacement, though paired in their multi-speaker configurations.</p>
<p>The HomePod research and production efforts will live on in some ways through Apple&#8217;s advanced audio rendering systems that led to things like Spatial Audio in AirPods. I quite enjoy the ones in my home and have yet to add any minis to the mix. Maybe a last minute hunt is in order.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.passioncapital.com/">Passion Capital</a>, the early-stage venture firm in London, told TechCrunch earlier this week that &#8212; in an apparent first for a European fund &#8212;  it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/in-a-first-for-europe-passion-capital-will-crowd-fund-part-of-its-new-62m-fund-from-retail-investors/">plans to crowdfund</a> the final stage of its third and latest vehicle. Specifically, it’s carving out around half a million dollars for anyone who wants to invest in the vehicle, as long as they are a high net worth individual.</p>
<p>Firm founder Eileen Burbidge says the outfit was inspired by developments it has seen here in the U.S., from AngelList&#8217;s <a href="https://angel.co/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">rolling fund</a> program, to an imminent change in a crowdfunding regulation, Reg CF, that <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/01/171249-after-long-wait-updates-to-crowdfunding-exemptions-publish-in-federal-register-with-new-rules-effective-in-march/">on Monday</a> is set to bump up the maximum amount that can be raised through a crowdfunding campaign from $1.07 million in any twelve-month period to $5 million &#8212; a nearly five-fold increase.</p>
<p>The move is interesting, especially coming on the heels of some other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/two-new-efforts-push-to-transform-more-people-into-limited-partners-of-vc-funds/">recent initiatives</a> to democratize venture capital. But if crowdfunding a piece of traditional venture funds does become a bigger trend, it’s not going to happen overnight. We talked with fund formation attorneys and administrators this week, and they’d barely registered that the crowdfunding limit is about to quintuple because they aren&#8217;t being asked about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why not? One fund formation attorney said he doesn’t think it will become a viable fundraising path &#8212; unless other paths aren’t available &#8212; because of the benefits of having investors who can provide contacts and expertise to portfolio companies. Think of the many funds that count CTOs as limited partners, for example; VCs can learn a lot about the kinds of technology they&#8217;re looking to implement by bringing them into the fold.</p>
<p>There are other pragmatic concerns, too. VCs like to personally know their limited partners because they call down capital on a deal-by-deal basis and want to be sure their investors will come through with the money.</p>
<p>A crowdfunded component could also be a &#8220;big  and permanent administrative burden,&#8221; given that it could involve &#8220;potentially hundreds of equity owners for a relatively small amount of money.&#8221; So notes attorney Mike Sullivan of the global law firm Orrick.</p>
<p>A less obvious reason VCs might not be thinking much about crowdfunding ties to complications when it comes to a firm’s internal rate of return. VCs don’t like to have money sitting around on their balance sheet; they like to call down the capital as they need it, because the clock doesn’t start ticking on an investment until they do this. (That gives them more time to hopefully shepherd an investment into an eventual success story that they can later tweet about.)</p>
<p>Asked about why the new crowdfunding cap isn&#8217;t on his colleagues&#8217; radar yet, one fund administrator tells us it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re all too busy dealing with with SPACs, those special purpose acquisition companies that are springing up like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-boom-visualized-in-one-chart-11612962000">mushrooms</a>.</p>
<p>That many of these blank-check outfits are taking public fairly nascent tech companies &#8212; giving retail investors access to the kinds of high-risk, high-reward startups that be otherwise out of reach &#8212;  could also slow the extent to which VCs begin incorporating more &#8220;ordinary&#8221; investors into the asset class.</p>
<p>Still, absent a last-minute change by the Biden administration &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t that appear one is coming (at least, Gary Gensler&#8217;s nomination to serve as SEC chairman still requires full Senate confirmation) &#8212; Reg CF is on the cusp of changing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth paying closer attention to what ripple effects &#8212; and opportunities &#8212; might result.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our growing library of how-to stories are aimed squarely at early-stage founders and workers trying to solve long-term problems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Extra Crunch publishes a variety of article types, but how-tos are my favorite category.</p>
<p>For many entrepreneurs, the startup they are trying to get off the ground might be only the second entry on their resume. As a result, they don&#8217;t have much experience to draw from when it comes to basics like hiring, fundraising and growth marketing.</p>
<p>Last week, Natasha Mascarenhas interviewed experts who had some strategic advice for finding the right time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/product-manager-hiring-for-startups/">to bring a product manager on board</a>. This afternoon, we published a guest post by growth marketer Jessica Li with tips for &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/how-nontechnical-talent-can-break-into-deep-tech/">how nontechnical talent can build relationships with deep tech companies</a>.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve also received great feedback on a recent guest post about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/six-tips-for-saas-founders-who-dont-want-vc-money/">bootstrapping options for SaaS founders</a> written by a founder who&#8217;s actually done it.</p>

<p>As Roblox began to trade Wednesday, the company’s shares shot above its reference price of $45 per share. Roblox, a gaming company aimed at children, has had a tumultuous if exciting path to the public markets.</p>
<p>Seeing Roblox trade so very far above its direct listing reference price and final private valuation appears to undercut the argument that this sort of debut can sort out pricing issues inherent in more traditional IPOs.</p>

<p>Trained on trillions of words, GPT-3 is a 175-billion parameter transformer model — the third of such models released by OpenAI.</p>
<p>GPT-3 is remarkable in its ability to generate human-like text and responses, able to return coherent and topical emails, tweets, trivia and much more. In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications.</p>

<p>To date, Q1 2021 is ahead and is thus guaranteed to set a new record, having already bested the preceding all-time high. What’s going on?</p>

<p>Have you ever popped into a meeting because you overheard a snippet of a conversation and wanted to share your perspective?</p>
<p>That’s passive collaboration &#8212; low-friction ways to invite new ideas. But it’s only when we’re able to fully realize passive collaboration virtually that we’ll have unlocked the full potential of remote and hybrid work situations.</p>

<p>Many investors will encourage CEOs to remain U.S.-centric this year and perhaps expand their product offering or move into new market segments. But 95% of the world’s population lives outside the U.S., making an expansion into Europe your best growth lever.</p>

<p>Because product managers and founders often have overlapping skill sets, it can be tricky to find the right candidate.</p>
<p>While it’s different for every company, hiring a PM ensures companies aren’t “chasing the shiny object” but rather building the things that create enduring value for customers.</p>

<p>One of the first recurring features Alex Wilhelm established at Extra Crunch was the &#8220;$100M ARR Club,&#8221; ongoing coverage of startups that have reached scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget a $1 billion valuation — $100 million in annual recurring revenue is the cool kids&#8217; club,&#8221; he wrote in December 2019. Since then, he expanded it to cover companies that attained $50M ARR.</p>
<p>The concept is a useful lens for studying the market. I can say this with confidence because it&#8217;s been widely copied by other tech news outlets. But this morning, Alex surprised me — he&#8217;s shelving the ARR Club, at least for now.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end it became a pre-IPO list that was fun but not entirely educational, by my reckoning,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;The $50M ARR club evolution was supposed to help shake loose more interesting operational details, but just didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before putting the format on hiatus, Alex&#8217;s last ARR Club roundup looks at in-office display and kiosk startup AppSpace, data backup unicorn Druva, and Synack, which makes security software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A prominent Republican senator weighs in on Amazon&#8217;s labor disputes, Microsoft reports a security vulnerability in Exchange and we examine ByteDance&#8217;s gaming strategy. This is your Daily Crunch for March 12, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Marco Rubio sides with Amazon workers</strong></p>
<p>Senator Marco Rubio published <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/12/amazon-union-not-helping-working-class-economy-column/6947823002/">an op-ed</a> in USA Today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/">declaring his support for workers in Amazon&#8217;s warehouse</a> in Bessemer, Alabama, as they seek to unionize.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising for a Republican senator to throw his weight behind a nascent labor union, but it seems that Rubio&#8217;s position has as much to do with his feelings about Amazon as his labor politics. In fact, his op-ed warned of the &#8220;dangers posed by the unchecked influence of labor unions,&#8221; while also arguing that Amazon is guilty of &#8220;uniquely malicious corporate behavior.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Immune intelligence startup Serimmune hopes to better understand the relationship between antibody epitopes (the parts of antigen molecules that bind to antibodies) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p>The company’s proprietary technology, originally developed at UC Santa Barbara, provides a new and specific way of mapping the entire array of an individual’s antibodies through a small blood sample. They do this through the use of a bacterial peptide display — a sort of screening mechanism that can isolate plasmid DNA from antibody-bound bacteria in the sample. This DNA can then be sequenced to identify epitopes, which provide information about which antigens someone may have been exposed to, as well as how their immune system responded to them.</p>
<p>“It’s a very highly multiplexed and exquisitely specific way of looking at the epitopes found by antibodies in a specimen,” said Serimmune CEO Noah Nasser, who has a degree in molecular biology from UC San Diego and has previously worked for several diagnostics companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, Serimmune <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serimmune-launches-covid-antibody-epitope-mapping-service-301245377.html?tc=eml_cleartime">announced the launch of a new application of their core technology</a> to help understand the disease states of and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>“So what we do is we take these antibody profiles we build, and we’re able to then map those back with about a 12 amino acid specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome,” said Nasser. “And what we find is that antibody expression is highly correlated to disease state, so we can distinguish mild, moderate, severe and asymptomatic disease on the basis of antibodies that are present in the specimen.”</p>
<p>The more patient data Serimmune can collect, the better its core technology becomes at finding patterns across different antigen exposure and disease severity. Noticing those patterns sooner won’t only help physicians and researchers to better understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus operates, but can also inform new approaches to diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for any antigen.</p>

<p>Serimmune’s launch of its new COVID antibody epitope mapping service is a way of making this data more accessible to customers like vaccine companies, government agencies and academic labs that have shown interest in better understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>“The key was to zero in on the information that researchers wanted to know and standardize that,” said Nasser. “We can actually now provide these results back in as few as two days from sample receipt.”</p>
<p>Beyond this new service, Serimmune also has plans to launch a <a href="https://serimmune.com/covid19study/">longitudinal clinical study on immunity to SARS-CoV-2</a>. Using a painless at-home collection kit, study participants send in small blood samples to Serimmune, which then uses its core technology to outline an individual immunity map.</p>
<p>“We provide their results back to them in the form of a personal immune landscape to COVID,” said Nasser. “And what we’re trying to do is to understand over time how that immune response changes, and what happens to that immune response on repeated exposure to COVID.”</p>
<p>The mapping technology is now so specific that it can tell whether a patient has antibodies from natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or from a vaccine, he added.</p>
<p>While the primary focus for Serimmune remains these applications to the COVID-19 pandemic for now, Nasser also mentioned that the company has plans to move into personalized medicine, potentially offering their mapping service directly to interested patients.</p>
<p>“We believe that this has value to individual patients in understanding their immune status and what antigens they’ve been exposed to,” he said. Until then, Serimmune plans to continue growing its database with more patient samples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets are the subject of another lawsuit.</p>
<p>A Tesla investor is suing the company board and Musk for continuing to send &#8220;erratic tweets&#8221; that violate a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that requires oversight of his social media activities. The lawsuit, which was <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/musk-tesla-board-sued-over-tweeting-in-violation-of-sec-deal">first reported by Bloomberg</a>, claims Musk is exposing the company to potential fines and penalties from regulators and could drive down its share price. The lawsuit names the board for failing to control Musk&#8217;s behavior, which puts the company at risk.</p>
<p>The lawsuit by investor Chase Gharrity, which was <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/public/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=2019-0217&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=">filed in Delaware Chancery Court</a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">was unsealed Friday. It was originally filed March 8. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla, Musk and the SEC reached an agreement in April 2019 that gave the CEO freedom to use Twitter &#8212; within certain limitations &#8212; without fear of being held in contempt for violating an earlier court order. The agreement allows Musk to tweet as he wishes except when it&#8217;s about certain events or financial milestones. In those cases, Musk must seek pre-approval from a securities lawyer, according to the agreement filed with Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>The April 2019 agreement was the product of a years-long fight between Musk and the SEC that began after his infamous August 7, 2018 tweet in which he stated the company had “funding secured” for a private takeover at $420 per share. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/here-is-the-sec-complaint-against-elon-musk-and-tesla/">SEC filed a complaint</a> alleging that Musk had committed securities fraud.</p>
<p>Musk and Tesla settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing. Tesla agreed to pay a $20 million fine; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/elon-musk-agrees-to-resign-as-tesla-chairman-in-settlement-with-sec/">Musk had to agree to step down</a> as Tesla chairman for a period of at least three years; the company had to appoint two independent directors to the board; and Tesla was also told to put in place a way to monitor Musk’s statements to the public about the company, including via Twitter.</p>
<p>The fight was reignited after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/sec-pushes-court-to-hold-elon-musk-in-contempt-over-tesla-tweets/">Musk sent a tweet</a> on February 19, 2019 that Tesla would produce “around” 500,000 cars that year, correcting himself hours later to clarify that he meant the company would be producing at an annualized rate of 500,000 vehicles by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest lawsuit alleges that Musk’s tweeting violates the April 2019 judgment and betrays his, and the board’s, fiduciary duty.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 105-page suit cites several tweets sent from Musk’s account, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a tweet on May 1, 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — over a year after the SEC judgment — which stated: “Tesla stock is too high IMO.” </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla stock price is too high imo</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tweet </span>sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/tesla-shares-fall-on-elon-musk-stock-price-too-high-tweet/">shares into a free fall</a> — <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nearly 12% in the half-hour following his stock price tweets. The tweet was one of many sent out in rapid fire that day, covering a variety of topics and demands “give people back their freedom” and lines from the U.S. National Anthem to quotes from poet Dylan Thomas and a claim that he will sell all of his possessions. Musk later told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he was not joking and that his tweets were not vetted in advance.</span></p>
<p>The lawsuit revealed Friday alleges that t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he Tesla board has also failed to secure a general counsel “who can provide advice untainted by Musk,” the lawsuit. Three general counsels departed from the company in 2019, which the lawsuit points to as evidence that none were able to exercise independent advice that differed from Musk’s “desired outcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk’s “erratic” actions have caused the company “substantial damage,” including billions of dollars in lost market capitalization, the lawsuit says. </span></p>
<p>The case is Gharrity v. Musk, Del. Ch., No. 2021-0199.</p>

Here, I explore the other side: how nontechnical talent can build relationships with deep tech companies.</p>
<p>Startup hiring processes can be opaque, and breaking into the deep tech world as a nontechnical person seems daunting. As someone with no initial research background wanting to work in biotech, I felt this challenge personally. In the past year, I landed several opportunities working for and with deep tech companies.</p>
<p>Here, I’ll share what I’ve learned and offer tactical advice for finding, reaching out to, cultivating relationships with and working at deep tech companies as a nontechnical candidate.</p>

<h2>Find companies by tracking fundraising</h2>
<p>After startups raise capital, they are ready to spend the new funds on hiring. These companies are more likely to be posting new roles and actively hiring for a wide range of different teams, including nontechnical groups.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hackers are exploiting recently discovered vulnerabilities in Exchange email servers to drop ransomware, Microsoft has warned, a move that puts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/america-small-business-hafnium-exchange-hacks/">tens of thousands of email servers</a> at risk of destructive attacks.</p>
<p>In a tweet late Thursday, the tech giant said <a href="https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1370236539427459076">it had detected</a> the new kind of file-encrypting malware called DoejoCrypt — or DearCry — which uses the same four vulnerabilities that Microsoft linked to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">new China-backed hacking group</a> called Hafnium.</p>
<p>When chained together, the vulnerabilities allow a hacker to take full control of a vulnerable system.</p>
<p>Microsoft said Hafnium was the &#8220;primary&#8221; group exploiting these flaws, likely for espionage and intelligence gathering. But other security firms say they&#8217;ve seen other hacking groups exploit the same flaws. ESET said <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/">at least 10 groups</a> are actively compromising Exchange servers.</p>
<p>Michael Gillespie, a ransomware expert who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/18/stop-djvu-puma-decryption-tools/">develops ransomware decryption tools</a>, said many vulnerable Exchange servers in the U.S., Canada, and Australia had been infected with DearCry.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The new ransomware comes less than a day after a security researcher published proof-of-concept exploit code for the vulnerabilities to Microsoft-owned GitHub. The code was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vpaz/researcher-publishes-code-to-exploit-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-on-github">swiftly removed</a> a short time later for violating the company&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>Marcus Hutchins, a security researcher at Kryptos Logic, said <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1370100513501442051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1370101773470367745%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fgadgets%2F2021%2F03%2Fcritics-fume-after-github-removes-exploit-code-for-exchange-vulnerabilities%2F">in a tweet</a> that the code worked, albeit with some fixes.</p>
<p>Threat intelligence company RiskIQ says it has detected over 82,000 vulnerable servers as of Thursday, but that the number is declining. The company said hundreds of servers belonging to banks and healthcare companies are still affected, as well as more than 150 servers in the U.S. federal government.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a rapid drop compared to close to 400,000 vulnerable servers when Microsoft first disclosed the vulnerabilities on March 2, the company said.</p>
<p>Microsoft published security fixes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">last week</a>, but the patches do not expel the hackers from already breached servers. Both the FBI and CISA, the federal government&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit, have warned that the vulnerabilities present a major risk to businesses across the United States.</p>
<p>John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at FireEye&#8217;s Mandiant threat intelligence unit, said he anticipates more ransomware groups trying to cash in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though many of the still unpatched organizations may have been exploited by cyber espionage actors, criminal ransomware operations may pose a greater risk as they disrupt organizations and even extort victims by releasing stolen emails,&#8221; said Hultquist.</p>

<p>The trend continues to be strong; in February alone, growth companies like Bemobi, Westwing, Mobly and Mosaico went public. Mosaico, for example, was <a href="https://braziljournal.com/por-que-o-ipo-da-mosaico-foi-coisa-de-nasdaq">20x oversubscribed and went up 70% on its first trading day</a>. The same is true for other companies like Meliuz, Enjoei and Neogrid, up 173%, 53% and 74%, respectively, since their listing just a few months ago.</p>
<p>But what is even more surprising is that now, new special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are raising money in Nasdaq with a mandate to buy Latin American private growth companies, which would be completely unthinkable just a year ago.</p>
<p>The opportunity for SPAC mergers in the <a href="https://stockmarketmba.com/listofshellcompanies.php#:~:text=List%20of%20Shell%20Companies%20or%20Special%20Purpose%20Acquisition%20Companies%20(',These%20securities%20are%20common%20stocks.">U.S. has become quite competitive, as almost 300 SPACs</a>, which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/how-financing-spac-takeovers-became-wall-streets-new-favorite-trade.html">raised over $90 billion, </a>are now competing to find deals before the deadline. As a result, it has become more common to see SPACs with global mandates seeking to acquire foreign growth companies and list them in the U.S. to benefit from better multiples.</p>
<p>Just in 2021, <a href="https://braziljournal.com/por-que-o-ipo-da-mosaico-foi-coisa-de-nasdaq">eight Asian-sponsored SPACs raised over $2.3 billion</a> in the Nasdaq/New York Stock Exchange, already surpassing the entire volume of 2020. More recently, it looks like the activity level may pick up in Brazil, and, potentially, in other Latin American countries, <a href="https://neofeed.com.br/negocios/spacs-a-brasileira-devem-captar-mais-de-us-11-bilhao-e-essa-febre-esta-so-no-comeco/">with $1.1 billion of Brazil-focused SPACs coming into fruition.</a><div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW has joined the cohort of investors that are backing Boston Metal&#8217;s carbon dioxide-free production technology for steel.</p>
<p>The Boston-based startup had targeted a $50 million raise earlier in the year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/looking-to-decarbonize-the-metal-industry-bill-gates-backed-boston-metal-raises-50-million/">as TechCrunch reported</a>, and BMW&#8217;s addition closes out that round, according to a person familiar with the company.</p>

<p>Through a commitment from BMW iVentures, the automaker&#8217;s investment arm, Boston Metal will have an in to a company with massive demands for more sustainably manufactured metal. For instance, BMW Group press plants in Europe process more than half a million tonnes of steel per year, the company said.</p>
<p>“We systematically identify the raw materials and components in our supplier network with the highest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from production,&#8221; said Dr. Andreas Wendt, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for purchasing and the supplier network, in a statement. &#8220;Steel is one of them, but it is vital to car production. For this reason, we have set ourselves the goal of continuously reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the steel supply chain. By 2030, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be about two million tonnes lower than today’s figure.”</p>
<p>Conventional steel production requires blast furnaces that generate carbon dioxide emissions, but using Boston Metal&#8217;s process, an electrolysis cell produces the pig iron that gets processed into steel, the company said.</p>
<p>The addition of BMW to its investor group, which already includes Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and other strategic and financial investors, caps the fundraising process with another corporate partner wielding incredible industry influence.</p>
<p>“Our investors span across the steel value chain, from the upstream mining and iron ore companies to the downstream end customer, and validate Boston Metal’s innovative process to produce high-quality steel, cost competitively and at scale,&#8221; said chief executive officer and founder, Tadeu Carneiro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to an SEC investigation and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">resignation of its founder</a>, is targeting another electric vehicle company. This time it&#8217;s Lordstown Motors, the Ohio electric automaker that went public after merging with special-purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Hindenburg said in a report Friday that it has taken a short position on Lordstown Motors, causing shares to plummet 21%. Shares have recovered slightly and are now down about 15% from the previous day&#8217;s trade. Hindenburg&#8217;s short position is based on a company that it says has &#8220;no revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/">report issued</a> Friday, Hindenburg disputes that the company has booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller says that &#8220;extensive research reveals that the company’s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.&#8221; The firm goes further and alleges that Lordstown founder and CEO Steve Burns paid consultants for every truck pre-order as early as 2016 while he was leading Workhorse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The report also provides photos and a 911 call of an incident in January when a Lordstown prototype vehicle burst into flames during a test drive.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> A Lordstown Motors spokesperson responded to TechCrunch on Friday afternoon. “We will be sharing a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report,&#8221; the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>In comments to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ev-startup-lordstown-motors-is-targeted-by-short-seller-hindenburg-research-shares-fall-16-11615569913">Wall Street Journal</a>, Burns said the report contained &#8220;half-truths and lies&#8221; and that it was an attempt by Hindenburg to hurt its stock ahead of its first quarterly earnings report as a publicly traded company.</p>
<div class="paywall">
<p>The startup <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-sells-lordstown-plant-that-became-flash-point-for-trump-uaw-11573160818?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is named for the Ohio town</a> where the company purchased a dormant former <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM">General Motors</a><span class="company-name-type"> Co.</span> assembly plant in 2019. As a result of that deal, GM acquired a small stake in Lordstown Motors.</p>
</div>
<p>Lordstown has an interesting history for company that is less than two years old. Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of Burns’ other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors.</p>
<p>Workhorse is itself a small company that was founded in 1998 and has struggled financially at various points in its lifetime. Most recently, Workhorse lost a bid to become the supplier of electric vehicles to the U.S. Postal Service, which caused shares to fall nearly 15% in the days following the news. Workhorse shares are now hovering around $16.58, down 60% from its record price of $42.96 reached February 4.</p>
<p>Lordstown Motors acquired a 6.2 million-square-foot factory from GM in 2019. The company has said it plans to produce 20,000 electric commercial trucks annually, starting in 2021, at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Lordstown revealed its Endurance electric pickup in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/lordstown-debuts-a-52500-electric-pickup-alongside-a-campaigning-mike-pence/">splashy and political-leaning ceremony</a> in June 2020. At the time, the company didn’t provide details on the interior, performance or battery of its planned electric pickup truck. The entire second half of the event took a 90-degree turn away from the truck and centered on its special guest, former Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke for 25 minutes about former President Trump’s policies on jobs and manufacturing, China and the COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>Despite those lack of details, Burns told the crowd in June that it had received 20,000 pre-orders. That would mean the entire first year of production would be locked in if every customer who pre-ordered the truck followed through and bought the vehicle. Lordstown Motors said, at the time, that a number of potential customers had sent letters of intent, including AutoFlexFleet, Clean Fuels Ohio, Duke Energy, FirstEnergy, GridX, Holman Enterprises and ARI, Summit Petroleum, Turner Mining Group and Valor Holdings, as well as several Ohio municipalities.</p>
<p>Burns later said pre-orders had reached 100,000. Hindenburg disputes those claims.</p>
<p>From the Hindenburg report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our research has revealed that Lordstown&#8217;s order book consists of fake or entirely non-binding orders, from customers that generally do not even have fleets of vehicles. According to former employees and business partners, CEO Steve Burns sought to book orders, regardless of quality, purely as a tool to raise capital and confer legitimacy. In addition, we show how, in desperation to claim there was demand for the proposed vehicle, he paid for customers to book valueless, non-binding pre-orders.</p>
<p>We detail conversations with Lordstown &#8220;customers&#8221; who were eager to explain that the letters of intent (&#8220;LOI&#8221;s) with the company were &#8220;promotional&#8221;. Others assured us they were &#8220;not committed to anything&#8221; and that the pre-order commitment size recorded by Lordstown was &#8220;totally impossible&#8221;. One CEO at a &#8216;key&#8217; customer told us our outreach was the first he had heard of any arrangement with Lordstown.</p></blockquote>
<p>Burns did confirm to the WSJ that Lordstown paid consultants to generate preorders that were understood to be nonbinding. He explained that this was to &#8220;assess market demand.&#8221; Burns denied that the practice misrepresented the company&#8217;s preorder book.</p>

<p>US-based FJ Labs has joined TaxDown&#8217;s investment board as it closes the seed round. It says all its previous investors participated in the round, including James Argalas (Presidio Union); Abac Nest, Abac’s venture capital business; Baldomero Falcones, the former Chairman at Mastercard; and the founders of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/">Jobandtalent</a>, Juan Urdiales and Felipe Navío (another Madrid-based startup).</p>

<p>For the past three years TaxDown been offering a service in Spain but is now eyeing international expansion, as well as further growth in its home market.</p>
<p>Last year, it says it managed more than €29M in taxes for users &#8212; delivering savings of €4M+ to users.</p>
<p>Its target is to hit 500,000 users in Spain this year. While international expansion is planned for the second half of 2021, with TaxDown saying it&#8217;s focused on other European and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning, our ambition has been to help people fill in their taxes all over the world. That is why we developed our proprietary software/tax language that allows a tax expert with no coding capabilities to translate the tax law into calculation and logic that can be interpreted by our backend seamlessly,&#8221; says Enrique García, CEO and co-founder. &#8220;This tax language allowed us to launch in Spain in 4 months with only one tax consultant. We are confident that we can launch a new country in only 6 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax filing process is far from being simple,&#8221; he goes on, explaining how its tech simplifies income tax filing in Spain. &#8220;Currently, when using the Spanish Tax Agency tax-filling tool, taxpayers need to manually apply deductions on their tax forms. The problem is, with national regional deductions being different in each region in Spain, taxpayers often do not even know they’re entitled to those deductions. Thus, by not applying them to their tax form, they lose money. What TaxDown does is leverage the advanced Spanish Tax Agency technology, which offers an API to request the financial data related to a taxpayer &#8212; always with prior authorization from the user &#8212; with 2.000+ datapoints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we have that, our algorithm &#8216;RITA&#8217; is capable of understanding the user’s personal and financial data, select the optimum questions that the user needs to answer &#8212; an average of 9 over a database of 3.000+ &#8211; and precisely calculate the tax return, with no errors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is the heart of TaxDown,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Besides our algorithm RITA that has been trained with over 40.000+ tax returns, today we also use AI to help our ‘taxers’ with tips on how to lower future tax bills, and we have started working on live income tax simulation for our users throughout the entire year.&#8221;</p>
<p>García says TaxDown calculated more than 42,000 tax returns last year with a team of just two in-house tax experts &#8212; thanks to proprietary internal tools which allow them to handle this scale (by being &#8220;80x more efficient than the Spanish average&#8221;, as he puts it). He adds that further efficiency gains are expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have developed a machine-learning tool that flags the tax returns that need to be reviewed before filing based on historical data. Thus, we continuously increase the percentage of tax returns that are automatically submitted with no manual intervention,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, adding: &#8220;Thanks to this feature, we expect to improve our efficiency at least 5x versus last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to García, TaxDown has never had any filings rejected for inaccuracies because he says its algorithms continually run tests and validate the information with the authorities. &#8220;Furthermore, our technology can flag errors in real time in case that there is a discrepancy, so our tax experts can manually check the tax return form if needed,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Its business model &#8212; currently &#8212; is a sort of twist on freemium, in that it will only charge users if the income tax savings it calculates for them exceed €35.</p>
<p>García says that so far an average of three out of 10 users see financial savings from using its tool &#8212; but he suggests it&#8217;s not only savings that motivate users; he says they also want reassurance that they are taking &#8220;the best approach with their taxes: doing them effortlessly, correctly, with all the guarantees, tapping for experts’ live help at any time, ensuring the best result they can get, and of course knowing that we have their backs in case of an audit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given that wider relationship it&#8217;s building with users, TaxDown sees potential to evolve its business model by expanding to offer additional fintech services, such as financial advice, in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision goes far beyond income tax return preparation, we believe that tax data is becoming one of the most valuable data assets for people (take Trump’s tax returns for example), and we want to assess our ’taxers’ based on the best and more qualitative information that we can get,&#8221; says García. &#8220;Therefore, in the future we want to be a trusted financial advisor not just for taxes, but for personal finances as well. We believe we are well positioned to be an intermediary between our users and financial institutions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2021 kicked off, I reformulated a series of posts we published last year focused on startups that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">had reached the $100 million ARR (annual recurring revenue) mark</a>. In our refreshed effort, we cut the target in half and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">dug up companies around the $50 million ARR threshold</a>. The goal was to figure out what those firms were going through as they reached material scale, not after they had achieved effective pre-IPO status.</p>
<p>And the results were a bit medium.</p>
<p>While it was fun to chat with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/how-2-startups-scaled-to-50m-arr-and-beyond/">OwnBackup, Assembly</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">SimpleNexus and PicsArt</a>, ultimately we were getting similar notes from each company: Hiring is incredibly important as a company scales, founders have to cede decision-making, and as startups grow from $30 million ARR to $50 million or more, they must harden internal systems and build business infrastructure.</p>

<hr />
<p>All that made sense, but it wasn&#8217;t entirely scintillating. I meant to keep the project going; I had publicly made noise about the effort and had a few interviews in the bag that were collecting dust (and emails from various PR folks).</p>
<p>But they wound up in the Google Docs graveyard as the news cycle somehow managed to keep accelerating, meaning that the time required to execute the somewhat effort-intensive series dried up as I held on for dear life as the early, middle, late and IPO-stage startup market stormed.</p>

<p>For now, I&#8217;m hitting pause on the $50 million ARR series and whatever might have come from the $100 million ARR legacy effort. I may bring it back at some point, but for now, there are just more pressing and interesting things to work on.</p>
<p>What follows is what I <em>believe</em> to be the remainder of my notes from interviews that never saw the light of day. So, one last time, let&#8217;s discuss some big startups that are scaling quickly: <a href="https://www.appspace.com/">Appspace</a>, <a href="https://www.synack.com/">Synack </a>and <a href="https://www.druva.com/">Druva</a>. We&#8217;ll proceed in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2>Appspace</h2>
<p>The Exchange caught up with Appspace a bit ago, chatting with a few of its executives, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottchao/">CMO Scott Chao</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-miles-549b17/">CEO Brandon Miles</a>. It&#8217;s an interesting company that sells a software platform that powers in-office displays and kiosks. You&#8217;ve seen office sign-in screens at a welcome desk, screens outside conference rooms showing how booked they are, or company messaging and the like on various large screens? That&#8217;s what Appspace&#8217;s software does.</p>
<p>And the company has an interesting vibe. Unlike nearly every other startup I&#8217;ve met, Appspace doesn&#8217;t think it is saving the world. In our chat, the company joked that its culture is to move quickly, but with the cognizance that they aren&#8217;t curing cancer.</p>
<p>Such modesty might feel odd, but it was actually refreshing. Appspace&#8217;s job is to white-label itself, let its customers speak to their workers through its various apps (including mobile) and services, and simply feature rock-solid uptime.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">St. Louis-based voice assistant startup <a href="https://www.disruptel.com">Disruptel</a> is announcing that it has raised $1.1 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The money comes from an impressive group of investors who seem well-aligned with what the startup is aiming to do — namely, build a voice assistant that can provide detailed information about what’s happening on your TV screen. Those investors include PJC and Progress Ventures (which led the round), along with DataXu co-founder and former CEO Mike Baker, Siri co-founder Adam Cheyer, Sky executive Andrew Olson and DataXu co-founder Bill Simmons.</p>
<p>Disruptel CEO Alex Quinn told me that he began to pursue the idea in high school — the initial idea was more focused on TV gesture controls, but he decided that there was a bigger opportunity in the fact that “smart TVs don’t know what’s going on on their own screen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So he said Disruptel has built technology that has “a contextual understanding of everything that’s happening on the screen — every product, all of that data.” So for example, you could use the technology to ask your TV, “Who is the person in the brown shirt?”</p>

<p>Quinn’s description reminded me of Amazon’s X-Ray technology, which can tell you about the actors on-screen, as well as additional trivia about whatever movie or TV you’re watching on Amazon Prime. But he said that Amazon’s solution (as well as a similar one from Google) involves “static data — the videos have all been pre-processed.” With Disruptel, on the other hand, “everything is happening in real time,” which means it could theoretically work with any piece of content.</p>
<p>Disruptel’s flagship product Context is a voice assistant designed to work with smart TVs and their remotes. Quinn said he’s hoping to partner with smart TV manufacturers and streaming services and get this into the hands of viewers in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company has already created <a href="https://www.disruptel.com/smartscreen">a Smart Screen extension</a> for Google Chrome that you can try right now (using the extension, I successfully identified the actors on-screen during multiple scenes of an episode of “The Flash”). Quinn said the company is using the extension as way to test the product and gather engagement data.</p>
<p>Baker (who sold his adtech company dataxu to Roku in 2019)  said that he was convinced to back the company after seeing a demo of the product: &#8220;It was interesting to see the power, the fluidity of the experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also suggested that Disruptel’s tech creates new opportunities to improve on the smart TV advertising experience, which he described as largely consisting of “crap” — though he also pointed to Hulu as an example of a service that can be successful with “non-intrusive advertising and interstitial ads.”</p>
<p>Asked how a high school student could create this kind of technology, Quinn (who is now 21) said, “We had to learn. Our team is very focused on machine learning, and our machine learning engineers were reading research paper after research paper. We think that we have found the best research solutions.”</p>
<p>He added that if Disruptel had followed the leads of the big players and focused on pre-processing content, “We would never even have begun that journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse have already received public support from Democratic politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders to Joe Biden, the latter of whom promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen,” late last year. Now, as many look to unionize, the team is getting some political backing from a more unexpected place.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/12/amazon-union-not-helping-working-class-economy-column/6947823002/">op-ed penned for USA Today</a>, Marco Rubio threw support behind the workers, in spite of “dangers posed by the unchecked influence of labor unions.” The Florida Senator notes Republicans&#8217; historical tendency of siding with management, but adds “the days of conservatives being taken for granted by the business community are over.”</p>
<p>The piece is hardly a full-throated embrace of labor unions in general, which have traditionally allied themselves with the political left. Rubio hedges slightly in the beginning noting that conflicts between unions and management “are wrong for both workers and our nation’s economic competitiveness,” but the politician cites “uniquely malicious corporate behavior.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rubio writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s my standard: When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers. And that’s why I stand with those at Amazon’s Bessemer warehouse today.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to addressing long-standing complaints against Amazon workplace conditions, the piece embraces some long-standing Republican culture war complaints. “Today it might be workplace conditions,” he says, “but tomorrow it might be a requirement that the workers embrace management’s latest ‘woke’ human resources fad.”</p>
<p>Politics and labor relations, it seems, make strange bedfellows. Though while organizers have often been on the left, the goal of unions (however you may feel about them in practice) is to protect the conditions of workers, regardless of political affiliation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HYw6Q4z8vZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize/">Amazon warehouse workers to begin historic vote to unionize</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon warehouse workers to begin historic vote to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize/embed/#?secret=HYw6Q4z8vZ" data-secret="HYw6Q4z8vZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A number of lawmakers have traveled to Alabama to show support for workers at the warehouse, including Cori Bush, Jamaal Bowman, Andy Levin, Terri Sewell and Nikema Williams. Workers at the warehouse, which employs around 6,000, kicked off a mail-in vote on February 7. The balloting ends later this month.</p>
<p>Ultimately, high-profile support may be a net positive for workers when it comes to pressuring a company. Union organizers sometimes caution against taking too much stock in such comments, however.</p>
<p>Asked about Biden’s support in a recent conversation with TechCrunch, NYU fellow, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/the-rise-of-the-tech-workers-union-and-what-comes-next/">Clarissa Redwine noted</a>, “First and foremost, it’s really important to remember that the things that people in power say do not matter. All of the power that you have doesn’t come from people at the top giving it to you. It comes from linking arms with the people next to you and taking that power and influence for yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, offered TechCrunch the following comment, “We welcome support from all quarters. Senator Rubio&#8217;s support demonstrates that the best way for working people to achieve dignity and respect in the workplace is through unionization. This should not be a partisan issue.”</p>
