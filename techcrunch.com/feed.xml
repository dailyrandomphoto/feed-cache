										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://onesoil.ai/en/">OneSoil</a>, a company selling technology to help farmers monitor fields and increase yields, has raised $5 million from international investors Almaz Capital and PortfoLion.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tech integrates satellite imagery with mobile and desktop applications for farming analytics. These offerings include both remote crop monitoring, variable-rate seed and fertilizer applications that can reduce the time spent on field scouting and improve efficiency as it relates to inputs.</p>
<p>OneSoil already has more than 200,000 farmers and consultants using its service across over 180 countries just two and a half years after its launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that roughly 5% of the world&#8217;s total arable land (197 mln acres) is covered by OneSoil users, which include major ag companies like BASF and Krone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing from Almaz and PortfoLion will be used to expand on its market position in the Americas and Europe, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to help farmers make informed decisions for their agricultural operations, reduce input waste, and increase their profits. To do that, we provide digital tools that combine real-time, global-scale satellite imagery processing for the best analytics and insights for our users,&#8221; says Slava Mazai, CEO at OneSoil, in a statement. &#8220;We aim to build the biggest digital platform for informed solutions and precision agriculture. To move faster down this path, we will hire tech and marketing professionals in Europe and the CIS, and we&#8217;re looking for consultants and business partners in the field of agronomy in North and South America&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For Almaz investor, Pavel Bogdanov, it was the company&#8217;s impressive adoption rates among farmers that convinced the firm to invest in the OneSoil round. &#8220;[F</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">armers&#8217;] adoption of new tools has been slow due to the complexity of the products, cost, and a degree of risk aversion among farmers. At least, we thought adoption was slow before we met OneSoil. OneSoil is very popular with farmers; the growth in global usage was so impressive that we decided to invest in OneSoil to help them add even more valuable solutions for farmers&#8221;, said Bogdanov, in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprises are adopting an ever-wider range of SaaS applications to work and interface with customers, and that is proving to be a major security concern: it&#8217;s not just the prospect of phishing, credential stuffing and other malicious tricks to get into systems that are a worry, but the fact that more applications mean more attack surfaces, and more integrations between apps mean more inadvertent holes that get exposed in the process.</p>
<p>And that is leading to surge of interest in security applications that can help. Today, a startup called <a href="https://appomni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppOmni</a> &#8212; which has built a platform to help monitor SaaS apps and their activity, provide guidance to warn or block when things might go wrong, and fix problems when they do occur &#8212; is announcing some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p>The startup has raised $40 million in a Series B round led by Scale Venture Partners, with Salesforce Ventures and ServiceNow Ventures, as well as previous backers ClearSky, Costanoa Ventures, Inner Loop Capital and Silicon Valley Data Capital also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the back of a huge year for AppOmni. The company grew 900%, co-founder and CEO Brendan O&#8217;Connor told TechCrunch, and it has managed to stay at 100% customer retention &#8212; that is, AppOmni has yet to lose a single customer since it was founded.</p>
<p>The company today integrates with over 100 connectors, platforms used by developers and IT teams at companies to manage the apps that their businesses use, tools Splunk and Sumo Logic. Through this, AppOmni is able to aggregate and normalize event data around those apps, in addition to deeper monitoring in cases where it can integrate with apps themselves (those integrations to date include some of the most popular apps that enterprises use today, including Salesforce and Slack, Zoom, Microsoft 365, Box and Github).</p>
<p>As O&#8217;Connor describes it, the sheer number of apps that enterprise teams use and adopt has made managing security around them very complex. Partly because of how SaaS is set up for usage by as many people in and outside the organization as possible (to make the apps more useful), AppOmni estimates that some 95% of enterprises &#8220;overprovision&#8221; permissions for external users.</p>
<p>On top of that, some of the biggest problems occur indirectly, specifically when applications are linked up together, creating a flow of sensitive data. AppOmni says that some 55% of companies have sensitive data living in SaaS systems that has been inadvertently exposed to the anonymous internet, sitting there completely unguarded, in this way. (See <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zack&#8217;s story here</a> for a recent example of how this can play out.)</p>
<p>This is an issue, he said, that is unique to SaaS, which he describes different architecturally to any software that companies might have used in the past. &#8220;There is no operating system, no network that is exposed to customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The idea is that AppOmni provides a dashboard to make that monitoring much less murky. &#8220;One of our customers described using AppOmni as being akin to turning a light on in a dark room,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor and his co-founder, Brian Soby (the CTO), have first-hand knowledge of the challenges of securing SaaS applications: both spent years at Salesforce &#8212; with O&#8217;Connor the company&#8217;s SVP and &#8220;chief trust officer&#8221;, a role he left to join ServiceNow as its security CTO, before leaving there to co-found AppOmni with Soby.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s partly that track record, along with AppOmni&#8217;s own track record, that has given the startup the attention that it has from investors. Interestingly, Scale came to know AppOmni not over a coffee or a pitch deck, but as one of those satisfied customers, which eventually led the VC to offer to invest.</p>
<p>“Scale Venture Partners became an AppOmni customer in 2020. We know firsthand how powerful and differentiated the AppOmni product when it comes to protecting our sensitive SaaS data, and we’re excited to now be both a customer and an investor,” said Ariel Tseitlin, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, in a statement. “AppOmni’s 9x growth last year, driven by the acquisition of customers across a wide range of industries, proves that AppOmni is the market leader in the increasingly important SaaS Security Management market. We expect the momentum to continue in 2021 and beyond as companies accelerate their shift to cloud applications to support their larger remote workforces.”</p>
<p>The company has raised $53 million to date, and it is not disclosing valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://authzed.com/">Authzed</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to build permissions in their applications, announced a $3.9 million seed round today. The investment was led by Work-Bench with participation from Y Combinator and Amplify Partners.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Jake Moshenko says the service is an API that is designed to help developers quickly add permissions to an application. &#8220;Authzed is a platform to store, compute and validate application permissions. So based on our experience at Google and Red Hat and Amazon, we think that this is the proper way that companies should be doing application permissions,&#8221; Moshenko told me.</p>
<p>The way the service works is by helping to define groups of users, and based on the membership of a given group, defining what data they can see and what functions they have permissions to access. While it may rely on Active Directory or LDAP as the basis of permissions groups, he says that it simplifies the actual permissions implementation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So, by itself Active Directory doesn&#8217;t actually fully solve the problem. You still have to bind to that group membership to a set of permissions that it implies. With our system, you can actually unify the way that you talk about both the permissions and group members,&#8221; Moshenko said.</p>

<p>The company has built out the framework for the service, But Moshenko says the links to Active Directory and other directory services are on the road map. For now, they have been working with design partners to get the basics of the product down, and today the company is opening the service for any developer who wants to use it.</p>
<p>For starters, it will be free, but over time he expects they will have pricing tiers. He likens his service to other API companies like Twilio for communications or Stripe for payments and expects the cost will be low when an application is just starting out and then go up over time as it gets more popular and needs to check the permissions more regularly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days for the company and other than the three co-founders, they have just one employee. The plan is to hire additional engineers using the money from this round, while trying to build traction in the developer community for the product. He says that the number of new employees they add this year will really depend on how well the product is doing in the market.</p>
<p>The founders previously founded Quay, a private registry for Docker containers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/coreos-acquires-quay-io-to-launch-its-private-docker-repository/">they sold to CoreOS in 2014</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Cadillac Lyriq, the all-electric crossover and flagship of GM&#8217;s luxury brand, will start at a skosh under $60,000 when it comes to the U.S. market in early 2022.</p>
<p>The price, which doesn&#8217;t include destination charges, is one of the last remaining details to be shared about the production version of the Lyriq. GM first revealed a showcar version of the Lyriq back in August. On Wednesday, the automaker announced the pricing along with the final specifications of the production vehicle.</p>
<p>The Lyriq is just one in a roster of 30 electric vehicles that GM plans to bring to market by 2025. It will be a critical one for Cadillac and aims to set the benchmark for the brand that has seen lagging sales. The big message from GM: this car is coming soon, messaging that includes an invitation to customers to place order reservations beginning in September 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Cadillac Lyriq was supposed to go into production in the U.S. in late 2022, but executives said that virtual development tools and along with the underlying flexible Ultium platform used in the vehicle allowed the brand to speed up development.</p>
<p>The Ultium electric architecture and Ultium batteries will be used in a broad range of products across GM&#8217;s Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands, as well as the Cruise Origin autonomous shuttle. This modular architecture will be capable of 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, 400-volt and 800-volt packs with storage ranging from 50 kWh to 200 kWh, and front, rear and all-wheel drive configurations.</p>

<p>The rear-wheel drive Lyriq will be equipped with a 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack that can travel more than 300 miles based on Cadillac&#8217;s internal estimates. The EPA estimates have yet to be shared. The Lyriq will be able to handle fast charging at 190 kW, which translates to an estimated 76 miles of range in about 10 minutes of charging time. For home charging, there&#8217;s a 19.2 kW charging module, which can add up to 52 miles of range per hour of charge, the company said.</p>
<p>The vehicle aims to ooze luxury, a look that GM tries to achieve with exterior and interior touches like the &#8220;black crystal&#8221; grille, 33-inch vertical LED touchscreen display and AKG sound system. The vehicle has fast roofline and wide stance that is meant to give it a modern and even aggressive-looking look. That &#8220;black crystal&#8221; grille is a dynamic feature with &#8220;choreographed&#8221; LED lighting that greets the owner as they approach the vehicle. The LED lighting continues in the rear with a split taillamp design.</p>
<p>The vehicle will be offered in two exterior and interior colors. On the outside, the vehicle can come in satin steel metallic or stellar black metallic paint and sky cool gray or noir for the interior. Cadillac adds in laser etched patterns through wood over metal décor to complete the interior look.</p>

<p>The Lyriq will also offer Super Cruise, GM&#8217;s hands-free driver assistance system, which combines lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>Like the GM&#8217;s Chevy Bolt, the Lyriq will offer what it describes as one pedal driving. Electric vehicles typically have a regenerative braking feature. In the Lyriq, drivers are able to control how quickly the vehicle slows down or comes to a complete stop using a pressure-sensitive paddle located on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>The vehicle will be produced at GM&#8217;s Spring Hill, Tennessee assembly facility. GM has said it is investing $2 billion into the plant to support electric vehicle production. The automaker and its joint venture partner LG energy Solution also announced in April plans to invest $2.3 billion to build a battery cell manufacturing plant at next to the Spring Hill assembly plant.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European Union lawmakers have presented their risk-based proposal for regulating high risk applications of artificial intelligence within the bloc&#8217;s single market.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have presented their <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-approach-artificial-intelligence">risk-based proposal</a> for regulating high risk applications of artificial intelligence within the bloc&#8217;s single market.</p>
<p>The plan includes prohibitions on a small number of use-cases that are considered too dangerous to people&#8217;s safety or EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights, such as a China-style social credit scoring system or certain types of AI-enabled mass surveillance.</p>
<p>Most uses of AI won&#8217;t face any regulation (let alone a ban) under the proposal but a subset of so-called &#8220;high risk&#8221; uses will be subject to specific regulatory requirements, both ex ante and ex post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are also transparency requirements for certain use-cases &#8212; such as chatbots and deepfakes &#8212; where EU lawmakers believe that potential risk can be mitigated by informing users that they are interacting with something artificial.</p>
<p>The overarching goal for EU lawmakers is to foster public trust in how AI is implemented to help boost uptake of the technology. Senior Commission officials talk about wanting to develop an excellence ecosystem that&#8217;s aligned with European values.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we aim to make Europe world-class in the development of a secure, trustworthy and human-centered Artificial Intelligence, and the use of it,&#8221; said Commission EVP, Margrethe Vestager, announcing adoption of the proposal at a press conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, our regulation addresses the human and societal risks associated with specific uses of AI. This is to create trust. On the other hand, our coordinated plan outlines the necessary steps that Member States should take to boost investments and innovation. To guarantee excellence. All this, to ensure that we strengthen the uptake of AI across Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the proposal, mandatory requirements are attached to a &#8220;high risk&#8221; category of applications of AI &#8212; meaning those that<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> present a clear safety risk or threaten to impinge on </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN">EU fundamental rights</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (such as the right to non-discrimination).</span></p>
<p>Examples of high risk AI use-cases that will be subject to the highest level of regulation on use are set out in annex 3 of the regulation &#8212; which the Commission said it will have the power to expand by delegate acts, as use-cases of AI continue to develop and risks evolve.</p>
<p>For now cited high risk examples fall into the following categories: Biometric identification and categorisation of natural persons; Management and operation of critical infrastructure; Education and vocational training; Employment, workers management and access to self-employment; Access to and enjoyment of essential private services and public services and benefits; Law enforcement; Migration, asylum and border control management; Administration of justice and democratic processes.</p>
<p>Military uses of AI are specifically excluded from scope as the regulation is focused on the bloc&#8217;s internal market.</p>
<p>The makers of high risk applications will have a set of ex ante obligations to comply with before bringing their product to market, including around the quality of the data-sets used to train their AIs and a level of human oversight over not just design but use of the system &#8212; as well as ongoing, ex post requirements, in the form of post-market surveillance.</p>
<p>Other requirements include a need to create records of the AI system to enable compliance checks and also to provide relevant information to users. The robustness, accuracy and security of the AI system will also be subject to regulation.</p>
<p>Commission officials suggested the vast majority of applications of AI will fall outside this highly regulated category. Makers of those &#8216;low risk&#8217; AI systems will merely be encouraged to adopt (non-legally binding) codes of conduct on use.</p>
<p>Penalties for infringing the rules on specific AI use-case bans have been set at up to 6% of global annual turnover or €30M (whichever is greater). While violations of the rules related to high risk applications can scale up to 4% (or €20M).</p>
<p>Enforcement will involve multiple agencies in each EU Member State &#8212; with the proposal intending oversight be carried out by existing (relevant) agencies, such as product safety bodies and data protection agencies.</p>
<p>That raises immediate questions over adequate resourcing of national bodies, given the additional work and technical complexity they will face in policing the AI rules; and also how enforcement bottlenecks will be avoided in certain Member States. (Notably, the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation is also overseen at the Member State level and has suffered from lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement.)</p>
<p>There will also be an EU-wide database set up to create a register of high risk systems implemented in the bloc (which will be managed by the Commission).</p>
<p>A new body, called the European Artificial Intelligence Board (EAIB), will also be set up to support a consistent application of the regulation &#8212; in a mirror to the European Data Protection Board which offers guidance for applying the GDPR.</p>
<p>In step with rules on certain uses of AI, the plan includes measures to co-ordinate EU Member State support for AI development &#8212; such as by establishing regulatory sandboxes to help startups and SMEs develop and test AI-fuelled innovations &#8212; and via the prospect of targeted EU funding to support AI developers.</p>
<p>Internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said investment is a crucial piece of the plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under our Digital Europe and Horizon Europe program we are going to free up a billion euros per year. And on top of that we want to generate private investment and a collective EU-wide investment of €20BN per year over the coming decade &#8212; the &#8216;digital decade&#8217; as we have called it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also want to have €140BN which will finance digital investments under Next Generation EU [COVID-19 recovery fund] &#8212; and going into AI in part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaping rules for AI has been a key priority for EU president Ursula von der Leyen who took up her post at the end of 2019. A<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> white paper was published </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">last year</a>, following a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2018/EN/COM-2018-237-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF">2018 AI for EU strategy</a> &#8212; and Vestager said that today&#8217;s proposal is the culmination of three years&#8217; work.</p>
<p>Breton added that providing guidance for businesses to apply AI will give them legal certainty and Europe an edge. &#8220;Trust&#8230; we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,&#8221; he said. [Applications of AI] need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory &#8212; that is absolutely crucial &#8212; but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology&#8230; We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines &#8212; we&#8217;ll say &#8216;hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden&#8217;. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also in the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So come here &#8212; because artificial intelligence is about data &#8212; we&#8217;ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A version of today&#8217;s proposal </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/eu-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-set-fines-as-high-as-4-of-global-turnover-per-leaked-draft/">leaked last week</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; leading to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/">calls by MEPs to beef up the plan</a>, such as<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> by banning remote biometric surveillance in public places.</span></p>
<p>In the event the final proposal does treat remote biometric surveillance as a particularly high risk application of AI &#8212; and there is a prohibition in principal on the use of the technology in public by law enforcement.</p>
<p>However use is not completely proscribed, with a number of exceptions where law enforcement would still be able to make use of it, subject to a valid legal basis and appropriate oversight.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s proposal kicks off the start of the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process, with the European Parliament and Member States via the EU Council set to have their say on the draft &#8212; meaning a lot could change ahead of agreement on a final pan-EU regulation.</p>
<p>Commissioners declined to give a timeframe for when legislation might be adopted, saying only that they hoped the other EU institutions would engage immediately and that the process could be done asap. It could, nonetheless, be several years before the AI regulation is ratified and in force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As content moderation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/instagram-launches-tools-to-filter-out-abusive-dms-based-on-keywords-and-emojis-and-to-block-people-even-on-new-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues</a> to be a critical aspect of how social media platforms work &#8212; one that they may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/attorneys-general-from-twenty-states-call-on-facebook-to-do-more-to-fight-discrimination-disinformation-and-harrassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressured</a> to get right, or at least do better in tackling &#8212; a startup that has built a set of data and image models to help with that, along with any other tasks that require automatically detecting objects or text, is announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://thehive.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hive</a>, which has built a training data trove based on crowdsourced contributions from some 2 million people globally, which then powers a set of APIs that can be used to identify automatically images of objects, words and phrases &#8212; a process used not just in content moderation platforms, but also in building algorithms for autonomous systems, back-office data processing, and more &#8212; has raised $85 million in a Series D round of funding that the startup has confirmed values it at $2 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the heart of what we’re doing is building AI models that can help automate work that used to be manual,&#8221; said Kevin Guo, Hive&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;We’ve heard about RPA and other workflow automation, and that is important too but what that has also established is that there are certain things that humans should not have to do that is very structural, but those systems can&#8217;t actually address a lot of other work that is unstructured.&#8221; Hive&#8217;s models help bring structure to that other work, and Guo claims they provide &#8220;near human level accuracy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The funding is being led by Glynn Capital, with General Catalyst, Tomales Bay Capital, Jericho Capital, and Bain &amp; Company, and other unnamed investors participating. The company has now raised $121 million, making this latest round a particularly big leap. </span></p>
<p>The company has been somewhat under the radar since it was founded in 2017, in what appears to have been a pivot from founder Kevin Guo&#8217;s previous startup, a Q&amp;A platform that was called Kiwi, which itself was a product of a project out of his time at Stanford. But since then it has quietly picked up some interesting customers, including Reddit, Yubo, Chatroulette, Omegle, and Tango, along with NBCUniversal, Interpublic Group, Walmart, Visa, Anheuser-Busch InBev, and more. In all it has some 100 customers and has grown more than 300% in the last year.</p>
<p>Hive had its start with image identification, and working with companies building autonomous systems. In fact, if you talk with Guo over Zoom, chances are you&#8217;ll get a screenshot of some of that work as a background, with cars darting across Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>These days, however, most of Hive&#8217;s activity (pardon the pun) comes around moderation, some of which includes images, but others including text and streamed audio &#8212; which is converted into text and then moderated as that would be. (The autonomous car modelling is still used as a backdrop, I believe, because it&#8217;s a little less disturbing than a content moderation image, as you can see below.)</p>

<p>In part because it&#8217;s a very classic problem that you can imagine will be solved or helped with the use of AI, and in part because it&#8217;s such a big issue on the internet today, there are a number of other startups building platforms to help manage online abuse, including harassment, and to help with content moderation.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentropy-launches-tool-for-people-to-protect-themselves-from-social-media-abuse-starting-with-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentropy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Party</a>, <a href="https://l1ght.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L1ght</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectrum Labs</a>, not to mention a lot of tools being built in-house by big technology companies themselves. (Instagram for example launched its latest tools to help users combat abuse in DMs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/instagram-launches-tools-to-filter-out-abusive-dms-based-on-keywords-and-emojis-and-to-block-people-even-on-new-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just today</a>: it built the whole thing in-house, the company told me.)</p>
<p>But as Kevin Guo describes it, what has set Hive apart from the crowd has been the crowd, so to speak. Over the last several years, the company has slowly been building up a trove of data by crowdsourcing feedback from some 2 million users, who get paid &#8212; either in &#8216;normal&#8217; money or Bitcoin &#8212; to go through various images and items of text in order to identify &#8220;abuse&#8221; or other things. (Bitcoin started as a fringe offering and now accounts for the majority of how contributors get paid, Guo said.)</p>
<p>That database in turn powers a set of APIs used by Hive&#8217;s customers to help them run their own moderation tools, or whatever workflow requires frequent and rapid identification.</p>
<p>Most of the language learning in the system right now is based around English and several other popular global languages such as Spanish and French. Some of the funding will be used to help expand its reach and global coverage, including into a wider set of tongues. This is also leading to a wider set of use cases for the data and technology that Hive has built.</p>
<p>One of these, Guo said, includes a new approach to advertising that is based around serving ads associated with something you may have just read or seen on the screen. Very GDPR friendly because it involves absolutely no involvement of data based you or your online browsing activities (anonymised or not), this is picking up traction with brands who initially may have come to Hive to help protect their IP or reputation management, and are now considering how they can use the tool to spread the word about themselves in more effective ways.</p>
<p>The possibilities for how Hive&#8217;s AI can be used in the future, is part of what attracted the investment today. The focus on how it has been built in the cloud underscores that extensibility.</p>
<p>“Cloud computing has seen tremendous adoption in recent years, but only a small fraction of companies currently leverage cloud-based machine learning solutions,” said Charlie Friedland, principal at Glynn Capital, in a statement. “We believe cloud-hosted machine learning models will represent one of the most significant components of cloud growth in the years to come, and Hive is well-positioned as an early leader in the space.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable to me that for now at least Hive doesn&#8217;t disclose any big technology companies among its customers. That may partly be due to NDAs, but Guo points out that their in-house activities, which include heavy doses of human involvement, have made them somewhat less willing customers up to now. That could be changing however, not just because AI tools are improving, but because of the problems that have arisen from some of the current routes, such as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run of controversial stories</a> about social media content moderators and the traumas that they have faced.</p>
<p>In terms of future deals, those might come by way of some of Hive&#8217;s strategic backers and strategic partnerships. The company currently works with companies like Cognizant, Comscore and Bain (which is an investor), who in turn provide consulting and services to larger tech companies that have opted to outsource some of their human moderation work. Whether those human moderators shift up practices or not, chances are that tech will be playing an increasing role in the bigger process of trying to give more structure both to shaping and adhering to abuse policies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some of the most popular running apps are still lagging behind on security and privacy. That&#8217;s the verdict from security researchers who examined the leading running apps five years apart and found only a few apps had improved — and not by much.</p>
<p>Running apps know and learn a lot about you as you use them. Your health data, like your height and weight, are used to calculate how many calories you burn, and your location data can track your workout route from door-to-door.</p>
<p>But in the wrong hands, this data can identify where you live or where you work. In 2018, Strava said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/strava-simplify-privacy-options-review-features/">simplify its privacy features</a> to allow its users greater control over their data, after researchers found Strava app users were <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/strava-anonymized-fitness-tracking-data-government-opsec/">inadvertently sharing their workout data</a> and revealing military bases and secret government facilities.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at U.K. cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners say many of the top apps — Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Nike Run Club, and Runtastic — still <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/training-apps-have-their-privacy-settings-improved-in-5-years/ ">don&#8217;t use basic security measures</a> to prevent hackers from breaking in, or health and fitness data spilling out.</p>
<p>Only Runtastic had set a stronger password policy over the past five years, while the other apps still allow some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords">the most basic passwords</a> like &#8220;123456&#8221; and &#8220;password,&#8221; the researchers found in their testing. Malicious hackers often automate their attacks by targeting user accounts with known or easy-to-guess passwords. Worse, none of the apps allow users to set up two-factor authentication, a feature that puts an additional barrier in place to prevent malicious hackers from reusing stolen passwords. Data from Google shows even the simplest form of two-factor authentication <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/google-data-two-factor-security/">can prevent most</a> automated password reuse attacks.</p>
<p>We asked each of the app makers why they had not implemented two-factor authentication. None of the companies commented.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that while Runtastic, Nike Run Club, and MapMyRun had improved their privacy controls, Strava had seen &#8220;no significant change.&#8221;</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/training-apps-have-their-privacy-settings-improved-in-5-years/ ">their report</a>: &#8220;Strava and Runkeeper are configured to publicly share user data by default. It is possible to change these settings in the application, but it takes some time to find them and set them correctly, which is probably not the first consideration for a regular user.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nike Run Club, Runtastic and MapMyRun [were] found to have better privacy policy settings enabled, which means they do not share users’ data by default, like the other applications do. They only share your training information with friends or followers,&#8221; the report said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late-stage Fintech startup <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en">Pleo</a>, which offers expense management tools and ‘smart’ company Mastercards, says it plans to raise a Series C round of funding this summer. It’s also launching a B2B bill payments service this week.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jeppe Rindom told me via a call: “We have money until 2022, but we&#8217;ve seen incredible momentum in the past couple of quarters, and we are getting a lot of inbound interest so we will be fundraising a Series C round in the Summer and will be raising around $100 million.”</p>
<p>Pleo has raised $78.8 million to date. Its last funding round was $56M in May 2019. Its main investors include Speedinvest, Creandum, Kinnevik, Stripes and  Founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup competes on some levels with Dext, Soldo, Spendesk and Expensify.</p>
<p>Pleo is today launching Bills, a platform to consolidate, track and pay business-to-business bill payments and a supplier’s terms of service. It will offer free-of-charge domestic transfers.</p>
<p>Bills are automatically processed using Pleo’s OCR technology and cross-referenced for duplication and validated for authenticity before being approved for payment</p>
<p>In addition, it will offer approval control for admins and free domestic transfers.</p>
<p>Rindom added: “Since 66% of admins told us that they spent half their time on processing bills as well as authenticating the validity of them, it became our mission to simplify this complicated process and provide an end-to-end overview of it.”</p>
<p>Pleo was founded in Copenhagen in 2015 by Rindom and Niccolo Perra, who were early team members Tradeshift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses continue to adopt new digital tools to get their names out into the world, a startup that&#8217;s built a sales and marketing platform specifically for small and medium businesses is announcing a big round of funding. <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveCampaign</a>, which has built what it describes as a &#8220;customer experience automation&#8221; platform &#8212; providing a way not just to run digital campaigns but to follow up aspects of them automatically to make sales and marketing work more efficiently &#8212; has closed a $240 million round of funding. The Series C values the Chicago startup at over $3 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by a new, big-name investor, Tiger Global, with participation from another new backer Dragoneer, along with Susquehanna Growth Equity and Silversmith Capital Partners, which had both invested previously.</p>
<p>This funding round represents a huge leap for ActiveCampaign. It was only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/chicagos-activecampaign-raises-100m-for-an-all-in-one-marketing-and-sales-automation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2020 that it raised $100 million</a>, and before that, the company, which was founded in 2003, had only raised $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But as we have seen in many other ways, the pandemic resulted in a surge of interest among businesses to do more &#8212; a lot more &#8212; online than ever before, not least because so many people were spending more time at home, carrying out their consumer lives over the internet. That led to ActiveCampaign growing to a customer base of 145,000 customers, up from 90,000 16 months ago.</p>
<p>That points not just to the company already growing at a decent clip before the pandemic, but how it capitalized on that at a time when companies were looking for more tools to run their businesses in the new world.</p>
<p>The growth was not about ActiveCampaign throwing more money into business development, founder and CEO Jason VandeBoom said in an interview. &#8220;It was the network effect of people finding success. Even today, organic word of mouth is our primary driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tools fit into a wider overall trend in the world of business: automation, built on the back of new, cloud-based technology, is being adopted to carry out some of the less interesting and repetitive aspects of running a business.</p>
<p>In the case of sales, an example of what ActiveCampaign might provide is a way for an e-commerce business to identify when a logged-in customer (that is, a user who has an account already and is signed in) might have &#8216;abandoned&#8217; a visit to a site before buying a product that had already been searched for, or clicked on, or even added to a cart. In these cases, it sends an email to customers reminding them of those items, with options for other follow-ups, in the event that the choice was due to being distracted or having second thoughts that might be persuaded otherwise.</p>
<p>Users can opt-out of these, but they can be useful given the genuine distraction exercise that is browsing online &#8212; with all of the unrelated notifications, plus other options for considering a purchase. Tellingly, ActiveCampaign integrates with 850 different apps, a measure of just how fragmented the online landscape is, and also how many ways your attention might be distracted, or snagged depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Abandoned carts can cost a company, in aggregate, a lot of lost revenue, yet chasing those down is not the kind of task that a company would typically assign to a valuable employee to carry out. And that&#8217;s where companies like ActiveCampaign come in.</p>
<p>This, plus some 500 other actions like it around sales and marketing campaigns &#8212; Vandenboom calls them &#8220;recipes&#8221; &#8212; some of which have been contributed by ActiveCampaign&#8217;s own users, form the basis of the company&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>The marketing and sales automation market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars today, and, thanks to the rise of social media and simply more places to spend time online (and more time spent online) is expected to be <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-marketing-automation-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worth more than $8 billion by 2027</a>, so it&#8217;s going after a lucrative and much-used tool for doing business online. (And others are looking at it as well, of couse, including newer entrants like Shopify coming from a different angle to the same problem. Shopify today is a valued partner of the company, Vandeboom said when I asked him about it.)</p>
<p>That gives ActiveCampaign not just a big opportunity to continue targeting, but possibly also makes it a target itself, for an acquisition.</p>
<p>The other key aspect of ActiveCampaign&#8217;s growth that is worth watching is related to its customers. While the company has a client base that includes recognized names like the <a href="https://www.msichicago.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Museum of Science and Industry</a> based out of ActiveCampaign&#8217;s hometown, it also has <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some 145,000 others</a> across nearly 200 countries with a big emphasis on small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>SMBs form the vast majority of all businesses globally, collectively representing a huge win for tech companies that can capture them as customers. But traditionally, they have proven to be a challenging sector, given that they cover so many different verticals, are in many ways more price-sensitive than their enterprise-sized counterparts, among other factors.</p>
<p>So for ActiveCampaign to have found successful traction with SMBs &#8212; including with pricing that works for many of them (using it starts at $9 for accounts with less than 500 contacts) &#8212; is likely another reason why the startup has caught the eye of investors keen to back winning horses.</p>
<p>While the company did not need to raise money, Vandeboom said he &#8220;saw it as an opportunity to bring in more partners, saying that investors like how it purposely went after the idea of customer experience not on vertical or locale.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric scooters powered by <a href="https://www.gogoro.com/">Gogoro</a>’s swappable, rechargeable batteries now account <a href="https://www.gogoro.com/news/2019-25-of-total-taiwan">for nearly a quarter of monthly sales in Taiwan</a>, its home market. But one of the most frequent questions co-founder and chief executive officer Horace Luke gets asked is when will Gogoro launch its scooters in other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always said, ‘we’re getting ready, we’re getting ready, we’re getting ready,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. Gogoro answered that question today by announcing a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.heromotocorp.com/en-in/">Hero MotoCorp</a>, one of the world’s largest two-wheeled vehicle maker and <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/industry/top-10-two-wheeler-manufacturers-india-2020-market-share-hero-motocorp-honda-tvs-bajaj-royal-enfield/2174956/">the market leader in India</a>, where it is headquartered.</p>
<p>Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp’s agreement includes a joint venture to build a battery swapping network in India. Hero MotoCorp will also launch electric two-wheelers based on Gogoro technology under its own brand. This will mark the first time the company has launched electric vehicles. (The partnership is not to be confused with <a href="https://heroelectric.in/">Hero Electric</a>, which is run by relatives of Hero MotoCorp’s founders, but <a href="https://www.livemint.com/">is a separate company</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal will focus on India before expanding into Hero MotoCorp’s other markets (it serves a total of 40 countries). Details, like the first vehicle, launch cities and pricing, will be announced later, but Luke said Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp &#8220;are deploying very rapidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luke described the strategic partnership as a validation of Gogoro’s goal to become a battery swapping and smart mobility platform, packaging its technology as a turnkey solution for companies that want to produce energy-efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We designed our technology, capabilities and business model in the hope that one day we can solicit a giant like Hero,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>The first Gogoro Smartscooter was launched in 2015. Since then, it has struck partnerships with manufacturers like Yamaha, PGO and A-Motor to build electric scooters with its technology under their own brands, but Gogoro’s international rollout has been very gradual: for example, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/gogoro-launches-its-electric-scooters-for-businesses-in-south-korea/">delivery fleet in South Korea</a> and a partnership with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/coup-shuts-down-its-electric-moped-scooter-service/">now-defunct</a> scooter-sharing service Coup in Europe. Its first product launch in the United States was for Eeyo, its electric bike brand, instead of scooters.</p>

<p>Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp have been talking for more than a year and Luke described the the strategic partnership as one of the most important deals the company has made so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to make a massive change, we need really massive adoption, and Taiwan has served really well as a pilot market for us to develop technology, refine it and show the world that it is possible, through this swap-and-go technology rather than tethered plug-and-charge scenario, for lightweight personal mobility to take off,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>But India is obviously a much larger market, in terms of geography and population, than Taiwan. The Indian government wants to put more electric vehicles on the road <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/govt-aims-to-support-through-subsidies-62000-e-cars-buses-15l-electric-3-2-wheelers-gadkari/articleshow/80865193.cms?from=mdr">with subsidy programs</a>, and the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/indias-record-high-pump-prices-threaten-road-to-recovery-11614817160798.html">high cost of fuel in the country</a> is another incentive for people to make the switch from gas to electric. One major barrier for many consumers, however, is &#8220;range anxiety,&#8221; or concerns about how long their electric vehicle can run on a charge.</p>
<p>This is why Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp&#8217;s swapping station joint venture is important. In Taiwan, Gogoro now has more than 375,000 riders and 2,000 battery swapping/charging stations, which handle 265,000 swaps a day. That density is a key selling point because riders can find a nearby swapping station quickly through Gogoro’s smartphone app.</p>

<p>Gogoro’s batteries and charging stations are connected to its Gogoro Network cloud service, which monitors the condition of battery and manages how quickly they are charged. This allows the batteries to last longer&#8211;Luke said that the company has not retired any of its Smart Batteries in six years. Data from the Gogoro Network also shows the company where it needs to place more stations. In India, Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp will start with densely-populated areas, before adding stations based on demand, similar to Gogoro’s approach to its network in Taiwan.</p>
<p>After India, Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp plan to enter other markets, furthering Gogoro’s international expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is really important about this partnership is their influence on the two-wheel market, and the importance of the two-wheel market in emerging markets,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Hero MotoCorp chairman and CEO Dr. Pawan Munjal said the strategic partnership is an extension of the research and development has already put into creating an electric vehicle portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today marks another major milestone in our journey, as we bring Hero’s leadership in two-wheelers, our global scale and innovation powerhouse, with the leadership of Gogoro in the swapping business model, as they have demonstrated over the years in Taiwan and the rest of the world,&#8221; Munjal added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv’s <a href="http://www.orca-ai.io/">Orca AI</a>, a computer vision startup that can be retrofitted to cargo ships and improve navigation and collision avoidance, has raised $13 million in a Series A funding, taking its total raised to over $15.5 million. While most cargo ships carry security cameras, computer vision cameras are rare. Orca AI hopes its solution could introduce autonomous guidance to vessels already at sea.</p>
<p>There are over 4,000 annual marine incidents, largely due to human error. The company says this is getting worse as the Coronavirus pandemic makes it harder for regular crew changes. The recent events in the Suez Canal have highlighted how crucial this industry is.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by OCV Partners, with Principal Zohar Loshitzer joining Orca AI’s board. Mizmaa Ventures and Playfair Capital also featured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded by naval technology experts, Yarden Gross and Dor Raviv. The latter is an former Israel navy computer vision expert. Customers include Kirby, Ray Car Carriers and NYK.</p>
<p>Orca AI’s AI-based navigation and vessel tracking system supports ships in difficult to tricky to navigate situations and congested waterways, using vision sensors, thermal and low light cameras, plus algorithms that look at the environment and alert crews to dangerous situations.</p>
<p>On the raise, Yarden Gross, CEO, and co-founder said: “The maritime industry… is still far behind aviation with technological innovations. Ships deal with increasingly congested waterways, severe weather and low-visibility conditions creating difficult navigation experiences with often expensive cargo… Our solution provides unique insight and data to any ship in the world, helping to reduce these challenging situations and collisions in the future.” </p>
<p>Zohar Loshitzer, Principal from OCV added: “Commercial shipping has historically been a highly regulated and traditional industry. However, we are now “witnessing a positive change in the adoption of tech solutions to increase safety and efficiency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung announced Galaxy Upcycling a few years back, but has largely been quiet on that front, aside from some stage time at CES back in January. Today the company announced that Upcycling at Home is being opened to beta today for users in the U.S., Korea and the U.K.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty novel program, in a world where consumers are encouraged to scrap their old devices every two to three years for something shiny and new. The program is designed to breathe new life into handsets that might otherwise be tossed in a landfill or stashed away in a drawer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141393" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141393 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-Sound-Sensor.gif" alt="" width="1280" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are rethinking how we use existing resources, and we believe the key to upcycling is to enable solutions that transform old technology into something new by adding value,” VP Sung-Koo Kim said in a release tied to the news. “We are committed to integrating sustainable practices into our day-to-day lives, and through Galaxy Upcycling at Home, users can join our journey toward a more sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the products can be revamped into smart home devices, like childcare and pet monitors.</p>
<p>The feature can be accessed within the SmartThings Labs feature found in Samsung’s SmartThings App. When enabled, the product can send alerts when things like a crying baby or barking dog are detected. The recorded sound will be sent as part of the alert. Another feature uses built-in sensors to turn on a room&#8217;s lights when things get dark. The service will optimize device battery so it can operate for an extended period while detecting these inputs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Excel and Google Sheets can only address pure ‘number crunching’ in a limited way. A new UK startup, <a href="https://www.causal.app/">Causal</a> hopes to tackle this issue and has now raised a $4.2 million seed round led by Accel. Existing investors Coatue, Passion Capital, Verissimo Ventures, Naval Ravikant, Varadh Jain and others, also participated. The raise brings Causal&#8217;s total funding to $5.5 million, which the company will use to grow the engineering team and launch on Product Hunt next month.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that spreadsheets are crucial to normal business operations, there are multiple use cases for sales teams, finances teams etc, all of which are very different. Causal hopes to address these with a more data-driven, collaborative approach.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Taimur Abdaal and Lukas Koebis, Causal is &#8220;aiming to replace Excel&#8221; by starting with the spreadsheet&#8217;s foundation: formulas&#8221;. Causal says its formulas “read like plain English” such “as Profit = Revenue &#8211; Costs&#8221;  and also claims it typically takes “100x fewer formulas” in Causal to build exactly the same model in Excel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Business planning and forecasting should involve every team in a company, but the complexity of spreadsheets means that it’s often siloed within finance,” said Taimur Abdaal, CEO and co-founder in a statement. “We want to democratize this process with a truly horizontal product that every knowledge worker can use, and we’re excited to have Accel join us on the next phase of our journey.”</p>
<p>Over a call Abdaal told me: “We started really because we saw how difficult it is to actually work with numbers and spreadsheets. You have these esoteric formulas that are really hard to understand which is why something like 80% of spreadsheets have errors in them. Spreadsheets are also really disconnected from the other tools that companies use. Finance teams typically spend days with everyone manually pulling in data from accounting systems. So, these are some of the problems that we&#8217;re trying to solve. Right now we are a pretty small team of five, mostly engineers, and we&#8217;re really focused on building a very horizontal product that every team in a company can use for number crunching. As a seed investment it&#8217;s really, really nice because it lets us double down on some of the traction that we&#8217;ve gotten.”</p>
<p>“Many of us have felt the pain that comes with building and managing large spreadsheets across teams and data sources firsthand,” added Seth Pierrepont, Partner at Accel. “Taimur and Lukas are talented, product-focused founders who have taken the intuitive Excel-like interface that we’re all familiar with, and supercharged it with data integrations, collaboration features, and high-quality visualizations. Beyond that, they’ve leveraged their data science and mathematics backgrounds to offer sophisticated models out of the box, giving all users the ability to harness much more powerful predictive capabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra likes to describe itself as an API “super-connector” that creates a secure portal and process to exchange real-time financial information between customers, applications and banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faraashiru/">Fara Ashiru Jituboh</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/david-peterside-793297123">David Peterside</a> founded the company in June 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in January 2020, Okra has aggressively pushed by connecting to all banks in Nigeria and even claims to have a 99.9% guaranteed uptime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its business model provides integrations to developers and businesses into existing banking services and takes commissions off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These integrations include accounts authorization, balance, identity, income, payments and transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per partners (developers and businesses), they are well over 100 with some big names like Access Bank, Aella, Interswitch and uLesson</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashiru Jituboh tells TechCrunch that besides making APIs, Okra is in the business of selling &#8220;digital first-experiences and transformation&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are building an open finance infrastructure that enables developers and businesses to offer digital-first experiences and financial products,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re at a point where businesses are realizing that digital transformation is one of the most conversation happening in most boardrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for us, we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making tools and services needed to achieve digital transformation at scale with our APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning the company in such a way might be the reason for its immense growth in over a year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has recorded an average month-on-month API call growth of 281%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra has also analyzed more than 20 million transactions; last month, it analyzed 27.5% of this figure at over 5.5 million transaction lines</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a bit of context, Plaid has analyzed more than 10 billion transactions in its eight years of existence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s a good indicator that we&#8217;re on the right trajectory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traction,&#8221; COO Peterside added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything one can learn from the Nigerian fintech ecosystem over the past two years is that with growth comes regulatory scrutiny</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year, different regulatory moves from some of the country&#8217;s financial bodies have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward payments, crypto and wealth tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these regulators claim to foster the interests of the Nigerian public and protect consumers, their moves reek of innovation stifling and jurisdictional play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, these regulators appear not to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be concerned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the activities of API fintech infrastructure startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But will these companies be prepared to deal with the situation should that change?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Peterside, Okra is preparing for unforeseen circumstances by taking the initiative and engaging with the regulators in its space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2018 when the EU released the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to deal with data protection and violations resulting from it, most African countries have mirrored these laws for their region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, there&#8217;s the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), and due to its similarities with the GDPR, Peterside believes Okra has nothing to worry about &#8212; at least for now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what the law says, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the fine print is clear not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria but globally, so how we operate as a business is straightforward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in terms of what we think, the regulators whether they make the necessary decisions&#8230; we can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speak about that but generally, the laws and global standards are clear,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the company succeeds in keeping harmful regulations at bay, it can grow at whatever pace it wants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bane that might threaten this pace is hiring, according to the CEO. &#8220;The one challenge I&#8217;ll say we face has to be hiring,&#8221; Ashiru Jituboh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, one of the significant reasons Okra proves attractive despite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a year in operation is how it prioritizes speed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to onboard new clients in 24 hours or less while supporting them through the use cases specific to their product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increasing clientele means increased problems which means more personnel to handle them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So besides using the recent check to expand its data infrastructure across Nigeria, Okra will put a sizeable chunk into sourcing for talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to ensure that we&#8217;re solving our customers&#8217; problems as fast as possible and give the clients the support they need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want to make sure our hiring speed is the same as the speed of our growth and I think being able to raise capital is one of the solvers of that problem&#8230; making sure we&#8217;re bringing great talent and building a great team,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashiru Jituboh understands the need for great engineering talent because of her engineering-heavy background. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Okra with Peterside, she worked with JP Morgan, Fidelity Investments and Daimler Mercedes Benz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Okra, she doubles as the chief executive and CTO, staking a claim as one of the most promising founders in Africa&#8217;s male-dominated fintech scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omobola Johnson, a senior partner at TLcom Capital, maintains that these qualities and Okra&#8217;s proposition made the company its first fintech investment. It was more than enough to convince the firm to follow up in this round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year on, Okra has managed to make its investor list more impressive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susa Ventures, its lead investor, has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made notable early investments in Robinhood, Flexport and Fast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, Okra is the only African-based startup the VC firm has invested in asides from Andela.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to partner with Okra as they enable developers across the African continent to transform digital financial services,” general partner at Susa, Seth Berman said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re blown away by the quality of Okra’s team, pace of development and the excitement from the customers building on their API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a Fortune Global 500 company, Accenture Ventures has invested in more than 30 startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Okra is the first Black founded startup in its portfolio. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Lounibos, the firm&#8217;s president and managing director, said the reason behind the investment stems from partnering with Okra to bring open finance to Africa, the calibre of founders and their technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders tell me that Accenture and Susa represent smart money investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Okra&#8217;s vision and technology infrastructure play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, if we&#8217;re building an API infrastructure for the continent, we thought Accenture would be a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good partner because we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building an API which is a technology-based infrastructure,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; said the CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the investors will be pivotal to the company&#8217;s hiring and imminent pan-African expansion plans to Kenya and South Africa, where Okra is currently in beta</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accenture coming onboard to Okra as an investor marks the latest in a line of major companies jumping in on the African fintech wave &#8212; Stripe with the acquisition of Paystack and Visa and WorldPay partnership with Flutterwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments, Accenture Ventures continues the list of first-time U.S. investors in African fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/african-fintech-startup-chipper-cash-raises-30m-backed-by-jeff-bezos/">Bezos Expeditions</a> in Chipper, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Tiger Global and Avenir Growth Capital</a> in Flutterwave and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/kuda-raises-25m-more-led-by-valar-to-become-the-neobank-for-every-african-on-the-planet/">Valar</a> in Kuda come to mind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Susa and Accenture Ventures, Okra also brought on three angel investors to the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Solomon, chairman at GoFundMe and former partner at Accel; and two ex founding engineers at Robinhood &#8212; Arpan Shah and Hongxia Zhong</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra is not the only company looking to capitalize on the budding API financial infrastructure space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stitch, another South African API fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/">came out of stealth with $4 million</a> in funding. Pngme <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/">raised $3 million</a> in February. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others like Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Mono</a> and <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/12/16/onepipe-raises-950k-pre-seed/">OnePipe</a> have raised six-figure pre-seed rounds and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are backed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Y Combinator and Techstars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite seeming competition, the infrastructure business, unlike a commoditized business, is one with room for many winners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook and its family of apps have long grappled with the issue of how to better manage &#8212; and eradicate &#8212; bullying and other harassment on its platform, turning both to algorithms and humans in its efforts to tackle the problem better. In the latest development, today, Instagram is announcing some new tools of its own.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s introducing a new way for people to further shield themselves from harassment in their direct messages, specifically in message requests by way of a new set of words, phrases and emojis that might signal abusive content, which will also include common misspellings of those key terms, sometimes used to try to evade the filters. Second, it&#8217;s giving users the ability to proactively block people even if they try to contact the user in question over a new account.</p>
<p>The blocking account feature is going live globally in the next few weeks, Instagram said, and it confirmed to me that the feature to filter out abusive DMs will start rolling out in the UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a few weeks’ time before becoming available in more countries over the next few months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, these features are only being rolled out on Instagram &#8212; not Messenger, and not WhatsApp, Facebook&#8217;s other two hugely popular apps that enable direct messaging. The spokesperson confirmed that Facebook hopes to bring it to other apps in the stable later this year. (Instagram and others have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/instagram-adds-new-anti-bullying-features-including-tag-controls-comment-management-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regularly issued updates on single apps</a> before considering how to roll them out more widely.)</p>
<p>Instagram said that the feature to filter DMs for abusive content &#8212; not scan, the company was clear to point out &#8212; will be based on a list of words and emojis that Facebook compiles with the help of anti-discrimination and anti-bullying organizations (it did not specify which), along with terms and emoji&#8217;s that you might add in yourself. And to be clear, it has to be turned on proactively, rather than being made available by default.</p>
<p>Why? More user license, it seems, and to keep conversations private if uses want them to be. &#8220;We want to respect peoples&#8217; privacy and give people control over their experiences in a way that works best for them,&#8221; a spokesperson said, pointing out that this is similar to how its comment filters also work. It will live in Settings&gt;Privacy&gt;Hidden Words for those who will want to turn on the control.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2141514" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png 4056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=2048,1034 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>There are a number of third-party services out there in the wild now building content moderation tools that sniff out harassment and hate speech &#8212; they include the likes of Sentropy and Hive &#8212; but what has been interesting is that the larger technology companies up to now have opted to build these tools themselves. That is also the case here, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The system is completely automated, although Facebook noted that it reviews any content that gets reported. While it doesn&#8217;t keep data from those interactions, it confirmed that it will be using reported words to continue building its bigger database of terms that will trigger content getting blocked, and subsequently deleting, blocking and reporting the people who are sending it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the subject of those people, it&#8217;s been a long time coming that Facebook has started to get smarter on how it handles the fact that the people with really ill intent have wasted no time in building multiple accounts to pick up the slack when their primary profiles get blocked. People have been aggravated by this loophole for as long as DMs have been around, even though Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/477434105621119/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/477434105621119/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619072671239000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB5wWj33Bnme6JsjM6oi2m83BY9Q">harassment policies</a> had already prohibited people from repeatedly contacting someone who doesn’t want to hear from them, and the company had already also prohibited recidivism, which as Facebook describes it, means &#8220;if someone’s account is disabled for breaking our rules, we would remove any new accounts they create whenever we become aware of it.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2141516" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png 2028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s approach to Direct Messages has been something of a template for how other social media companies have built these out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In essence, they are open-ended by default, with one inbox reserved for actual contacts, but a second one for anyone at all to contact you. While some people just ignore that second box altogether, the nature of how Instagram works and is built is for more, not less, contact with others, and that means people will use those second inboxes for their DMs more than they might, for example, delve into their spam inboxes in email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bigger issue continues to be a game of whack-a-mole, however, and one that not just its users are asking for more help to solve. As Facebook continues to find itself under the scrutinizing eye of regulators, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/attorneys-general-from-twenty-states-call-on-facebook-to-do-more-to-fight-discrimination-disinformation-and-harrassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassment &#8212; and better management of it &#8212; has emerged as a very key area</a> that it will be required to solve before others do the solving for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A week after the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase staged a direct listing, much of the focus remains on the wealth that the listing generated for executives at the company, its board members, and its private investors. Citing data from Capital Market Laboratories, Cointelegraph on Monday noted, for example, that 12,965,079 <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-insiders-dump-nearly-5-billion-in-coin-stock-shortly-after-listing">shares worth close to $5 billion</a> at the time had been sold by insiders by the close of stock market on Friday.</p>
<p>One early investor who sold some of those shares is Garry Tan of the venture firm Initialized Capital. Tan worked previously as a partner with Y Combinator, where he helped ensure that Coinbase was accepted into the program and he remained the primary contact for founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, backing Armstrong three more times with seed checks after launching Initialized Capital with two other YC alums: Alexis Ohanian and Harjeet Taggar. Before the listing, Initialized still owned .08% of Coinbase, which currently boasts a market cap of $64 billion.</p>
<p>We talked with Tan late last week, who spoke candidly about the event and its impact on him personally. Tan also gave a fairly specific reason why he&#8217;s holding on to the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of his stake for the foreseeable future. You can hear our longer conversation<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8350564"> here</a>; we&#8217;re also featuring excerpts from that discussion below.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What year was that when you wrote that first check to Coinbase [on behalf of Y Combinator]?</strong></p>
<p>GT: It was 2012. I believe it would have been in April or May and then the batch started in June and I had just raised $7 million from <a href="https://www.thetrustedinsight.com/investment-professional/AlexBangash/">Alex Bangash</a>, who&#8217;s a great fund of funds operator. He does direct [investing] now, too. But he&#8217;d been trying to invest with Y Combinator for many years., and Jessica [Livingston] and Paul [Graham] said, &#8216;There&#8217;s probably not a way for you to do that. But here, you should meet Garry and Harj and Alexis, who are raising a very small $7 million fund.&#8217; And he ended up giving us $5 million of the $7 million and Coinbase was one of our very first checks; we wrote a $50,000 check [with a] $9 million pre-money cap.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did that create any complications with Y Combinator as Coinbase started to take off? Did Initialized end up with a bigger stake in the company than Y Combinator?</strong></p>
<p>GT: I think YC still ended up getting more. The other thing that was true back then was it was commonplace for YC partners to invest in YC companies. And it is true that we were quite successful. And we were asked to stop doing that, and we did. And that&#8217;s when I helped raise YC Continuity. And once that got up and running in 2015, that&#8217;s when I decided to spin out.</p>
<p>I love YC. It was in super great shape. And it&#8217;s more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy. So I jumped ship and worked on our third $125 million seed fund back in 2016. But [we&#8217;re] still close friends with all of our friends back at YC and I think super fondly of my time back there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of numbers have been published about who owns much and how much it&#8217;s worth. If you detangle Initialized&#8217;s stake from YC&#8217;s, your stake [would be valued around] $800 million. Were you restricted in any way from selling?</strong></p>
<p>GT: No.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Nobody was?</strong></p>
<p>GT: The company didn&#8217;t need to raise money. It&#8217;s a profitable company. That&#8217;s a super powerful thing to really know. This is not a speculative, cash-burning entity. This is a kind company with a durable moat and hyper profitability.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you share what percentage of your stake you sold?</strong></p>
<p>GT: I sold basically a fraction of my shares. As [with] many early employees, to be frank, this exit to me and my family is actually quite meaningful, just like it is for a lot of the other people who started off as engineers, I myself am an engineer [who] had credit card debt as recently as 2011 before I became an investor at Y Combinator and Initialized. We have to remember that Silicon Valley is where a lot of skilled builders are creating their own first wealth.</p>
<p>And all that being said, like a lot of other people who are also long with the company, I&#8217;m holding the majority and vast majority [of my shares] because I&#8217;m super long on both crypto and Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think about its valuation and whether it&#8217;s sustainable? So much of the company&#8217;s revenue derives from transaction fees and invariably, competition is going to drive those down to potentially zero. Robinhood already offers commission-free trades on crypto [and is also expected to go pubic soon]. </strong></p>
<p>GT:  In the short term, you think about it as an exchange. In the long term, you need to think about it as what is: a trusted on-ramp and user experience, and then [there&#8217;s] also the infrastructure.</p>
<p>We were actually the first seed investors and largest institutional holder of stock in <a href="https://bisontrails.co/">Bison Trails</a> [a firm that specializes in building blockchain infrastructure for banks and other companies] and was<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/19/coinbase-acquires-bison-trails-crypto-builder-deal/."> bought by Coinbase</a> late last year [though the deal was announced in January for undisclosed terms]. This is a company that I think a lot of people should pay attention to even now, because all of crypto is switching from proof of work &#8212; [an energy intensive process] that is how Bitcoin and Ethereum currently get to consensus &#8212; to [a new way of mining called] proof of stake, which is far more efficient and pretty much all of the newer blockchains are shifting to [and that rewards miners with transaction fees].</p>
<p>So this was a huge strategic buy for Coinbase and sets them up to be like a cloud infra company the way AWS is. And if you spend time with Amazon&#8217;s annual report, you realize that [infrastructure] is a massively profitable space. So that is the way to think about Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And Coinbase has customers of this cloud infrastructure service already.</strong></p>
<p>GT: It&#8217;s already the preferred infra company for a great number of the top 100 new crypto blockchains.</p>
<p>Long term, Microsoft is not one revenue stream, it&#8217;s not a one trick pony. They started with an OS. They used their advantage in operating systems to build applications, and then OS and applications together allowed them to also build server software.</p>
<p>[The best] companies stack durable advantages in multiple industries, and they do it on the back of hiring the best software engineers, the best designers, and the best product people, and that is enabled by a being extremely profitable, and then being a great place to work. And that&#8217;s the same for Coinbase as it is for Google, Facebook, for Amazon &#8212; any of the big tech giants.</p>
<p><em>(Again, you can check it out this chat in its entirety <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8350564">here</a>. We&#8217;re also talking soon with Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz, so stay tuned for more on this front.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restaurants rode a wave of usage of food delivery services like Deliveroo, Uber Eats and DoorDash in the last year, discovering new revenues and ways to connect with diners to offset the fact that in-person trade for many of them had disappeared overnight. But they also discovered something less appetizing: dealing with the mess of apps and hardware that they need to use to manage orders from their various services is a nightmare, worse than a deflated souffle or a botched Beef Wellington.</p>
<p>Today, a startup out of Belgium called <a href="https://www.deliverect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverect</a>, which has built a platform to manage all of that through one seamless app, is today announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p>Underscoring the demand for its technology and the bumper year it&#8217;s just had, the company has raised $65 million &#8212; funding that it will be using to expand its business. That will include the services and integrations that it provides with a wider range of physical point of sale terminals and third-party service providers, and targeting more customers &#8212; restaurants, dark kitchens and consumer goods companies building direct-to-consumer strategies &#8212; in a wider range of markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being co-led by DST and Redpoint Ventures, with OMERS, Newion, Smartfin and the founders also participating. It brings the total raised by Deliverect to $90 million, and while the valuation is currently not being disclosed, it comes on the heels of big growth. In the last year, the company processed some $1 billion across 30 million orders for its customers, with business growing almost 750% in the last year.</p>
<p>Customers number 10,000 and include the likes of chains like KFC and Pret a Manger, smaller restaurants like Dishoom (an Indian restaurant in London, for readers outside of London), a dark kitchen startup called <a href="https://www.eatcasper.com/how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casper</a>, and consumer goods giant Unilever.</p>
<p>For some further context on valuation, <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toast</a>, a company that provides similar SaaS out of the US, but also sells an all-in-one product that also includes the point-of-sale hardware, is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-for-ipo-11613938981?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly working on an IPO right now</a> that would value it at $20 billion.</p>
<p>Zhong Xu, the CEO who co-founded Deliverect with Jan Hollez (CTO), Jelte Vrijhoef (CIO), and Jerome Laredo (CRO), recalled in an interview that the idea for the company stretches back to a time when his dad, an Asian transplant to Belgium who had built a point of sale system that he sold to Chinese restaurants, had hoped that his son would take over the family business. He had the entrepreneurial itch, however, and also saw that the problem was bigger than just the range of businesses that his dad was targeting. (His dad is still in business, and they still talk, Xu confirmed.)</p>
<p>That first led Xu and Hollez, also friends outside of work, in 2010, to found POSiOS, which was the first iPad-based point of sale solution in Europe. That business four years later was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/22/lightspeed-now-caters-for-restaurants-after-buying-belgian-startup-posios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Lightspeed</a>, to spearhead its move into POS for restaurants just ahead of its IPO.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the end of the line for these two, though. &#8220;We saw that tens of thousands of customers were using our iPad system, but they were asking for something else. They wanted to remove all their tablets altogether,&#8221; Xu said.</p>
<p>What he is referring to is a pretty big issue for the typical ready-made food provider. Be it a restaurant, a chain, a dark kitchen or a food company itself, the market for taking and filling food orders is traditionally very fragmented. You will have one proprietary system that is used to manage orders in your restaurant itself, and another for orders that people call in to come pick up and takeaway, and a third for delivery orders taken via third-party platforms.</p>
<p>And that third can be more than one, depending on how many delivery networks your restaurant is using. All of these could feasibly require their own pieces of hardware, and these customers wanted that simplified down to one device alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just try to imagine being in a restaurant: there could be people there, others calling in, and between 5 and 10 tablets screaming for attention,&#8221; Hollez said in an interview. &#8220;It is just not possible to manage this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The solution that Deliverect, founded in 2018, has built essentially brings all of that into a single SaaS platform that manages all of these different channels in one place. (<a href="https://www.deliverect.com/en-us/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pricing</a> for the service starts at $69 per month and goes up based on how many orders are processed through the system.)</p>
<p>This gives the food provider a way of adequately monitoring and managing what stock is being used up and which dishes are subsequently off the menu, what orders are coming in and where and how to better manage that across their operations, and critically to update their customers on what they can actually order and how long it might take to fill that order out (a provider like Deliveroo will then also use that data to calculate how long it will take to not just make the order but to pick it up and get it to a customer). Deliverect also provides some analytics that can help its customers figure out how to manage all this better in the future.</p>
<p>While this state of affairs has been a problem for years, it definitely escalated in the last year, Xu said, with between 10% and 30% more orders coming from delivery platforms. The company claims that using its software helps its restaurant customers work significantly more efficiently, leading to an average increase of 25% in revenues and &#8212; importantly &#8212; an 80% decrease in order failures that resulted from all that chaotic fragmentation.</p>
<p>The work it&#8217;s doing with FMCG companies is also interesting: the idea here is that brands themselves have been in a bind that has only tightened in the last year, with usually only a very indirect relationship with customers: perhaps a strong bond in terms of marketing, but not when it comes to actually selling food items to customers: its sales typically involve intermediaries such as stores or restaurants.</p>
<p>But as the D2C trend has taken off in food, those big brands are leaving a lot on the table for competitors to pick up, and that&#8217;s even more of an issue when the restaurants and stores are being shut or just seeing less footfall due to Covid-19. So many of them have started to explore what they might do to bridge that gap. Xu said that by and large the focus at the moment is really about running marketing campaigns and getting physical items to people as a part of that, but it does present some very interesting ideas about how Deliverect might develop in the future.</p>
<p>For example, a new wave of ultra-fast grocery delivery startups are emerging, and those could represent a new wave of customers for the company and be a tool for helping the Unilevers of the world supply those platforms with steady streams of its products, or indeed the FMCG companies could leverage those to become direct sellers of their fizzy drinks, pretzels and chocolates (or whatever items they want to sell). Xu noted in fact that Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, one of these startups, is already a partner.</p>
<p>All of this spells an interesting future, despite the many other companies also chasing the opportunity, one reason why these founders and this startup out of Ghent have been backed by these high-profile international investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosive rise of online food delivery is forcing restaurants to change how they operate,&#8221; said Elliot Geidt, Managing Director, Redpoint Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Zhong and the Deliverect team are building the tools and infrastructure to help restaurants thrive in a world where navigating online food delivery is a matter of success or failure. Zhong has a unique empathy for restaurant owners, an unmatched technical understanding of the food delivery tech stack, and a raw ambition and vision that leaves us very excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Restaurants, consumer goods companies and other businesses increasingly want to enable on-demand ordering by their customers,&#8221; added Tom Stafford, Managing Partner, DST Global Partners, in his own statement. &#8220;But many do not have the tools or technology to efficiently work with  on-demand delivery providers. Deliverect is providing key software and integrations to enable these businesses to integrate on-demand offerings seamlessly. We are excited to partner with the Deliverect team as they continue to roll out their technology globally and further develop their product offering.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">become buzzy</a> in the last few months. New York-based UiPath is on course to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing/">initial public offering</a> after gaining an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">astounding valuation of $35 billion</a> in February. Over in China, homegrown RPA startup Laiye is making waves as well.</p>
<p>Laiye, which develops software to mimic mundane workplace tasks like keyboard strokes and mouse clicks, announced it has raised $50 million in a Series C+ round. The proceeds came about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/lightspeed-leads-laiyes-42m-round-to-bet-on-chinese-enterprise-it/">a year after</a> the Beijing-based company pulled in the first tranche of its Series C round.</p>
<p>Laiye, six years old and led by Baidu veterans, has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/laiye/company_financials">over $130 million</a> to date according to public information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leading investors in the Series C+ round were <a href="https://www.pingan.com/us-en.shtml">Ping An Global Voyager Fund</a>, an early-stage strategic investment vehicle of Chinese financial conglomerate Ping An, and <a href="http://www.guojianjituan.com/index_m.php/Index/news_details/id/705">Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Industry Equity Investment Fund</a>, a government-backed fund. Other participants included Lightspeed China Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia China and Wu Capital.</p>
<p>RPA tools are attracting companies looking for ways to automate workflows during COVID-19, which has disrupted office collaboration. But the enterprise tech was already gaining traction prior to the pandemic. As my colleague, Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">wrote</a> this month on the heels of UiPath&#8217;s S1 filing:</p>
<p>&#8220;The category was gaining in popularity by that point because it addressed automation in a legacy context. That meant companies with deep legacy technology — practically everyone not born in the cloud — could automate across older platforms without ripping and replacing, an expensive and risky undertaking that most CEOs would rather not take.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one case, Laiye&#8217;s RPA software <a href="https://laiye.com/case/social_security">helped the social security workers</a> in the city of Lanzhou speed up their account reconciliation process by 75%; in the past, they would have to type in pensioners&#8217; information and check manually whether the details were correct.</p>
<p>In another instance, Laiye&#8217;s chatbot helped automate the national population census in several southern Chinese cities, freeing census takers from visiting households door-to-door.</p>
<p>Laiye said its RPA enterprise business achieved positive cash flow and its chatbot business turned profitability in the fourth quarter of 2020. Its <a href="https://laiye.com/about#">free-to-use edition</a> has amassed over 400,000 developers, and the company also runs a <a href="https://store.uibot.com.cn/">bot marketplace</a> connecting freelance developers to small-time businesses with automation needs.</p>
<p>Laiye is expanding its services globally and boasts that its footprint now spams Asia, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laiye aims to foster the world’s largest developer community for software robots and built the world’s largest bot marketplace in the next three years, and we plan to certify at least one million software robot developers by 2025,&#8221; said Wang Guanchun, chair and CEO of Laiye.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that digital workforce and intelligent automation will reach all walks of life as long as more human workers can be up-skilled with knowledge in RPA and AI”.</p>
