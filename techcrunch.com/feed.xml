</div><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Starlink</a> has introduced a new user terminal customers can get with their starter kit. As first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the company now offers a <a href="https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">rectangular option</a> (PDF) that&#8217;s smaller and lighter than its original circular one. Users have to install that antenna on their rooftop or anywhere high up with a clear view of the sky to be able to access its satellite internet.</p>
<p>The original version is a standard dish that&#8217;s 23-inch wide, but the rectangular version is only 12 inches wide and 19 inches long. It&#8217;s also only 9.2 pounds, which is almost half the weight of its circular counterpart. The new terminal&#8217;s smaller form factor could give users more options when it comes to potential locations where they can install it. In addition, the rectangular terminal comes with more accessory options, including a long pole users can simply stick in the ground so they no longer have to mount the antenna on their rooftop.</p>
<p>SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-service-99-a-month-045831110.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">launched</a> Starlink as a beta service in late 2020 and offered customers access to its satellite internet for $99 a month. Users would have to pay $499 on top of that for its hardware kit, though, which includes the antenna, its stand, power supply and a WiFi router. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/networking/45600/spacex-prepares-to-cut-starlink-dish-cost-by-half-later-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">said</a> in August that the original dish cost $3,000 to produce, and while the company was able to get that down to $1,300, it was still selling the kit at a loss.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shotwell also said at the time that the terminal it&#8217;s releasing this year &#8220;will cost roughly half&#8221; of what its current user terminals cost and that the company may be able to cut that in half again. <em>The Verge notes</em>, however, that the hardware kit is still being sold for $499 even with the rectangular antenna, and SpaceX has yet to reveal whether it will be sold at a lower price in the future. Potential new customers who don&#8217;t mind paying the same price for it can get the rectangular terminal when they order a kit, so long as they&#8217;re in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salesforce users tend to have a similar complaint in the amount of time it takes to update records, but <a href="https://www.getweflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weflow</a> aims to conquer this form of “Salesforce fatigue.”</p>
<p>The Berlin-based company is developing a tool — still in private beta — that makes it faster to update Salesforce and reduces much of the busy work that takes up salespeople’s time.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2018/03/13/salesforce-essentials-is-here-now-millions-of-small-businesses-can-grow-and-innovate-faster-on-the-worlds-1-crm-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83% of Fortune 500 companies use the platform</a> to improve sales productivity, many sales professionals <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend the bulk of their time on tasks other than selling</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serial entrepreneurs Henrik Basten and Janis Zech worked together at Fyber and experienced this firsthand while running revenue teams. They started Weflow in late 2020 to be a revenue workspace built on top of Saleforce’s database to help salespeople add information inside Salesforce records quickly and manage their pipeline.</p>
<p>“People want to create a solution that is more like Asana for pipeline management,” CEO Zech told TechCrunch. “However, what is helpful is that Salesforce is an open ecosystem that you can build on top of. We observed people go into their pipeline and have 30 tabs open with notes scattered about. We were thinking that if salespeople don’t enjoy using it, we would create a more modern experience that was easier to update.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233125" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png" alt="Weflow" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png 2340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weflow-Pipelines-Table-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233125" class="wp-caption-text">Weflow pipeline table. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weflow</p></div></p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Users can sign up with their Salesforce account, access their pipeline and update deals, tasks, notes and activities with a few clicks. All of the data stays in Salesforce. Salespeople typically perform this task once a week and schedule two or three hours for it, but Zech estimates that Weflow can reduce that down to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In addition, the company created a modern notepad, built for Salesforce, for users to build templates so that salespeople are asking the same questions and writing in the same fields. There is also a task manager.</p>
<p>Now today, the company announced $2.7 million in pre-seed funding, led by Cherry Ventures, to get its tool to public launch. Cherry was joined by a group of angel investors, including Christian Reber, Sascha Konietzke, Chris Schagen, Alexander Ljung, Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss and Andreas Bodczek.</p>
<p>Filip Dames, partner at Cherry Ventures, said he and the founders had known each other from Fyber, and when they came to him with Weflow, Dames was “happy to be a support on this journey.”</p>

<p>When Dames looked across this firm’s portfolio, he noted that most startups began with sales, a process that is hard to ramp up, especially when sales tools are “expensive and clunky.”</p>
<p>“With the ability to build something on top of Salesforce, there is a wide canvas in which direction the company can go,” he added. “Janis and Henrik are on a mission in a space that is large enough to create venture returns. Salesforce brings in $20 billion in revenue, and that enables a lot of new businesses to be created. By making the interface more fun to use, you can spend more time with the customer.”</p>
<p>In the last couple of months, Basten and Zech have built up a team of 10, and there are 15 co-development partners piloting the product currently, with a handful being added each week. Zech says the product will launch early next year.</p>
<p>They will be using the new funding to invest in marketing and product development. Weflow is product-led and will eventually have a free version, Zech added.</p>
<p>“We want to help everyone because the problem is very well understood by whoever you talk to about Salesforce, so we have an interest in solving this and have a good starting point,” he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With World Mental Health Day just behind us, I thought about how the tech industry can be a difficult place to stay mentally well. Working remotely, especially under unprecedented circumstances, can make a difficult situation worse. I have worked remotely in technology for over a decade, and I’ll share my tips for how fast-paced technical startups can take good care of their software development talent.</p>
<p>Software development at its best is a creative endeavor. Developers need a certain level of comfort to be able to produce quality work. Boring tasks, noisy offices and too many meetings can impact productivity even in the best of times.</p>
<p>However, health is something more fundamental, almost on the lowest level of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">hierarchy of needs</a>, which includes mental health. Software developers need their brains in good shape to do the work that they do, and sometimes when things aren’t going well, we can see it in our colleague’s code before the real problem is even communicated.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226207" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The distributed nature of remote startup teams makes this more difficult. When you work remotely, the features of the office that can help you to support your team’s well-being are missing. Not only the free fruit and coffee or the bean bags; it can also be harder to notice when a colleague is having a hard time. When we aren’t in the same place, it’s harder to spot who is coming in late, leaving early or just seems a bit … flat.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>It’s also harder to check if someone is doing all right when there is no watercooler conversation. However, if you are unsure about someone and wondering if you should check in with them, my advice is always to reach out. As remote teams, we need to communicate more, and when it comes to mental health, it’s better to say something and find out someone is fine and that you were worried about nothing, rather than have them reach a breaking point alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Give the gift of autonomy</h2>
<p>I’ve worked remotely &#8212; by choice, for a selection of employers both large and small, as well as my own freelance consultancy &#8212; for more than a decade. What I value most about working from home is the flexibility, especially when my work is more on the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">maker’s schedule</a> as a software developer.</p>
<p>I discovered a series of life hacks that helped me to do more of my best work, such as a gym workout at 11 a.m. after an early start in the office, or putting dinner in the oven before the last meeting of the day. This ability to have a bit more “life” alongside the work has been beneficial for my own well-being, especially at times when I have been struggling.</p>
<p>In Daniel Pink’s book “Drive,” he covers how autonomy, mastery and purpose are the main drivers of motivation. Motivation, recognition and confidence are key to successful software development work. Being empowered to contribute toward a wider goal using your skills is very rewarding, and for startups where there is usually more freedom in choosing and prioritizing work, this can be very satisfying for developers.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/blog/83-of-developers-suffer-from-burnout-haystack-analytics-study-finds">83% of developers report burnout</a>, according to research from Haystack, so be careful to set realistic expectations for your software developers. It’s harder to send them home at a reasonable time when there is no physical office, so those expectations need to be carefully laid out, especially when there are flexible working hours and it’s easy to let big projects take over.</p>
<h2>Education says you care</h2>
<p>Developers are lifelong learners; they have to be because the industry changes so quickly. They are constantly investing in themselves, their knowledge and their skills.</p>
<p>As an employer, you can invest in them as individuals as well. Some companies offer generous training budgets or time off. I once worked for a small software company that didn’t provide a budget for study, but you could book one day a month to just learn something, and either help yourself to the shelf of textbooks or ask for a one-hour tutorial from someone else to get you started on a new topic. It didn’t cost the company much at all, but I felt like they wanted me to succeed.</p>
<h2>Freedom to work</h2>
<p>Rewarding developers with money <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/55603/1/505087677.pdf">doesn’t work as a motivator</a>, but giving them time and trusting them to use it for something other than direct product engineering work can have a big impact.</p>
<p>Google famously uses an approach of giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project">20% of a worker’s time</a> to be used for anything they found interesting. It even produced some useful products, but the main point is that developers felt involved and trusted at work. Atlassian is also famous for doing something similar, with all employees working for 24 hours on projects of their choice, producing surprising innovations and improvements that might never have shipped otherwise.</p>
<p>Many developers give much of their time to open source projects. I’ve had a few attempts at explaining this to people from other professions, and it turns out <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/">hacker culture is baffling</a>.</p>
<p>Developers, however, strongly identify with this world, and <a href="https://aiven.io/press/research-the-future-is-open-source-over-90-of-developers-believe-that-open">91% of developers say open source is in their future</a>. Giving developers permission to contribute to open source can make them feel more valued. Those open source communities can be an important part of a developer’s social and support networks, as well as their identity, which is critical for their wider well-being.</p>
<h2>Lessons from open source</h2>
<p>Our modern workplace has a lot to learn from open source in the way that we enable others to participate alongside us in projects. Open source projects serve as a reasonable model for how a truly remote workflow can function.</p>
<p>Some of the foundational building blocks of our software world were built by people who knew one another only by mailing list or IRC channel. Software was built, but, perhaps even more importantly, strong connections were made.</p>
<p>Remote software teams today, whether remote by choice or circumstance, have much more impressive tools available. Source control and collaboration tools are more than a mailing list now, and we can all be constantly in contact by text chat, audio or video call. We can even pair programs remotely using screen sharing or tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share">VSCode Live Share</a>.</p>
<p>However, all this connectivity can lead to added stress and notification fatigue. Remember that software developers are all different; one person’s working style won’t be exactly like another’s. Open source projects work in a way that is respectful of everyone’s time and without much expectation that any one person will be around at any specific time — rather, within an expected time window.</p>
<p>For remote teams doing advanced technological work, scheduling as few meetings as possible that leave long stretches of thinking time &#8212; and setting expectations about how quickly anyone is expected to respond to Slack messages &#8212; can really help to provide a calm working environment.</p>
<h2>Work-life balance</h2>
<p>When the pandemic stopped us from our daily commute, many were left with less than ideal work setups. Parked on the sofa or at the kitchen table, and possibly with other family members nearby, was unsurprisingly difficult for many of us, with <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252507495/Team-leaders-urged-to-address-developer-mental-health">increased levels of burnout</a> widely reported.</p>
<p>Even if your developers have been working from home for some time, it’s never a bad idea to check in whether they need a monitor upgrade, a spare power supply or even a new keyboard. Many employers now offer work-from-home budgets, but a little goes a long way when it comes to making sure your developers have the tools that they need.</p>
<p>Take the time to socialize together at work. Cringeworthy corporate team building is hopefully a thing of the past, but some simple online games can lighten the mood. If your company offers an EAP (employee assistance program), make sure that all of your employees know about it and how to access it. It doesn’t hurt to remind managers that the programs are there for them, too, not just the people on their teams.</p>
<p>When it comes to mental health, a startup can be a difficult place to be. They’re fast-paced, with frequent changes and many plates to keep spinning. My best advice is to look out for one another &#8212; and that’s not just managers looking out for the staff that report to them. All of us can do our bit by looking out for others and by taking care of ourselves.</p>
<p>When we burn out, there are warning signs before it happens. We need to find ways to make our work sustainable for the long term and to be something we do alongside our healthy lives. It’s easier said than done, but busy startups must take the time to remind their employees that they matter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 11, 2021. Below we have the first news item I have seen in which a company <em>not</em> diving into crypto was met by cheers, so read on for some narrative violations. In TechCrunch news, Rocket Lab’s Peter Beck is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/rocket-labs-peter-beck-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">coming to TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, which has me hype! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/">Discord backtracks on crypto push:</a> </strong>After tweeting out a screenshot of NFTs inside of Discord, the social chat company said that it has “no current plans to ship this internal concept.” Given that every brand with a pulse is trying to smear crypto magic all over itself, the Discord community backlash to crypto integration feels notable.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/as-valuations-soar-and-ipos-accelerate-the-public-is-taking-on-more-startup-risk/"><strong>The public is now at risk:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s tech boom is different from the dot-com era’s own period of outlandish exuberance. But after a long run of rich valuations and revenue-light companies being mostly constrained to the private market, we’re seeing more risk spill into the pockets of the investing public. It’s something to worry about.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/indonesian-goto-group-raises-over-1-3b-in-its-first-close-of-pre-ipo/">GoTo raises $1.3 billion in pre-IPO deal:</a></strong> The hybrid of Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce player Tokopedia is not shy about adding funds to its accounts ahead of its public debut. And it could be worth around $30 billion after this latest infusion of cash. When GoTo does in fact go to the public markets, its IPO will make waves around the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a whole mess of startup news, let’s talk about SoftBank. After its first Vision Fund wound down — though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/how-chinas-regulatory-crackdown-whomped-vision-fund-1s-returns/">results are still trickling in</a> from that particular capital vehicle — it seemed that Tiger and other groups took SoftBank’s leading-investor mantle. But the Japanese telco and investing powerhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">has put $3 billion into India this year alone</a> and could do more next year. That says quite a lot about Indian startups and about SoftBank itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233008" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/sivo-debt-as-a-service/"><strong>Stripe for debt:</strong></a> That’s what Sivo is building it appears, by offering access to debt via an API. Stripe, of course, has generated oceans of revenue by offering payments as a service via an API along with a growing stable of fintech products. In essence, Sivo should be able to help startups offer debt products without having to use their own balance sheet as their funding source.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/collectible-card-trading-platform-alt-raises-75m-as-it-eyes-other-asset-categories-and-preps-its-mobile-launch/"><strong>Why is everyone obsessed with collectibles?</strong></a> I don’t know, but alternative asset investing is still putting up impressive growth. We can tell that thanks to Alt raising a $75 million round today. It’s currently a platform for buying and selling rare sports cards, or what you might prefer to refer to as IRL NFTs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instacart-rolls-out-reduced-and-free-delivery-option-in-select-markets-deals-tab-and-more/"><strong>Instacart wants to bring you groceries tomorrow:</strong></a> Grocery delivery unicorn Instacart is rolling out lower-fee, next-day delivery and partnering with dollar stores for more goods. DoorDash, another delivery company, is also expanding its product remit. Uber Eats as well. It appears that every delivery company wants to deliver pretty much everything, in time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/ro-is-in-talks-to-acquire-at-home-sperm-storage-startup-dadi/"><strong>Ro wants to freeze your swimmers:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">Troubled health unicorn Ro</a> — parent company of well-known ED pill slinger Roman – is in talks to buy sperm storage company Dadi, TechCrunch reports. The expansion into sperm management makes sense given that the company has already done the work to ensure that folks are able to produce said material.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/chilean-proptech-startup-houm-raises-35m-series-a-to-expand-across-latam/"><strong>More money to help folks buy, sell houses more quickly:</strong></a> It seems that every market will have a few startups that want to make the process of buying and selling homes easier. Because it’s an awful experience everywhere, I suppose. Today’s example is Chilean proptech startup Houm, which has just raised a $35 million Series A.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/nigerias-helium-health-acquires-uaes-meddy-in-rare-africa-gcc-deal/"><strong>Helium Health buys Meddy:</strong></a> In a notable bit of M&amp;A, Nigeria-based Helium Health is buying UAE-based doctor-booking platform Meddy. Terms were not disclosed, but the transaction underscores how quickly the African and Middle Eastern startup markets are maturing.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/e-commerce-logistics-startup-hive-buzzes-following-34m-investment/"><strong>Today’s Tiger deal is Hive:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Berlin-based Hive provides software to help DTC brands manage fulfillment. The company just raised a $34 million round, which might sound small but the company had raised $10 million prior to the new investment.</li>
<li>And in case you forgot about SPACs, smart building tech concern Brivo <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/brivo-to-go-public-via-spac-at-808m-valuation/">intends to ride one to the public markets</a></strong>, giving itself an $800 million valuation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advent of new privacy regulations in Europe, California and other regions has forced online marketers to rethink their basic practices.</p>
<p>Instead of surreptitiously skimming intelligence via cookies and invisible pixels, what if marketers just asked consumers for relevant details that would personalize their shopping experience?</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the kind of things you’d tell a store associate helping you find the right gifts to purchase for your family,&#8221; says Ben Parr, president and co-founder of Octane AI. &#8220;That’s zero-party data.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram added <a href="https://www.instagram.com/creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two features</a> to Reels yesterday: text-to-speech and voice effects. These features are popular already on TikTok, but now, creators can use them on Instagram too. This marks yet another effort from Instagram to keep up with TikTok when it comes to short-form video, as Instagram offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">big reels bonuses</a> to incentivize creators,</p>
<p>Text-to-speech is a necessary accessibility feature that helps blind and low-vision people understand written text. But videos with these robotic voices became so <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/meme-insider/how-tiktoks-new-text-to-speech-feature-became-a-meme-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inexplicably popular</a> on TikTok that the voice actor behind the feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701167/bev-standing-tiktok-lawsuit-settles-text-to-speech-voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the company</a> since she hadn&#8217;t given it permission to use her recordings. After she filed her lawsuit, TikTok changed the voice behind the feature.</p>

<p>Creators often use text-to-speech voiceovers not so much for their accessibility benefits, but because it can be kind of funny to have a monotone, computerized voice narrating their content. The text-to-speech tool can be found within the text tool in the Reels camera. Once you record or upload a video, navigate to preview to add text. Once you add the text, a text bubble will appear at the bottom of the screen, which lets users time when they want that bit of text to appear. But now, you can tap a three-dot icon to open a menu for each text bubble, which will give you the option to add a text to speech voiceover. There are two voice options to choose from.</p>
<p>But voice effects let you get even more creative with your reels. These features let you modify the audio or the voiceover in your post. To see these effects, tap the music note once you&#8217;ve recorded your reel to open the audio mixer. Then, you&#8217;ll see an effects menu that lets you modify the audio in your reel or voiceover.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new features are rolling out now to Instagram mobile users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-unveils-interactive-clip-sharing-feature">rolling out</a> a new Prime Video feature that lets users share video clips from TV shows and movies on the platform. The clips can be shared on social media or via direct message. The feature is currently only available on iOS and for users in the U.S. For the initial rollout, users <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">can</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">only share clips from a limited number of shows, including season one of “The Boys,” “The Wilds,” “Invincible” and “Fairfax.”</span></p>
<p>When you’re watching one of these four titles, you can click on the new &#8220;Share a clip&#8221; button to create a 30-second clip. Once you click the button, the streaming service will pause the show to open up a screen where you can clip and edit the video. The app will then create a clip of what you just watched, allowing you to move the clip forward or backward to exactly where you want it. You’ll also be able to preview the clip before sharing it with others. When you’re ready to share the clip, you can select the &#8220;Share&#8221; icon and either upload it or share it via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, iMessage, Messenger and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Amazon says it plans to let users share clips from more of its original movies and series in the future. The company’s decision to allow users to share its content marks a change from other streaming services, which currently don’t offer ways to share video clips from their shows and movies. Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu all go as far as preventing users from capturing screenshots of content on their services and instead black out images when users try to do so.</p>
<p>Amazon’s latest feature for Prime Video indicates that it’s thinking differently about its content being shared and viewed on other platforms. It’s worth noting that Amazon may also be hoping to attract more users to Prime Video by encouraging its users to share clips of its original content with their friends and followers and hopefully get them interested enough to check it out themselves.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Your startup’s homepage should accomplish two things well: (1) <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Clearly explain exactly what you offer and (2) </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Convert visitors into active prospects.</span></p>
<p>If visitors leave confused or your website isn&#8217;t able to convert, allocate the resources to fix it before worrying about marketing.</p>
<p>When building your startup&#8217;s website, start by getting inspiration from the websites of established companies in your industry. Why? Because larger companies will have the resources to test and optimize their website to convert, saving you the need to do figure it all out yourself.</p>
<p>This post is going to tear down the homepage of Zapier, a SaaS platform that now has millions of customers and integrates with over 3,000 apps.</p>
<p>This teardown covers all the key sections of Zapier&#8217;s homepage so that you can apply the conversion tactics and copywriting strategies to your startup&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<h2>Grab attention early with these three tactics</h2>
<p>The above-the-fold (ATF) section of a homepage is the first section users see before they begin to scroll. It&#8217;s important that you nail this section, because if it&#8217;s not compelling, the rest of your landing page won&#8217;t be read.</p>
<p>Zapier&#8217;s ATF section has three pieces that we&#8217;ll dive into individually: header, subheader and a call to action.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232783" style="width: 1765px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232783" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232783 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png" alt="Zapier's above the fold section" width="1755" height="729" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png 1755w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=768,319 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=680,282 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=1536,638 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1755px) 100vw, 1755px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232783" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>A descriptive header with no jargon</h3>
<p>The purpose of the header is to explain what your startup does and why it matters. It needs to be easy to understand at a glance. One of the biggest mistakes we see startups make is trying to make their header clever. Opt for clarity, not cleverness if you care about getting customers. The best headers can accomplish this in about 10 simple words.</p>
<p>Zapier explains what their product does in three words: &#8220;Connect your apps.&#8221; Then, they explain why it matters in two words: &#8220;Automate workflows.&#8221; The implication is that you&#8217;ll save a lot of time if you use Zapier.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When crafting your header, start by writing at least 10 variations and share them with friends and colleagues who don&#8217;t work in your industry. Your header should be simple enough that anyone can understand what you sell. Avoid industry jargon unless it&#8217;s a primary competitive advantage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232784" style="width: 1153px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232784" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232784 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png" alt="It's imperative to use a descriptive header with no jargon" width="1143" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1143px) 100vw, 1143px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232784" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>A subheader that describes the transformation your customers go through</h3>
<p>The header and subheader should complement each other. The header explains what you do, while the subheader explains how you do it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The less information you ask your visitor to provide, the higher the conversion rate will be.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The subheader should add credibility to the claim made in the header by explaining <em>how</em> your company will accomplish the promise of the header. Explaining how it works is critical for conversion so that visitors know you have a real solution to their problems that has been thought through.</p>
<p>Again, avoid technical jargon in the subheader. You&#8217;re trying to pique your reader&#8217;s interest, not pitch to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an effort to expand beyond music, Spotify has been investing hundreds of millions to build out its podcasts business. Now the company has set its sights on another form of audio, with today&#8217;s acquisition of digital audiobook distributor <a href="https://findaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Findaway</a>.</p>
<p>Spotify declined to share the financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory review and approval.</p>
<p>Founded in 2004, Findaway&#8217;s core focus has been on bringing more audiobooks to listeners worldwide.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It today operates a collection of brands and products led by its <a href="https://findaway.com/publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large audiobook distribution business</a> that connects content creators with reseller partners like Apple, Google, Scribd, Audible, Nook, Rakuten Kobo, Chirp, Storytel (a Spotify partner), Overdrive, Audiobooks.com and dozens of other global brands.</p>
<p>Other brands under the Findaway umbrella include <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://findaway.com/authors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Findaway Voices</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17157640/smashwords-findaway-voices-ebook-audiobook-production-partnership-audible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connects</a> authors with professional narrators; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://findawayaudioworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audioworks</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which sees the company producing audio for top publishers; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://findaway.com/institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playaway</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which brings preloaded audiobook products to libraries and schools; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://orangeskyaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orange Sky Audio</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which works to bring a more diversified audio catalog to listeners; and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://audioengine.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AudioEngine</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which offers tools and technology that allow developers to integrate a broad catalog of audiobooks into their own platforms. </span></p>
<p>Spotify is bringing in Findaway&#8217;s full team of around 150, it says, and then plans to build on Findaway&#8217;s existing investments in the audio industry. It also plans to bring expanded access to audiobooks to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Shareholder-Letter-Q3-2021_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">381 million</a> monthly active users.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this acquisition, the plan is to accelerate into the audiobooks space by expanding our platform,&#8221; said Nir Zicherman, Spotify&#8217;s head of Audiobooks. He explained that today, Spotify users tend to go to other platforms to access audiobooks, and it wants to enable that consumption to take place with Spotify&#8217;s app itself. Initially, that may see Spotify users leveraging the company&#8217;s new <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Access Platform technology</a> (OAP) to authenticate with existing credentials to access audiobooks from Findaway and other audiobook partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spotify-expands-into-the-audiobooks-market-by-partnering-with-storytel/">like Storytel</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, however, OAP offers the flexibility for publishers to determine how their content is sold that works with their own business models, meaning they may introduce a variety of new ways consumers could unlock and listen to audiobook content on Spotify going forward.</p>
<p>The first integrations of OAP are expected to arrive early next year, said Spotify.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we think there&#8217;s massive potential and growth ahead for audiobooks,&#8221; Zicherman noted. &#8220;Combining Spotify and Findaway and their amazing team and their amazing tech, the idea is to realize that future faster than we ever could as separate companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/audiobooks-market#:~:text=The%20global%20audiobooks%20market%20is,USD%2014.99%20billion%20by%202027.&amp;text=Some%20key%20players%20operating%20in,Apple%20Inc.%2C%20and%20Storytel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> research estimates,</a> the audiobook industry is expected to grow from $3.3 billion as of 2020 to $15 billion by 2027, which is why Spotify believes Findaway is worth the investment. The company also noted that it sees the Findaway deal as the beginning of its ambitions in the audiobooks space, so it may choose to expand the team further in the future.</p>
<p>Spotify plans to have Findaway continue to run its various brands and services much as it does today, with the same staff and partners, operating from its Cleveland-area headquarters. This approach is similar to how Spotify handled its acquisition of podcast creation platform Anchor, which continued to offer distribution to other platforms &#8212; including Spotify&#8217;s competition.</p>
<p>The company has signaled its interest in audiobooks ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. In January, it <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-tests-audiobooks-with-frankenstein-jane-eyre-and-other-literary-classics-exclusive-4121062/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began testing the format</a> with a handful of classics, like “Frankenstein,” “Jane Eyre,” “Persuasion” and others, narrated by celebs. It had also previously offered the first “Harry Potter” book with chapters narrated by stars like Daniel Radcliffe, David Beckham and Dakota Fanning.</p>
<p>And in May, it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spotify-expands-into-the-audiobooks-market-by-partnering-with-storytel/"> announced a partnership</a> with audiobooks platform <a href="https://www.storytel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storytel</a> to allow Spotify users to access their audiobooks through Spotify&#8217;s app, also powered by OAP. (The company wouldn&#8217;t say if the deal with Findaway grew out of similar partnership discussions, but that seems a likely possibility.)</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s acquisition doesn&#8217;t signal a shift away from Spotify&#8217;s commitment to podcasts in order to chase a new area of audio investment, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Podcasts will remain a critical part of our focus as a business,&#8221; said Zicherman. &#8220;This is an expansion into a new content type that we know our consumers want, and, in many cases, are already listening to. We want to bring that on platform so they can enjoy it on Spotify, as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ro.co/">Ro</a>, a direct-to-consumer health company valued by its investors at $5 billion, is nearing a deal to acquire at-home sperm storage upstart Dadi, per multiple sources familiar with the unicorn’s business. The deal would be Ro’s fourth acquisition in the past 12 months, along with Workpath, Kit and Modern Fertility.</p>
<p>The deal is near close but could still fall through. It’s unclear how large the deal is, but one source estimated that the transaction will close at $100 million. Ro and Dadi did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dadikit.com/">Dadi</a> launched in 2019 with a temperature-controlled at-home fertility test and sperm collection kit, with a mission to remind men that “infertility isn’t a women’s issue, it’s both a men’s and women’s issue,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/dadi-brings-in-2m/">according to co-founder and CEO Tom Smith. </a>The startup has since raised $10 million in known venture capital, per Crunchbase, from investors such as firstminute Capital, Third Kind Venture Capital and The Chernin Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233009" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dadi’s closest competitor is Legacy, which has similarly raised venture capital for a sperm-testing and freezing service. Legacy won TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition at Disrupt Berlin 2018 and has raised over $20 million to date from investors like FirstMark, Y Combinator and Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes amid rising tensions at Ro, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">current and former employees say that the healthcare company has struggled</a> to keep up with the demands of new growth-stage goals. Many employees, some of whom have since left the company, said the tipping point for them was when Ro pursued rapid acquisitions for growth, instead of fixing culture and operations for longtime teams within the company.</p>
<p>“Each acquisition felt like it came out of nowhere,” a recently resigned employee interviewed by TechCrunch said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">about the cadence of deals.</a> “We’ve never really integrated with any of our companies that we’ve acquired; so what are we doing this for? The focus [of the company] would shift a lot because of these acquisitions, and, leaders would say ‘this is a growth company, that’s what happens.’”</p>
<p>That said, two of Ro’s latest acquisitions seem to mesh well with Dadi when it comes to strategy. Kit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/ro-buys-kit-a-17-month-old-startup-that-offers-at-home-health-testing/">which Ro acquired in June,</a> is an at-home diagnostics company with an array of customizable products, from finger prick blood tests to weight measurement tools. The startup, similar to Dadi, wants to make it easier for consumers to be proactive about their health within the comfort of their own homes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s a fragmentation of care, fragmentation of data and providers aren’t kept in the loop,” Zachariah Reitano, co-founder and CEO of Ro, said about the Kit acquisition. “And we have so much work to do, but Kit is such an important and essential piece in that infrastructure to again bring more and more of a patient’s care under the same roof.”</p>
<p>Dadi will also bolster Ro’s apparent efforts to move into the fertility space, underscored by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">$225 million buy of Modern Fertility.</a> Led by Carly Leahy and Afton Vechery, Modern Fertility offers an at-home fertility test for women as well as a slew of personalized support for reproductive health issues.</p>
<p>And of course, Ro started out as a business in the men&#8217;s health space by focusing on erectile dysfunction. Its ED line continues to account for half of the health tech unicorn&#8217;s revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is on the verge of entering a new era in its historic journey as a provider of private rocket launch services: The company&#8217;s next flight includes its first attempt to recover one of its boosters for re-use, using a helicopter to snatch it out of the air as it floats back to Earth slowed by a parachute.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one reason why we&#8217;re so excited to have Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021 this year, which is happening December 14 and 15</a>. Beck, who founded the company 15 years ago in Auckland, has had a whirlwind year, taking Rocket Lab public via a SPAC merger in March, and unveiling plans to develop Neutron, a new medium-lift launch vehicle that will boost its capabilities alongside its existing Electron rocket.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is also expanding its own identity as a space company, venturing further into satellite development and providing a range of services that essentially make it a one-stop shop for would-be spacefaring businesses and customers who want to stick to what they do best and leave getting to and operating in space to the professionals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232292" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15.

<p>Johnson-Roberson also served as a co-director of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/ford-expands-robotics-research-with-75-million-u-m-facility/">UM Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles</a>, from whose office he fielded our call to discuss his plans for his new position, as well as what he believes the future will look like for robotic research.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You’re currently in Michigan, working out of that new Ford wing?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MJR: Yeah, I’m here and a few of the students are here. Just doing some robot stuff. Having a good time.</p>
<p><strong>What has your focus been over there?</strong></p>
<p>A number of different things, but it’s long-term, blue sky research for Ford. They’re doing lots of work, as is Argo, on things that will come out on the roads, hopefully in the next six months to three years. We’ve been looking much more at things that are five-10 years off of getting to the road. That’s one of the nice things about universities is we can take this blue sky approach to things, everything from weird new sensors to thinking a lot about human prediction and safety guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>I see the Ford/U of M setup being a model universities increasingly look to. Universities &#8212; especially those like CMU &#8212; have a long history of wealthy benefactors. Do you see this kind of partnership being the model for university research going forward?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It reflects the sort of transformation that robotics has undergone in the past 20 years. So many of the technologies that were developed in the 90s and 00s are now reaching a level of maturity where they are getting rolled out in commercial products and making a big difference to the future of a lot of industries. I think it’s a natural extension of that. You begin to see relationships between universities and companies. Even if you look at Pittsburgh as a city, the transformation that it’s undergone from heavy industry focused around natural resources and steel, that transformation is only going to accelerate.</p>
<p>Part of my goal is to continue relations and build new ones. Beyond just industries, thinking about government and policy and all the other things that are now going to become more relevant for robotics &#8212; making sure we make those relationships and build on the strengths of the technical work that already goes on at the institute. That is something I’m particularly excited about.</p>
<p><strong>In Pittsburgh, you have a number of these homegrown startups, but also big companies like Google coming in to be closer to the research and court graduates. What can CMU do to further foster a relationship like that?</strong></p>
<p>They’re opening a Waymo office to work with one of the professors at CMU, so you can see see that these relationships &#8212; not just the faculty but the students. The lifeblood of all of these companies is new, highly trained employees, and anything you can do to get a leg up on recruiting and helping to build a culture that people want to come to is a huge advantage for these companies. You see them co-locating, sponsoring research, doing all of these things that are helping them to both develop new projects but also form new relationships with incoming students. The richest part of the university is that every year you get a new crop of some of the smartest people in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Is part of your job going to be helping grow some of these startups natively within sort of the broader context of the university?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Having had the opportunity to do a startup myself, I think knowing that there’s this huge knowledge gap, that there are so many students that are so smart and have such big ambitions for the world, I think figuring out ways of helping them fulfill that is my role. One way that you just highlighted is startups. People talk about ecosystem a lot. Part of that is that there are other startups in the area, but secondly, you have a community where you can find likeminded people to do stuff with and build things.</p>
<p><strong>You’re at the U of M, so you’ve seen some of the transformation that’s happening in Detroit. Detroit may not be as far along as Pittsburgh, when it comes to fostering the startup community, but there’s a lot of opportunity there. What role can the school play in keeping the talent that CMU attracts to the city?</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of things. One thing that I see as increasingly important is making sure that you acknowledge that the opportunities are out there. The speed and size of the robotics industry is accelerating at a pace I don’t think any of us could have anticipated. An important part of this is acknowledging that and not trying to stay stationary. The industry is changing, the ecosystem around robotics is changing and the size and scale around these companies is changing. Let’s figure out how to make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>Robotics hasn’t historically been the most inclusive field. What role can CMU play in that? I assume by the time most people enroll at a place like CMU, robotics has already been their focus for some time?</strong></p>
<p>I want to leave as my mark on CMU in this time two things. One is to increase opportunities, make sure we are broadening participation and we are seeing representation in the field. Secondly, I think this is perhaps more important, is that universities are good at shaping the minds of young people. I couldn’t imagine a better position to try and affect change on bringing more diversity and inclusion into robotics than being at the premier research institution for robotic research. That means you’re at the genesis point for the next generation of roboticists.</p>
<p><strong>You’re a good example of that &#8212; you didn’t start at CMU with robotics as a focus.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly right. And I’ll go a step further. When I got to CMU, I struggled. It was the first place I’d ever been where everyone was smarter than me. That is what I think is really special about that place. Whatever happened, it didn’t result in me quitting robotics, leaving and never coming back. And I think that’s a testament to the people that were there then and are there now.</p>
<p><strong>What excites you most in robotics, these days?</strong></p>
<p>We’re really at this inflection point when it comes to big, deployed robotic field systems out there in the world. One day, I want it to be that you look out your window, wherever you are in the U.S. and the world, and you see a robot doing something useful. That’s not the world we live in right now. If you go to a factory floor or a few other places, you can see a robot. Maybe you have a robot vacuum, but I want it to be at a point where you look out your window and see a robot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Labs is back, but this time around, it&#8217;s not a consumer-facing brand delivering a range of experimental products. Instead, it&#8217;s the internal name given to a new team at Google created under a reorganization that aims to gather the company&#8217;s many innovative projects and long-term bets under one roof. The new group will be led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claybavor/">Clay Bavor</a>, a veteran Googler and VP whose most recent role has seen him leading the company&#8217;s forward-looking efforts in virtual and augmented reality, including its cutting-edge holographic videoconferencing project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">known as Project Starline</a>.</p>
<p>Bavor will lead the new organization that will contain Google&#8217;s existing AR and VR efforts, its <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/">futuristic Starline</a>, its in-house incubator called <a href="https://area120.google.com/">Area 120</a>, as well as any other &#8220;high-potential, long-term&#8221; projects. He will report directly to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p>
<p>Launched in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/google-preps-new-corporate-incubator?shared=4055a3">2016</a>, Area 120 was envisioned as a way to better retain entrepreneurial-minded talent at Google, while giving teams the ability to test out new ideas while still having access to Google&#8217;s data, products, and resources.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the years, the organization has cranked out a number of successful projects and exits, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/">HTML5 gaming platform for emerging markets</a> called GameSnacks, now integrated with Google Chrome in some countries; the technical interview platform Byteboard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/technical-interview-platform-byteboard-spins-out-of-googles-area-120-takes-on-new-funding/">a rare external spinout</a>; an AirTable rival called Tables <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/googles-airtable-rival-tables-graduates-from-beta-test-to-become-a-google-cloud-product/">which exited to Google Cloud</a>; an A.I.-powered conversational ads platform <a href="https://adlingo.com/">AdLingo</a>, which also exited to Cloud; video platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/googles-area-120-launches-tangi-a-short-form-video-app-focused-on-creativity-and-diy/">Tangi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Shoploop</a>, which exited to Google Search and Shopping, respectively; and the web-based travel app <a href="https://blog.google/technology/area-120/touring-bird-expansion/">Touring Bird</a>, which exited to Commerce, among others.</p>
<p>Currently, Area 120 is incubating projects like the workplace video platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/google-threadit-is-bite-size-video-for-team-collaborations/">ThreadIt</a>, spectrum marketplace <a href="https://www.orion.area120.com/">Orion</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-launches-stack-an-app-that-digitizes-personal-docs-and-extracts-key-information/">document scanner Stack</a>, and more. At any given time, it has around 20 projects underway, though not all of them are made public.</p>
<p>However, under the prior organizational structure, Area 120 was three layers deep in terms of reporting to Google CEO Sundar Pichai &#8212; even though Pichai himself had to sign off on its every exit. The group was also housed amid a potpourri of groups reporting to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-harrison-a1b4271/">Don Harrison</a>, President of Global Partnerships and Corporate Development. With the reorganization, Area 120 will be relocated alongside other innovative projects, potentially gaining the participating teams and their efforts increased visibility.</p>
<p>Though Google is only using the branding &#8220;Labs&#8221; internally to have something to call its new group, the name it selected has a rich history at the company. Hardly a boring choice, the &#8220;Google Labs&#8221; brand was associated in the past with Google&#8217;s public-facing experiments that often <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2004/">moved from beta</a> into general availability.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During its run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Labs">from</a> 2002-2011, Google Labs produced <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/google-labs-experiments/">products</a> like Personalized Web Search, Google Web Alerts, Google Docs and Spreadsheets, Google Reader, Google Shopper (now <a href="https://shopping.google.com/">Google Shopping</a>), Aardvark (a Quora-like Q&amp;A site), a Lens precursor called Google Goggles, Gesture Search for Android, iGoogle, Google Maps, Google Transit, Google Video, Google Talk, Google Trends, Google Scholar, Google Code Search, Google Suggest, Google Groups, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503171724/http://labs.google.com:80/">others</a> that become core Google products and services.</p>
<p>While Google&#8217;s new plan is not about making Labs a public brand &#8212; individuals will be hired into the project teams themselves (like Starline, e.g.) &#8212; the reorg itself could elevate the focus on some of Google&#8217;s bigger bets. And by bringing Labs under Bavor&#8217;s leadership &#8212; a veteran Googler who led product management for many high-profile Google projects over the years, including Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Apps for Work (now Google Workspace) &#8212; Google is putting into place a leader with experience turning innovative ideas into core products.</p>
<p>In an announcement to staff, the company described the reorganization as one that&#8217;s &#8220;focused on starting and growing new, forward-looking investment areas across the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Central to this org is a new team called Labs, focused on extrapolating technology trends and incubating a set of high-potential, long-term projects,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Google has not publicly announced its reorganizational efforts. But after hearing about the moves from internal sources, Google confirmed to TechCrunch the changes are as we&#8217;ve described, including Bavor&#8217;s new position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay has taken on an expanded role. His work will focus on long-term technology projects that are in direct support of our core products and businesses,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram really wants you to post Reels &#8212; they&#8217;ll even pay you up to $10,000 for one, if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<p>As TikTok surpasses the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion monthly active users</a> mark, competitor platforms like YouTube Shorts, Snapchat Spotlight and Instagram Reels are incentivizing users to post their short-form content on their apps instead. YouTube established a $100 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/">creator fund</a> for Shorts, Snapchat is offering cash prizes for submissions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/snapchat-revamps-creator-payouts-by-offering-chance-to-win-prizes-with-spotlight-challenges/">Spotlight challenges</a> and, now, Instagram is upping the ante on its monthly <a href="https://help.instagram.com/183392733628561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reels Play bonus program</a>.</p>
<p>But creators are confused about what factors determine how big a bonus they&#8217;re eligible for from Instagram, and the platform isn&#8217;t helping clear up their concerns. Instagram told TechCrunch that the program is experimental and still in its early stages. But the lack of transparency can be troubling for creators who use these platforms to make a living. The bonus program even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qpnii0/instagram_bonuses_disappeared_glitch_i_got_a_text/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced a glitch</a> this week, causing eligible creators to be told that they were actually ineligible for the payout. Instagram told TechCrunch that this glitch has been fixed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232426" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Maddy Corbin, who has ~52,000 <a href="http://www.instagram.com/maddy.corbin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followers on Instagram</a>, was offered up to $1,000 for her reels in a month. She noticed, though, that other creators were being offered different deals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw some people that had more followers than me and they could only make $600,&#8221; Corbin told TechCrunch. Some others with fewer followers were offered $800. &#8220;I wish I knew more on how that was generated. All I can think of is maybe it&#8217;s based off of past reels&#8217; performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>A creator with about 24,000 Instagram followers &#8212; less than half as many as Corbin &#8212; told TechCrunch that last month, they were offered a bonus of up to $800 if they got 1.7 million views on all reels posted that month. The bonus isn&#8217;t all-or-nothing &#8212; the creator intentionally posted one reel per day during the bonus period and managed to get 1.49 million plays on their reels, earning a $689.90 payout. Still, they were disappointed when all Meta-owned apps like Instagram went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">offline for six hours</a> due to server issues last month, which slowed the spread of their Reels.</p>
<p>But this month, Instagram kicked the bonus up a notch: Now this creator can get up to $8,500 for 9.28 million views. Proportionally, this is a higher payout-per-view than last month&#8217;s rate, and of course, there&#8217;s the potential to make over 10 times more money. The creator said that this is a higher payout-per-view than they get on TikTok, where they have 32,000 followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to determine how Instagram&#8217;s bonus offer is calculated &#8212; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qigb8i/reels_bonus_feature_error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one Reddit user</a> was offered up to $35,000 for over 58 million views in a month. Miguel Lozada, a Twitch streamer with around 800 Instagram followers, got the same $8,500 offer as a creator with 24,000 followers. Another user with 59,000 followers told TechCrunch that they were offered an $850 bonus this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re continuing to test payments as we roll out to more creators, and expect them to fluctuate while we’re still getting started,&#8221; Instagram told TechCrunch. &#8220;We’ve designed bonuses so that we can help as many creators as we can in a way that is achievable and drives meaningful earnings. Our goal is for bonuses to become more personalized over time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some creators <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qflw3o/anyone_else_have_instagram_reels_bonus_how_can_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported that</a> they felt like their reels weren&#8217;t getting as much attention once they joined the bonus program.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first three days [I had access to bonuses], I was probably making about $40 a day, and it literally crashed after about week one, and it went down to like cents and dollars per day,&#8221; Corbin said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s been interesting because I really haven&#8217;t changed that much the way that I&#8217;m putting my content out.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/183392733628561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> page, these bonuses are &#8220;rolling out slowly&#8221; and are not available to all users yet. To start, these bonuses are only available in the U.S.</p>
<p>Instagram told TechCrunch that to be eligible for these promotions, users need to be at least 18 years old and meet the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/512371932629820" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner monetization policies</a>, which are a bit vague. Per the policy, creators must maintain a &#8220;sufficient follower base,&#8221; but Instagram doesn&#8217;t quantify what counts as &#8220;sufficient&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch spoke to creators who were offered the bonus whose follower counts ranged between 800 and 59,000.</p>
<p>Instagram also announced the <a href="https://about.instagram.com/features/reels/reels-surprise?gk_enable=about_ig_reels_contest_launch_holdout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reels Surprise</a> bonus program this week, which will reward up to 150 U.S.-based creators per week with up to $10,000 for a particularly inspiring, entertaining reel. To be eligible, U.S.-based creators must be at least 18 years old, meet Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community guidelines</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/512371932629820" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner monetization policies</a>, have an existing reel with at least 1,000 views, and have not yet received a bonus.</p>
<p>To discourage users from recycling content from TikTok, the Instagram algorithm<a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA9BBtlKfRZDfw7Z-zY3sxlj-G7k0vPD64aMVPGVZp4QPTppgAjhyUX4hIINmXLEb-edzkgAcnQcyXQSn2dTMaIBmRPcOUCxWwdqV9D928ny91L4491ejpRbFZp9Ha6rgVT3phXd-jMlDJmQDtsyL4KojISVqKDML8dc8ycUexjL" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> deflates content</a> that has watermarks from other social media platforms. But YouTube Shorts has gotten even more aggressive with its tactics to sway popular creators to its platform. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-paying-tiktok-stars-and-other-influencers-to-post-shorts-2021-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Insider reported</a> this week that some popular TikTokers got offered $50,000 to post 100 YouTube Shorts over six months. This program was not public and is separate from YouTube&#8217;s $100 million Shorts fund. According to the talent managers who spoke to Business Insider, creators had to wait seven days after posting a short on YouTube before they could repost it to another platform.</p>
<p>TikTok only continues to grow, but the platform is up against long-standing giants like Google-owned YouTube and Meta-owned Instagram &#8212; and for those companies, throwing $10,000 at an individual user&#8217;s short video isn&#8217;t a huge business expense.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Hummer H1 was based on a military truck, and now it appears GM is ready to return the favor. GM Defense president Steve duMont <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/gm-plans-to-produce-military-vehicle-based-on-hummer-ev-in-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">told <em>CNBC</em></a> the company planned to build a military vehicle prototype based on the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmcs-newly-unveiled-hummer-ev-suv-is-830-hp-of-electric-supertruck-220323684.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Hummer EV</a>. The eLRV, or electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle, would modify the Hummer&#8217;s frame, motors and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-reveals-the-ultium-motors-that-are-key-to-its-all-electric-shift-120029040.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Ultium batteries</a> to suit US military requirements.</p>
<p>The prototype should be ready sometime in 2022. There&#8217;s no guarantee American armed forces will use the eLRV, however. The Army is still exploring the viability of EVs like this, and GM will have to meet formal requirements (along with a rival manufacturer) if and when they exist. A choice is due sometime in the mid-2020s.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Any military EV faces logistical challenges, at least for machines on the front lines. Soldiers couldn&#8217;t just find a charging station on the battlefield, for starters — they&#8217;d need transportable charging systems that aren&#8217;t dependent on a working electrical grid. DuMont said GM could provide combustion-powered charging systems. We&#8217;d add that temperatures significantly affect EV range, and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">swappable batteries</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (important for quick turnarounds and repairs) are still in their relative infancy.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There could be advantages to military EV adoption. They might improve overall emissions, even if the need for combustion-based chargers partly offset that advantage. EVs generally require less maintenance due to fewer moving parts. And their quiet operation could be extremely useful for recon and stealth missions where conventional rides would be too noisy. The challenge is to make the most of these advantages while minimizing drawbacks that could hurt operational speeds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233000" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Have you ever had the itch to watch Twitch on Nintendo Switch? Available now as a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/twitch-switch/">free download</a> on the Nintendo eShop, the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/11/11/twitch-on-switch-download-the-new-twitch-app-for-nintendo-switch/">Twitch app</a> lets users watch both live and VOD content on the go in handheld mode, or on the big screen when the Switch is docked.</p>
<p>Since Twitch is best known for gaming livestreams, it makes sense that a lot of people who play Nintendo Switch are probably also Twitch viewers. You can&#8217;t stream your games through the Twitch app (streaming setups are complex and bandwidth-intensive!), but it&#8217;s easy to browse and search for streams. You can sign into your Twitch account to easily keep up with your favorite streamers, but you can&#8217;t use the chat function in the app. It would be difficult to keep up with a Twitch chat while trying to type with your joycons, so it&#8217;s not a huge loss. Plus, you can scan a QR code on your phone to join the chat. At that point, if you&#8217;re not docked to a TV screen, you might as well just use the iOS app, though.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch has some popular entertainment apps available to download, like Hulu and YouTube. But fans are eager for the option to watch Netflix, which had an app on older Nintendo consoles like the Wii U and 3DS. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217049/nintendo-netflix-wii-u-3ds-switch">stopped supporting</a> the Netflix app on those systems in January, though, and hasn&#8217;t shared plans for a Netflix on the Switch. Other popular streaming services like Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ are also absent from the Switch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Panic first launched pre-orders of its adorable little retro-inspired handheld gaming device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/playdate/">Playdate</a>, it expected the first 20,000 units to ship by the end of 2021 — just in time, they hoped, for the holidays. That first batch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/panic-sells-20000-playdate-handhelds-in-under-20-minutes/">sold out in under 20 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, due to last-minute battery component issues, even those first orders have now slipped back to 2022.</p>
<p><strong>In an update email sent to impacted pre-orderers, Panic writes:</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>As our first 5,000 finished Playdate units arrived at our warehouse in California for 2021, we began to test a few of them. We quickly became concerned that some of them weren’t giving us the battery life we expected. Playdate’s battery is designed to last a very long time, and always be ready for you, even if not used for a while. But that was not the case: in fact, we found a number of units with batteries so drained, Playdate wouldn’t power on at all — and couldn’t be charged. That’s a battery worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball, and we halted production at the factory.</p>
<p>The conclusion?</p>
<p>We made the difficult, expensive decision to replace all of our existing batteries with brand new ones, from a totally different battery supplier.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Panic goes on to note that they&#8217;ve received new batteries and they&#8217;re now working as hoped … but shipping everything back to Malaysia, swapping out the batteries and getting them back across the ocean is going to take a while.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company also discovered that the CPU it planned to use for all Playdate units shipped in 2022 is now backordered for literal years.</p>
<blockquote><p>With lots of pre-orders in place, we immediately placed an order at our factory for all the parts needed for 2022 units and beyond. The response was … sobering. Many of our parts have been delayed significantly. In fact, we can’t get any more of Playdate’s current CPU for — you’re not going to believe this — two years. Like, 730 days.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve heard about the “global chip shortage” everyone’s talking about? We’re here to say it is very real. Covid-19 caused an ever-cascading set of worldwide supply chain failures that are leading to many, many electronic parts being simply … gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>To work around this, the company has redesigned Playdate&#8217;s boards to support a different CPU — one they say is more readily available, but that they don&#8217;t expect to impact the way the handheld works in any way that the user might notice.</p>
<p>The full text of Panic&#8217;s delay announcement <a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg">is available here</a>.</p>
<p>The company says that although units one through 20,000 have slipped into 2022, they don&#8217;t currently expect orders placed thus far to slip into 2023.</p>
<p>As always, hardware is hard. Add a pandemic to the mix, and, well….</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter will <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer automatically</a> crop image previews on the web after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-image-cropping-changes/">rolling out</a> full-size image previews on mobile earlier this year. On Twitter for the web, images will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline, images will look just like they did when you shot them.</p>
<p>In the past, the platform automatically cropped images to make them display in a more condensed way in the timeline, where users often scroll through without clicking on an image preview. The social media giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">tested the change</a> in March with a small subset of iOS and Android users, saying it wanted to give people an accurate preview of what an image will look like.</p>

<p>Pic looking good in the Tweet composer? That’s how it will look on the timeline.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The tweet composer will now show anyone sharing an image a preview of what it will look like before it goes live in the timeline, resolving past concerns that Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/">algorithmic cropping</a> was biased toward highlighting white faces. The automatic image cropping was also a hassle for photographers and artists, who generally prefer to have total control over how an image is displayed.</p>
<p>Although images will now likely take up more vertical space in users’ timelines on the web, it’s less of a hassle than having to manually click through images to be able to see them in their entirety.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest change comes as Twitter has been tweaking its platform and making its services more accessible. The social media giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/"> recently rolled</a> out the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. It also launched its premium subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a>, in the U.S. and New Zealand on Monday, following its initial rollout in Canada and Australia earlier this year.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-doherty-830625123/">Marcus Doherty, Ph.D.,</a> is a co-founder and chief scientist at <a href="https://quantumbrilliance.com/">Quantum Brilliance</a>. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As the quantum computing industry continues to push forward, so do the goal posts.</p>
<p>A long-sought objective was to attain quantum “supremacy” &#8212; demonstrating that a quantum computer could solve a calculation that no traditional computer on Earth could do — without requiring a practical benefit.</p>
<p>Google claimed to reach that goal with its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03213-z">landmark scientific paper</a> in 2019, but IBM notably expressed skepticism. In any case, it was an exercise in computer science that was not of any practical relevance in the real world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since the Google announcement, the industry intensified its efforts in attaining quantum “advantage,” which is defined as achieving a business or scientific advantage by exceeding the computing capacity of the largest supercomputers in a relevant application.</p>
<p>As a reference point for comparison and benchmarking, it was certainly more useful than quantum supremacy. Quantum advantage is often connected to achieving major breakthroughs in drug discovery, financial trading or battery development.</p>
<p>However, quantum advantage ignores one important point: Should we really wait around for million-qubit quantum steampunk golden chandeliers to outperform supercomputers before we consider quantum computers meaningful? Or should we focus on measuring performance improvements in comparison to the units of hardware we use in today’s classical computers, e.g., individual CPUs (central processing units), GPUs (graphics processing units) and FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays)?</p>
<p>Because what may be a more valuable goal for this still-nascent industry is achieving quantum “utility,” or usefulness, as soon as possible. Quantum utility is defined as a quantum system outperforming classical processors of comparable size, weight and power in similar environments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Accelerating commercialization</h2>
<p>Those who have examined quantum computing in any depth know the massive impact it will have on IT, business, the economy and society. A future of quantum supercomputing mainframes with exponential speedup, error-corrected qubits and quantum internet will be a very different world than the one we live in today.</p>
<p>That said, similar to the classical mainframes of the 1960s, quantum mainframes will likely remain large and fragile machines for the foreseeable future, requiring ultra-low temperatures and complex control systems to operate. Even when fully operational, there will only be a few quantum mainframes located at supercomputing and cloud-computing facilities around the world.</p>
<p>The quantum computing industry would be better off emulating the success of classical computers. When personal computers arrived in the late 1970s and early ’80s, IBM and others were able to market new models every year that offered incremental improvements over the previous models. This market dynamic is what drove Moore’s law.</p>
<p>Quantum computing needs a similar market dynamic to scale and thrive. Investors can’t be expected to keep handing out money waiting for quantum computers to outperform the few supercomputers. An annual release of new, improved and ever more “useful” quantum computers will provide the revenue assurance that will drive the long-term investment required to achieve the technology’s full potential.</p>
<p>With a never-ending supply of useful quantum systems for a variety of applications, there is no reason to wait in line to process a calculation on one of the few massive quantum mainframes available in the cloud when you can have a quantum processor right next to you, integrated with your existing classical systems. Your application may require a calculation instantaneously that &#8220;quantum in the cloud&#8221; can’t deliver in time, or you may have to rely upon on-premise or on-board compute if there is no cloud access possible.</p>
<p>Extending the idea of quantum utility, you can imagine the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal and image processing in autonomous and intelligent technologies at the network edge in robots, driverless vehicles and satellites.</li>
<li>Industry 4.0 end-point applications such as digital twins in manufacturing facilities.</li>
<li>Distributed network applications such as battlefield situations in defense.</li>
<li>Classical computing accessories, providing a boost as needed for laptops and other common devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Room-temperature quantum computing in small form factors will be required to achieve these quantum “accelerator” applications in the next few years. There are several approaches being undertaken, but the most promising is using so-called nitrogen vacancies in diamonds to make qubits.</p>
<h2>Enabling technologies</h2>
<p>Room-temperature diamond quantum computing works by leveraging an array of processor nodes each composed of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, or defects in the ultra-pure diamond lattice, as well as a cluster of nuclear spins. The nuclear spins act as the qubits of the computer, while the NV centers act as quantum buses that mediate the operations between the qubits and their input/output.</p>
<p>The primary reason why diamond quantum computers can work at room temperature is because the ultra-hard diamond serves as a kind of quantum mechanical dead space where qubits go to survive for a few hundred microseconds.</p>
<p>Quantum scientists from the University of Stuttgart in Germany pioneered many diamond quantum computing achievements in algorithms, simulations, error correction and high-fidelity operations. However, they hit a roadblock when they tried to scale systems beyond a handful of qubits because of challenges with qubit fabrication yield and precision.</p>
<p>Since then, Australian quantum scientists have found a way to address scaling issues, as well as the miniaturization and integration of the electrical, optical and magnetic control systems of diamond quantum computers. Their work will enable the scaling up of qubit numbers while simultaneously scaling down the size, weight and power of diamond quantum systems.</p>
<p>The scientists further demonstrated that compact and robust quantum accelerators were possible for mobile applications in robotics, autonomous systems and satellites, as well as massively parallelized applications for simulating molecular dynamics in drug design, chemical synthesis, energy storage and nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Because of diamond-based computing’s unique benefits, there is currently a global research effort underway involving leading academic institutions such as the University of Cambridge and Harvard University. The Australian National University’s diamond-based quantum computing research has moved into an initial commercialization phase.</p>
<p>Other types of quantum computing technology operating at room temperatures in relatively small form factors are advancing as well, including trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum computers. However, these come with requirements of either vacuum systems and/or precision laser systems. One quantum computing startup has successfully developed a trapped-ion system that fits in two server racks. However, it’s uncertain whether these types of systems can be miniaturized even further.</p>
<h2>Recalibrating assumptions</h2>
<p>For the industry to achieve the vision of quantum accelerators that deliver quantum utility, the technology must be compatible with scalable semiconductor manufacturing processes, where the qubits are formed and integrated with control systems that are robust, low-maintenance and have a lengthy operational lifespan. As classical computers showed us, the best way to do this is to miniaturize and develop integrated quantum chips.</p>
<p>Similar to the first transistors at the dawn of ubiquitous classical computing in the 1960s, the key technical challenge to achieving widespread quantum utility will be in the fabrication of integrated quantum chips. However, like classical computing, once this fabrication is performed, the devices can be simple to use and deploy.</p>
<p>While early useful quantum systems have considerably fewer qubits than quantum mainframes, they may become a focal point of the industry and prospective markets once the first integrated chips are manufactured.</p>
<p>The downstream implications are almost unimaginable — there may not be an area where a room-temperature quantum system <em>won’t</em> make a fundamental change in how we solve problems. There is a clear message to all the product designers, software developers, market forecasters and social observers here as well: The time to get your head around quantum computing is now.</p>
<p>In the near term, useful quantum computers will massively disrupt supply chains, even entire value chains. Preparing for that impact implies understanding not only the technology, but also its economic impact. And of course, there are incredible investment opportunities in a technology moving this fast as well.</p>
<p>Quantum utility also means the future of quantum can be heterogeneous &#8212; accelerators can exist alongside mainframes and be deployed for different reasons and applications. It will encourage a groundswell of cooperation as opposed to direct competition &#8212; and accelerate innovation and adoption in the quantum industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dubuy.com/">Dubuy</a>, an e-commerce platform by UAE global logistics provider DP World, has entered Kenya with plans to launch the business-to-business (B2B) site in more countries across the continent in the coming months. This marks Dubuy&#8217;s third market in East Africa, coming months after setting up in Rwanda and unveiling plans to enter <a href="https://www.dpworld.com/news/releases/dp-world-launches-e-commerce-platform-and-opens-a-new-digital-trade-corridor-for-ethiopia/">Ethiopia</a>.</p>
<p>The wholesale <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/consumables-dominate-jumias-sales-as-buyer-habits-change/">e-commerce</a> platform, owned by the government of Dubai, launched earlier this year to help businesses buy and sell goods. Purchased goods are fulfilled through the supply chain of DP World and its logistics partners.</p>
<p>The e-commerce site is set to leverage DP World’s ports (currently eight, with three more under development) and logistics network in Africa to enter new markets in the continent. DP World’s hubs in Africa are spread across Rwanda, Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Senegal, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Djibouti and Somaliland, meaning that they will likely inform its regional expansion plans. Dubuy plans to cover all of Africa by 2025.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232836" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“With the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) now in effect, the eyes of the world will be on the continent,” Mahmood Al Bastaki, CEO of Dubai Trade World and DP World, said.</p>
<p>“African businesses are increasingly using digital channels and technologies to engage with suppliers and distributors to create agile supply chains, and digital platforms like Dubuy.com will be key to this shift. Our technology allows homegrown businesses to transform into international enterprises by providing access to new markets in Africa, the Middle East and the rest of the world,” he said.</p>
<p>The site has 4,000 active merchants and so far has received 500,000 visits from sellers and buyers in Africa, they said. Automotive supplies and kitchen appliances are most in demand. Owing to working closely with governments, traders using Dubuy are said to benefit from heavily discounted shipping tariffs, and in Kenya, the platform has an arrangement with the National Bank of Kenya for trade finance.</p>
<p>Online marketplaces have increasingly become important avenues of growth for small and medium businesses in Africa, yet the continent accounts for a small share of global e-commerce due to a number of factors, including internet connection and cost of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1190579/number-of-online-shoppers-in-africa/">only about 25%</a> of Africa’s 1.2 billion population are e-commerce users, but this is set to grow steadily as the cost of internet dips and connectivity deepens. About 28% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is connected to mobile internet, but this is expected to grow to about 40% by 2025, according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>.</p>
<p>Kenya is ranked among the top 100 fastest growing e-commerce economies in the world, according to the <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tn_unctad_ict4d17_en.pdf">2020 UNCTAD B2C Commerce Index</a>. About 72.9% of the population uses mobile money account, while 26.1% are active e-shoppers and pay bills online, making the country ripe for e-commerce.</p>
<p>Across Africa, Jumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform, leading hundreds of other B2C sites, including Chinese-owned Kilimall, Nigeria’s Marketplace Africa and South Africa’s bidorbuy.</p>
