</div><p id="speakable-summary">As developers unlock new AI tools, the risk for perpetuating harmful biases becomes increasingly high — especially on the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/ai-is-struggling-to-adjust-to-2020/">year like 2020</a>, which reimagined many of our social and cultural norms upon which AI algorithms have long been trained.</p>
<p>A handful of foundational models are emerging that rely upon a magnitude of training data that makes them inherently powerful, but it’s not without risk of harmful biases — and we need to collectively acknowledge that fact.</p>
<p>Recognition in itself is easy. Understanding is much harder, as is mitigation against future risks. Which is to say that we must first take steps to ensure that we understand the roots of these biases in an effort to better understand the risks involved with developing AI models.</p>
<h2>The sneaky origins of bias</h2>
<p>Today’s AI models are often pre-trained and open source, which allows researchers and companies alike to implement AI quickly and tailor it to their specific needs.</p>
<p>While this approach makes AI more commercially available, there’s a real downside — namely, that a handful of models now underpin the majority of AI applications across industries and continents. These systems are burdened by undetected or unknown biases, meaning developers who adapt them for their applications are working from a fragile foundation.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> by Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models, any biases within these foundational models or the data upon which they’re built are inherited by those using them, creating potential for amplification.</p>
<p>For example, YFCC100M is a publicly available data set from Flickr that is commonly used to train models. When you examine the images of people within this data set, you’ll see that the distribution of images around the world is <a href="http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/browse?q=person&amp;adj=&amp;m=b">heavily skewed toward the U.S.</a>, meaning there’s a lack of representation of people from other regions and cultures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These types of skews in training data result in AI models that have under- or overrepresentation biases in their output — i.e., an output that is more dominant for white or Western cultures. When multiple data sets are combined to create large sets of training data, there is a lack of transparency, and it can become increasingly difficult to know if you have a balanced mix of people, regions and cultures. It’s no surprise that the resulting AI models are published with egregious biases contained therein.</p>
<p>Further, when foundational AI models are published, there is typically little to no information provided around their limitations. Uncovering potential issues is left to the end user to test — a step that is often overlooked. Without transparency and a complete understanding of a particular data set, it’s challenging to detect the limitations of an AI model, such as lower performance for women, children or developing nations.</p>
<p>At Getty Images, we evaluate whether bias is present in our computer vision models with a series of tests that include images of real, lived experiences, including people with varying levels of abilities, gender fluidity and health conditions. While we can’t catch all biases, we recognize the importance of visualizing an inclusive world and feel it’s important to understand the ones that may exist and confront them when we can.</p>
<h2>Leveraging metadata to mitigate biases</h2>
<p>So, how do we do this? When working with AI at Getty Images, we start by reviewing the breakdown of people across a training data set, including age, gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re able to do this because we require a model release for the creative content that we license. This allows us to include self-identified information in our metadata (i.e., a set of data that describes other data), which enables our AI team to automatically search across millions of images and quickly identify skews in the data. Open source data sets are often limited by a lack of metadata, a problem that is exacerbated when combining data sets from multiple sources to create a larger pool.</p>
<p>But let’s be realistic: Not all AI teams have access to expansive metadata, and ours isn’t perfect either. An inherent tradeoff exists &#8212; larger training data that leads to more powerful models at the expense of understanding skews and biases in that data.</p>
<p>As an AI industry, it’s crucial that we find a way to overcome this tradeoff given that industries and people globally depend upon it. The key is increasing our focus on data-centric AI models, <a href="https://eval.how/dcai2021/index.html">a movement beginning to take stronger hold</a>.</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Confronting biases in AI is no small feat and will take collaboration across the tech industry in the coming years. However, there are precautionary steps that practitioners can take now to make small but notable changes.</p>
<p>For example, when foundational models are published, we could release the corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf">data sheet</a> describing the underlying training data, providing descriptive statistics of what is in the data set. Doing so would provide subsequent users with a sense of a model’s strengths and limitations, empowering them to make informed decisions. The impact could be huge.</p>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> on foundational models poses the question, “What is the right set of statistics over the data to provide adequate documentation, without being too costly or difficult to obtain?” For visual data specifically, researchers would ideally provide the distributions of age, gender, race, religion, region, abilities, sexual orientation, health conditions and more. But, this metadata is costly and difficult to obtain on large data sets from multiple sources.</p>
<p>A complementary approach would be for AI developers to have access to a running list of known biases and common limitations for foundational models. This could include developing a database of easily accessible tests for biases that AI researchers could regularly contribute to, especially given how people use these models.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter recently facilitated a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-bug-bounties-help-find-biased-algorithms-this-competition-put-the-idea-to-the-test/">competition</a> that challenged AI experts to expose biases in their algorithms (Remember when I said that recognition and awareness are key toward mitigation?). We need more of this, everywhere. Practicing crowdsourcing like this on a regular basis could help reduce the burden on individual practitioners.</p>
<p>We don’t have all of the answers yet, but as an industry, we need to take a hard look at the data we are using as the solution to more powerful models. Doing so comes at a cost –- amplifying biases — and we need to accept the role we play within the solution. We need to look for ways to more deeply understand the training data we are using, especially when AI systems are used to represent or interact with real people.</p>
<p>This shift in thinking will help companies of all types and sizes quickly spot skews and counteract them in the development stage, dampening the biases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK published its first ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">national AI strategy</a> this week. The decade-long commitment by the government to levelling up domestic artificial intelligence capabilities &#8212; by directing resource and attention toward skills, talent, compute power and data access &#8212; has been broadly welcomed by the country&#8217;s tech ecosystem, as you&#8217;d expect.</p>
<p>But there is a question mark over how serious government is about turning the UK into a &#8220;global AI superpower&#8221; given the lack of a funding announcement to accompany the publication.</p>
<p>A better hint is likely to come shortly, with the spending review tabled for October 27 &#8212; which will set out public spending plans for the next three years.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, TechCrunch spoke to Marc Warner, CEO of UK AI startup Faculty, who said government needs to show it&#8217;s serious about providing long term support to develop the UK&#8217;s capabilities and global competitiveness with an appropriate level of funding &#8212; while welcoming the &#8220;genuine ambition&#8221; he believes the government is showing to support AI.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bXaPc09RiS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">UK announces a national strategy to &#8216;level up&#8217; AI</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK announces a national strategy to &#8216;level up&#8217; AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/embed/#?secret=bXaPc09RiS" data-secret="bXaPc09RiS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Warner&#8217;s startup, which closed a $42M growth round of funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/flush-with-42m-hot-ai-startup-faculty-plans-to-hoover-up-more-phds-and-steer-clear-of-politics/">earlier this year</a>, has started its own internal education program to attract PhDs into the company and turn out future data scientists. While Warner himself is also a member of the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ai-council">AI Council</a>, an expert advisory group that provides advice to government and which was consulted on the strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a really pretty good strategy,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a genuine ambition in it which is relatively rare for government and they recognize some of the most important things that we need to fix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The problem &#8212; and it&#8217;s a huge problem &#8212; is that there are currently no numbers attached to this.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while in principle there&#8217;s lots of great stuff in there, in practice it&#8217;s totally critical that it&#8217;s actually backed by the funding that it needs &#8212; and has the commitment of the wider gov to the high quality execution that doing some of these things are going to require.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner warned of the risk of the promising potential of a &#8220;pretty serious strategy&#8221; fading away if it&#8217;s not matched with an appropriate &#8212; dare we say it, &#8216;world beating&#8217; &#8212; level of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question for the spending review but it seems to me very easy now that having done &#8212; what looks like a really pretty serious strategy &#8212; then&#8230; it fades into a much more generic strategy off the back of not really willing to make the funding commitments, not really willing to push through on the execution side and actually make these things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what level of funding he&#8217;d like to see government putting behind the strategy to deliver on its long term ambitions, Warner said the UK needs to aim high &#8212; and do so on a global stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can look around the world and look at the commitments that other countries are making to their AI strategies which are in the hundred of millions to low billions,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;And if we are serious about being globally competitive &#8212; which the strategy is, and I think we should be &#8212; then we&#8217;re talking at least matching the funding of other countries, if not exceeding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately it comes down to where does this rank in their priority list and if they want to deliver on an ambitious strategy it&#8217;s got to be high,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Access to talent</h2>
<p>Discussing the broad detail of what the strategy says is needed for the UK to up its AI game, Warner highlighted talent as a key component.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a technical field like AI talent is a huge deal. There&#8217;s a global competition for that talent. And it seems like the government is taking that seriously and hopefully going to take actions to make sure the UK has all the talent it needs for this kind of stuff &#8212; from a skills perspective and training up people but also from a visa perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From our perspective it&#8217;s just wonderful to be able to access some of the most talented people from across the world to come and work on important problems and so the easier that it can be made for those people &#8212; or for organizations, whether it&#8217;s universities or charities or companies like us or even government departments to start to be able to hire those people it&#8217;s just a massive step forward,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice that they&#8217;re taking computing and data seriously,&#8221; he went on, discussing other elements of the strategy. &#8220;Obviously those are the two fuels for the set of techniques of machine learning that are sort of the foundation of modern AI. And having the government think about how we can make that more accessible is clearly a great thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the fact that they&#8217;re thinking about the long term risks of AI is novel and basically important,&#8221; he also said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think they&#8217;re relatively honest that our adoption is weaker than we&#8217;d like, as a country, as a set of businesses. And hopefully recognizing that and thinking seriously about how we might go about fixing it &#8212; so, all in all, from a strategy perspective it&#8217;s actually very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strategy also talks about the need to establish “clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment” for AI. But the UK is already lagging on that front &#8212; with the European Union proposing an AI Regulation earlier this year.</p>

<p>Asked for his views on AI regulation Warner advocated for domain-specific rules.</p>
<h2>Domain specific AI rules</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it would be a big mistake to regulate at the level of just artificial intelligence. Because that&#8217;s sort of equivalent to regulating steel where you don&#8217;t know whether the steel is going to be used in girders or in a knife or a gun,&#8221; he suggested. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Either you pick the kind of legislation that we have around girders and it becomes incredibly lax around the people who are using the steel to make guns  or you pick the kind of legislation that we have around guns and it becomes almost impossible to make the girders.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while it&#8217;s totally critical that we regulate AI effectively that is almost certainly done in a domain-specific fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave the example of AIs used in health contexts, such as for diagnosis, as a domain that would naturally require tighter regulation &#8212; whereas a use-case like ecommerce would likely not need such guardrails, he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the government recognizes this in the strategy,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It does talk about making sure the regulation is really thoughtfully attuned to the domain. And that just seems very sensible to me.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it&#8217;s extremely important that AI is done well and safely and for the benefit of society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s proposed risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI does have a focus on certain domains and use-cases &#8212; which are classified as higher or lower risk, with regulatory requirements varying accordingly. But <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Warner said he hasn&#8217;t yet studied the EU proposal in enough detail to have a view on their approach.  </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the Faculty CEO for his views on the UK government&#8217;s simultaneous push to &#8216;reform&#8217; the current data protection framework &#8212; which includes consulting on changes that could weaken protections for people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>Critics of the reform plan suggest it risks a race to the bottom on privacy standards.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My view would be that it&#8217;s absolutely critical that uses of AI are both legal and legitimate,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;As in, if people knew what was being done with their data they would be completely comfortable with what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Data legitimacy</h2>
<p>Faculty&#8217;s AI business was in existence (albeit under a different name) before the UK&#8217;s version of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was transposed into national law &#8212; although the prior regime was broadly similar. So existing rules don&#8217;t appear to have harmed its prospects as a high value and growing UK AI business.</p>
<p>Given that, might the government&#8217;s appetite to reduce the level of data protection that UK citizens enjoy &#8212; with the claim that doing so would somehow be &#8216;good for innovation&#8217; &#8212; actually be rather counterproductive for AI businesses which need the trust of users to flourish? (Plus, of course, if any UK AI businesses want to do business in the European Union they would need to comply with the GDPR.)</p>
<p>&#8220;GDPR is not perfect,&#8221; argued Warner. &#8220;If you speak to anyone I think that&#8217;s widely recognized &#8212; so I don&#8217;t think that the way it&#8217;s being framed as a choice between one or other, I think we can do better than both and I think that&#8217;s what we should aim for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are lots of ways that we can &#8212; over time &#8212; be better at regulating these things. So that we maintain the absolute best in class for legitimacy around the use of these technologies which is obviously totally critical for companies like us that want to do business in a way that&#8217;s widely accepted and even encouraged in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically I don&#8217;t think we should compromise but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a choice between just following GDPR or not. It&#8217;s more complicated than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting there have been a number of high profile data scandals emanating from the UK in recent years.</p>
<p>And Faculty &#8212; in its pre-rebranding guise as <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/were-there-any-links-between-cambridge-analytica-russia-and-brexit-">ASI Data Science</a> &#8212; was intimately involved in controversial use of data for targeting ads at voters during the UK&#8217;s Brexit vote, for example.</p>
<p>Although it has since said it will never do political work again.</p>
<h2>Political campaigning</h2>
<p>ASI Data Science&#8217;s corporate rebranding followed revelations around the data-mining activities of the now defunct and disgraced data company, Cambridge Analytica &#8212; which broke into a global scandal in 2018, and led to parliamentarians around the world asking awkward questions about the role of data and predictive modelling to try to sway voters.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s information commissioner even called for an &#8220;ethical pause&#8221; on the use of data and AI tools for political add targeting, warning that trust in democracy was being undermined by big data techniques opaquely targeting voters with custom political messaging.</p>
<p>During the Brexit referendum, Warner worked with the UK government&#8217;s former special advisor, Dominic Cummings, who was a director for the Vote Leave campaign. And Cummings has written extensively that data scientists played a crucial role in winning the Brexit vote &#8212; writing, for instance, in a <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/2016/10/29/on-the-referendum-20-the-campaign-physics-and-data-science-vote-leaves-voter-intention-collection-system-vics-now-available-for-all/">2016 blog post</a> on how data science and AI was used in the referendum, that:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of our central ideas was that the campaign had to do things in the field of data that have never been done before. This included a) integrating data from social media, online advertising, websites, apps, canvassing, direct mail, polls, online fundraising, activist feedback, and some new things we tried such as a new way to do polling&#8230; and b) having experts in physics and machine learning do proper data science in the way only they can – i.e. far beyond the normal skills applied in political campaigns. We were the first campaign in the UK to put almost all our money into digital communication then have it partly controlled by people whose normal work was subjects like quantum information (combined with political input from Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete, and digital specialists AIQ). We could only do this properly if we had proper canvassing software. We built it partly in-house and partly using an external engineer who we sat in our office for months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this infamous episode in his company&#8217;s history, we asked Warner if he would be supportive of AI rules that limit how the technology can be used for political campaigning?</p>
<p>The UK government has not made such a proposal but it is eyeing changing in election law &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/uk-eyeing-disclosure-labels-for-online-political-campaigning/">disclosure labels</a> for online political campaigning.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Faculty as an organization is not interested in politics anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;re thinking about,&#8221; was Warner&#8217;s response on this. </span></p>
<p>Pushed again on whether he would support limits on AI in the political campaigning domain, he added: &#8220;From Faculty&#8217;s perspective we don&#8217;t do politics anymore. I think it&#8217;s up to the government what they think it&#8217;s best around that area.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Noops is going after the $50 billion snack foods market and plans to take on yogurt next.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after securing <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noops-is-flippin-snacks-with-brand-launch-and-closes-on-a-2-million-pre-seed-investment-round-301095789.html">$2 million in pre-seed funding</a>, plant-based pudding startup <a href="https://eatnoops.com/">Noops</a> is announcing an additional $2 million round led by Lerer Hippeau.</p>
<p>The Long Island-based company was founded in 2019 by Hungryroot co-founder Gregory Harry Struck after he adopted a plant-based diet while battling cancer.</p>
<p>“It was born out of a need when a lot of things were eliminated for me,” Struck told TechCrunch. “During this period of change, I thought about consumption and how it affects our well-being and health system.”</p>
<p>Struck recalls a time in the grocery store looking in the dairy case for yogurt, catching a glimpse of pudding and wondering why this product had never been reimagined, nutrition-wise. He went home, turned his house into a commercial kitchen and began experimenting with recipes, sometimes using his three young children as taste-testers.</p>
<p>When Struck found a recipe that worked, he started handing the pudding out to friends and family and ultimately started Noops. The company’s first product is an oat milk-based line that is organic, free of dairy and gluten, contains prebiotics, plant protein and fiber, and has no added sugar. The pudding comes in traditional flavors like chocolate, caramel, mocha and vanilla.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Immi takes in $3.8M to cook up plant-based instant ramen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/immi-takes-in-3-8m-to-cook-up-plant-based-instant-ramen/embed/#?secret=fltHbpxlnM" data-secret="fltHbpxlnM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Joining Lerer Hippeau in the investment are Siddhi Capital, Idea Farm Ventures, Simple Food Ventures, Animal Capital and American Pie executive Alan Mitzner. The latest round gives the company a total of $5 million raised to date, Struck said.</p>
<p>“This, for us, is very significant in terms of having a partner like Lerer Hippeau believe in us that we can be the next-generation,” he added. “And for us, we know exactly where we are going and can see the future and be a part of it.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment Larry Appel, former CEO of The Fresh Market, and Benjamin McKean, CEO of Hungryroot, will join the company’s advisory board.</p>
<p>Andrea Hippeau, partner at Lerer Hippeau, agreed, saying that it was Struck himself, and his background, that led to the firm’s belief that he could make an impact on the plant-based food category and build a strong company. The plant-based foods market was valued at $29.4 billion in 2020, <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/plant-based-market-skyrocket/">according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report</a>, and is poised to <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/plant-based-food-market-worth-74-billion-by-2027/">grow to $74 billion by 2027</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As investors in the space, Hippeau said the firm is looking at this category as “the next generation of consumables that will be hitting every category.” And, while the food type has reached a number of categories, like meat and seafood, there is not much in the space of pudding, nor have incumbents come out with better-for-you options, Hippeau said.</p>
<p>In fact, of the $348 billion in annual sales generated by the top 25 food and beverage incumbents in the U.S., some $50 billion of the sales can be attributable to snack brands, like Jell-O, which contain animal byproducts and have remained unchanged since launching in 1897, Struck said.</p>
<p>“Grocers are looking for the plant-based alternatives,” Hippeau said. “Noops is making a pudding with the same flavors people like and nutritional to take yogurt on head-on. Gregory and his team understood this and had those connections already established when they came to us.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will go to grow Noops’ distribution channels and network as it services retailers and direct-to-consumers, develop additional partnerships, make some key hires in finance and sales, bring on a second manufacturing partner as it aims to triple production and create more flavors and products, including a breakfast line that will develop a yogurt alternative.</p>
<p>Noops officially launched in Q1 of 2021 and is now available in more than 750 locations of retailers, including Sprouts Farmers Market and Wegmans Foods Markets. In addition, since its pre-launch in 2020, the company has doubled its projected numbers. It intends to launch in Fresh Thyme this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is working on a number of new devices including an Echo with a 15-inch wall-mounted display, a soundbar, new Echo Auto technology and wearables. Some may appear fairly soon at the company&#8217;s September 28th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fall-hardware-event-september-28-181440028.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">hardware event</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.</p>
<p>The splashiest-looking product would be an Alexa-enabled Echo with a display size around 15-inches. Codenamed Hoya, it could not only be placed on a stand like a regular Echo device, but mounted on a wall as well. It would serve as a smart-home center to control lights, cameras, locks and other devices, while showing weather, timers, appointments, photos and more. It&#8217;s specifically designed to work in the kitchen, displaying recipes and YouTube cooking videos, while letting you stream Netflix and other apps.</p>
<p>The company may also announce its own soundbar, codenamed Harmony, to accompany a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">rumored lineup</a> of Amazon-branded TVs. Unlike third-party Alexa-enabled soundbars, it would have a front-facing camera and support video calls from TVs, much like Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Portal TV</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s reportedly developing a new version of Echo Auto (codenamed Marion). The updated version will supposedly have a new design and allow for device charging via inductive technology. Amazon currently has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-alexa-built-in-120032156.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">partnership with Ford</a> to put Alexa in 700,000 vehicles, but it&#8217;s apparently looking to team up with other automakers, too.</p>
<p>Other items in the works include new Echo speakers for 2022 and wearables for kids and seniors (the latter with fall detection). It&#8217;s also reportedly building dedicated processors to improve artificial intelligence along with new technology to help its Fire TV, Echo and other devices work better together.</p>
<p>The company has some other, somewhat more unusual products in the works as well, according to the report. It has been working on a home robot codenamed Vesta that would use the Alexa interface and also an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone — though team working on that project was reportedly disbanded.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Avenue is building a command center for operations teams.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://avenue.so/">Avenue</a> launched Friday to give operations their own tools to monitor teams, and is building a “command center” for this area of business that is often forgotten, co-founder and CEO Justin Bleuel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch the company is announcing $4 million in seed funding, led by Accel, with participation from Flexport and a group of individual investors from companies like Coinbase, Uber, Stripe and Thumbtack.</p>
<p>Bleuel and his co-founder, Jeff Barg, grew up building iOS apps together and then went their separate ways, Bleuel to Uber and Barg to Amazon. While at Uber, Bleuel was working on observability — passive or proactive monitoring — building a lot of the tools in-house to monitor the marketplace for data like rider experience.</p>
<p>Both saw an opening to build these tools themselves for operations teams, and Avenue was born. The technology enables business teams to set up alerts to observe when there is a problem with data, act on it correctly and improve how the overall team functions, think “Datadog or PagerDuty for operations teams,” Bleuel said.</p>
<p>“Data is now all centralized in data warehouses, so you can build on top of them in a way you could not before, like Fivetran, and activate off of it,” he added. “You used to have to build one-to-one alerts for each tool, but now we can actively direct them from the warehouse.”</p>

<p>The company, founded in 2020, came out of the Y Combinator winter 2021 cohort, and one of its early customers is food pickup service Snackpass, which is using Avenue to monitor uptime and receive notifications when restaurant partners, for example, have an ordering tablet battery die or lose Wi-Fi. Snackpass is able to contact the location and help them figure out why they went offline. As a result, the company was able to cut the percentage of offline stores in half, Bleuel said.</p>
<p>Avenue’s customer sweet spot is marketplace companies or warehouses for monitoring stock. However, the co-founders are also seeing their technology being used by other companies, like furniture delivery companies, to monitor for reliability or know their inventory levels. Customers are also packaging up reports and sharing them with other internal teams on how to improve operations.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the funding to build on its small team of three, especially in engineering to be able to go to market with new products, Barg said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Avenue is working with more than 50 companies and since April has sent out over 200,000 alerts. The company’s model bills customers per alert per month, and the team is looking at a freemium model as well as enterprise levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amit Kumar, partner at Accel, said via email the firm is “very thesis-driven,” one of them being the modern data stack. Accel made early investments into companies like Airbyte, Monte Carlo and Privacer, and saw opportunity for new downstream applications based on the innovation, of which Avenue stood out.</p>
<p>The combination of Bleuel and Barg was “particularly compelling because of their fluency with the problem space” due to their backgrounds at Uber and Amazon and experiencing firsthand how “poorly served” operations teams are and how that can affect the overall business.</p>
<p>He believes the current approach of ops teams in the market today relies heavily on dashboarding, periodic sweeps and color-coded Excel sheets — a process that is “often inaccurate and disorganized.” At the same time, product engineers were flush with well-established tools around observability and incident response.</p>
<p>“Given the rise of &#8216;atoms&#8217; startups powered by a cohort of ex-Uber and ex-Amazon operators, Justin and Jeff were uniquely positioned to find early design partners and customers among their peer networks,” Kumar added. “As ops teams become both increasingly commonplace and essential to business outcomes, I expect their processes to mature and benefit from similar tooling. This is the thesis behind Avenue, and early traction indicates that next-gen leading ops-heavy companies agree.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s central bank said on Friday that all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal in the country and they must be banned, citing concerns around national security and &#8220;safety of people&#8217;s assets.&#8221; The world&#8217;s most populated nation also said that foreign exchanges are banned from providing services to users in the country.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, ten Chinese government agencies vowed to work closely to maintain a &#8220;high pressure&#8221; crackdown on trading of cryptocurrencies in the nation. The People&#8217;s Bank of China separately ordered internet, financial and payment companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trading on their platforms.</p>
<p>The central bank said cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Tether, cannot be circulated in the market as they are not fiat currency. The surge in usage of cryptocurrencies has disrupted &#8220;economic and financial order,&#8221; and prompted a proliferation of &#8220;money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes and other illegal and criminal activities,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Offenders, the central bank warned, will be &#8220;investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese government will &#8220;resolutely clamp down on virtual currency speculation, and related financial activities and misbehaviour in order to safeguard people&#8217;s properties and maintain economic, financial and social order,&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move has already started to cause panic among some crypto traders, sending the price of bitcoin and several other currencies down. Bitcoin was down 5.5% at the time of publication.</p>
<p>China, home to some of the world&#8217;s largest crypto mining services, is also going after those businesses. The National Development and Reform Commission said it was launching a nationwide cleanup of cryptocurrency mining &#8212; a task it said was &#8220;imperative.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is not the first time China has declared a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related activities, but until now so many government agencies had not collaborated on such efforts.</p>
<p>Regulators in China have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/china-considers-ban-crypto-mining/">weighing a ban on crypto mining</a> for several years. But in recent quarters, several local firms have started to embrace crypto. Chinese app maker Meitu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/china-meitu-crypto-investment/">bought Bitcoin and Ether worth $40 million</a> in March.</p>
<p>Some are optimistic. Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific business with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore, said in a tweet that, &#8220;China has banned crypto more times than one can count.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has launched Prime Video Channels in India, allowing its customers to subscribe to eight streaming services including Discovery+ and Mubi from one hub (Prime Video website or app), the latest in a series of efforts by the U.S. giant to win customers in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The new offering makes it easier for users to login and pay for additional streaming services, the company said. To make things more enticing, Amazon said the services are available at discounted prices for the first year. Discovery+ costs $4 per year, Mubi $27, Hoichoi ($8.2), DocuBay $6.8, ErosNow $4, Lionsgate Play $9.5, manoramaMax $9.5, and ShortsTV $4.</p>
<p>The company, which is currently at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/amazon-starts-probe-over-bribe-to-govt-officials-by-its-lawyers-in-india-report-says/">centre of several controversies in India</a>, did not share how much of the revenue it is taking from the streaming services and the duration of the partnerships, which are not exclusive. India is the 12th market where Amazon has launched Prime Video Channels.</p>
<p>Friday’s launch is likely to prove more beneficial to the third-party streaming partners. All the partner services are currently struggling to make inroads in the country. Discovery+ app had fewer than 4 million monthly active users in India last month, for instance. Every other app had fewer than 1 million monthly active users, some didn&#8217;t even have 200,000, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>“With the launch of Prime Video Channels, we now take the next big step in our journey to entertain India by creating a video entertainment marketplace – first of its kind in India – which will not only delight our customers by giving them even more entertainment choices, but also benefit the OTT Channel partners who collaborate with us to leverage Prime Video’s distribution, reach and tech infrastructure,” said Gaurav Gandhi, Country Manager of Amazon Prime Video India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Video, which has amassed over 55 million monthly active users in India, competes with Netflix, Disney’s Hotstar and Times Internet’s MX Player in the country. Both Hotstar and MX Player have established larger reach than Prime Video in India, and Netflix has courted most elite customers in the country.</p>
<p>The e-commerce group, on its part, has attempted to push for more reach by securing some rights to cricket matches &#8212; though the vast majority of those rights are still owned by Hotstar &#8212; and has also launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">free, ad-supported streaming service</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups have spent the last decade trying to offer every variation of Airbnb that they can imagine. But <a href="https://www.stayukio.com/">Ukio</a> thinks it has found a way through the ever-growing tangle of housing rental competitors — and regulators — right as remote work becomes the norm.</p>
<p>It offers rentals of one month or longer, featuring a turnkey premium experience in prime city locations in partnership with local property owners. The initial results are promising.</p>
<p>The Barcelona, Spain-based company was founded early last year and has grown to more than 100 apartments between that city and Madrid while maintaining a 95% occupancy rate.</p>
<p>Today it is announcing a large-sized seed round of $9 million from top European investors, with plans to scale to more than 700 apartments across six continental capitals in 2022. Lisbon is the next city on the list, followed by London and Berlin.</p>
<p>Ukio&#8217;s guests so far are split nearly evenly between two use-cases, according to cofounder and CEO Stanley Fourteau*. One half is composed of new long-term residents who have landed local jobs and will eventually move into permanent housing. So far, this group tends to stay six months or longer.</p>
<p>A longtime director at Airbnb, Fourteau says that the mainstreaming of remote and distributed work has also brought in a growing group of digital nomad types who are looking for something more than a short-term rental. This half of the user base tends to stay around two or three months, to date.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2207912" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg 5967w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/INDAH-JUNGLE-0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>To indicate that market opportunity, he cited <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-22-gartner-forecasts-51-percent-of-global-knowledge-workers-will-be-remote-by-2021">Gartner report</a> showing the remote-worker demographic could grow to 31% of all workers by the end of this year. But TechCrunch readers might find that number a little conservative. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">Proptech investors who I surveyed for Extra Crunch</a> in March, for example, described office space as being more of a luxury in the future, with more workers living wherever they wanted — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/the-return-of-neighborhood-retail-and-other-surprising-real-estate-trends/">places with fun &#8220;third spaces&#8221;</a> for entertainment and community, like what many European cities are known for.</p>
<p>Ukio, which is Japanese for “living in the moment,” is hardly the only startup aiming for this changing demographic. A few prominent ones from a long list of them include Blueground, Sonder, Sentinel and Zeus (plus Airbnb’s long-term rental options). So what’s different here?</p>
<p>“Ukio rents, furnishes and manages properties to oversee the entire guest experience,” Fourteau explains. “Our vertically integrated approach allows us to professionalize supply for platforms such as Airbnb (a peer-to-peer marketplace), similarly to how global hotel chains professionalize supply for Booking.com.”</p>
<p>The idea originated from his time at Airbnb, where user demand for long-term rentals never really fit with the company’s platform model. “The core focus of [that] company is in strengthening their relationships with and growing their host community,” he says. If Airbnb were to build a vertically integrated rental operator like Ukio, “it would compete with their existing community and could compromise its relationship with them.”</p>
<p>Today, he says, the most desirable long-term rentals in a city get taken before they get posted on Airbnb, or are snatched up from the platform well before demand is met. Ukio-operated apartments, on the other hand, “will be a part of that community for many years to come.”</p>
<p>Ukio’s relationship with property owners is another way of creating a moat around key locations, he believes. “We engage in 7-10 year lease contracts with full tenant management. These agreements optimize their returns, avoiding vacancy rates and reducing management costs. Ukio provides them guaranteed yields and offers a hassle free solution. As a business, we now receive more inbound requests from landlords wanting to work with Ukio than targeted outreach, with a strong supply pipeline for growth in the next year.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2207914" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="896" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=768,672 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=680,595 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=1536,1344 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-8.46.50-PM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Here’s a more granular look at what he sees providing the differentiation long-term, paraphrased for brevity: Ukio uses a 200-point process to choose potential apartments and only works with the owners of the best ones in prime locations. Many of these are single units, which allows for more of a mix spread across a city than startups like Sentral that use entire buildings. Each unit also gets a unique design, versus the templated approach of Blueground and some others. While many competitors are primarily platforms with hosts providing and managing their own units, Ukio has an internal team to manage all properties. It’s also starting out with a focus on Europe, whereas many of its most direct competitors like Zeus are focused on the US.</p>
<p>On the tech side, in addition to the supply acquisition tool, it uses a dynamic pricing model to help keep occupancy high, and an internal design system and catalogue to reduce installation and onboarding costs. Ukio’s product-focused cofounder, Stanley&#8217;s brother Jeremy, has a decade of experience from key roles at Zynga, EA, Headspace and most recently Knotel.</p>
<p>As a company whose core product is physical, Ukio faces risks of tightening local regulations as well as COVID-related restrictions. Fourteau (Stanley) acknowledged the issues but argued that Ukio’s company’s particular model is better suited to cope because it is getting such heavy usage from long-term locals. The bigger question in this phase seems to be Ukio’s various well-funded competitors, who will no doubt tweak their models repeatedly to attract the remote workers of the future.</p>
<p>And so, this need for rapid scaling is the context for the large-sized seed round. It was led by French venture firm Breega with participation from Heartcore and Partech, and angels including Iñaki Berenguer, founder of Coverwallet, and Avi Meir, founder of Travelperk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank is gaga for startups in Latin America. Since first announcing it was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-5-billion-latin-america-tech-fund.html">planting a stake</a> in the ground in the region in early 2019, the Japanese conglomerate  &#8212; from its own balance sheet, it says &#8212; has plugged more than $5 billion into the region, and it expects that number to top $8 billion by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Its capital contributions are meaningful, to say the least. In 2019, startups across Latin America raised $5.3 billion in funding, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">according to CB Insights</a>. In 2020, they raised roughly the same amount.</p>
<p>This year, the pace of dealmaking has shifted into overdrive, with $9.3 billion plugged into Latin American startups in the first six months, and SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure believes that by 2023, closer to $30 billion will be invested in the region annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, the world has realized that Latin America has size,&#8221; said Claure, a native of Bolivia, today at TechCrunch Disrupt. &#8220;It&#8217;s only half of China, but it&#8217;s two times the size of India, and three times the size of Southeast Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>More, he said, people are making money there. &#8220;Latin America has the same GDP per capita &#8212; $9,000 to $10,000 per year &#8212;  as China, and that&#8217;s three times (GDP per capita) in India and two times what people are making in Southeast Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>It&#8217;s a me, Burt Macklin! </em>Chris Pratt is voice acting as Mario in a feature film that Nintendo is working on with Illumination, the studio that made &#8220;Despicable Me.&#8221; Also, they didn&#8217;t tell us at Nintendo Direct who the new &#8220;Smash&#8221; fighter is. But we can&#8217;t be too disappointed, because apparently Anya Taylor-Joy is Peach, Jack Black is Bowser, Charlie Day is Luigi and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/seth-rogen-explains-how-houseplant-promotes-cannabis-without-breaking-the-rules/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">recent TechCrunch Disrupt guest</a> (shameless plug) Seth Rogen is Donkey Kong, giving me <a href="https://twitter.com/El_Silvero/status/1441168463892860932">the representation I always wanted</a> from Nintendo.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#8217;ll have to wait until December 2022 to see whether that&#8217;s a flop or a hit, but other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">recent TechCrunch Disrupt guest</a> Ryan Reynolds absolutely killed it as the titular &#8220;Detective Pikachu&#8221; in 2019, so let&#8217;s go into this with an open mind.</p>

<p>But, in terms of exciting things, we won&#8217;t have to wait a long time for&#8230; Nintendo unveiled that for the first time since announcing its online subscription Nintendo Switch service in September 2018, it will add a new subscription tier. This tier, called the Nintendo Switch Online+ Expansion membership, will offer access to games from Nintendo 64 and SEGA, like &#8220;Super Mario 64,&#8221; &#8220;Mario Kart 64&#8221; (which you can play online with up to four players), &#8220;Yoshi&#8217;s Story,&#8221; &#8220;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&#8221; and &#8220;Castlevania: Bloodlines,&#8221; with more to be added over time. Nintendo didn&#8217;t say how much this will cost, but it will be available in late October.</p>

A free update will hit our islands in November, and more details will be revealed in an October edition of Nintendo Direct, focused on &#8220;Animal Crossing.&#8221; But, today&#8217;s livestream teased that players will gain access to the Roost, a café inside of the Museum. This cozy hangout previously appeared in other games, like &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Leaf.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 23, 2021. We just put the final bow on Disrupt, which went pretty damn well. Thanks to everyone who came out, and, of course, a big huzzah to the winner of Startup Battlefield (more below).</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/announcing-tc-sessions-saas-on-october-27/">next event is SaaS-focused</a>, so be sure to mark your calendars! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2021-is-cellino/">Cellino wins Disrupt Battlefield:</a> </strong>From an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/here-are-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2021">incredibly competitive group of finalists</a>, <a href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a> took home the top prize. The startup’s platform to automate stem cell production brings together lasers <em>and</em> AI, it turns out. Its vision impressed the judges during today’s final presentations, besting other strong competitors like Nth Cycle, which was the runner-up. Congrats, Cellino!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/"><strong>Twitter’s product team pounds Red Bull, moves deeper into crypto:</strong></a> The drumbeat of new products from Twitter continued today, with the company announcing “support for tipping with crypto, NFT authentication” and more. The social network has also moved into email newsletters and social audio in recent quarters. And, notably, it has managed the product deluge while not harming its core service &#8212; thus far, at least.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/duolingo-doesnt-want-to-disrupt-the-college-degree/"><strong>The limits of edtech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The CEO of Duolingo joined TechCrunch at Disrupt this year, sitting down with our own edtech expert <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>. The two dug into the ethics of paywalling education content and how to make money without sacrificing core values.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>While Cellino won our yearly Battlefield competition, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/here-are-the-five-startup-battlefield-finalists-at-disrupt-2021/">joined in the finals</a> by four other startups that we found impressive:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adventr.io/"><strong>Adventr:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/adventr-uses-patented-voice-control-tech-to-allow-anyone-to-create-interactive-videos/">Software to create interactive videos.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.withkoa.com/"><strong>Koa:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/koa-is-helping-african-consumers-make-better-money-moves/">Savings-focused fintech aimed at the African market.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nthcycle.com/"><strong>Nth Cycle:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nth-cycle-wants-to-revolutionize-metals-processing-for-recyclers-and-mine-operators/">Materials recycling tech that can be applied to batteries.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tatum.io/"><strong>Tatum:</strong></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/tatum-lets-you-interact-with-blockchains-using-api-calls/">An API-hook for the larger crypto economy.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the rest of the startup news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/it-turns-out-fintech-is-worth-as-much-as-saas/"><strong>Fintech valuations are red-hot:</strong></a> Thanks to a few recent IPOs, the public market is making it clear that the value of fintech revenues at tech startups is greater than many expected. For startups, it’s good news.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/clubhouse-announces-wave-making-it-easier-to-start-casual-private-rooms/"><strong>Clubhouse kinda takes on Discord:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Clubhouse is best known for public chats. Discord is best known for private chats. So when Clubhouse released work on private rooms, we took note. The service has a new feature called “Wave” that “makes it easier to start private rooms with friends when you see that they’re online,” per TechCrunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/ex-apple-designers-ultra-premium-audio-hardware-startup-raises-48-75-million-series-a/"><strong>Syng closes ​​$48.75M Series A for at-home spatial audio:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are content to listen to music with your laptop speakers, Syng is not for you. But if you are the sort of person who tinkers with the music setup of your home for max oomph, Syng’s “triphonic” hardware that wants to bring spatial audio to the home could be your jam.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/vyne-raises-15-5m-seed-round-to-grow-its-merchant-focused-open-banking-solutions/"><strong>Open-banking startup Vyne raises $15.5M:</strong></a> According to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden?lang=en">Ingrid Lunden</a>, the concept of open banking is enjoying a moment in the spotlight. Per my colleague, open banking is “a new approach to payments and other financial services that disrupts traditional card-based infrastructure by linking directly into banks,” and Vyne wants a piece of the action. Focused on merchants, the company just locked down eight figures of new capital for its vision.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery/"><strong>There’s infinite capital for grocery delivery startups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Many grocery delivery companies in Europe are working to get deliveries done more quickly. Jiffy is one of them. Jiffy is also racing through its capital raises, putting $28 million on to its balance sheet after being founded this April.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out our startup section, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/attack-of-the-200m-robotic-raises/">here’s the latest TechCrunch rundown of robotics news.</a></strong> Apple’s Foundation show comes out tomorrow, so this feels somewhat timely for the Asimov fans out there.</p>
<h2>Duolingo doesn’t want to disrupt the college degree</h2>
<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn has appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt before, but this year was his first time representing a public company.</p>
<p>A few months ago, reporter Natasha Mascarenhas described Duolingo’s debut as the &#8220;bellwether edtech IPO of the year,&#8221; so she was well equipped with questions about the company&#8217;s plans for boosting revenue. For example, is premium content in the cards?</p>
<p>“If we wanted to make more money in the short term, we could probably start paywalling things, but I think that would stifle our growth,” said von Ahn.</p>
<p>“If we start charging for some aspects of language learning, eventually we’re just gonna charge for everything.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recap, along with a video that captures the entire interview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York City Council passed bills today that will set minimum pay and improve working conditions for gig workers making deliveries for apps like Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. More specifically, the bills allow delivery workers to use restaurant bathrooms, limit how far they can be asked to deliver, set minimum payments per trip and ensure that tips get to workers. This legislation is the<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2021/9/22/22687983/nyc-landmark-food-delivery-worker-pay-bathrooms"> first of its kind</a> in any major U.S. city, setting a precedent for how government intervention can influence the relationship between food delivery companies and their many, many thousands of contractors.</p>
<p>This package of bills was written <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps">with input</a> from <a href="https://losdeliveristasunidos.org/">Los Deliveristas Unidos</a> (LDU), a collective of mostly immigrant app delivery workers that was born out of the Workers Justice Project. The group has been protesting for better working conditions throughout the pandemic, and, in April, they publicly <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/4/23/22397398/los-deliveristas-unidos-backed-by-union">joined forces</a> with SEIU Local 32BJ, NYC&#8217;s largest union of service workers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bitter truth is that many food delivery workers can work 12 hours a day in the cold or rain for multiple food service apps and still not make enough to feed their own families,&#8221; the LDU website reads.</p>
<p>An LDU organizer <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db8zx/gig-workers-were-incentivized-to-deliver-food-during-nycs-deadly-flood">told VICE</a> that gig workers can be financially incentivized to work during rain and snow storms, so dangerous weather can be an opportunity to make more money. Earlier this month, as Hurricane Ida pummeled New York City and led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/nyregion/ida-new-york-city-deaths.html">13 deaths</a>, app delivery workers were still bringing people food, wading through feet of flooding to complete an order. DoorDash <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db8zx/gig-workers-were-incentivized-to-deliver-food-during-nycs-deadly-flood">suspended service</a> in Manhattan, and Grubhub suspended service in certain parts of New York City. But many gig workers continued to seek bonuses and incentives where they could, even if it meant putting themselves in physical danger.</p>

<p>The conditions of Hurricane Ida illuminated a truth that has been obvious for years: contractors for delivery apps struggle to make a living wage, which incentivizes them to put themselves in danger for extra cash. At the same time, companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-and-uber-eats-are-hot-theyre-still-not-making-money-11622194203">still aren&#8217;t making money</a>, even after doing more business than ever in the pandemic.</p>
<p>A report from the LDU surveyed more than 500 app-based couriers in NYC and found that, including tips, the average hourly net pay was <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/6c0bc951-f473-4720-be3e-797bd8c26b8e/09142021CHARTSLos%20Deliveristas%20Unidos-v02.pdf">around $12.21</a>, which falls below New York City&#8217;s $15 minimum wage. On top of that, delivery workers are expected to pay for their own transportation, which in New York City, is often via e-bike. Delivery workers are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/nyregion/delivery-workers-robberies-nyc.html">especially vulnerable</a> to theft. The report also found that 49% of respondents had been in an accident or crash while making a delivery, and 75% of those people said that they paid for medical care with their own funds. However, DoorDash told TechCrunch that Dashers in Manhattan earn $33 per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize the unique challenges facing delivery workers in New York City and share the goal of identifying policies that will help Dashers and workers like them. This is why last year, we announced an industry-leading set of initiatives to improve Dasher safety, strengthen earnings, and expand access to restrooms. We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, to identify ways to support all delivery workers in New York City without unintended consequences,&#8221; a DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>DoorDash also indicated some concerns with the bills, saying that the bathroom access bill doesn&#8217;t actually require restaurants to allow bathroom access; instead, companies like DoorDash have to include provisions in their <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4927206&amp;GUID=4F2D9BC6-74D4-4A24-A889-85104C11881B&amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;Search=2298">contracts with restaurants</a> that require them to allow delivery workers to use their bathrooms.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Grubhub also expressed support for the bills. The company told TechCrunch in a statement: “These bills are common sense steps to support the delivery workers who work hard every day for New York’s restaurants and residents. Ensuring they receive a living wage and have access to restrooms isn’t just a good idea &#8212; it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Gig workers for other apps experience similar issues to app delivery couriers. Earlier this week, the Gig Workers Collective &#8212; which represents about 13,000 Instacart contractors &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/?tpcc=ECTW2020">urged customers to delete the app</a> until Instacart meets five demands to increase pay and make conditions better for workers. Because workers for these apps are contractors, rather than employees, they have fewer protections, like the guarantee of earning a minimum hourly wage. Instacart has even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts">subsidized workers&#8217; wages</a> with their tips in the past.</p>
<p>For about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/nyregion/nyc-food-delivery-workers.html">80,000</a> delivery workers in New York City, today&#8217;s legislation marks a positive change. But it remains unclear how or if tech companies will be held responsible for paying these minimum wages and guaranteeing that workers&#8217; needs are met.</p>

After three days of fierce pitching in the virtual yet incredibly competitive Startup Battlefield arena, we have a winner.</p>
<p>The startups taking part in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> have all been hand-picked to participate in our highly competitive startup competition. Like last year, we reproduced the nail-biting excitement of our physical contest on a virtual stage. All the companies presented a live demo in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.</p>
<p>After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: <a href="https://adventr.io">Adventr</a>, <a href="https://www.cellinobio.com">Cellino</a>, <a href="https://www.withkoa.com">Koa</a>, <a href="https://nthcycle.com">Nth Cycle</a> and <a href="https://tatum.io">Tatum</a>.</p>
<p>These startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included: Kirsten Green (Forerunner Ventures), Jim Lanzone (current CEO of Tinder, future CEO of Yahoo), Luciana Lixandru (Sequoia), Sarah Tavel (Benchmark), Alexa von Tobel (Inspired Capital) and Matthew Panzarino (TechCrunch).</p>
<p>We’re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2021 is …</p>
<h2>Winner: Cellino</h2>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614cd3a175544444803475dd" post-id="2207654"></div> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cellinobio.com">Cellino</a>, a company developing a platform to automate stem cell production, combines AI technology, machine learning, hardware, software — and yes, lasers! — to democratize access to cell therapies. It aims to bring down costs associated with the manufacturing of human cells while also increasing yields.</p>
<p>Read our post about Cellino <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/cellino-is-using-ai-and-machine-learning-to-scale-production-of-stem-cell-therapies/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Runner-Up: Nth Cycle</h2>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614cd1ba7554444480346e7c" post-id="2207642"></div> </p>
<p><a href="https://nthcycle.com">Nth Cycle</a> has developed an electro-extraction system that stands at less than 1,000 square feet and can process 5 tons of material per day — a key differentiator from big, traditional recyclers that use hydro- and pyrometallurgical techniques that require more capital and generate a greater footprint. The system can accept “black mass,” a powdery waste substance that’s generated from the battery recycling process, and turn that waste into valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt and manganese.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In order to combat human trafficking effectively, those combating it must understand it — and these days, that means data. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons there is no convenient index of trafficking victims, though this confidential information is in some ways abundant. Microsoft and the International Organization for Migration may have found a way forward with a new synthetic database that has all the important characteristics of the real trafficking data, but is completely artificial.</p>
<p>While each victim is unquestionably individual, basic high-level questions like which countries are increasingly the source or means of trafficking, which routes and methods are used, and where the victims end up are a matter of statistics. The evidence to identify trends and patterns, crucial to prevention, is locked up in thousands of these individual stories that most would prefer not to publicize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Administrative data on identified cases of human trafficking represent one of the main sources of data available but such information is highly sensitive,&#8221; said IOM program coordinator Harry Cook <a href="https://www.iom.int/news/iom-microsoft-collaboration-enables-release-largest-public-dataset-bolster-fight-against-human-trafficking">in a news release describing the data set</a>. &#8220;IOM has been delighted to work with Microsoft Research over the past two years to make progress on the critical challenge of sharing such data for analysis while protecting the safety and privacy of victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historically, for things like crime databases and medical info, the strategy is to redact liberally, but this method of &#8220;de-anonymizing&#8221; has been shown to be ineffective against any serious attempt to reconstruct the data. With numerous databases public and leaked and computing power on tap, the redacted information can be supplied quite reliably.</p>
<p>The option taken by Microsoft Research is to use the original data as the basis for a synthetic data set that retains all the important statistical relationships of the source but none of the identifiable information. And it&#8217;s not just turning &#8220;Jane Doe&#8221; into &#8220;Janet Doeman&#8221; and her hometown from Cleveland to Queens. Instead, groups of no less than 10 people with similar or overlapping data are merged to create a set of attributes that accurately represent them statistically but can&#8217;t be used to identify them individually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207737" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207737" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2207737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png" alt="Caption: Statistics relating to human trafficking around the world." width="1024" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dataset-trafficking.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft Research / IOM</p></div></p>
<p>Naturally this doesn&#8217;t have the granularity of the original data, but unlike the sensitive source, <em>this</em> data can actually be used. It&#8217;s not necessarily for some task force to analyze and say &#8220;okay the next smuggling operation will be based out of&#8230;&#8221; but rather this data, based in firsthand evidence, can be pointed at as a factual record for addressing this at a policy and diplomacy level. Where before one may have had to say in a more general way that Country X or Government Z was neglectful or complicit in these matters, having hard data to back that up allows one to say &#8220;36 percent of sex trafficking victims pass through your jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that the data has to be used in strongarm tactics — simply understanding the global trade in human misery as a system and not just a series of disconnected events is valuable in and of itself. You can peruse the data and request to use it <a href="https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/global-synthetic-dataset">here</a>, and learn more about the process for creating it <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/synthetic-data-showcase">at the program&#8217;s GitHub</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company whose tech powered the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery/"> sensational MyHeritage app</a> that turned classic family photos into lifelike moving portraits is back with a new implementation of its technology: Transforming still photographs into ultra-realistic video, capable of saying whatever you want.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d-id.com">D-ID&#8217;s</a> Speaking Portraits may look like the notorious &#8220;deepfakes&#8221; that have made headlines over the past couple of years, but the underlying tech is actually quite different, and there&#8217;s no training required for basic functionality.</p>
<p>D-ID, which actually debuted at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/d-id-launches-its-initial-product-with-customers-in-printing-automotive-and-financial-services/">TechCrunch Battlefield in 2018 with a very different focus</a> (scrambling facial recognition tech), debuted its new Speaking Portraits product live at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. The company showed off a number of use cases, including using its new tech to create a multilingual TV anchor capable of expressing various emotions; creating virtual chatbot personas for customer support interactions; developing training courses for professional development use; and creating interactive conversational video ad kiosks.</p>
<p>Both this new product and D-ID&#8217;s partnership with MyHeritage, which saw the latter company&#8217;s app briefly take over the top of Apple&#8217;s App Store charts, are obviously major departures from the company&#8217;s initial focus. Up until even May of last year, D-ID was still raising funding based on its earlier approach, but its partnership with MyHeritage debuted in February, followed by a similar deal with GoodTrust after that and a splashy tie-up with Warner Bros. on the Hugh Jackman film &#8220;Reminiscence&#8221; that allowed fans to insert themselves into its trailer.</p>
<p>D-ID&#8217;s pivot might seem more dramatic than most, but from a technical perspective its new focus on bringing photos to life is not so far off from its de-identification software. D-ID CEO and co-founder Gil Perry told me that the company chose the new direction because it was apparent that there&#8217;s a very large addressable market when it comes to this kind of application.</p>
<p>Big-name clients like Warner Bros., as well as an App Store-dominating app from a relatively unknown brand, would seem to support that assessment. Speaking Portraits, however, is aimed at clients both big and small, and allows anyone to generate a full HD video from a source image, plus either recorded speech or typed text. D-ID is launching the product with support for English, Spanish and Japanese, but plans to add other languages in the future, too, as customers request support for those.</p>
<p>D-ID offers two basic categories of Speaking Portrait, including a &#8220;Single Portrait&#8221; that can be made using just a single still image, which features an animated head but other parts stay static. This one will also work with the existing background in the photo only.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For a bit more uncanny reality, there&#8217;s a &#8220;Trained Character&#8221; option that requires submitting a 10-minute training video of the character requested, following guidelines supplied by the company. This has the advantage of being able to work against a custom, swappable background, and features some preset animation options for the character&#8217;s body and hands.</p>
<p>Check out an example of a Speaking Portrait newscaster generated using the trained character method below to get a sense of how realistic it can be:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nV_sLx3PceU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The demo that Perry showed us live at Disrupt today was created from a still photo of himself as a child. The photo was mapped to facial expressions performed by a sort of human puppeteer who also voiced the script for what the Speaking Portrait version of Gil ended up saying during the interaction between his current and younger self. You can see a video of how the speaker&#8217;s expressions were mirrored by the animated photo below:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFW7iktsuYg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Obviously, the ability to create photo-realistic videos from just a single photo that can convincingly deliver any lines you want is a bit of a hair-raising prospect. We&#8217;ve already seen far-ranging debates about the ethics of deepfakes, as well as industry efforts to try to fingerprint and identify when AI generated realistic, but artificial, results.</p>
<p>Perry said at Disrupt that D-ID is &#8220;keen to make sure it&#8217;s used for good, not bad,&#8221; and that in order to achieve that, they&#8217;re going to be issuing a pledge at the end of October, alongside partners, that outline their commitments to &#8220;transparency and consent&#8221; when it comes to using tech like Speaking Portraits. The purpose of said commitment is to ensure that &#8220;users aren&#8217;t confused about what they&#8217;re seeing and that people involved give their consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>While D-ID wants to make assurances in its terms of use and public position on misuse of this kind of tech, Perry says it &#8220;can&#8217;t do it alone,&#8221; which is why he&#8217;s calling on others in the ecosystem to join forces in efforts to avoid abuse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thentwrk.com/">NTWRK</a>, a video shopping app that has helped to popularize the idea of livestreamed commerce in the U.S., announced today it has closed on $50 million in new funding led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management and global luxury group Kering, owners of luxury <a href="https://www.kering.com/en/talent/who-we-are/our-houses/">brands</a> Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and others. The company has been working to capitalize on the growing interest in live commerce and creator content, and shifted into<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/the-ntwrk-the-live-nation-backed-shopping-app-for-gen-z-is-launching-a-virtual-festival/"> live virtual events</a> and festivals as COVID-19 ravaged the U.S. last year. Now it says it will invest in furthering its growth and working to establish a more global footprint.</p>
<p>Other participants in the new round include LionTree Partners and Tenere Capital. They join the company&#8217;s prior backers: Main Street Advisors (whose investors include Jimmy Iovine, Drake and LeBron James), Live Nation, Foot Locker and others. Allison Berardo, a vice president within the Growth Equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, will join NTWRK&#8217;s board of directors.</p>

<p>Aimed at a younger crowd of Gen Z and millennial consumers, NTWRK offers tools that allow creators to interact with viewers and sell products in real time, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/ntwrk-moves-into-live-events/">what&#8217;s been called</a> a mix of QVC, Twitter and Twitch. The experience blends commerce with entertainment, as viewers watch and chat with other viewers and hosts in real time, as they shop for streetwear, shoes, collectibles and other items. The company has also created its own exclusive content where it has featured hosts like Billie Eilish, Juice WRLD, DJ Khaled, Odell Beckham Jr., Eddie Huang, Blake Griffin, Alexander Wang, FaZe Clan, Nadeshot, Jonah Hill, Gary Vee, A$AP Ferg, Wu-Tang Clan, Doja Cat and others. (It even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/on-the-heels-of-its-ntwrk-investment-faze-clan-looks-at-global-expansion-despite-pandemic/">invested</a> into FaZe Clan last year, we should note.)</p>
<p>Its business model extends beyond just offering live video shopping that you can tune into at any time, as it also regularly features product drops that work to build up anticipation and excitement. This sort of feature is only now making its way to larger social media platforms, like Instagram, which introduced drops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">just this spring</a>.</p>
<p>NTWRK has also embraced live events and virtual festivals as another way to engage audiences. Last year, for instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/the-ntwrk-the-live-nation-backed-shopping-app-for-gen-z-is-launching-a-virtual-festival/">ran TRANSFER</a>, which featured 30 brands and artists, panels, interviews, DJ sets and musical performances. It also ran BEYOND THE STREETS, a virtual art fair that attracted over 250,000 attendees. Earlier this year it ran a two-day designer toy and collectibles festival, <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-unboxed-a-two-day-designer-toy-collectibles-festival-february-13-14-2021">Unboxed</a>, as the first of a slate of digital events which have subsequently run throughout the year, including <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-presents-surface-festival">Surface Festival</a>, a <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-the-hundreds-present-a-two-day-virtual-food-festival-family-style-to-go">virtual food festival</a> and a virtual <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-announces-open-house-a-virtual-home-goods-festivalfor-the-hype-obsessed-generation">home goods festival. </a>It&#8217;s now gearing up for th<a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-announcesthe-second-editionof-transfer">e return of its flagship event</a>, TRANSFER.</p>

<p>This summer, NTWRK also <a href="https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/ntwrk-expands-into-the-world-of-nfts">embraced</a> the world of digital goods with the launch of NTWRK NFT, its own curated shop for unique crypto art from creators like BADBOI, Imaginary Foundation, MILKMAN, Young &amp; Sick, Fafi, KidEight, MGOGLKTKO and Eddie Gangland.</p>
<p>Livestream shopping is already a popular activity overseas, but is still gaining ground here in the U.S. The company, in announcing its news today, noted that livestream shopping in China reached $150 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to $300 billion this year. But in the U.S. it&#8217;s expected to reach $11 billion by the end of 2021 and $25 billion by 2025, leaving much room for growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to become the biggest, most culturally relevant, livestream shopping marketplace for Gen-Z and Millennial audiences who are obsessed with pop culture,&#8221; said NTWRK CEO Aaron Levant, in a statement. &#8220;It’s exciting for NTWRK to have Goldman Sachs and Kering sign on for the future of livestream shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>NTWRK had previously raised a $10 million Series A, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ntwrk/investor_financials">Crunchbase</a> data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the electric vehicle startup that’s gearing up for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">initial public offering</a>, continues its trend of growing fast. The company will be opening a service support operations facility for vehicle owners in Plymouth, Michigan &#8212; and just in time, as deliveries of the launch edition of the R1T pickup are expected to commence late this month.</p>
<p>The facility will create 100 new jobs and come at an investment of $4.6 million, $750,000 of which comes from a business development grant from the state. Funds such as the Michigan Business Development Program are used to attract business and encourage in-state job creation and investment. This isn’t Rivian’s first time investing in Michigan &#8212; while the company’s factory is in Normal, Illinois (with a second one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">likely coming</a>), its headquarters is in Plymouth. Rivian also opened an R&amp;D center in Dearborn in 2015 at a capital investment of $29.5 million.</p>
<p>The new center will be an extension of Rivian’s current headquarters, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. Through the new center, the electric automaker “plans to support all Rivian owners” by providing “around-the-clock assistance by the Rivian Roadside and Service Support team to North American Rivian owners with vehicle questions, roadside requests and service scheduling needs,” according to a news release.</p>
<p>The Michigan Governor’s Office describes the new jobs as high-wage and says that they come with benefits like tuition reimbursement and childcare assistance.</p>

<p>Like its rival Tesla, Rivian operates under a direct sales model that allows customers to order vehicles from it directly online. Today, only 22 states allow OEMs to sell directly to customers &#8212; in those states, Rivian can set up display rooms and offer test rides &#8212; but there are no prohibitions from a customer ordering directly online.</p>
<p>Rivian also plans on keeping its servicing and support in-house. According to the company website, Rivian plans on providing 24/7 support via its Service Team, which will offer troubleshooting, diagnostics, help with setting up appointments and roadside assistance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just last week, Rivian confirmed to TechCrunch that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivian-vehicles-are-now-ready-for-sale-in-all-50-states-following-key-certifications/">received the necessary certifications</a> from three separate agencies giving it the greenlight to sell and deliver the R1T and R1S SUV in all 50 states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based autonomous farming startup Iron Ox this week announced a $53 million round. The Series C, led by Breakthrough Energy Venture, brings the firm’s total funding up to $98 million.</p>
<p>Iron Ox is one of a large number of companies looking to revolutionize farming for the 21st century, amid growing concerns over population growth, climate change, labor shortages and a slew of other mounting concerns. Solutions range from large-scale indoor farms to field robotics designed for a more plug and play approach that operates with a more traditional setup.</p>
<p>The startup refers to its approach as a “closed loop system.” It’s effectively a robotic greenhouse full of proprietary harvesting technology. The company doesn’t have any outlandish claims in terms of yield, saying it more or less amounts to what you’ll get from a traditional farm, but it’s working to do so with a significantly smaller environmental footprint &#8212; and a model that is less beholden to seasonal changes than standard farming.</p>
<p>Iron Ox says its system uses around 90% less water than traditional farming. These sorts of systems also integrate data into every part of the process, collecting a significant amount of information about the produce they grow to improve on future yield.</p>
<p>“World-class investors know that humanity’s most important pursuit is to reverse climate change. To get there, we can’t settle for incrementally more sustainable crops — and we can’t ask consumers to compromise on taste, convenience, or value,” co-founder and CEO Brandon Alexander said in a release tied to the news. “We are applying technology to minimize the amount of land, water and energy needed to nourish a growing population. The team at Iron Ox will not stop until we achieve our long-term mission of making the produce sector carbon negative.”</p>
<p>The company says this round will go toward scaling manufacturing, expanding operations in the U.S., ramping up R&amp;D and hiring more headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiny houses might have lost some of their luster in the COVID era, but a reimagined future for remote work might call for tiny offices.</p>
<p>According to Nick Foley, <a href="https://www.denizen.work/#1">Denizen</a> founder and CEO, people are clamoring for a serene space to think these days — and they’re happy to pay for it.</p>
<p>Foley is the former chief product officer and director of industrial design for Jump Bikes, a bike-sharing company acquired by Uber in 2018 for $200 million. With Denizen, he’s setting out to answer one question: “Can you build an office space as a product that’s just a phenomenal experience for a single person to have the perfect workday?&#8221;</p>
<p>Foley thinks that WeWork got some things wrong about how to optimize the work environment. While plenty of people reap the social benefits of co-working, a buzzing environment full of workers focusing on different projects can be detrimental to the kind of flow state that some work necessitates.</p>

<p>Denizen’s solution is to build a small army of itty-bitty standalone offices that come pre-constructed, packed with outlets, USB plugs, cameras (for videoconferencing), speakers, an integrated router and even a whiteboard wall, all in less than 100 square feet. Denizen’s office pods are beautifully designed, with windows that can turn opaque in seconds for privacy, recyclable materials and an aesthetic that’s right at home in Dwell (they were actually <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/denizen-archetype-prefab-office-pod-4b8c5d90">just featured in Dwell</a>, because of course they were).</p>
<p>“The ceiling is really high, the glass is all around you — it just feels expansive and huge,” Foley said, adding that Denizen is all about giving people the tools they need to have “inspired, productive workdays.” And they&#8217;re not just a beautiful concept image — a friend of Foley&#8217;s who works for NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory gave us a virtual tour of his own Denizen-built micro workspace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Denizen initially only planned to provide its pre-fab office pods to employers, who could rent them on a monthly subscription basis. But the demand from people stuck working from home and searching for an alternative was so great that the company now plans to sell the standalone offices on wheels to individuals, who can keep them at their home residences. One of Denizen’s beautiful, high-tech tiny offices will set you back about $55,000 as an individual.</p>
<p>Foley sees the Denizen model as something that would fit into a company’s COVID-era real estate plan. With fewer workers coming into the office, companies are downsizing the expensive and often sprawling campuses that have long defined them and looking to explore more flexible, bespoke options that better fit the future of work. For an employer with a bulk deal, Foley expects that each smartpod will run around $1,000 per month to rent.</p>

<p>The pods could supplement traditional offices with inspiring solo office settings, but Foley hopes that some day companies or even city governments might place clusters of Denizen office pods in green spaces where they could be booked out by the day.</p>
<p>“The real dream is honestly very similar to Jump Bikes&#8230; Figuring out how to collaborate on the neighborhood level to make these really amazing shared use amenities,” Foley said.</p>
<p>The company is currently raising a seed round of funding and signing up companies in the Bay Area and further afield in California for multi-unit tests that will start in early 2022. It’s looking to scale slowly, selling about 100 units next year while it streamlines the manufacturing experience to get the product just right.</p>

<p>Because the smartpods are on wheels, Denizen smartly eschews many of the permitting headaches that Foley’s team would otherwise get bogged down in. “I understand how that can be a complication to a business model,” Foley says, citing his experience installing kiosks and parking structures for Jump Bikes.</p>
<p>Instead of navigating labyrinthine local regulations, anyone with a 12&#215;7.5-foot area and the cash to spare can roll right into one of the little pod offices and get to work. From a regulatory perspective, it’s basically a beautiful little RV, sans plumbing.</p>
<p>Foley is excited about how his vision fits into the future of work, but he’s also excited about the literal nuts and bolts of putting Denizen’s tiny offices together. Production for the pod offices blends large-scale CNC automation, 3D printing and sophisticated product design into a product that’s pre-fabricated and ready to ship to Denizen’s early customers on the West Coast, wheels and all.</p>
