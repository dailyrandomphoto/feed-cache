										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tresl.co/">Tresl</a>’s flagship product, e-commerce intelligence platform Segment Analytics, is designed to give small brands on Shopify access to the same kind of analytics larger online retailers have. Founded by former LinkedIn data scientists, Tresl is <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/2a93c8ef-f501-491b-9d88-86cea40f4dc7?index=1">currently exhibiting at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena</a>.</p>
<p>Segments Analytics analyzes a Shopify store’s data and then automatically sorts visitors into more 30 pre-built customer segments based on their browsing habits, spending and how likely they are to make repeat purchases.</p>
<p>This means that brands can identify specific groups of shoppers and use Segments Analytics&#8217; suggestions for targeted campaigns without spending too much on data analytics, marketing or user acquisition. For example, one of the segments the platform identifies are people who have made one purchase already, but are unlikely to buy again unless they are see an ad or promotion soon. Segments Analytics can be used for advertising across multiple channels, including email, Facebook and Google.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tresl claims that brands using Segments Analytics have increased their clickthrough rates on abandoned cart flows (or reminders sent to customers who have unpurchased items) by 30% and grown sales by 40% month-over-month within one month of implementing the platform.</p>
<p>Segments Analytics is currently available through the Shopify App Store, with subscriptions starting from $79 a month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.3drens.com/">3Drens</a>’ IoT mobility management platform not only lets fleet operators track where their vehicles are, but also produces data that helps them make business decisions. The company began operating in Taiwan, where it is based, before expanding into Southeast Asia. Currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/2befd832-75d3-4057-adaa-29a67d822747?index=1">presenting at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena</a>, 3Drens is focused on the increased demand for logistics during COVID-19. For example, its tech can potentially be used to enable smaller e-commerce retailers to rent unused capacity on delivery vehicles from larger platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">The company’s clients also come from the vehicle rental, ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Founded in 2017, one of 3rens’ first clients was a electric scooter company that mostly serves tourists. It installed 3Drens’ IoT box onto scooters to send alerts if scooters were potentially involved in accidents or if a user went over the time they had paid for. It also generated a heat map of where the scooters traveled the most often, so the company was able to make partnerships with popular venues and attractions.</p>
<p class="p1">3Drens’ platform can also help logistics services pick the right type of vehicle for a delivery, predict the best routes and assign new tasks for drivers on their way back after an order is fulfilled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.oflo.io/">OFLO</a> is a voice communication system designed to replace traditional walkie talkies. Its hardware is more compact and lightweight, with a bone conduction headset, and capable of covering unlimited distances and multiple channels. Created by Origami Labs, OFLO is also connected to software that features auto logging and productivity tools for teams who don’t have access to screens while they are working.</p>
<p>The startup, whose clients include property management company JLL and luxury hotel chain The Peninsula, is currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/4156af83-7ac4-45f4-9716-3120e13bb1ed?index=1">showcasing OFLO</a> at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion.</p>
<p>OFLO was created for the millions of frontline workers in health care, hospitality, security, manufacturing and other sectors who can’t sit in front of a computer or look down at mobile screens frequently. The walkie talkies many of them currently use cover only limited distances and have a single channel that is shared by multiple workers. OFLO’s advantages include letting users call specific co-workers and it is also cross-platform, so someone talking on a smartphone can call a person on a OFLO walkie talkie. Its software includes features like live chats, transcriptions, task management and GPS location.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>OFLO is available on a subscription plan for $6 per user a month. Wong said its monthly recurring revenue is currently increasing 20% a month, with a target of $100,000 a month by the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The system builds on Origami Labs’ other tech, including <a href="https://orii.io">Orii</a>, a voice-powered ring. Co-founder and chief executive officer Kevin Johan Wong told TechCrunch the company sees OFLO as &#8220;almost a screenless smartphone alternative.&#8221; One of the reasons Wong became interested in working on voice technology is because his father, Peter Wong, is a visually-impaired programmer who helped develop Microsoft’s accessibility tools.</p>
<p>“Our company’s mantra is to try to create devices that are equalizing, that allow people to interact with computers screenless-ly,” said the younger Wong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the proliferation of subscription services, combined with our lives becoming almost 100% digital, there’s a rising need to be able to manage these services. But most banks don’t have much of an answer. Step in <a href="https://minnatechnologies.com/">Minna Technologies</a>, which sells in its subscription management services into banking apps.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $18.8 million (€15.5m / £14m) in Series B fundraising from Element Ventures, MiddleGame Ventures, Nineyards Equity and Visa, to expand its open banking technology to banks globally.</p>
<p>Founded in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2016, Minna enables customers to manage subscription services via their existing bank’s app. Using Minna, customers can terminate subscriptions just from their banking app, automatically, cutting the data and financial ties between the merchant and customer. The platform can also notify customers when a free trial is about to end and facilitates utilities switching allowing them to find better deals. So far, Minna has partnerships with Lloyds Banking Group, Swedbank and ING.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Minna’s technology reduces the burden on a bank’s call centers, plus banks can also benefit financially from Minna’s role in facilitating utility switching, raising the prospect of banks becoming marketplaces.</p>
<p>The appearance of Minna suggests that the first wave of neo-banks is about to be accompanied by a second wave of overlayed services such as this. The average European is spending £301 (€333) a month on 11 subscriptions, which is predicted to increase to £459 (€508) a month on 17 subscriptions by 2025. IDC predicts that by 2050, 50% of the world’s largest enterprises will focus the majority of their businesses on digitally enhanced products, services, and experiences. Subscriptions are even coming from car makers such as Volvo.</p>
<p>Joakim Sjöblom, CEO and co-founder of Minna Technologies, said: “Over the past four years the subscription economy has exploded from Spotify and Netflix to even iPhones and cars. It&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to keep track of the payments and harder for banks to handle inquiries to shut them down. Minna’s tech improves the procedure for banks by simplifying the process, as well as providing an in-demand digital product that consumers are starting to expect from their financial institutions.”</p>
<p>Sjöblom told me that by largely working with incumbent banks, Minna is providing them with a way to fight back against challenger banks.</p>
<p>Pascal Bouvier, Managing Partner, MiddleGame Ventures said: “We strongly believe in a vision where banks develop their checking account offerings into “connected and intelligent” platforms and where retail clients are able to interact in many more ways than in the recent past.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google said on Thursday it has pulled some personal loan apps from Play Store in India and was implementing stronger measures to prevent abuse following reports that said several firms were targeting vulnerable borrowers in the country and then going to extreme lengths to recover their money.</p>
<p>The Android-maker said users and government agencies in India recently flagged several personal loan apps and the company reviewed hundreds of them. The review found an identified number of apps violated Play Store’s safety policies and they were immediately removed from the Store.</p>
<p>Google, whose Android operating system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/indian-startups-explore-forming-an-alliance-and-alternative-app-store-to-fight-googles-monopoly/">powers 98% smartphones in India</a>, said it has asked the developers of the remaining identified apps to demonstrate that their apps are in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. (In an email reviewed by TechCrunch, Google had asked a developer to provide documentation within five days.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Apps that fail to do so will be removed without further notice. In addition, we will continue to assist the law enforcement agencies in their investigation of this issue,” the company said.</p>
<p>Users have identified several lending apps including 10MinuteLoan and Ex-Money in India in recent months that granted small ticket loans (typically in the range of $50 to $200) to people for short tenures without much verification to determine their eligibility and then <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-instant-loan-apps-drained-crores-from-borrowers/articleshow/80170284.cms">charged steep processing fees</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid such abuse, Google said Play Store will only allow personal apps that require customers to make their repayment in 60 days or longer.</p>
<p>When borrowers struggled to repay their debt in the short period, collection agents on behalf of some lending apps <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/indias-instant-loan-app-crisis-is-made-in-china/">among other ill tactics</a>, threatened to embarrass them in front of their friends, colleagues and family. In November, local newspaper Indian Express <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2020/nov/25/bullied-online-by-money-lending-app-company-chennai-man-kills-self-2227722.html">reported</a> that a 23-year-old man committed suicide after being bullied by a money lending app. It&#8217;s not the only reported suicide case linked to such harassment in recent months.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Local media also <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-instant-loan-apps-drained-crores-from-borrowers/articleshow/80170284.cms">reported</a> that police in the city of Hyderabad recently froze bank accounts holding $58 million for alleged scams conducted through 30 lending apps, none of which had approval from the nation&#8217;s central bank. A preliminary investigation found that these apps had processed nearly $2.9 billion through 14 million transactions.</p>
<p>“To protect user privacy, developers must only request permissions that are necessary to implement current features or services. They should not use permissions that give access to user or device data for undisclosed, unimplemented, or disallowed features or purposes,&#8221; wrote Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy, <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/01/protecting-against-harmful-financial.html">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers must also only use data for purposes that the user has consented to, and if they later want to use the data for other purposes, they must obtain user permission for the additional uses,” she added.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s move comes months after Google stepped up its efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations/">crack down on fantasy sports apps in India</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small enterprises remain one of the most underserved segments of the business market, but the growth of cloud-based services &#8212; easier to buy, easier to provision &#8212; has helped that change in recent years. Today, one of the more promising startups out of Europe building software to help SMEs run online businesses is announcing some funding to better tap into both the opportunity to build these services, and to meet a growing demand from the SME segment.</p>
<p><a href="https://xentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xentral</a>, a German startup that develops enterprise resource planning software covering a variety of back-office functions for the average online small business, has picked up a Series A of $20 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform today covers services like order and warehouse management, packaging, fulfillment, accounting and sales management, and the majority of its 1,000 customers are in Germany &#8212; they include the likes of direct-to-consumer brands like YFood, KoRo, the Nu Company and Flyeralarm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Benedikt Sauter, the co-founder and CEO of Xentral, said the ambition is to expand into the rest of Europe, and eventually other geographies, and to fold in more services to its ERP platform, such as a more powerful API to allow customers to integrate more services &#8212; for example in cases where a business might be selling on their own site, but also Amazon, eBay, social platforms and more &#8212; to bring their businesses to a wider market.</p>
<p>Mainly, he said, the startup wants &#8220;to build a better ecosystem to help our customers run their own businesses better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Sequoia Capital, with Visionaires Club (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/visionaries-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B-focused VC out of Berlin</a>) also participating.</p>
<p>The deal is notable for being the prolific, high-profile VC&#8217;s first investment in Europe since officially opening for business in the region. (Sequoia has backed a number of startups in Europe before this, including Graphcore, Klarna, Tessian, Unity, UiPath, n8n and Evervault &#8212; but all of those deals were done from afar.)</p>
<p>Augsburg-based Xentral has been around as a startup since 2018, and &#8220;as a startup&#8221; is the operative phrase here.</p>
<p>Sauter and his co-founder Claudia Sauter (who is also his co-founder in life: she is his wife) built the early prototype for the service originally for themselves.</p>
<p>The pair were running a business of their own &#8212; a hardware company they founded in 2008, selling not nails, hammers and wood, but circuit boards they they designed, along with other hardware to build computers and other connected objects. Around 2013, as the business was starting to pick up steam, they decided that they really needed better tools to manage everything at the backend so that they would have more time to build their actual products.</p>
<p>But Bene Sauter quickly discovered a problem in the process: smaller businesses may have Shopify and its various competitors to help manage e-commerce at the front end, but when it came to the many parts of the process at the backend, there really wasn&#8217;t a single, easy solution (remember this was eight years ago, at a time before the Shopifys of the world were yet to expand into these kinds of tools). Being of a DIY and technical persuasion &#8212; Sauter had studied hardware engineering at university &#8212; he decided that he&#8217;d try to build the tools that he wanted to use himself.</p>
<p>The Sauters used those tools for for years, until without much outbound effort, they started to get a some inbound interest from other online businesses to use the software, too. That led to the Sauters balancing both their own hardware business and selling the software on the side, until around 2017/2018 when they decided to wind down the hardware operation and focus on the software full-time. And from then, Xentral was born. It now has, in addition to 1,000 customers, some 65 employees working on developing the platform.</p>
<p>The focus with Xentral is to have a platform that is easy to implement and use, regardless of what kind of SME you might be as long as you are selling online. But even so, Sauter pointed out that the other common thread is that you need at least one person at the business who champions and understands the value of ERP. &#8220;It&#8217;s really a mindset,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The challenge with Xentral in that regard will be to see how and if they can bring more businesses to the table and tap into the kinds of tools that it provides, at the same time that a number of other players also eye up the same market. (Others in the same general category of building ERP for small businesses include online payments provider Sage, Netsuite and Acumatica.) ERP overall is <a href="https://www.marketresearchengine.com/reportdetails/erp-enterprise-resource-planning-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecast</a> to become a $49.5 billion market by 2025.</p>
<p>Sequoia and its new partner in Europe Luciana Lixandru &#8212; who is joining Xentral&#8217;s board along with Luciana Lixandru and Visionaries’ Robert Lacher &#8212; believe however that there remains a golden opportunity to build a new kind of provider from the ground up and out of Europe specifically to target the opportunity in that region.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see Xentral becoming the <em>de facto</em> platform for any SMEs to run their businesses online,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;ERP sounds a bit scary especially because it makes one think of companies like SAP, long implementation cycles, and so on. But here it’s the opposite.&#8221; She describes Xentral as &#8220;very lean and easy to use because you an start with one module and then add more. For SMEs it has to be super simple. I see this becoming like the Shopify for ERP.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Short, snappy, entertaining videos have become an increasingly common way for young people to receive information. Why not learn English through TikTok-like videos too? That was what prompted Angelo Huang to launch <a href="https://www.blabla.app/">Blabla</a>.</p>
<p>Originally from Taiwan, Huang relocated to Shanghai in 2019 to start Blabla after working in Silicon Valley for over a decade. A year later, Blabla was chosen as part of Y Combinator&#8217;s 2020 summer cohort. The coronavirus had begun to spread in the U.S. at the time, keeping millions at home, and interest in remote learning was reviving.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my eighth time applying to YC,&#8221; Huang, who founded two companies before Blabla, told TechCrunch during an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, Blabla announced it has raised $1.54 million in a seed round led by Amino Capital, Starling Ventures, Y Combinator, and Wayra X, the innovation arm of the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica. While Y Combinator wasn&#8217;t particularly instrumental in Blabla&#8217;s expansion in China &#8212; one of the biggest English-learning markets &#8212; the famed accelerator was of great help introducing investors to the young company, said the founder.</p>
<p>The Blabla app pays native English speakers by the hour to create short, engaging videos tailored to English-learning students around the world. The content creators are aided by Blabla&#8217;s proprietary software that can recognize and tag their scenes, as well as third-party translation tools that can subtitle their videos. The students, in turn, pay a subscription fee to receive personalized video recommendations based on their level of proficiency. They can practice through the app&#8217;s built-in speech recognition, among other features like speaking contests and pop quizzes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hG7XFliQJc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The startup is in a highly crowded space. In China, the online English-learning market is occupied by established companies like VIPKID, which is backed by Tencent and Sequoia Capital. Compared to VIPKID&#8217;s one-on-one tutoring model, Blabla is more affordable with its starting price of 39 yuan ($6) a month, Huang noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students [on mainstream English learning apps] might have to spend several thousands of RMB before they can have a meaningful conversation with their teachers. We instead recycle our videos and are able to offer lessons at much cheaper prices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app has about 11,000 weekly users and 300-400 paid users at the moment, with 80-90% of its total users coming from China; the goal for this year is to reach 300,000 students. The funding will allow Blabla to expand in Southeast Asia and Latin America while Wayra X can potentially help it scale to Telefónica&#8217;s 340 million global users. It will be seeking brand deals with influencers on the likes of TikTok and Youtube. The new capital will also enable BlaBla to add new features, such as pairing up language learners based on their interests and profiles.</p>
<p>Blabla doesn&#8217;t limit itself to teaching English and has ambitions to bring in teachers of other languages. &#8220;We want to be a global online pay-for-knowledge platform,&#8221; said Huang.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/poshmark-is-said-to-consider-pricing-ipo-above-marketed-range">Poshmark</a>, the nine-year-old, Redwood City Ca.-based online marketplace for second-hand clothing, beauty, and home decor products, is set to start trading as a public company on the Nasdaq tomorrow after tonight pricing 6.6 million shares higher than originally planned, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/poshmark-is-said-to-consider-pricing-ipo-above-marketed-range">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Per its report, the company, which earlier expected to sell shares at between $35 and $39 million, saw enough demand to rationalize a $42-per-share price &#8212; one that values the company at $3.5 billion on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Given investors&#8217; feverish embrace of all kinds of newly public consumer brands, including Airbnb, DoorDash and, to a more moderate degree, Wish (trading currently where it opened when it hit the market in mid-December), most industry observers anticipate smooth sailing for the company as it makes the move from private to publicly traded company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has numerous things going for it.</p>
<p>More than 70 million Poshmark users having sold more than 130 million items through the platform since its inception, according to the company. And its revenue is moving<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in the right direction. Poshmark makes money off commissions on peer-to-peer sales and on products that it sells via wholesale, and it turned profitable last year for the first time. According to its S-1, it produced net income of $21 million off revenue of $193 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared with a net loss of $34 million on revenue of $150 million during the same period in 2019.</span></p>
<p>Also, unlike many brick-and-mortar retail businesses that were hit especially hard by pandemic-related shutdowns  &#8212; J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, and Brooks Brothers are just a few of many to declare bankruptcy &#8212; Poshmark only facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers, so it doesn&#8217;t have the burden or expense of holding inventory.</p>
<p>Not last, resale platforms of all stripes have the wind at their back right now. Resale can be more affordable. It can be a means for sellers to make money. More, shoppers are more interested than ever in sustainability, and buying someone else&#8217;s never- or lightly-used items is more environmentally friendly than supporting, say, a fast fashion brand. (Forever 21, the fast-fashion mall staple, filed for bankruptcy in 2019.)</p>
<p>What Poshmark has to overcome includes improving the customer experience, if a variety of review sites is to be believed. The company consistently receives poor marks for its quality control and support service.</p>
<p>Though profitable, it&#8217;s not yet terribly profitable, which may need to change, and quickly.</p>
<p>Poshmark, which has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/poshmark">$153 million</a> from its venture investors, is also challenged with making public market investors understand how it differs from already publicly traded rivals like eBay and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">The RealReal</a>, which went public in 2019 and whose current market cap is roughly $2.3 billion. It will also need to differentiate itself from other companies hot on its heels.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of its closest rivals, <a href="https://www.thredup.com/">ThredUp</a>, filed a confidential registration statement with the SEC for an IPO last fall around the same time that Poshmark did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grab Financial Group <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-financial-groups-fintech-leadership-recognised-in-series-a-funding-round-of-over-us300-million/">said today </a>it has raised more than $300 million in Series A funding, led by South Korean firm Hanhwa Asset Management, with participation from K3 Ventures, GGV Capital, Arbor Ventures and Flourish Ventures.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e5143de1-b7f8-4410-898f-b4f9bdec823d">Financial Times reports</a> that the funding values Grab Financial, a subsidiary of ride-hailing and delivery giant Grab, at $3 billion. Both K3 Ventures and GGV Capital were early investors in Grab, which was founded in 2012.</p>
<p>Back in February 2020, Grab announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/grab-and-gojek-began-discussing-a-potential-merger-more-than-three-months-ago/">had raised $856 million in funding</a> to grow its payment and financial services. That news came during speculation that Grab and Gojek, one of it top rivals, were finally getting closer to a merger after lengthy discussions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the Grab-Gojek talks stalled, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/gojek-is-said-in-talks-with-tokopedia-for-18-billion-merger">Gojek is now reportedly in talks to merge with Indonesia e-commerce platform Tokopedia</a> instead. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/gojek-is-said-in-talks-with-tokopedia-for-18-billion-merger">According to Bloomberg</a>, the combined company would be worth $18 billion, making it a more formidable rival to Grab.</p>
<p>In its funding announcement, Grab Financial Group said its total revenues grew more than 40% in 2020, compared to 2019. This driven by strong consumer adoption of services like AutoInvest, an investment platform that allows users to invest small amounts of money at a time through the Grab app and insurance products. Grab Financial announced the launch of several financial products for consumers and SMEs in August 2020.</p>
<p>Usagea of digital financial services by consumers and SMEs in Southeast Asia increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-economy-sea.appspot.com/assets/pdf/e-Conomy_SEA_2020_Report.pdf">report</a> published by Google, Temasek and Bain &amp; Company in November, usage of banking apps and online payments, remittances, insurance products and robo-advisor investment platforms all grew in 2020, and the region’s financial services market may be reach $60 billion in revenue by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sennder.com/">Sennder</a>, a large digital road freight forwarder based out of Germany, has raised $160m in Series D financing. The round was led by an unnamed party, but round participants included Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania. Sources say <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hedosophia">Hedosophia</a> may be the unnamed growth investor, although Sennder declined to comment. To date, Sennder has raised more than $260m, allowing it to lay claim to a potential $1bn valuation.</p>
<p>Sennder directly connects enterprise shippers with trucking companies, thus disintermediating the traditional freight model. It says it will move over 1 million truckloads this year. So far it’s concentrated on the lucrative European market. In June 2020 it merged with French competitor Everoad and acquired Uber Freight’s European business last September. The European logistics and freight sector has a market size of $427bn.</p>
<p>Sennder competes with large incumbents like Wincanton and CH Robinson as well as other startups such as OnTrac in Spin, and Instafreight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The whole digital freight forwarding market is booming. Only last November, Germany’s Forto, a digital freight forwarder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">raised</a> another $50 million in funding taking its total raised to $103 million.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh off the announcement of more than $500 million in new capital across two new funds, Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group has announced that they&#8217;re adding Anu Sharma and Daniel Li to the team&#8217;s list of Partners.</p>
<p>The firm, which in recent years has paid particularly close attention to enterprise software bets, invests heavily in the early-stage Pacific Northwest startup scene.</p>
<p>Both Li and Sharma are stepping into the Partner role after some time at the firm. Li has been with Madrona for five years while Sharma joined the team in 2020. Prior to joining Madrona, Sharma led product management teams at Amazon Web Services, worked as a software developer at Oracle and had a stint in VC as an associate at SoftBank China &amp; India. Li previously worked at the Boston Consulting Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seattle-based Madrona raises $345M for its eighth early-stage fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/seattle-based-madrona-raises-320m-for-its-eighth-fund/embed/#?secret=U1UZi77aN6" data-secret="U1UZi77aN6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I got the chance to catch up with Li who notes that the promotion won&#8217;t necessarily mean a big shift in his day-to-day responsibilities &#8212; &#8220;At Madrona, you&#8217;re not promoted until you&#8217;re working in the next role anyway,&#8221; he says &#8212; but that he appreciates &#8220;how much trust the firm places in junior investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about leveling up his venture career during a time when public and private markets seem particularly flush with cash, Li acknowledges some looming challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;On one hand, it&#8217;s just been an amazing five years to join venture capital because things have just been up and to the right with lots of things that work; it&#8217;s just a super exciting time,&#8221; Li says. &#8220;On the other hand, from a macro perspective, you know that there&#8217;s more capital flowing into VC as an asset class than ever before. And just from that pure macro perspective, you know that that means returns are going to be lower in the next 10 years as valuations are higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Li is plenty bullish on internet companies claiming larger swaths of the global GDP and hopes to invest specifically in &#8220;low code platforms, next-gen productivity, and online communities,&#8221; Madrona notes in their announcement, while Sharma plans to continue looking at to &#8220;distributed systems, data infrastructure, machine learning, and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch recently talked to Li and his Madrona colleague Hope Cochran about some of the top trends in social gaming and how investors were approaching new opportunities across the gaming industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quite a bit has happened since Snap announced last week that it was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/"> indefinitely locking President Trump&#8217;s Snapchat account</a>. But after temporary bans from his Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts as well as a permanent ban from Twitter, Snap has decided that it will also be making its ban of the President&#8217;s Snapchat account permanent.</p>
<p>Though Trump&#8217;s social media preferences as a user are clear, Snapchat gave the Trump campaign a particularly effective platform to target young users who are active on the service. A permanent ban will undoubtedly complicate his future business and political ambitions as he finds himself removed from most mainstream social platforms.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s deplatorming follows riots last week at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob emboldened by the President himself. Since then, a number of companies have severed ties with the Trump brand, while social platforms have aimed to minimize Trump&#8217;s presence on their platforms in his final days as President and beyond.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap says it made the decision in light of repeated attempted violations of the company&#8217;s community guidelines that had been made over the past several months by the President&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last week we announced an indefinite suspension of President Trump’s Snapchat account, and have been assessing what long term action is in the best interest of our Snapchat community. In the interest of public safety, and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence, which are clear violations of our guidelines, we have made the decision to permanently terminate his account,” a Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s decision to permanently ban the President was first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-snapchat-will-permanently-ban-trumps-account-05419dd3-fed6-4614-9ed0-c2d606ef0e62.html">Axios</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">comprehensive ban from Twitter</a> and a number of other online services following last week&#8217;s assault on the Capitol by his followers, President Trump managed to put out a tweet in the form of a video address touching on the &#8220;calamity at the Capitol&#8221;&#8230; and, of course, his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">deplatforming</a>.</p>
<p>In the video, Trump instructs his followers to shun violence, calling it un-American. &#8220;No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence,&#8221; he said, days after calling rioters &#8220;great patriots&#8221; and telling them &#8220;we love you, you&#8217;re very special&#8221; as they despoiled the House and Senate.</p>
<p>He pivoted after a few minutes to the topic that, after his historic second impeachment, is almost certainly foremost on his mind: being banned from his chief instrument of governance, Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days,&#8221; he said, although the bans and other actions are all due to documented breaches of the platforms&#8217; rules. &#8220;The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>After having his @realdonaldtrump handle suspended by Twitter, Trump attempted to sockpuppet a few other prominent accounts of allies, but was swiftly shut down. What everyone assumed must be plans to join Parler were scuttled along with the social network itself, which has warned it may be permanently taken offline after Amazon and other internet infrastructure companies refused to host it.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering how Trump was able to slip this one past Twitter&#8217;s pretty decisive ban to begin with, we were curious too.</p>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>This Tweet is not in violation of the Twitter Rules. As we previously made clear, other official administration accounts, including @WhiteHouse, are permitted to Tweet as long as they do not demonstrably engage in <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/ban-evasion">ban evasion</a> or share content that otherwise violates the Twitter Rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, while Trump the person was banned, Trump the <em>head of the Executive branch </em>may still have some right, in the remaining week he holds the office, to utilize Twitter as a way of communicating matters of importance to the American people.</p>
<p>This gives a somewhat unfortunate impression of a power move, as Twitter has put itself in the position of determining what is a worthwhile transmission and what is a rabble-rousing incitement to violence. I&#8217;ve asked the company to clarify how it is determined whether what Trump does on this account is considered ban evasion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, almost simultaneous with Trump&#8217;s surprise tweet, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690">unloaded 13 tweets&#8217; worth of thoughts</a> about the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.</span></p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Jack neither reaches any real conclusions nor illuminates any new plans, but it&#8217;s clear he is thinking real hard about this. As he notes, however, it&#8217;ll take a lot of work to establish the &#8220;one humanity working together&#8221; he envisions as a sort of stretch goal for Twitter and the internet in general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. safety regulators have asked Tesla to recall 158,000 vehicles over media control unit failures that cause the touchscreen displays to stop working, following a months-long investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>The Office of Defects Investigation unit of the agency determined that the failure of the media control unit is a safety issue since functions like the backup camera and defogging and defrosting setting controls stop working as well as audible chimes, which are used when the turn signal indicator is activated and to alert drivers while the vehicle&#8217;s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system is engaged. Reports of the MCUs suddenly failing have been a topic for years in Tesla forums.</p>
<p>The failure is caused when the memory storage in a flash drive used in the used in these vehicles reaches capacity, investigators concluded. The only solution is to replace the physical piece of hardware. Vehicles affected include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 as well as Model X SUVs in 2016 through 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company did provide information to NHTSA, which is contained in the report. Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device’s finite storage capacity. Tesla provided its own statistical model showing the number of projected weekly MCU repairs from 2020 to 2028. The automaker estimated that replacement rates for MCU failures will peak in early 2022 and gradually decline until (near) full part turnover has been accomplished in 2028, according to the report.</p>
<p>These vehicles are equipped with an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device. Part of this 8GB storage capacity is used each time the vehicle is started. The eMMC NAND cell hardware fails when the storage capacity is reached, resulting in failure of the MCU, the agency said.</p>
<p>The eMMC NAND flash device&#8217;s lifespan based upon the number of program/erase cycles, after which the MCU fails due to memory wear-out. Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P/E cycles would take only 5 to 6 years, the agency said.</p>
<p>The agency has officially requested that Tesla initiate a recall to notify all owners, purchasers, and dealers of the subject vehicles of this safety defect and provide a remedy.</p>

<p>SNKRDUNK’s sales also grew last year, and in December 2020, it recorded a 3,000% year-over-year increase in monthly gross merchandise value. Chief executive officer Yuta Uchiyama told TechCrunch this was because demand for sneakers remained high, while more people also started buying things online.</p>

<p>Launched in 2018, SNKRDUNK now has 2.5 million monthly users, which it says makes it the largest C2C sneaker marketplace in Japan. The Series B will allow it to speed up the pace of its international expansion, add more categories and expand its authentication facilities.</p>
<p>Like StockX and GOAT, SNKRDUNK’s user fees cover authentication holds before sneakers are sent to buyers. The company partners with FAKE BUSTERS, an authentication service based in Japan, to check sneakers before they are sent to buyers.</p>
<p>In addition to its marketplace, SNKRDUNK also runs a sneaker news site and an online community.</p>
<p>SODA plans to work with other companies in SoftBank Venture Asia’s portfolio that develop AI-based tech to help automate its operations, including logistics, payment, customer service and counterfeit inspection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One in five people have a mental health illness. <a href="https://pace.group/">Pace</a>, a new startup founded by Pinterest and Affirm executives, wants to pay attention to the other four in that statistic.</p>
<p>“Nobody is perfectly mentally healthy all the time,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackwchou/">Jack Chou</a>, Pace co-founder. “It’s a non-existent idea, everyone is sort of swimming in between being clinically mentally unhealthy and perfectly mentally happy.”</p>
<p>While diagnosable mental health conditions might get an individual medication or therapy, those that live in a grey space might still need resources to stay afloat. After Chou experienced the <a href="https://medium.com/pacetogether/why-mental-health-is-about-everyone-and-why-we-started-pace-d68485671be">detrimental effects of burnout</a> while working for Pinterest and Affirm, and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecatlee/">Cat Lee</a>, formerly of Pinterest and Maveron, experienced a personal travesty, the former colleagues realized there needed to be a way to help people who didn’t fit squarely into one bucket.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So Pace, which launched out of private beta today, wants to address this fallacy by creating small-group training classes for people interested in taking care of their emotional and mental health. It is launching with $1.9 million in seed funding. Investors include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nellie-levchin-90b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nellie-levchin-90b/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErQXtGfLksRpmjRycCCLy0iv3v4g">Nellie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUXTnHgue12gcBfW3eif4HWPqhfQ">Max Levchin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKeF1BfnxFSod6YBch8B-f6_FMzA">Jeff Weiner</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliechoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliechoi/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmX2cQz7jbvnNOcdUYxHFpT6fLFg">Emilie Choi</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silbermann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/silbermann/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610658346268000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQ_YLngNl2hokCfQxAWTQLD_sSAQ">Ben Silbermann</a>, Box Group, and SV Angel.</p>
<p>The core of the product is a 90-minute live video group session once a week, delivered through Pace’s platform. The video component integrates with Twilio and Agora (and interestingly, not Zoom, because its SDK lacks personalization options). Users can attend the sessions on Web, iOS or Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096056" style="width: 882px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096056" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2096056" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png" alt="" width="872" height="544" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png 1826w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=1536,959 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pace_devices-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096056" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pace</p></div></p>
<p>Pace forms cohorts of eight to 10 people around shared interest or identities, such as a founder group or parent group. Then, Pace interviews a new user for 15 to 30 minutes to learn about what they hope to get out of the experience.</p>
<p>Once a group is formed, they meet weekly with a facilitator at the helm. While it’s not trying to be a therapy replacement, the startup is looking for facilitators who are licensed in mental health practice. To help them do this, Pace secured two founding members who are psychologists: Dr. Kerry Makin-Byrd and Dr. Vivian Oberling.</p>
<p>When users sign on, they are prompted to pick three words that describe themselves from dozens of options. Those words show up under their video as they talk, and help skip some small talk in the beginning of the sessions.</p>

<p>The group talks about a variety of topics, from how to manage stress to how to adapt to a remote world. There is no formal curriculum, but each class has a takeaway for participants to leave with.</p>
<p>Pace doesn’t follow any specific curriculum during the meetings, but instead uses the time for people to talk through their feelings. Facilitators are licensed mental health clinicians, with the majority of the leaders being part-time or freelancers. It plans to introduce asynchronous ways for group members to chat and stay in touch beyond the weekly class, as well as spend time building out a product that feels beyond a Zoom call.</p>
<p>Mental health software startups are on a tear right now. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/">Lyra Health raised $175 million at a $2.25 billion valuation</a> to connect employees to therapists and mental health services. Another telehealth provider, Talkspace, announced today that it was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/13/talkspace-to-go-public-in-1-4-billion-spac-deal/">going public through a SPAC</a>. There’s also Calm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">last valued at $2 billion</a>, and Headspace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/headspace-raises-53-million-and-40-million-in-debt-as-it-pursues-clinical-validation-for-mindfulness/">its biggest competitor</a> in the mindfulness app space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q0L6eeIY6H"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">Calm raises $75M more at $2B valuation</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Pace’s focus is more similar to the latter than the former: It’s avoiding the telehealth label and positioning itself more as supplementary to formal health services.</p>
<p>“Our hope is that as [therapists] have individual patients who they’d like to incorporate some group work, or need a next thing, that we’re here for that too,” says Chou.</p>
<p>One of Pace’s closest competitors is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/coa-seed-soulcycle-for-your-soul/">Coa</a>, which launched with $3 million in seed funding in October 2020. The startup is similarly using small-group fitness culture and applying it to mental health. It mixes lecture-style teaching with breakout sessions to breed conversation.</p>
<p>Pace wouldn’t expand on how it differentiates from Coa beyond alluding to upcoming product features and community investments. Coa charges $25 for drop-in classes (sticking to that fitness class theme) while Pace charges $45 per week for the same group to meet for months at a time. While Coa has licensed therapists, Pace has licensed mental health clinicians.</p>
<p>Coa co-founders Alexa Meyer and Dr. Emily Anhalt say their service is unique from Pace in a curriculum perspective.</p>
<p>“Although all of Coa’s classes are facilitated by licensed therapists, Coa’s classes are different from group therapy,” Meyer said. Coa uses Anhalt’s research around mental happiness to create programming. Both companies are still pre-launch, but Coa says it has 6,000 people on its waitlist.</p>

<p>For both startups, the hurdles ahead are common for any startup: customer acquisition, effectiveness in tracking outcomes and scaling an innately emotional and personalized experience. As Homebrew’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk">Hunter Walk</a> pointed out<a href="https://hunterwalk.com/2021/01/10/why-i-worry-about-venture-backed-mental-health-addiction-startups/"> in a recent blog post</a>, vulnerable populations being exposed to venture-level risk is a difficult phenomenon. Startups fail often, and in this case, that could mean leaving without once-critical support people who are depending on group therapy.</p>
<p>Going forward, the real winner in the mental health fitness space will come down to a thoughtful curriculum and a user experience that brings out vulnerability in people even over a virtual setting. Regardless, innovation pouring into the sector couldn’t come at a better time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last several years have seen a substantial increase of ability for robotic exoskeleton technology. Completely understandable. For one thing, it’s that rare technology you encounter that really feels like it’s going to change lives for the better the first time you see it. I’ve had a number of demos with companies that frankly took my breath away &#8212; watching someone walk across the room for the first time in years while their spouse stands by you crying will do that.</p>
<p>For another thing, there are two distinct use cases for this tech. The first is the aforementioned mobility &#8212; whether it&#8217;s full paralysis or simply helping people with walking impairments move a bit more easily. The second is work. Exoskeletons have great potential to ease the burden of lifting heavy objects or standing for extended periods. For this reason, many companies like Esko Bionics have created two distinct divisions to serve both sides.</p>

<p>So it’s a big, potential market &#8212; albeit one that’s still going to take a number of years to mature. For that reason, we’re really only talking rough projections here. I do think there’s still space for some smaller companies to carve out a meaningful business in the category.</p>
<p>I also won’t be surprised when more big companies get involved in the category. It’s a good way to put your stamp on the robotics category. Samsung’s GEMS is certainly the biggest-name product in the category this week at CES &#8212; even if it didn’t warrant a ton of stage time. It debuted at the event two years ago and we were able to try it out. For now, the news centered around hardware improvements like battery and the beginning of clinical trials – a necessary part of bringing this sort of healthcare or healthcare-adjacent product to market.</p>

<p>As with most of Samsung’s robotics announced at the show this week, the jury is very much still out with regards to how seriously the company is taking the product. Last year it made a brief appearance at CES as part of an “immersive workout experience.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2096116" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2096116" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2096116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T0015284_hero_image.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2096116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Archelis</p></div></p>
<p>Some smaller companies have shown off compelling entries. Japan-based Archelis Inc. is top of mind, showcasing the ArchelisFX, whose name derives from the Japanese word for &#8220;walkable chair.&#8221; The device is designed for a number of different scenarios, including back pain and those who have recently undergone surgery. The company says it will be available to rent or buy for around $5,000.</p>
<p>On the whole, the exoskeletons on display at this year’s virtual CES tend largely toward the mobility side of the equation. Notably absent was Sarcos Robotics, which announced a partnership with Delta Airlines at last year’s event. In September, the company built on that interest to raise a $40 million round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://weezy.co.uk/">Weezy</a> — an on-demand supermarket that delivers groceries in as fast as 15 minutes — has raised $20 million in a Series A funding led by New York-based venture capital fund Left Lane Capital. Also participating were U.K.-based fund DN Capital, earlier investors Heartcore Capital and angel investors, notably Chris Muhr, the Groupon founder.</p>
<p>Although the company hasn&#8217;t made mention of a later U.S. launch, the presence of U.S. investors would tend to suggest that. Weezy is reminiscent of Kozmo, the on-demand groceries business <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozmo.com">from the dot-com boom</a> of the late &#8217;90s. However, it differs from Postmates in that it doesn&#8217;t do pickups.</p>
<p>The cash injection will be used to expand its grocery delivery service across London and the broader UK, and open two fulfillment centers across London. Some 40 more U.K. sites are planned by the end of 2021 and it plans to add 50 new employees in the next four months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in July 2020, Weezy uses its own delivery people on pedal cycles or electric mopeds to deliver goods in less than 15 minutes on average. As well as working with wholesalers, it also sources groceries from independent bakers, butchers and markets.</p>
<p>It has pushed at an open door during the pandemic. In Q2 2020, half a million new shoppers joined the grocery delivery sector, which is now worth £14.3 billion in the U.K., according to research.</p>
<p>Kristof Van Beveren, co-founder and CEO of Weezy, said in a statement: “People are no longer happy to wait around for deliveries, and there is strong demand for a more efficient service.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FF6aggCez0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">London-based Weezy raises pre-seed funding for its 15-minute grocery delivery app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;London-based Weezy raises pre-seed funding for its 15-minute grocery delivery app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/embed/#?secret=FF6aggCez0" data-secret="FF6aggCez0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Weezy’s co-founders are Kristof Van Beveren and Alec Dent. Van Beveren is formerly from the consumer goods world at Procter &amp; Gamble and McKinsey &amp; Company, while Dent headed up operations at U.K. startup Drover and business development at BlaBlaCar.</p>
<p>Harley Miller, managing partner, Left Lane Capital, commented: “Weezy’s founding team have the right balance of drive, experience and temperament to lead in e-commerce innovation and convenience within the UK grocery market and beyond.”</p>
<p>Nenad Marovac, founder and managing partner, DN Capital, said: “Even before the pandemic, interest in online grocery shopping was on the rise. The first time I ordered from Weezy, my delivery arrived in seven minutes and I was hooked.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/blog/every-day-is-tag-day-is-your-pet-protected/">around 10 million pets</a> go missing in the U.S., and millions of those end up in shelters where they aren&#8217;t always reunited with their owners, due to their lack of identification or a microchip. A new mobile app, <a href="https://shadowapp.com/">Shadow</a>, aims to tackle this problem by leveraging a combination of a volunteer network and A.I. technology to help dog owners, in particular.</p>
<p>The startup is working in partnership with animal shelters and rescue organizations around the U.S. to pull in photos of the dogs they&#8217;re currently housing, then supplements this with photos pulled from social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>It then uses A.I. technology to match the photograph of the missing dogs to possible matches from nearby shelters or the web.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095976" style="width: 642px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095976" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?w=632" alt="" width="632" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,827 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=632,680 632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.52-PM-1.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shadow</p></div></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s not a match found, Shadow will then programmatically set a search radius based on where and when the dog went missing, and suggest other actions that the dog&#8217;s owner can take as the next steps.</p>
<p>This includes viewing all the photographs from the shelters directly, in the case that the technology matching process missed a possible match, as well as working with other Shadow users to help crowdsource activities like hanging &#8220;Lost Dog&#8221; flyers around a neighborhood, for example.</p>
<p>The app also relies on a network of volunteers who help by also reviewing shelter photographs and broadcasting missing posters to social media sites they use to increase the chances of the dog being found. Dog owners can even advertise a reward in the app to encourage people to help search.</p>
<p>Today, Shadow has grown its volunteer user base to over 30,000. And it&#8217;s partnered with the ASPCA, Animal Care Centers of New York and L.A., the Dallas shelter system and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095977" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095977" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?w=574" alt="" width="574" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=127,150 127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=253,300 253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,910 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=574,680 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-1.19.58-PM-1.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shadow</p></div></p>
<p>While Shadow is free to use, it makes money through a virtual tipping mechanism when it makes a successful match and the dog is found. It also offers users the ability to buy an Instagram ad in-app for $10. Here, Shadow provides the visual assets and manages the ad-buying process and placement process on owners&#8217; behalf.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by former Zocdoc founder Cyrus Massoumi, has been in a sort of public stealth mode for a few years as it grew beyond its hometown of New York. It&#8217;s now offering dog-finding services in 76 counties across 20 U.S. states.</p>
<p>We should note that Massoumi&#8217;s exit from Zocdoc was complicated. <a href="https://www.axios.com/zocdoc-health-tech-startup-lawsuit-new-york-5c151b39-d9ea-449f-b0fd-3e6933b3261d.html">He sued his co-founders and CFO</a> for orchestrating a plot to oust him from the company during a Nov. 2015 board meeting, claiming fraud. The lawsuit <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/zocdoc-swings-back-ousted-ceos-fraud-allegations">detailed the internal strife</a> inside Zocdoc at the time. A New York Supreme Court judge recently determined this lawsuit, which is ongoing, needs to be filed in Delaware, instead of New York. So a ruling is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, Zocdoc <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zocdocs-company-culture-2015-7">had been accused by Business Insider</a> of having developed a stressful, &#8220;bro culture,&#8221; in which young, male employees would make inappropriate remarks about the women who worked there. This was ahead of the larger rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement">#MeToo</a> movement, which has since impacted how businesses address these issues in the workplace.</p>
<p>Massoumi disputes the claims were exactly as described by the article. The company had 300 salespeople at the time, and while he agrees some people may have acted inappropriately, he also believes the company&#8217;s response to those actions was handled properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The allegations were fully investigated at Zocdoc and found to be without merit,&#8221; he told TechCrunch, adding that Zocdoc was repeatedly recognized as a &#8220;best place to work&#8221; while he was CEO. (There were never allegations against Massoumi, but ultimately, the buck stops with the CEO.)</p>
<p>Shadow today claims a different makeup. It has a team of 12 people, and two-thirds of its product and engineering team are women. Some Zocdoc investors have also returned to back Massoumi again.</p>
<p>The startup is funded by Founders Fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/humbition-is-a-new-fund-led-by-the-indiegogos-slava-rubin/">Humbition</a> (Massoumi and Indiegogo founder Slava Rubin&#8217;s fund), Lux Capital, firstminute Capital, and other angels, including a prior Zocdoc investor.</p>
<p>Despite the complicated Zocdoc history, the work Shadow is doing is solving a problem many people do care about. Millions of pet owners lose their pets to euthanization as they end up at shelters that cannot keep animals indefinitely due to lack of space. Meanwhile, the current system of having lost-pet messages distributed across social media can mean many of those posts aren&#8217;t seen &#8212; especially in larger metros where there are numerous &#8220;lost pet&#8221; groups.</p>

<p>As Shadow began its work in 2018, it was local to the New York area. Its first year, it reunited 600 dogs. The next year, it reunited 2,000 dogs. The third year, it reunited 5,000 dogs. Today, it&#8217;s nearing 10,000 dogs reunited with owners.</p>
<p>More than half of those were since the pandemic began, which saw many new pet owners and increased time spent outdoors with those pets, when dogs can sometimes get loose.</p>
<p>Massoumi says he was inspired to found Shadow after a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlTcJiCDmj7/">friend</a> lost his own dog, the namesake Shadow. It took the friend over a month to find the dog after both following false leads and being connected with people who tried to help him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking to myself, this is something that happens 100 million times a year, globally … and for people who love pets, this is a lost family member,&#8221; Massoumi explains. &#8220;It seemed to me to be a similar problem that I&#8217;d already been solving in healthcare, where there&#8217;s fragmentation &#8212; people want to see the doctor and the doctor wants to see the patient, but there&#8217;s just not a central way to make it work,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>More broadly, he wants to see technology being put to good use to solve problems that people actually care about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there needs to be more technology that injects the humanity back in what everyone does. I think that it&#8217;s very core that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he says.</p>
