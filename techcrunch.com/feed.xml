										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://atomizedhq.com/">Atomized</a>, an early stage startup that wants to create a modern tool to help developers deploy infrastructure faster, announced the first step of its funding journey today, a $500,000 pre-seed round from Zing Capital, Y Combinator and several unnamed angels.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Nik Kotov says developers are spending over 20% of their time on setting up the necessary infrastructure just to run their applications, and he and his co-founder and CTO Eddie Herbert believed there had to be a better way, so like all good entrepreneurs, they built one.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Atomized our goal is to provide a platform that allows developers to deploy their applications really quickly. And the way it literally works is that we plug into where your code lives in GitHub, and also plug into your cloud provider, so currently it&#8217;s AWS, and we automatically spin up all the necessary infrastructure for you&#8221; Kotov told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For now, that means spinning up containers, databases and static sites on AWS, but there are plans to expand that to work across multiple clouds over time as the company develops. &#8220;Our [goal] is actually to abstract away all those choices, all those nitty gritty details of Amazon, Azure and GCP and essentially provide you the easiest most straightforward solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kotov actually went through Y Combinator last summer as a solo founder, but he was trying to build a different product at that time dealing with compliance infrastructure. He ended up pivoting to this solution and joining forces with Herbert after Demo Day, but says the experience was well worth his time, even if he ended up with a different approach after all was said and done.</p>
<p>&#8220;YC opened up a huge door for me as someone who does not have any connections to Silicon Valley whatsoever. [&#8230;] Being an immigrant and not coming from a rich family [&#8230;], all of a sudden I got access to a bunch of people that I previously had no access to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Both founders are immigrants with Kotov hailing from Russia and Herbert from Estonia. They are both based in Charlotte, North Carolina, which Kotov says is a hidden gem for diverse technical talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Charlotte is kind of the best place to [build a startup] because in general Charlotte is very diverse, which a lot people don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s 50% white and the rest are Black or Latino. It&#8217;s kind of awesome because we can hire the best people and then have diversity also built into into the company as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The product is in Beta right now with 60 customers running on the platform. The plan is to use the money judiciously to begin to hire some more people. Right now in addition to the two founders, they have two full time engineers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drue Kataoka’s art has made it to collections in five countries and even the International Space Station. Now the artist, activist and<a href="https://nextshark.com/drue-kataoka-clubhouse-app-icon/"> current face of Clubhouse’s app icon</a> is releasing her first NFT to support Asian American causes. The auction will begin on digital art marketplace <a href="https://niftygateway.com/">Nifty Gateway</a> at 1:30PM EST, May 13, along <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/PYlRYkW3">with a launch party on Clubhouse</a>, and run for 24 hours. Nifty Gateway is waiving its auction fees and all proceeds will go to the Catalyst Fund for Justice (CFJ), the grant-making arm of <a href="https://standwithasianamericans.com">Stand with Asian Americans</a>, a coalition of business leaders and activists partnered with the <a href="https://asianpacificfund.org/">Asian Pacific Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Kataoka is known for commissioned artworks like mirror-polished steel sculptures. and art that uses virtual reality, EEG and mobile technology. One of her pieces, “Up!,” created with Sumi-e ink on mounted rice paper, was <a href="https://www.drue.net/art-space-exhibit">part of the first zero-gravity art exhibit at the International Space Station</a>. She is also an activist and organizer, and has raised a total of almost $300,000 through Clubhouse for<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stopasianhate"> #StopAsianHate</a>, <a href="https://hopefoundationusa.com/covid-19-emergency-response">#Clubhouse4India</a> and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/martin-luther-king-center-fundraiser">#24HoursofLove</a> for <a href="https://thekingcenter.org">The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change</a>, the non-profit started in 1968 by Coretta Scott King.</p>
<p>Called “In the Club: #StopAsianHate,” Kataoka’s NFT was inspired by activist communities on Clubhouse, where Kataoka leads the Art Club, one of the app’s biggest art groups with 102,000 followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’ve been passionate about leveraging Clubhouse as a medium for social change,” Kataoka said. For this project, “we want to fire on all cylinders, not just only philanthropy or not just only art, but both of those at the highest level to really serve a goal and create the most impact that we possibly can for the Asian American community.”</p>

<p>Kataoka is the founder and chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.drue.net/">Drue Kataoka Studios</a>, which creates pieces that bring together influences from Zen Buddhism, her training in Sumi-e ink painting and Silicon Valley. Instead of art school, Kataoka went to Stanford University because she wanted to learn about tech like virtual and augmented reality, how to code and business fundamentals.</p>
<p>“My mantra for the past 20 years has been that art is technology and technology is art,” she told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For her “genesis drop,” or first NFT release, Kataoka wanted “to be very thoughtful about the first project I did, and I’m excited that it will be this one. I’ve been watching the space very carefully and I am very bullish on crypto and NFTs. I know there’s a lot of volatility and many things that will fall away and not stand the test of time, but ultimately as a mechanism for creativity and so many important things, this will be the way of the future.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Eric Kim, co-chair of Stand with Asian Americans&#8217; Catalyst Fund for Justice, said “the fact that Drue is willing to donate 100% of the proceeds to go towards the AAPI community is really, really meaningful. I think it’s also a beautiful expression of blockchain technology.”</p>
<p>Kim, who is also co-founder and managing partner of venture firm Goodwater Capital, added, “I’ve been searching for the best product market fit of the blockchain and through this project&#8211;digital art being captured, codified, securitized in non-fungible tokens, and then being utilized for the community, launched on Clubhouse even, and auctioned through a platform like Nifty Gateway&#8211;it is one of the best applications of blockchain I’ve ever seen and an amazing coordination of multiple consumer tech platforms.”</p>
<p>About one-minute long, “In the Club: #StopAsianHate” features an image of a Clubhouse room superimposed over a gold-colored background. User photos have been removed and a series of shifting shapes, sculpted by Kataoka in virtual reality, can be seen through the remaining spaces. At the same time, chanting from a recent street protest is played, overlaid on a recording of Kataoka’s own heartbeat. At the end, the sounds fade into wind, symbolizing air, or qi, chi, ki or prana, a vital force in many Asian cultures.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/beqxlfYyk1Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>“It’s a tribute to all of the activists and community members who have really put a lot of belief and faith into this movement and who were speaking out about these issues very early on. One of the things that I feel is disturbing is that mainstream media has either turned a blind eye or sugarcoated a lot of the hate crimes going on in our community and a lot of big issues for the Asian American community,” said Kataoka. “With Clubhouse, it’s completely unfiltered and uncensored, and very early on, last year in 2020, I was hosting and listening to those conversations. We were having serious conversations that really started to take off and gather momentum synergistically with Twitter, that some of the mainstream news outlets were not interested in at the time.”</p>
<p>Kim said the Catalyst Fund for Justice will use a data-driven approach to finding grant recipients. Initially, it will focus on reducing hate crimes and supporting victims; workplace discrimination; the lack of Asian American representation in politics; and supporting underfunded non-profits. Some goals include introducing more Asian American history into educational curriculums, understanding how workplace bias prevents more Asian Americans from being promoted into leadership roles, and increasing the number of Asian Americans in civic organizations.</p>
<p>After the Atlanta shootings, Kim began working with venture capitalists, including his co-founder at Goodwater Chi-Hua Chien, GGV managing partner Hans Tung and Lightspeed Venture partner Jeremy Liew, raising $5 million from a collective of leading VCs to donate to AAPI organizations.</p>
<p>“Coming out of that heightened awareness and and activation, business leaders, entrepreneurs and investors started thinking, how can we do this more systematically and apply our professional skill sets to this movement,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Stand with Asian Americans was the result of these types of discussions, and at the end of March, the coalition <a href="https://standwithasianamericans.com/static/pledge.pdf">outlined its mission in a full-page Wall Street Journal ad</a> co-signed by business and political leaders including Zoom founder and CEO Steve Chen, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Wang, Stitch Fix co-founder and CEO Katrina Lake and former governor of Washington and United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke. Stand with Asian Americans is partnered with the Asian Pacific Fund, one of the Bay Area’s most tenured AAPI non-profits, and launched the Catalyst Fund for Justice as its grant-making arm to harness the power of what is now nearly 8,000 signatories and over 100 dedicated volunteers.</p>
<p>In a statement, Asian Pacific Fund president and executive director Audrey Yamamoto said, “Drue Kataoka’s generous donation of her Genesis NFT drop means the world to the AAPI community as we continue to live in fear of violence and hate every time we leave our homes. The Catalyst Fund for Justice will tap into new sources of funding and use a data-driven approach to make grants that truly move the needle on addressing the greatest injustices faced by our AAPI community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Pomelo, a startup building a fintech-as-a-service platform for Latin America, has raised $9 million in a seed round of funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Buenos Aires-based startup’s new infrastructure aims to allow fintechs and embedded finance players to launch virtual accounts and issue prepaid and credit cards via “compliant” onboarding processes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital payments all over the world, and Latin America is no exception. While the majority of transactions are still done in cash, there are still over a billion cards in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Cards have an estimated payments volume of $900 billion per year, and yet 95% of these transactions are being processed by local incumbents, asserts Pomelo. This is a problem the company&#8217;s founders experienced firsthand in previous roles, and are eager to solve by creating a new payments infrastructure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We know from previous experiences&#8230;that building a fintech, and particularly issuing cards, in Latin America is a real nightmare,” said Pomelo co-founder and CEO Gaston Irigoyen. “It takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months to launch a simple prepaid card, and unfortunately companies have to go through the painful experience of repeating the process in every market where they operate.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pomelo’s goal is to solve the problem by creating a new generation of financial services infrastructure that allows companies to build a fintech business and launch cards “much faster” throughout Latin America. For now, the three-month-old company is in its infancy &#8212; the pre-product phase, which makes it even more notable that the company managed to raise such a large seed round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oUsTCR5KYD"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/clocktower-technology-ventures-makes-25m-bet-on-latin-american-fintechs/">Clocktower Technology Ventures makes $25M bet on Latin American fintechs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clocktower Technology Ventures makes $25M bet on Latin American fintechs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/clocktower-technology-ventures-makes-25m-bet-on-latin-american-fintechs/embed/#?secret=oUsTCR5KYD" data-secret="oUsTCR5KYD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">This round caught our eye for a few other reasons. For one, the three co-founders of the Buenos Aires-based startup were former executives at Mastercard, Google LatAm, Mercado Pago and Naranja X. CEO Irigoyen was an early employee at Google LatAm. He is also a third-time founder with two exits (one to TripAdvisor) and former CEO of Naranja X, Argentina&#8217;s largest neobank, with millions of customers. Juan Fantoni was the former director of fintech at Mastercard, where he signed issuing deals with a number of large companies. And Hernan Corral was the CPO of Naranja X and previously head of digital accounts &amp; cards at Mercado Pago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, the caliber of Pomelo’s investors. U.S.-based Index Ventures and Brazil’s monashees co-led the funding round, which also included participation from QED’s Fontes, Max Levchin&#8217;s SciFi, Latitud, Biz Stone&#8217;s Future Positive, 20VC, Addition, FJ Labs and a16z’s Angela Strange, as well as the founders of Marqeta, Rappi, Auth0, Kavak, Loft and RecargaPay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re looking for comparisons to U.S.-based fintechs, Irigoyen said it’s got a little bit of Galileo, Marqeta and Stripe in what it’s building out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Caio Bolognesi, partner at monashees, said his firm has been very bullish on the financial infrastructure space as a whole. They were drawn to Pomelo in part because its founders had been senior tech executives at leading fintech companies in the region and because many of its portfolio companies had already manifested the need for a better solution in this space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Index Ventures’ Mark Fiorentino agrees that the company’s founder-market fit was crucial in his firm’s decision to invest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They have the DNA of the most well-known payments companies within the LATAM fintech ecosystem&#8230; and have lived through the pain points and keyed in on this opportunity through firsthand experience,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In general, Fiorentino believes that while the need for embedded financial products is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the Latin American market, it’s important to note that the region “is far from a carbon copy” of the U.S. market with different dynamics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For one, he said, existing solutions in the Latin American market are either “outdated” offerings from legacy financial institutions or “subpar” iterations from U.S. incumbents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It takes over 12 months for a business to spin up a plastic or digital card for itself. And because most legacy processors are owned by banks or large financial institutions that have been around for decades, pricing is inflexible and expensive,” Fiorentino told TechCrunch. “And if that wasn’t enough of a headache, stable reliability has been a huge pain point with these issuer processors. Pomelo is building the dev-first, self-serve API solution to address this clear market need.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Pomelo plans to use its new capital in part to open offices in São Paulo, Brazil and Mexico City, and hire dozens of people in those cities as well as in its home base of Argentina. The company currently has about 15 employees, 11 of which are engineers. It of course plans to continue building out its offering.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Boston Dynamics’ robot “dogs,” or similar versions thereof, are already being employed by police departments in Hawaii, Massachusetts and New York. Partly through the veil of experimentation, few answers are being given by these police forces about the benefits and costs of using these powerful surveillance devices.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, in a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/community-control-over-police-surveillance-ccops-model-bill">position paper on CCOPS</a> (community control over police surveillance), proposes an act to promote transparency and protect civil rights and liberties with respect to surveillance technology. To date, 19 U.S. cities in have passed CCOPS laws, which means, in practical terms, that virtually all other communities don’t have a requirement that police are transparent about their use of surveillance technologies.</p>
<p>For many, this ability to use new, unproven technologies in a broad range of ways presents a real danger. Stuart Watt, a world-renowned expert in artificial intelligence and the CTO of <a href="https://turalt.com/">Turalt</a>, is not amused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Even seemingly fun and harmless “toys” have all the necessary functions and features to be weaponized.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“I am appalled both by the principle and the dogbots and of them in practice. It&#8217;s a big waste of money and a distraction from actual police work,” he said. “Definitely communities need to be engaged with. I am honestly not even sure what the police forces think the whole point is. Is it to discourage through a physical surveillance system, or is it to actually prepare people for some kind of enforcement down the line?</p>
<p>“Chunks of law enforcement have forgotten the whole ‘protect and serve’ thing, and do neither,” Watts added. “If they could use artificial intelligence to actually protect and actually serve vulnerable people, the homeless, folks addicted to drugs, sex workers, those in poverty and maligned minorities, it&#8217;d be tons better. If they <em>have to</em> spend the money on AI, spend it to help people.”</p>
<p>The ACLU is advocating exactly what Watt suggests. In proposed language to city councils across the nation, the ACLU makes it clear that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The City Council shall only approve a request to fund, acquire, or use a surveillance technology if it determines the benefits of the surveillance technology outweigh its costs, that the proposal will safeguard civil liberties and civil rights, and that the uses and deployment of the surveillance technology will not be based upon discriminatory or viewpoint-based factors or have a disparate impact on any community or group.</p></blockquote>
<p>From a legal perspective, Anthony Gualano, a lawyer and special counsel at <a href="https://www.teamlaw.com/">Team Law</a>, believes that CCOPS legislation makes sense on many levels.</p>
<p>“As police increase their use of surveillance technologies in communities around the nation, and the technologies they use become more powerful and effective to protect people, legislation requiring transparency becomes necessary to check what technologies are being used and how they are being used.”</p>

<p>For those not only worried about this Boston Dynamics dog, but all future incarnations of this supertech canine, the current legal climate is problematic because it essentially allows our communities to be testing grounds for Big Tech and Big Government to find new ways to engage.</p>
<p>Just last month, public pressure forced the New York Police Department to suspend use of a robotic dog, quite unassumingly named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/nyregion/nypd-robot-dog.html?searchResultPosition=2">Digidog</a>. After the tech hound was placed on temporary leave due to public pushback, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/nyregion/robot-dog-nypd.html">the NYPD used it at a public housing building</a> in March. This went over about as well as you could expect, leading to discussions as to the immediate fate of this technology in New York.</p>
<p>The New York Times phrased it perfectly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/nyregion/nypd-robot-dog-backlash.html">observing</a> that “the NYPD will return the device earlier than planned after critics seized on it as a dystopian example of overly aggressive policing.”</p>
<p>While these bionic dogs are powerful enough to take a bite out of crime, the police forces seeking to use them have a lot of public relations work to do first. A great place to begin would be for the police to actively and positively participate in CCOPS discussions, explaining what the technology involves, and how it (and these robots) will be used tomorrow, next month and potentially years from now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bird Rides, the shared electric scooter startup that operates in more than 100 cities across 3 continents, said Wednesday it is going public by merging with special purpose acquisition company Switchback II with an implied valuation of $2.3 billion. The announcement confirms earlier reports, including one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/bird-reportedly-prepares-to-go-public-via-spac-aims-for-2023-profitability/">this week from dot.la</a>, that Bird intended to go public via a SPAC.</p>
<p>Bird said it was able to raise $106 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, by institutional investor Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, and others. Apollo Investment Corp. and MidCap Financial Trust provided an additional $40 million asset financing.</p>
<p>The transaction will enable the combined entity to retain net proceeds of up to $428 million of cash, according to Switchback, which brings <span class="xn-money">$316 million</span> cash-in-trust to the table. The announcement also provided new information about a previously undisclosed <span class="xn-money">$208 million, which Bird raised privately</span> as part of an <span class="xn-chron">April 2021</span> Senior Preferred Convertible equity offering led by Bracket Capital, Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When and how Bird would go public has been an item of speculation after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG">Bloomberg reported</a> last November that the company received “inbound interest” from SPACs.</p>
<p>Bird’s ride has been bumpy at times. In 2020, revenue dropped to $95 million, or 37% from the previous year. That year the company also laid off around 30% of its workforce – 406 people – for cost-saving reasons. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/bird-reportedly-prepares-to-go-public-via-spac-aims-for-2023-profitability/">The company may use this new access to cash</a> to expand its European operations and pay off debt.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the new injection of cash may help the company finally achieve profitability. It&#8217;s a rarity amongst scooter startups, who face notoriously high overhead.</p>
<p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have become a popular route for going public amongst transportation startups. Already this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/">scooter company Helbiz</a>, which is based in Europe and the U.S., went public via SPAC in a merger with GreenVision Acquisition Corp. SPAC shell corporations allow companies to list on the NASDAQ without doing a traditional initial public offering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think when money's chasing money, you don't want to be the last guy holding the money. You want to be the chase,"]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a recent episode of TechCrunch&#8217;s Equity podcast, hosts Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm invited Yext CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevecakebread/">Steve Cakebread</a> and Latch CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garth-mitchell-34837511/">Garth Mitchell</a> on to discuss when companies should go public, the costs and benefits of the process, and when a SPAC can make sense. <a href="https://www.yext.com/">Yext</a> pursued a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">traditional IPO a few years back</a>; Latch is now going public via a blank-check company combination.</p>
<p>The chat was more than illustrative, as we got to hear two CFOs share their views on delayed public offerings and when different types of debuts can make the most sense. While the TechCrunch crew has, at times, made light of certain SPAC-led deals, the pair argued that the transactions can make good sense.</p>
<p>Undergirding the conversation was Cakebread&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IPO-Playbook-Insiders-Perspective-Company/dp/1733959122">recent IPO-focused book</a>, which not only posited that companies going public earlier rather than later is good for their internal operations but also because it can provide the public with a chance to participate in a company&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s hyper-charged private markets and frothy public domain, his argument is worth considering.</p>
<p>What follows is the recap for those who prefer the written word, but we&#8217;ve also embedded the entire episode below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/4007687c-0c98-483c-b742-e7fc1df3c375?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<h2>What the CFOs say</h2>
<p>Cakebread said he began shaping his ideas around IPOs while working at Salesforce alongside CEO Mark Benioff while they mulling whether to take the company public.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we started to realize was [that] it makes you more efficient; it forces you to put systems in place; it makes you run a business as opposed to just keep getting money from people to keep growing the business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so from the business angle&#8230; it was always about discipline and running a business and getting going.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Cakebread examined other companies and served on boards, his ideas evolved. He noted that the number of listed companies on the exchanges has dropped by 50% over the last decade or so. That&#8217;s a problem.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

The resulting invoices then land in the finance department, a part of companies that can be a bit siloed. Finance is then left to determine a number of factors, like why something was purchased, whether it delivered, and if the invoice should it be paid at all.</p>
<p>Stampli turns each bill into a communications hub, connecting the folks in finance to other stakeholders on the purchase, including the vendor. Its system uses machine learning to recognize patterns around how the organization allocates cost, manage approval workflows, and what data can be extracted from invoices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stampli has been historically payment platform agnostic, meaning that its customers could use whatever payment method or provider they wanted. However, in early 2020, Stampli launched Direct Pay, its own payments product that solve some of the stickier problems for the accounting department. This fits into the general trend of seeing modern software companies bake a payments option into their services, adding a revenue stream to their books in the process.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stampli, an invoice management software startup, launches a payments product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/stampli-an-invoice-management-software-startup-launches-a-payments-product/embed/#?secret=wkkIzRn1fV" data-secret="wkkIzRn1fV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Because Stampli&#8217;s core product focused on the context of individual transactions, it plays well with its payments product. For example, folks who pay through ACH (which comes at a low, flat cost) usually suffer from the fact that the payment method likes to group multiple transactions into a single sum, which removes context. That issue can make it a huge headache for accounts payable to reconcile individual purchases. But because Stampli already understands the context of individual transactions, it can fill in the blanks for accounting while still allowing them to use ACH for payments.</p>
<p>Of course, Stampli remains payments agnostic, letting organizations use whatever provider they&#8217;d like. Still, co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/feldman_eyal?lang=en">Eyal Feldman</a> says that between 20 and 25 percent of Stampli&#8217;s customers use Direct Pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are all these payment providers that monetize on the payments themselves,&#8221; said Feldman. &#8220;We provide payments as a service to our customers to give them the easiest way to manage that part of the process. There is a revenue stream coming from Direct Pay but that isn&#8217;t the reason we do it. We want to turn payments into a commodity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stampli will use the new funding to sprint into scaling, aiming to double the size of the business in the next year. Thus far, Stampli has about 1000 customers, and has managed $20 billion in transactions.</p>
<p>The latest round brings Stampli&#8217;s total amount of funding to $87 million, which has come from investors such as Signal Fire and UpWest.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> unpacked <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a>&#8216;s latest project: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">The Duolingo EC-1.</a> The 12,000 word four-part series was published last week and is worth a read. But, until you get to it, enjoy our podcast that doubles-clicks into its most interesting bits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146587" style="width: 492px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146587" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Duolingo_PressKit_DuoHop_900.gif" alt="" width="482" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146587" class="wp-caption-text">Duo, Duolingo&#8217;s mascot, flying around. <strong> Image Credits: Duolingo </strong></p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it went, after we got our morning allergy banter out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s an EC-1?</strong> A TechCrunch-style deep-dive into one of the startup world&#8217;s most promising, and interesting companies.</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s with the flying vermin up above?</strong> That&#8217;s Duolingo&#8217;s mascot. Which is a combination of hypercutness and modest menace. (You <em>will</em> have fun learning a language. Or the owl <em>will</em> visit.)</li>
<li><strong>Why did we write about Duolingo? </strong>No, it wasn&#8217;t only because Duolingo is edtech. Natasha dug into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">the company&#8217;s product-led growth mode, and its views on gamification</a>, which were fascinating.</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s up with today&#8217;s show name?</strong> As it turns out, Duolingo has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/">Tinder angle.</a> In fact, Duolingo leaned on some of the biggest companies out there when it came to design and monetization.</li>
<li>And as with all edtech companies, we talked monetization and outcomes!</li>
</ul>
<p>The Duolingo EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 12,200 words and a reading time of 48 minutes. Here’s what’s in store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">How a bot-fighting test turned into edtech’s most iconic brand, Duolingo</a>” (3,300 words/13 minutes) — looks at how Guatemalan immigrant entrepreneur Luis von Ahn pivoted from fighting bot attacks on login screens with squiggly text to building one of edtech’s great success stories.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Product-led growth strategy</strong> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">The product-led growth behind edtech’s most downloaded app</a>” (3,000 words/12 minutes) — analyzes the tactics and tradeoffs that an edtech company has to evaluate as it grows from thousands to 500 million registered learners.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Monetization</strong> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/">How Duolingo became fluent in monetization</a>” (2,800 words/11 minutes) — examines how Duolingo experimented with a variety of different business models to match its unique community, and why it chose subscription in the end.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: New initiatives and future outlook</strong> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo can’t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try</a>” (3,100 words/12 minutes) — explores how Duolingo is launching new business lines, their chances for success, and how the company is attempting to expand its main product from basic language fluency to mastery while adding speaking skills to the mix.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has published its long-trailed (child) &#8216;safety-focused&#8217; plan to regulate online content and speech.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Bill has been in the works for years &#8212; during which time a prior plan to require age verification for accessing online porn in the UK, also with the goal of protecting kids from being exposed to inappropriate content online but which was widely criticized as unworkable, got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uk-quietly-ditches-porn-age-checks-in-favor-of-wider-online-harms-rules/">quietly dropped</a>.</p>
<p>At the time the government said it would focus on introducing comprehensive legislation to regulate a range of online harms. It can now say it&#8217;s done that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 145-page Online Safety Bill can be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-online-safety-bill">found here</a> on the gov.uk website &#8212; along with 123 pages of explanatory notes and an 146-page impact assessment.</p>
<p>The draft legislation imposes a duty of care on digital service providers to moderate user generated content in a way that prevents users from being exposed to illegal and/or harmful stuff online.</p>
<p>The government dubs the plan globally &#8220;groundbreaking&#8221; and claims it will usher in &#8220;a new age of accountability for tech and bring fairness and accountability to the online world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Critics warn the proposals will harm freedom of expression by encouraging platforms to over-censor, while also creating major legal and operational headaches for digital businesses that will discourage tech innovation.</p>
<p>The debate starts now in earnest.</p>
<p>The bill will be scrutinised by a joint committee of MPs &#8212; before a final version is formally introduced to Parliament for debate later this year.</p>
<p>How long it might take to hit the statute books isn&#8217;t clear but the government has a large majority in parliament so, failing major public uproar and/or mass opposition within its own ranks, the Online Safety Bill has a clear road to becoming law.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, digital secretary Oliver Dowden said: &#8220;Today the UK shows global leadership with our groundbreaking laws to usher in a new age of accountability for tech and bring fairness and accountability to the online world.</p>
<p class="last-child">&#8220;We will protect children on the internet, crack down on racist abuse on social media and through new measures to safeguard our liberties, create a truly democratic digital age.&#8221;</p>
<p>The length of time it&#8217;s taken for the government to draft the<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/985033/Draft_Online_Safety_Bill_Bookmarked.pdf"> Online Safety Bill</a> underscores the legislative challenge involved in trying to &#8216;regulate the Internet&#8217;.</p>
<p>In a bit of a Freudian slip, the DCMS&#8217; own PR talks about &#8220;the government&#8217;s fight to make the internet safe&#8221;. And there are certainly question-marks over who the future winners and losers of the UK&#8217;s Online Safety laws will be.</p>
<h2>Safety and democracy?</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-laws-to-keep-children-safe-stop-racial-hate-and-protect-democracy-online-published">press release</a> about the plan, the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) claimed the &#8220;landmark laws&#8221; will &#8220;keep children safe, stop racial hate and protect democracy online&#8221;.</p>
<p>But as that grab-bag of headline goals implies there&#8217;s an awful lot going on here &#8212; and huge potential for things to go wrong if the end result is an incoherent mess of contradictory rules that make it harder for digital businesses to operate and for Internet users to access the content they need.</p>
<p>The laws are set to apply widely &#8212; not just to tech giants or social media sites but to a broad swathe of websites, apps and services that host user-generated content or just allow people to talk to others online.</p>
<p>In scope services will face a legal requirement to remove and/or limit the spread of illegal and (in the case of larger services) harmful content, with the risk of major penalties for failing in this new duty of care toward users. There will also be requirements for reporting child sexual exploitation content to law enforcement.</p>
<p>Ofcom, the UK&#8217;s comms regulator &#8212; which is responsible for regulating the broadcast media and telecoms sectors &#8212; is set to become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/uk-names-its-pick-for-social-media-harms-watchdog/">UK Internet&#8217;s content watchdog too</a>, under the plan.</p>
<p>It will have powers to sanction companies that fail in the new duty of care toward users by hitting them with fines of up to £18M or ten per cent of annual global turnover (whichever is higher).</p>
<p>The regulator will also get the power to block access to sites &#8212; so the potential for censoring entire platforms is baked in.</p>
<p>Some campaigners backing tough new Internet rules have been pressing the government to include the threat of criminal sanctions for CEOs to concentrate C-suite minds on anti-harms compliance. And while ministers haven&#8217;t gone that far, DCMS says a new criminal offence for senior managers has been included as a deferred power &#8212; adding: &#8220;This could be introduced at a later date if tech firms don’t step up their efforts to improve safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite there being widespread public support in the UK for tougher rules for Internet platforms, the devil <em>is</em> the detail of how exactly you propose to do that.</p>
<p>Civil rights campaigners and tech policy experts have warned from the get-go that the government&#8217;s plan risks having a chilling effect on online expression by forcing private companies to be speech police.</p>
<p>Legal experts are also warning over how workable the framework will be, given hard to define concepts like &#8220;harms&#8221; &#8212; and, in a new addition, content that&#8217;s defined as &#8220;democratically important&#8221; (which the government wants certain platforms to have a special duty to protect).</p>
<p>The clear risk is massive legal uncertainty wrapping digital businesses &#8212; with knock-on impacts on startup innovation and availability of services in the UK.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The bill&#8217;s earlier incarnation &#8212; a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">2019 White Paper</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; had the word &#8220;harms&#8221; in the title. That&#8217;s been swapped for a more anodyne reference to &#8220;safety&#8221; but the legal uncertainty hasn&#8217;t been swapped out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The emphasis remains on trying to rein in an amorphous conglomerate of &#8216;harms&#8217; &#8212; some illegal, others just unpleasant &#8212; that have been variously linked to or associated with online activity. (Often off the back of high profile media reporting, such as into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/instagrams-adam-mosseri-to-meet-uk-health-secretary-over-suicide-content-concerns/">children&#8217;s exposure to suicide content</a> on platforms like Instagram.)</span></p>

<p>This can range from bullying and abuse (online trolling), to the spread of illegal content (child sexual exploitation), to content that&#8217;s merely inappropriate for children to see (legal pornography).</p>
<p>Certain types of online scams (romance fraud) are another harm the government wants the legislation to address, per latest additions.</p>
<p>The umbrella &#8216;harms&#8217; framing makes the UK approach distinct to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">European Union&#8217;s Digital Service Act</a> &#8212; a parallel legislative proposal to update the EU&#8217;s digital rules that&#8217;s more tightly focused on things that are illegal, with the bloc setting out rules to standardize reporting procedures for illegal content; and combating the risk of dangerous products being sold on ecommerce marketplaces with &#8216;know your customer&#8217; requirements.</p>

<p>In a response to criticism of the UK Bill&#8217;s potential impact on online expression, the government has added measures which it said today are aimed at strengthen people’s rights to express themselves freely online.</p>
<p>It also says it&#8217;s added in safeguards for journalism and to protect democratic political debate in the UK.</p>
<p>However its approach is already raising questions &#8212; including over what look like some pretty contradictory stipulations.</p>
<p>For example, the DCMS&#8217; discussion of how the bill will handle journalistic content confirms that content on news publishers&#8217; own websites won&#8217;t be in scope of the law (reader comments on those sites are also not in scope) and that articles by &#8220;recognised news publishers&#8221; shared on in-scope services (such as social media sites) will be exempted from legal requirements that may otherwise apply to non journalistic content.</p>
<p>Indeed, platforms will have a legal requirement to safeguard access to journalism content. (&#8220;This means [digital platforms] will have to consider the importance of journalism when undertaking content moderation, have a fast-track appeals process for journalists’ removed content, and will be held to account by Ofcom for the arbitrary removal of journalistic content,&#8221; DCMS notes.)</p>
<p>However the government also specifies that &#8220;citizen journalists’ content will have the same protections as professional journalists’ content&#8221; &#8212; so exactly where (or how) the line gets drawn between &#8220;recognized&#8221; news publishers (out of scope), citizen journalists (also out of scope), and just any old person blogging or posting stuff on the Internet (in scope&#8230; maybe?) is going to make for compelling viewing.</p>
<p>Carve outs to protect political speech also complicate the content moderation picture for digital services &#8212; given, for example, how extremist groups that hold racist opinions can seek to launder their hate speech and abuse as &#8216;political opinion&#8217;. (Some notoriously racist activists also like to claim to be &#8216;journalists&#8217;&#8230;)</p>
<p>DCMS writes that companies will be &#8220;forbidden from discriminating against particular political viewpoints and will need to apply protections equally to a range of political opinions, no matter their affiliation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Policies to protect such content will need to be set out in clear and accessible terms and conditions and firms will need to stick to them or face enforcement action from Ofcom,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;When moderating content, companies will need to take into account the political context around why the content is being shared and give it a high level of protection if it is democratically important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Platforms will face responsibility for balancing all these conflicting requirements &#8212; drawing on Codes of Practice on content moderation that respects freedom of expression which will be set out by Ofcom &#8212; but also under threat of major penalties being slapped on them by Ofcom if they get it wrong.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the government appears to be looking favorably on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebooks-hand-picked-oversight-panel-upholds-trump-ban-for-now/">Facebook-devised &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; model</a>, where a panel of humans sit in judgement on &#8216;complex&#8217; content moderation cases &#8212; and also discouraging too much use of AI filters which it warns risk missing speech nuance and over-removing content. (Especially interesting given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/uk-outs-extremism-blocking-tool-and-could-force-tech-firms-to-use-it/">UK government&#8217;s prior pressure on platforms to adopt AI tools</a> to speed up terrorism content takedowns.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bill will ensure people in the UK can express themselves freely online and participate in pluralistic and robust debate,&#8221; writes DCMS. &#8220;All in-scope companies will need to consider and put in place safeguards for freedom of expression when fulfilling their duties. These safeguards will be set out by Ofcom in codes of practice but, for example, might include having human moderators take decisions in complex cases where context is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People using their services will need to have access to effective routes of appeal for content removed without good reason and companies must reinstate that content if it has been removed unfairly. Users will also be able to appeal to Ofcom and these complaints will form an essential part of Ofcom’s horizon-scanning, research and enforcement activity,&#8221; it goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Category 1 services [the largest, most popular services] will have additional duties. They will need to conduct and publish up-to-date assessments of their impact on freedom of expression and demonstrate they have taken steps to mitigate any adverse effects. These measures remove the risk that online companies adopt restrictive measures or over-remove content in their efforts to meet their new online safety duties. An example of this could be AI moderation technologies falsely flagging innocuous content as harmful, such as satire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another confusing-looking component of the plan is that while the bill includes measures to tackle what it calls &#8220;user-generated fraud&#8221; &#8212; such as posts on social media for fake investment opportunities or romance scams on dating apps &#8212; fraud that&#8217;s conducted online via advertising, emails or cloned websites will not be in scope, per DCMS, as it says &#8220;the Bill focuses on harm committed through user-generated content&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet since Internet users can easily and cheaply create and run online ads &#8212; as platforms like Facebook essentially offer their ad targeting tools to anyone who&#8217;s willing to pay &#8212; then why carve out fraud by ads as exempt?</p>
<p>It seems a meaningless place to draw the line. Fraud where someone paid a few dollars to amplify their scam doesn&#8217;t seem a less harmful class of fraud than a free Facebook post linking to the self-same crypto investment scam.</p>
<p>In short, there&#8217;s a risk of arbitrary/ill-thought through distinctions creating incoherent and confusing rules that are prone to loopholes. Which doesn&#8217;t sound good for anyone&#8217;s online safety.</p>
<p>In parallel, meanwhile, the government is devising an ambitious <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition ex ante regime to regulate tech giants</a> specifically. Ensuring coherence and avoiding conflicting or overlapping requirements between that framework for platform giants and these wider digital harms rules is a further challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With so much focus on the &#8216;creator economy&#8217;, and countries hit by the effects of the pandemic, the self-employed market is ‘booming’, for good or for ill. So it’s not too much of a surprise that<br />
<a href="http://Collective.com">Collective</a>,a subscription-based back-office for the self-employed has raised a $20 million Series A funding after launching only late last year.</p>
<p>The round was led by General Catalyst and joined by Sound Ventures (the venture capital fund founded by Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary). Collective has now raised a total of $28.65 million. Other notable investors include:  Steve Chen (Founder YouTube), Hamish McKenzie (Founder Substack),  Aaron Levie (founder Box), Kevin Lin (founder Twitch), Sam Yam (founder Patreon), Li Jin (Atelier Ventures), Shadiah Sigala (founder HoneyBook), Adrian Aoun (founder Forward), Holly Liu (founder Kabam), Andrew Dudum (founder Hims) and Edward Hartman (founder LegalZoom).</p>
<p>Ashton Kutcher said in a statement: &#8220;We&#8217;re proud to be supporting a company that&#8217;s making it easier for creators to focus on what they do best by taking care of the back office work that creates so much friction for so many early entrepreneurs. I would have loved something like this when I was getting started.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in September 2020 by CEO Hooman Radfar, CPO Ugur Kaner and CTO Bugra Akcay, Collective offers “tailored&#8221; financial services, access to advisors that oversee accounting, tax, bookkeeping, and business formation needs. There are currently 59 million self-employed workers in the U.S. (36% of US workforce) who mostly do all their own admin. So Collective hopes to be their online back office platform.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over email, Radfar said that the start-up fintech market tends to serve companies like them &#8211; other start-ups and growing SMBs: &#8220;Companies like Pilot have done an amazing job at building a back-office platform that handles taxes, bookkeeping and finances for start-ups. We want to offer that same great value to the underserved business-of-one community, since they are the largest group of founders in the country.”</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Before Collective, consultants, freelancers, and other solo founders had to string together their back-office solution using DIY platforms like Quickbooks, Gusto, and LegalZoom. If they were lucky, they had the help of a part-time accountant to advise them. Collective makes handling finances easy with the first all-in-one platform that not only bundles these tools into one platform, but also provides the technology and team to optimize their tax savings like the pros.”</p>
<p>According to some estimates, the number of lone freelancers in the US is projected to make up 86.5 million, 50% of the US workforce by 2027, with the freelancer space projected to grow three times faster than the traditional workforce.</p>
<p>Niko Bonatsos, Managing Director of General Catalyst said: &#8220;Collective is serving the $1.2 trillion business-of-one industry by building the first back-office platform that saves individuals significant time and money, while providing them with the appropriate tools and resources they need to help them succeed,” said  “We’re excited to support Collective as they expand their team and build an exceptional service for the business-of-one community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon this morning announced a handful of updates across its Echo Show line of smart screens. The top-level most interesting bit here is the addition of a pan and zoom camera to the mid-tier Echo Show. The feature is similar to ones found on Facebook’s various Portal devices and Google’s high-end Nest Hub Max.</p>
<p>Essentially, it’s designed to keep the subject in frame – Apple also recently introduced the similar Center Stage features for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-ipad-pro-features-apples-m1-chip/">the latest iPad Pro</a>. It comes after Amazon introduced a far less subtle version in the Echo Show 10, which actually follows the subject around by swiveling the display around the base. I know I’m not alone in being a little creeped out, seeing it in action.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWL2XazFn74?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new feature arrives on the Show 8’s 13-megapixel camera, which is coupled with a built-in physical shutter – a mainstay as Amazon is look to stay ahead of the privacy conversations. The eight-inch HD display is powered by an upgrade octa-core processors and coupled with stereo speakers. The new Show 8 runs $130.</p>

<p>The other biggest news here is the arrival of the Echo Show 5 Kids – the one really new product in the bunch. At $95, the kid-focused version of the screen features a customizable home screen, colorful design, a two-year warranty in case of creaks and a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+.</p>
<p>There’s a new version of the regular Show 5, too, featuring an upgraded HD camera, new colors and additional software features. That runs $85. The new devices go up for preorder today and start shipping later this month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Low code and no code tools abound these days, as the industry attempts to give non-technical end users the ability to create applications without code (or very little anyway). <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> has been a big proponent of this approach to help reduce the complexity of working on its platform, and today the CRM giant announced a new wrinkle: drag and drop interactive components.</p>
<p>These new components allow users to create more sophisticated kinds of interactions, says Ryan Ellis, SVP for product management and platform at Salesforce. &#8220;We&#8217;re introducing this new feature called Dynamic Interactions and prior to their existence you had to have developers if you wanted to be able to build essentially truly interactive applications,&#8221; Ellis said.</p>
<p>What he means by this is if you have an application made up of multiple components such as a list of companies, a map and information about the company. You can click a company name and its location instantly appears on the map, and information about the company appears alongside it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salesforce will be providing about 150 such interactions like maps, lists, Einstein next best action and so forth. Developers can also create these for users as reusable building blocks that make sense to your organization or make them available in the AppExchange for others to use. Finally, you might have a systems integrator or consultant help build them for you.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As low-code startups continue to attract VC interest, what&#8217;s driving customer demand?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/as-low-code-startups-continue-to-attract-vc-interest-whats-driving-customer-demand/embed/#?secret=eYGRNMnnwj" data-secret="eYGRNMnnwj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;With dynamic interactions, we&#8217;re really dramatically simplifying the process of building apps with components that communicate with each other, pass data back and forth and react to user actions. It&#8217;s an entirely no code tool so that developers write the code once for their component, and then that component can be reused by people who don&#8217;t have technical skills by dragging and dropping them onto the page, then configuring what should happen when a user takes an action,&#8221; Ellis explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150951" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150951" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ListOfEvents.png?w=680" alt="An example of dynamic interactions from Salesforce.

<p>He says that this is part of a larger trend of digital transformation happening across the industry, one that was accelerated by the pandemic, something we hear frequently from tech companies like Salesforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s really this big push to go digital faster than ever before, and this was happening for years as we were seeing businesses having to pivot much more rapidly as new business models were coming about. [&#8230;] But then in this last year COVID really changed the game, and people just had to put on full gas in terms of actually being able to deliver those digital transformations in some instances overnight,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When you combine that with a shortage of developers, it makes sense that Salesforce and many other companies in the industry are developing these low-code tools that allow non-technical business users to build some applications themselves, while freeing developers to concentrate on more sophisticated organizational requirements.</p>
<p>Dynamic Interactions will be available starting today from Salesforce in beta. The product is expected be generally available around Dreamforce in the fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a great idea for an app or game is one thing, but scaling it to become a successful business is quite another. A new fintech startup called <a href="https://www.sanlo.io/">Sanlo</a> aims to help. The company, which is today announcing an oversubscribed $3.5 million seed round, offers small to medium-sized game and app companies access to tools to manage their finances and capital to fuel their growth.</p>
<p>To be clear, Sanlo is not an investor that&#8217;s taking an equity stake in the apps and games it finances. Instead, it&#8217;s offering businesses access to technology, tools, and insights that will allow them to achieve smart and scalable growth while remaining financially healthy &#8212; even if they&#8217;re a smaller company without time to sit down and structure their finances. Then, when Sanlo&#8217;s proprietary algorithms determine the business could benefit from the smart deployment of capital, it will assist by offering financing.</p>
<p>The idea for Sanlo hails from co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olya-caliujnaia-sivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/olya-caliujnaia-sivers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620514946351000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGV1tDOCtxejiZBstX8skq_bCDkDA">Olya Caliujnaia</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/biwwywiu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/biwwywiu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620514946351000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRj4enFK40lV7JGImaLPkeq4kNEg">William Liu</a>, who both have backgrounds in fintech and gaming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Caliujnaia began her career in venture capital in one of the first mobile-focused funds, before moving to operator roles in gaming, stock photography, and fintech, at EA, Getty Images, and SigFig, respectively. She later joined early-stage fintech and enterprise fund XYZ.vc as an Entrepreneur in Residence.</p>
<p>Liu, meanwhile, had also worked in gaming at EA, but later switched to fintech, working at startups like Earnest and Branch.</p>
<p>After reconnecting in San Francisco, the co-founders realized they could put their combined experience to work in order to help smaller businesses just starting out recognize when it&#8217;s time to scale, what areas of the business to invest in, and how much capital they need to grow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg 3698w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Copy-of-SL_2a.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150627" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sanlo&#8217;s Olya Caliujnaia and William Liu</p></div></p>
<p>Caliujnaia has seen how the app and gaming market has evolved over the years, and she realized the difficulties new developers now face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have this explosion of the app economy that&#8217;s growing insanely,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That&#8217;s the exciting part of it. That creativity. That passion and that desire to build &#8212; that&#8217;s so admirable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, companies benefit from having access to better development tools, broader access to talent, consumer demand, and other forces, she notes, compared with those in the past. But on the flip side, it&#8217;s become incredibly difficult to scale a consumer app or game.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of that comes down to, one, that there are dynamics around the free-to-play model &#8212; how you monetize and therefore, what kind of players and users you bring on board,&#8221; Caliujnaia says. &#8220;And then the second aspect is that it&#8217;s just harder to get noticed. So, ultimately, it comes down to marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the decisions that a company has to make on this front are predictable, however. That means Sanlo doesn&#8217;t have to sit down with businesses and consult with them one-on-one, the way a financial advisor working in wealth management would do with their clients.</p>
<p>Instead, Sanlo asks companies for certain types of data to get started. This includes product data about how well the app or game monetizes and customer acquisition and retention, for example, as well as marketing data and a subset of financial data. Its predictive algorithms then continually monitor the company&#8217;s growth trajectory to surface insights to identify where and how the business can grow.</p>
<p>This concept alone could have worked as a services business for mobile studios, but Sanlo takes the next step beyond advice to actually provide companies with access to capital. The amount of financing provided will vary based on the life stage of the company and risk profile, but it&#8217;s non-dilutive capital. That is, Sanlo takes no ownership stake in the companies it finances.</p>

<p>Caliujnaia said it made more sense to go this route rather than return to the VC world, because of potential to reach a wider group.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this long tail of developers and it&#8217;s more about enabling them, rather than producing more hits,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s very different mindsets, different markets that we&#8217;re going for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanlo doesn&#8217;t have a lot of direct competitors beyond perhaps, Silicon Valley Bank and other financial lenders, as well as mobile gaming publishers. But the publisher model often implies some sort of ownership, which is a significant differentiating factor. In some cases, you may see a larger gaming company extending debt financing to a smaller one. That was the case with Finnish mobile games company Metacore which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/supercell-likes-metacores-games-so-much-it-just-gave-it-another-180m-credit-line/">recently raised another debt round</a> from gaming giant Supercell, for example.</p>
<p>Caliujnaia points out that most smaller companies don&#8217;t have that kind of access to financing. Now they could, through Sanlo.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to have a healthier layer of companies that are able to survive for the long-term,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>That means more companies that won&#8217;t have to stress about their futures, leading to them to aggressively monetize their users, and later, scrambling for an exit when their financial runway comes to an end.</p>
<p>Sanlo is currently pilot testing its system with a small group of mobile game studios who will serve as its initial customer base, but plans to later support consumer apps, which have similar struggles with customer acquisition costs and growth.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-headquartered startup itself was founded in 2020 and began raising money. It has now raised a total of $3.5 million in seed funding co-led by Index Ventures and Initial Capital, with participation from LVP, Portag3 Ventures, and  XYZ Venture Capital. Angel investors include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/segerstrale/">Kristian Segestrale</a> (Super Evil Megacorp CEO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokulrajaram1/">Gokul Rajaram</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleyma/">Charley Ma. </a></p>
<p>Initial Capital co-founder and partner Ken Lamb became a board director with the fundraise, while Index partner Mark Goldberg and XYZ managing partner Ross Fubini joined as board observers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sanlo cracked the code to help mobile gaming and app companies reach maturity with a new level of speed, scale, and fiscal wellbeing,&#8221; said Goldberg, in a statement. &#8220;The company is building a very sophisticated fintech offering that will give those companies superpowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanlo plans to use the funds to grow its team and product suite ahead of its public launch later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amplitude, the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/21/2037017/0/en/Amplitude-Raises-50M-Round-Led-by-GIC-to-Meet-Surging-Demand.html">well-funded</a> product intelligence startup that helps businesses use their data to predict which features will drive the best business outcomes for them, today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://iterative.ly/">Iteratively</a>, a startup that helps businesses build trustworthy data pipelines.</p>
<p>Since data is at the core of Amplitude&#8217;s services, this acquisition will help the company bolster its data management capabilities that power many of its features, including its recently launched <a href="https://amplitude.com/amplitude-recommend">personalized recommendation engine</a>.</p>
<p>This marks Amplitude&#8217;s second acquisition, after <a href="https://amplitude.com/press/amplitude-acquires-clearbrain">buying ClearBrain</a> last March. With a total of $186.9 million in funding and a unicorn valuation, we may just see it do more of these in the no-so-far future. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2150827" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150827" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IterativelyBlogHeader.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150827" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amplitude</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the big story for us is to be able to expand beyond product analytics to really help companies one, measure user behavior, two, predict which features and actions lead to business outcomes, and then use that to intelligently adapt each experience based on those insights,&#8221; Amplitude EVP of Product Justin Bauer told me. &#8220;For us, that&#8217;s really the broader problem that we&#8217;re focused on and why we think digital optimization is really critical.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Bauer noted, the Amplitude Behavioral Graph that powers these optimization services is only as effective as the data that is fed into it &#8212; and that&#8217;s why buying Iteratively made a lot of sense at this point.</p>
<p>Bauer and Iteratively CEO Patrick Thompson tell me that the two companies started talking in earnest around the end of last year after hearing more about Iteratively from Amplitude&#8217;s customers. &#8220;As we spoke to our customers, we consistently heard from them the importance of proactively and continuously increasing the quality of data,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And many of them told us how excited they were about Iteratively to help them solve that. As we dug in more, we found out that 70% of their customers are Amplitude customers. That gave us a lot of conviction to explore the acquisition.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150845" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150845" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150845" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png?resize=1536,654 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-5.43.46-PM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150845" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amplitude</p></div></p>
<p>The two companies also had compatible cultures and Bauer tells me that the executive team at Amplitude was impressed by Iteratively&#8217;s founding team, which, like virtually everybody else at Iteratively, will move to Amplitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest thing for us is we saw the excitement from many of our existing customers who were using Amplitude and how that helped change the way that they built product and delivered customer value,&#8221; Iteratively&#8217;s Thompson said. &#8220;From the early days, we were really big fans of what Amplitude was building and saw the impact that it was having on the industry. For us, when we thought about folks who fit our cultural values, where we could see ourselves as well as the rest of the team working, I don&#8217;t think there was another company at the top of the list beyond Amplitude who fit all those criteria. And generally, as we&#8217;ve been having conversations with these folks internally, it just made sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iteratively will continue to exist as a stand-alone product and will continue to support a wide range of customers, including those who don&#8217;t use other Amplitude services. Bauer and Thompson stressed that this was important to both teams, in part because the data governance and quality problem expands well beyond the Amplitude audience. As such, a stand-alone product like Iteratively will also likely help Amplitude bring in new customers. But at the same time, the teams have already integrated some of Iteratively&#8217;s technology into Amplitude&#8217;s stack and specifically the existing <a href="https://amplitude.com/govern">Amplitude Govern</a> service that helps businesses oversee their data pipelines.</p>
<p>This new integration is now available to Amplitude customers through an early access program, with wider availability planned for later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://divibank.co/pt/">Divibank</a>, a financing platform offering LatAm businesses access to growth capital, has closed on a $3.6 million round of seed funding led by San Francisco-based Better Tomorrow Ventures (BTV).</p>
<p dir="ltr">São Paulo-based Divibank was founded in March 2020, right as the COVID-pandemic was starting. The company has built a data-driven financing platform aimed at giving businesses access to non-dilutive capital to finance their growth via revenue-share financing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are changing the way entrepreneurs scale their online businesses by providing quick and affordable capital to startups and SMEs in Latin America,” said co-founder and CEO Jaime Taboada. In particular, Divibank is targeting e-commerce and SaaS companies although it also counts edtechs, fintechs and marketplaces among its clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The company is now also offering marketing analytics software for its clients so they can “get more value out of the capital they receive.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A slew of other investors participated in the round, including existing backer MAYA Capital and new investors such as Village Global, Clocktower Ventures, Magma Partners, Gilgamesh Ventures, Rally Cap Ventures and Alumni Ventures Group. A group of high-profile angel investors also put money in the round, including Rappi founder and president Sebastian Mejia, Tayo Oviosu (founder/CEO of Paga, who participated via Kairos Angels), Ramp founder and CTO Karim Atiyeh and Bread founders Josh Abramowitz and Daniel Simon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In just over a year’s time, Divibank has seen some impressive growth (albeit from a small base). In the past six months alone, the company said it has signed on over 50 new clients; seen its total loan issuance volume increase by 7x; revenues climb by 5x; customer base increase by 11x and employee base by 4x. Customers include Dr. Jones, CapaCard and Foodz, among others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Traditional banks and financial institutions do not know how to evaluate internet businesses, so they generally do not offer loans to these companies. If they do, it is generally a long and tedious process at a very high cost,” Taboada said. “With our revenue-share offering, the entrepreneur does not have to pledge his home, drown in credit card debts or even give up his equity to invest in marketing and growth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For now, Divibank is focused on Brazil, considering the country is huge and has more than 11 million SMEs “with many growth opportunities to explore,” according to Taboada. It’s looking to expand to the rest of LatAm and other emerging markets in the future, but no timeline has yet been set.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As in many other sectors, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a tailwind to Divibank&#8217;s business, considering it accelerated the digitalization of everything globally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We founded <span class="il">Divibank</span> the same week as the lockdown started in Brazil, and we saw many industries that didn&#8217;t traditionally advertise online migrate to Google and Facebook Ads rapidly,&#8221; Taboada told TechCrunch. &#8220;This obviously helped our thesis a lot, as many of our clients had actually recently went from only selling offline to selling mostly online. And there’s no better way to attract new clients online than with digital ads.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Divibank will use its new capital to accelerate its product roadmap, scale its go-to-market strategy and ramp up hiring. Specifically, it will invest more aggressively in engineering/tech, sales, marketing, credit risk and operations. Today the team consists of eight employees in Brazil, and that number will likely grow to more than 25 or 30 in the coming 12 months, according to Taboada.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup is also developing what it describes as “value additive” software, aimed at helping clients better manage their digital ads campaigns and “optimize their investment returns.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Divibank is working on a few additional financial products for its clients, targeting the more than $205 billion e-commerce and SaaS markets in Latin America with offerings such as inventory financing and recurring revenue securitizations. Specifically, it plans to continue developing its banking tech platform by “automating the whole credit process,” developing its analytics platform and building its data science/ML capabilities to improve its credit model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jake Gibson, general partner at Better Tomorrow Ventures, noted that his firm is also an investor in Clearbanc, which also provided non-dilutive financing for founders. The company&#8217;s &#8220;20-minute term sheet&#8221; product, perhaps its most well-known in tech, allowed e-commerce companies to raise non-dilutive marketing growth capital between $10,000 to $10 million based on its revenue and ad spend.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We are very bullish on the idea that not every company should be funded with venture dollars, and that lack of funding options can keep too many would-be entrepreneurs out of the market,” he said. “Combine that with the growth of e-commerce in Brazil and LatAm, and expected acceleration fueled by COVID, and the opportunity to build something meaningful seemed obvious.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, since there aren’t a lot of similar offerings in the region, Better Tomorrow views the space that Divibank is addressing as a “massive untapped market.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Besides Clearbanc, Divibank is also similar to another U.S.-based fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/pipe-which-aims-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue-raises-more-money-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe</a>, in that both companies aim to help clients with SaaS, subscription and other recurring revenue models with new types of financings that can help them grow without dilution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Like the e-commerce market, we see the SaaS, and the recurring revenues markets in general, growing rapidly,&#8221; Taboada said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime</a>, a banking-as-a-service startup that delivers its product via APIs, announced that it has closed a $20 million Series B. The capital comes around a year since the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/treasury-prime-raises-9m-to-bring-its-banking-apis-to-market/">announced its Series A</a>, and around 1.5 years since it raised its preceding round.</p>
<p>For Treasury Prime, the new capital was an internal affair, with prior investors stepping up to lead its new round of funding. <a href="https://deciens.com/">Deciens Capital</a> and <a href="https://qedinvestors.com/">QED Investors</a> co-led the round, with <a href="https://susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a> and <a href="https://coda.io/@jasonmlemkin/saastrfund/">SaaStr Fund</a> also putting cash into the transaction.</p>
<p>As is increasingly common among insider-led fundraises in recent years, the startup in question was not in dire need of new funding before the new investment came together. In fact, Treasury Prime CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/ctdean?lang=en">Chris Dean</a> told TechCrunch that his firm is &#8220;super capital efficient&#8221; in an interview, adding that it had not tucked into its Series A capital until January of this year.</p>
<p>So, why raise more funds now? To invest aggressively in its business. That plan is cliche for a startup raising new funding, but in the case of Treasury Prime the move isn&#8217;t in anticipation of future demand. Dean told TechCrunch that his startups had run into a bottleneck in which it could only take on so much new customer volume. That&#8217;s no good for a startup in a competitive sector, so picking up its spend in early 2021 and raising new capital in mid-2021 makes sense as it could help it hire, and absorb more demand, more quickly.</p>
<p>And for Treasury Prime&#8217;s preceding backers, the chance to put more capital into a startup that was dealing with more demand than capacity likely wasn&#8217;t too hard a choice.  Dean added that to make sure the round&#8217;s price was market-reasonable, he pitched around 10 venture capital firms, got three term sheets, and then went with his preceding investor group; if any VC reading this is irked by the move, this is the founder equivalent of private-market investors asking founders to come back to them after they find a lead.</p>
<p>But with the banking-as-a-service market growing, thanks to entrants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">Stripe showing up in recent quarters</a>, how does Treasury Prime expect to stay towards the front of its fintech niche? Per Dean, by bringing together banks that want fintech deal volume, and fintechs who need both technology and eventual banking partners. By courting both sides of its market, Treasury Prime hopes to be well-situated for long-term growth.</p>
<p>And its CEO is bullish on the scale of his market.</p>
<p>If you imagine the banking-as-a-service market as merely neobanks, he explained, it&#8217;s not that big. But his startup expects the number of companies that want to offer their customers the sort banking capabilities that Treasury Prime and some competitors can offer will be broad. How broad? The best way I can summarize the company&#8217;s argument is that, a bit like how vertical SaaS has proven that building software for particular industries can be big business, Treasury Prime expects that banking tools will also be built for similar business categories. Vertical banking, perhaps, integrated into other services.</p>
<p>And it wants to be there, offering the back-end tech, and access to banks that the companies building those services will need.</p>
<p>Fintech is a big and expensive market, and Treasury Prime isn&#8217;t busy raising nine-figure rounds &#8212; yet, at least. According to <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> data, Treasury Prime was valued at just over $40 million at the time of its Series A; the company&#8217;s new valuation was presumably higher, though how much is not yet clear.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with $20 million more as it sheds some of its frugal DNA and looks to burn a little faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As private companies like Axiom Space, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX prepare to ferry private customers to the stars, a whole new market is opening up to train affluent would-be travelers for their future missions. Case in point: space training company Orbite, whose goal is to combine aeronautics and five-star hospitality in its inaugural astronaut training program.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re going to have hundreds, if not thousands of people this decade of the 2020s, who will go to space, but you just don&#8217;t get off the couch and strap into a rocket […] you actually have to get mentally prepared, physically prepared, and also spiritually prepared for this out of out of this world journey,” co-founder Jason Andrews told TechCrunch. “And that&#8217;s really our role.”</p>
<p><a href="https://orbitespace.com/">Orbite</a> (the French word for ‘orbit,’ pronounced <em>or-beet</em>) was founded by space and hospitality industry veterans Andrews and Nicolas Gaume. Andrews is an aerospace entrepreneur that founded Spaceflight and BlackSky, while Gaume, a software and game development entrepreneur, sits on the board of his family’s resort and hotel business Groupe Gaume. Last year, Gaume’s business Space Cargo Unlimited <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/">shipped a dozen bottles of wine</a> to the International Space Station. They were later retrieved. (When asked how the wine tasted, Gaume told TechCrunch, “It’s a unique product.”)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The program will be led by Brienna Rommes, who previously worked as the director of space training and research at the National Aerospace Training and Research Center. Rommes has trained over 600 people to prepare for spaceflight, including Sir Richard Branson, Orbite said.</p>
<p>Led by Rommes, the program aim to prepare travelers that are determined to reach space, but Andrews also said Orbite can help customers “try before they buy” – give people a taste of spaceflight for those who are unsure whether they’d actually want to board a launch vehicle. This seems to be their main value proposition, by providing a general overview to space travel across different companies, because they&#8217;ll also be competing to a degree with the native (and mandatory) training programs of individual private launch companies that are purpose-built to prepare customers for their flight.</p>

<p>Costs remain prohibitively high for the average spacefarer: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">it’s been reported that</a> a ticket on Axiom’s inaugural commercial launch to the International Space Station costs upwards of $55 million. Orbite’s premium training program comes in at $29,500 per person for the three-day, four-night stay.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement on the premium price tag, the four training program sessions scheduled through the remainder of 2021 will be held at luxury resorts: the Four Seasons Resort in Orlando, Florida, and Hôtel La Co(o)rniche in Pyla-sur-Mer, France. The latter hotel is owned by Groupe Gaume.</p>
<p>Would-be space travelers will be able to experience up to 5 Gs by taking a ride on a high-performance aircraft as well as simulated zero-gravity. To prepare customers mentally and even spiritually, the training program itinerary includes meditation training, a workshop on stress and anxiety management, and individual coaching with staff “to explore personal goals for space, thoughts and asses possible flight options,” the company said. The itinerary also includes virtual reality mission experiences and a ‘Michelin star’ space food tasting.</p>
<p>“We really want to make sure we bridge the gap with more of a sensorial, psychological, even spiritual preparation for the trip,” Gaume said.</p>
<p>The company’s long-term vision is building and operating many training facilities around the world. The first facility will open in 2023 or 2024, though Andrews and Gaume are not yet sharing where it will be located. They did say that the dedicated training facility will offer a range of packages, with some as short as single-day experiences. They will also offer accommodation and hospitality, potentially for the long term – weeks or even months, depending on if we reach a stage in human space travel where we’re sending private citizens to the Moon or even Mars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Job-hunting for those close to leaving or just out of college is a different ballgame these days than it used to be. Gone (at least for now) are the open job fairs and so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk rounds</a> where prospective employers go <em>en masse</em> to tap student bodies for potential new entrant hires. In their place, virtual fairs run by startups like <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Handshake</a>. Today, the company, which has built a platform for professional networking and graduate recruitment aimed at the wider and diverse breadth of college students, is announcing a hefty round of funding &#8212; a sign of how it has capitalized on the new landscape and found a healthy place for itself within it.</p>
<p>The startup has closed in on $80 million, a Series E that it has confirmed values Handshake at over $1.5 billion. Lightspeed Venture Partners and Spark Capital co-led this round, with first-time backers Coatue Management and Valiant Peregrine Fund also investing, alongside Handshake&#8217;s previous investors. (That list of previous backers is a pretty illustrious list: EQT, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Omidyar Network, Reach Capital, True, Kleiner Perkins, and GGV are among them.)</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Covid-19 has had a massive effect on our business,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Garrett Lord told me in an interview. Key to that has been a new video product that Handshake built, which powers its virtual career fairs and interviews between prospective recruits and organizations. &#8220;It&#8217;s all centered around video recruiting with more than 90% of our university partners using our video solution. That’s really important for them because they [recruiters and those working in career services at the schools] are all under a lot of pressure to show results. They moved to our virtual products because they could facilitate those connections.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The valuation is a big hike compared to its previous round (also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/handshake-raises-80m-more-to-build-a-more-diversity-focused-linkedin-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million</a>, as recently as last October), and comes as the company is recording a lot of momentum in the market.</p>
<p>It has been doubling revenue every year for the last three, and is now on track for $100 million in annual recurring revenue. The platform now has 18 million students and young alumni hailing from 1,200 educational institutions including four-year colleges &#8212; with the recent additions of the wider extent of higher learning, in the form of community colleges and boot camps, now also bolstering those ranks. It said that a full 49% of U.S. college graduates from 2018-2020 received job offers via Handshake.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the third part of Handshake&#8217;s marketplace alongside students and their colleges &#8212; the organizations doing the recruiting &#8212; is also really digging in. It now has 550,000 companies on its rolls using Handshake to connect with individuals. That includes no less than 100% of the Fortune 500. And it notes that with companies getting more serious about diversity and inclusion, the companies&#8217; engagement on Handshake is only growing. The startup said that 98 million virtual student-employer connections were enabled on its platform last year.</p>
<p>When I previously covered Handshake (see stories <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/31/handshake-a-linkedin-for-university-students-and-diversity-raises-40m-on-a-275m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/handshake-raises-80m-more-to-build-a-more-diversity-focused-linkedin-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), what really stood out to me about the company was how it was building and gaining traction addressing a very significant and often-ignored parts of the workforce, groups traditionally underrepresented in hiring in graduate roles.</p>
<p>Hires for these roles traditionally skew towards white males, and for the most competitive jobs, towards a select coterie of institutions. The mission of Handshake &#8212; founded by Garrett Lord (CEO), Scott Ringwelski (CTO) and Ben Christensen (a board member), three friends who hailed from a technical university in Michigan &#8212; was to break those models and barriers by creating a network that catered to a much wider range of historically Black colleges, and simply a wider range of institutions to improve the ratios.</p>
<p>In doing so, Handshake has carved out a place for itself as a kind of complement, or even competitor, to LinkedIn in this area. (It&#8217;s a complement if you think LinkedIn has squared away its ambitions for building professional networking and social-network-based recruitment for the rest of the wider working world; competitor if you think that LinkedIn has a viable chance of working out how to do this specifically for younger users earlier on in their careers, and those from historically underrepresented groups &#8212; both of which it&#8217;s never done outstandingly well.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that while there have been a lot of worries over how the graduate job market and students would fare in a Covid-19 landscape, Handshake has found a way ahead to match our current times. Specifically, it&#8217;s doubled down on virtual recruiting fairs and other ways of facilitating connections and conversations between its users and the organizations that want to hire them.</p>
<p>This funding, Lord tells me, will be used to continue developing the company&#8217;s technology and tools that it provides to its users. Interestingly, the company does not believe that its development is best-served by trying to mimic a LinkedIn experience, however: no plans for online education or professional development, or sharing content and news related to your professional life, but more work on improving recommendations and perhaps extending out the number of years where a user might find Handshake useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know where users went to school, and what they were looking for in a job,&#8221; Lord said. &#8220;What makes us different is that everyone is searching at the same time and that means a ton of information we can work with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors are happy with the focus and how Handshake plans to develop it.</p>
<p>“Since leading Handshake’s Series B in 2016, we’ve been thrilled to watch the company become the clear number one way for students to find internships and jobs, and there is still so much opportunity ahead,” said Will Reed, general partner at Spark Capital, in a statement. “Doubling down on our investment five years later underscores our belief that Handshake will not only help students build the skills and relationships they need to get their first job, but also expand into the $100 billion+ market of helping professionals advance their careers with second, third, and fourth jobs over time.”</p>

For many of us, our lives and lifestyles have changed massively in the last year, and alongside that, we&#8217;re collectively facing pandemic-fueled mortality on a global scale in a way that hasn&#8217;t existed for generations, a perfect storm of sorts that has inevitably had an impact on our state of mind and our moods.</p>
<p>Today a startup that has built a platform to help people think about and respond to this situation is announcing a big round of growth funding, specifically to help address all of this and how it plays out in one of the more stress-inducing aspects of our life &#8212; our workplaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://unmind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unmind</a> &#8212; a London startup that has built a mental health platform for the workplace &#8212; has raised $47 million, a Series B that it will be using to continue investing in its research and development and also to expand its business reach. The funding is being led by EQT Ventures –- a very <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active investor at the moment in UK growth rounds</a> &#8212; with participation also from Sapphire Ventures and previous backers Project A, Felix Capital, and True.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The core of Unmind&#8217;s service is built around a set of questions to help employees explore their own states of mental health, which could include depression, anxiety, insomnia, and a host of other manifestations. Complementing reactive services like EAPs or teletherapy, it then provides access to proactive, self-guided tools to measure, understand, and nurture their mental wellbeing. It also provides a service to the employers, sharing anonymized data from the app with them so that they, too, can consider how better to respond to their employees&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>The app has seen some notable traction especially in the last year, a time when the conversation about mental health has become much more commonplace and critical, given the environment we&#8217;ve been living in.</p>
<p>Unmind says its services are available to more than 2 million employees in 110 countries, and while it not disclose active user numbers, nor how they have grown, it tells me that uptake and adoption of its app ranges from 15% to over 60% of an organization&#8217;s workforce (this varies by size, and the emphasis that the organization itself puts on using the app, among other things). It also said that of those employees who are using Unmind, 88% have said they experience an improvement in mental wellbeing, work, or relationships, while 92% report higher confidence, awareness, and understanding of mental health.</p>
<p>The company also said that revenues grew by more than 3x in the last 12 months. Meanwhile, its customers include major retailers like John Lewis and M&amp;S, high street bank TSB, Uber, Samsung, Virgin Media, British Airways and Asos &#8212; a list of companies that have strong degrees of customer service around them, have been greatly impacted by the lockdowns, and you can imagine must have a lot of people working in them pretty stressed out as a result of being on the front lines of interfacing with a stressed-out wider population of consumers.</p>
<p>The company was co-founded by Dr Nick Taylor, who previously had been a clinical psychologist and worked for years in mental health care (and before that was a classically-trained singer), who said he came up with the idea after feeling like he was seeing too many people only for the first time at a stage when their issues were already very advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept encountering the same frustration time and again: I wish I’d met this person six months ago,&#8221; Taylor said in an interview.</p>
<p>As with all kinds of preventative healthcare, it&#8217;s always better to identify and work on issues before they grow big and more urgent, and so he set out to think about how one might approach the concept of a preventative check-up and check-in for mental health.</p>
<p>The workplace is not a bad place to base that effort. Not only is it often a source of stress for people, but it&#8217;s a regular place for them to be every day so creating a way of assessing mental health through that implicitly creates a kind of routine to the effort. It also potentially means a closer connection to the employer to work on issues more collectively when and if they emerge, in a way that the employer might not do (or ever discover) through other means.</p>
<p>The connection between work and mental health is a longstanding one but has perhaps been proven out more than ever before in the last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t know what would happen with mental health during Covid,&#8221; Taylor recalled. &#8220;I actually wondered if it would be demoted,&#8221; given all of the other conflicting priorities. &#8220;But the prevalence of mental illness has escalated. It&#8217;s out of control. And in the workplace, it&#8217;s a leading cause of absenteeism and turnover.&#8221; And given how full-on everything has become, including likely more hours spent working since now it all has merged with our home lives, we all know (and may well be among) many people who are feeling incredibly burned out right now.</p>
<p>Taylor said that in fact quite the opposite has happened to his early skepticism: mental health has become front of mind, &#8220;and the shackles of stigma are falling away.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is part of what has really caught the eye of investors: technology that is not just effective, but very relevant to right now. “It is now universally recognized that our Mental Health is as important if not more important than our physical health &#8211; but has long been neglected. That is now changing rapidly,&#8221; said Alastair Mitchell, a partner at EQT Ventures. &#8220;As a result there has been a massive rise in the popularity of consumer mental health apps which is now being matched by surging demand from employers and employees for the same in the workplace. Unmind is the leading mental health app for the enterprise and we are so excited to work with Dr Nick and the team to support their scaling globally.&#8221; EQT is also a strategic investor, not just a financial one: it&#8217;s rolling out Unmind across its own workplace and its many portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Unmind, it should be noted, is not the only company that has identified this &#8220;opportunity,&#8221; if you could call it that. They include other startups like SF-based <a href="https://www.ginger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ginger</a> &#8212; which has also built a platform that partners with employers, but also healthcare providers and other stakeholders, to help people identify and manage their state of mind. Ginger has been <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200806005244/en/Ginger-Announces-50-Million-in-Series-D-Funding-to-Expand-Access-to-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-On-Demand-Mental-Healthcare-System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-capitalised</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ginger-an-mit-spinout-providing-app-based-mental-health-coaching-to-workers-raises-35m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the years</a>. Others in the same space include Welbot in New York, Spill also out of London and a host of others providing different aspects of mental wellness like Calm and Headspace, the meditation apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to think that, given the size of the problem and that mental health should not be a bunfight but something that takes a village to address, the key will be in how each company approaches its remit, and how people respond to it, and whether what people do ultimately use results in better bridges for employees to getting the help and peace they need, whether it&#8217;s from a startup, an individual, or something else, or a combination of sources.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We have a responsibility to connect with our mental health in the same way that we do when it comes to healthcare,&#8221; Taylor said, likening the effort to how it takes a number of skill sets sometimes to work on the complexities of a health issue. &#8220;Great healthcare integrates across a number of systems.&#8221;</p>
