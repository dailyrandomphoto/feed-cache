										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.primary.vc/">Primary Venture Partners</a>, a firm focused exclusively on investing in New York-area startups, has raised $150 million in its third fund for seed investments (its largest so far), as well as $50 million for the Select fund it uses to participate in later-stage rounds.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s portfolio includes New York success stories like Jet.com (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/confirmed-walmart-buys-jet-com-for-3b-in-cash/">acquired by Walmart</a> for $3.3 bill million), Mirror (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">acquired by Lululemon</a> for $500 million) and Latch (which is planning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/">go public via SPAC</a>). And the firm has doubled down on its association with New York by publishing <a href="https://www.nycfounderguide.com">an NYC Founder Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the idea of limiting your investments to a specific geography might sound old-fashioned at a time when offices largely go unused, teams are increasingly distributed and some investors are loudly trumpeting new startup hubs. But General Partner Brad Svrluga (who founded the firm with General Partner Ben Sun) told me that the New York focus remains crucial for the firm — for example, in its work to help startups hire the best employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When you think about [our three-person talent team], their charge is to understand, track and be connected to the top 10% of all talent in New York City,&#8221; Svrluga said. &#8220;That’s a big, ambitious challenge, but it’s also one that we&#8217;ve got a really good shot at doing in a relatively confined geography. If we were trying to simultaneously recruit for companies in New York, Seattle, Boston, Austin, L.A., the Bay Area, etc., you just can’t do it — or you&#8217;d need an army.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while he said San Francisco and Silicon Valley remain &#8220;unquestionably the center of the universe that we operate in, the sun around which everything else evolves,&#8221; he suggested that New York has unique advantages: &#8220;Unlike the Bay Area, New York is powered by a whole collection of industries. That diversity makes the place radically more resilient.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sH4xXmrEhG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/9-top-vcs-discuss-the-future-of-new-york-startups/">11 top VCs discuss the future of New York startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;11 top VCs discuss the future of New York startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/9-top-vcs-discuss-the-future-of-new-york-startups/embed/#?secret=sH4xXmrEhG" data-secret="sH4xXmrEhG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean things won&#8217;t change as we emerge from the pandemic. For one thing, Svrluga anticipated that companies that are ostensibly New York based will be more distributed, with &#8220;a relatively lower percentage of their workforce in New York City proper,&#8221; and of that NYC workforce, &#8220;fewer of them in the office on any given day.&#8221; He&#8217;s also hopeful that startup real estate costs will &#8220;shrink materially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love it if you and your peers continue to trumpet the demise of New York, so other investors can stop paying attention and we can have a less competitive environment,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Another change — one that&#8217;s not limited to geography — is the growing size of seed rounds, which Svrluga said is one of the reasons for the larger fund. The seed, he suggested, has become &#8220;the first third of the A&#8221; round, but that doesn&#8217;t mean startups raising seed rounds need to be more further along.</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole bunch of what we do has always has been way pre-product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could be just a founder or just two three people &#8230;. some early code might be written but you&#8217;re months and months way from launch. They&#8217;re now capable raising $2.5, $3, $4 million right out of the gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the new funds, Primary is also announcing that it has appointed Rebecca Price as operating partner and promoted Jason Shuman to partner.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After making pre-seed investments for seven years, I have observed <a href="https://www.startuphacks.vc/blog/8-myths-of-the-pre-seed-venture-investing">how different the pre-seed stage is from Series A and later-stage investing</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I want to highlight four ideas that are true across different stages of investing.</p>
<h2>Venture outcomes are driven by a power law</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">Power law</a> is an immutable law of the universe. Examples include the distribution of population in cities, price of artwork, and unfortunately, wealth distribution. This law is also known as the Pareto principle, and colloquially known as the 80%-20% rule.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The average manager faces a very real possibility of making no money at all because of how steep the power law curve is.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Venture capital is no exception and the outcomes of every venture portfolio will likely follow a power law distribution. There are two significant things to think about here:</p>
<p>One: Because most startups fail, the distribution is going to have a lot of zeros (or near zeros) in the long tail. The zeros are going to be followed by singles and doubles.</p>
<p>Two: The biggest winners, when they happen, tend to be huge. Unicorns were hard to come by when<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/"> Aileen Lee</a> penned her now-famous article in 2013. Today, unicorns are no longer as rare and top-tier firms are constructing their portfolio with the goal of funding a decacorn — a company valued at $10 billion or higher.</p>
<p>There is nothing mysterious about the power law dynamic in venture. Just like the rich get richer, the biggest companies get bigger.</p>
<p>A startup that reaches $10 million in revenue is much more likely to double, double again and then cruise by $100 million in revenue versus a startup at the $1 million mark now trying to get to $10 million.</p>
<p>At scale, everything is different — the resources, the possibilities and access to capital. Of course, even companies that reach very substantial scale may run into obstacles and eventually underperform. But that is not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that the ones that do end up winning and driving all the returns keep doubling and continue getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Hence, the outcomes of the venture portfolio fit a power law curve.</p>
<p>The best managers in the business are distinguished by a few more at the very top of the curve.</p>
<p>The average manager faces a very real possibility of making no money at all because of how steep the power law curve is.</p>
<h2>Your fund size is your strategy</h2>
<p>There is a piece of feedback that fund of fund managers frequently give to GPs: Your fund size is your strategy.</p>
<p>What they are essentially saying is that a fund&#8217;s portfolio construction will depend on how much capital is under management, and vice versa. Why is that?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take two extreme examples — a manager of a $10 million fund and a manager of a $1 billion fund. Let&#8217;s assume that both managers want to lead rounds. If the first one decided to be a Series A fund, it would be <em>extremely</em> concentrated. It may be able to lead 1-2 rounds, but that&#8217;s it. Given the power law nature of outcomes, it would be extremely unlikely for this manager to generate a good return.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Additive manufacturing has been a popular buzz phrase for decades now. With a smattering of notable exceptions, however, 3D printing has largely been focused on rapid prototyping and limited-run, personal products. Metal 3D printing companies like Mantle represent an intriguing use case on the road to truly scaling the tech to mass manufacturing.</p>
<p>Arriving out of stealth today, the Bay Area-based company is not focused on replacing traditional manufacturing methods, as much as augmenting and improving them. Specifically, the startup is focusing its technology in helping creating better molds and dies for manufacturers.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a number of companies currently competing in the printable metal category. Notable names include Desktop Metal, ExOne and Markforged. Armed with $13 million in funding from Foundation Capital, Hypertherm Ventures, Future Shape, 11.2 capital, Plug and Play Ventures and Corazon Capital, Mantle seeks to differentiate itself with a machine capable of removing some steps from the process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The main difference, having interacted with 3D printing for close to three decades, is really around the focus on these use cases that are production oriented,” Foundational Capital General Partner Steve Vassallo tells TechCrunch. “The vast majority of 3D printing is to make a prototype as quickly as possible. To actually make something that can be used in production environments &#8212; real parts that you can use &#8212; has never been done before.”</p>
<p>Built on the familiar binder jetting, the company’s machine (roughly &#8220;The size of two standing desks&#8221; its says) builds part finishing into the process.</p>
<p>“Ours is the first sintering-based hybrid technology that does shape refinement prior to going into the furnace,” CEO Ted Sorom tells TechCrunch. “We do it with a unique material that’s designed not only to be deposited into a very dense body but to also be cut with high-speed cutting tools. That allows us to get a totally different level of surface detail than anyone’s able to get today.”</p>
<p>The company has thus far announced L&#8217;Oréal as its first partner. The cosmetics giant will be using Mantle’s printers to create precision molds for products and packaging.</p>
<p>Tony Fadell, of Future Shape Mantle, added in a comment offered to TechCunch, “Mantle gives you the superpowers to make Apple-quality mechanical parts in days not months and lowers your cost by orders of magnitude. That speed and affordability lets you iterate to get your parts to perfection and still lets you launch much earlier.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies spend a significant amount of money and resources processing data from logs, traces and metrics, forcing them to make trade-offs about how much to collect and store. <a href="https://www.hydrolix.io/">Hydrolix</a>, an early stage startup, announced a $10 million seed round today to help tackle logging at scale, while using unique technology to lower the cost of storing and querying this data.</p>
<p>Wing Venture Capital led the round with help from AV8 Ventures, Oregon Venture Fund and Silicon Valley Data Capital.</p>
<p>Company CEO and co-founder Marty Kagan noted that in his previous roles, he saw organizations with tons of data in logs, metrics and traces that could be valuable to various parts of the company, but most organizations couldn&#8217;t afford the high cost to maintain these records for very long due to the incredible volume of data involved. He started Hydrolix because he wanted to change the economics to make it easier to store and query this valuable data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The classic problem with these cluster-based databases is that they&#8217;ve got locally attached storage. So as the data set gets larger, you have no choice but to either spend a ton of money to grow your cluster or separate your hot and cold data to keep your costs under control,&#8221; Kagan told me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, he says that when it comes to querying, the solutions out there like BigQuery and Snowflake are not well suited for this kind of data. &#8220;They rely really heavily on caching and bulk column scans, so they&#8217;re not really useful for [&#8230;] these infrastructure plays where you want to do live stream ingest, and you want to be able to do ad hoc data exploration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hydrolix wanted to create a more cost-effective way of storing and querying log data, while solving these issues with other tooling. &#8220;So we built a new storage layer which delivers [&#8230;] SSD-like performance using nothing but cloud storage and diskless spot instances,&#8221; Kagan explained. He says that this means that there is no caching or column scales, enabling them to do index searches. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting the low cost, unlimited retention benefits of cloud storage, but with the interactive performance of fully indexed search,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Scalyr scores $20M Series A for super-fast log reading tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/20/scalyr-scores-20m-series-a-for-super-fast-log-reading-tool/embed/#?secret=wqtPAYSSEJ" data-secret="wqtPAYSSEJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Peter Wagner, founding partner at investor Wing Venture Capital, says that the beauty of this tool is that it eliminates tradeoffs, while lowering customers overall data processing costs. &#8220;The Hydrolix team has built a real-time data platform optimized not only to deliver superior performance at a fraction of the cost of current analytics solutions, but one architected to offer those same advantages as data volumes grow by orders of magnitude,&#8221; Wagner said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that in the past couple of weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentinelone-acquires-high-speed-logging-startup-scalyr-for-155m/">SentinelOne bought high speed logging platform Scalyr</a> for $155 million, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/logging-startups-are-suddenly-hot-as-crowdstrike-nabs-humio-for-400m/">CrowdStrike grabbed Humio</a>, another high speed logging tool for $400 million, so this category is getting attention.</p>
<p>The product is currently compatible with AWS and offered through the Amazon Marketplace, but Kagan says they are working on versions for Azure and Google Cloud and expect to have those available later this year. The company was founded at the end of 2018 and currently has 20 employees spread out over six countries with headquarters in Portland, Oregon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enticing the enterprise world to embrace augmented reality has proven a more difficult task than many startups in the AR space anticipated, but as the hardware and software behind the tech becomes increasingly commodified, customers are starting to find use cases that align with their shifting remote workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scopear.com/">Scope AR</a> has been selling the vision of using 3D models to help the manufacturing industry scale training and collaboration since they launched back in 2010. Now, the startup is looking to build a more scalable future for themselves as they revamp their central product WorkLink for the web, Scope AR CEO Scott Montgomerie tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new platform called WorkLink Create allows customers to sidestep complexity and author 3D content on top of CAD models without using Unity, an effort to make the product more approachable to non-technical users and customers that might not have access to Unity developers to roll out an integration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Unity is awesome but to do anything you have to code,&#8221; Montgomerie tells TechCrunch, calling WorkLink Create a &#8220;more user-friendly and scalable&#8221; option compared to software from its competitors.</p>
<p>The browser-based platform allows users to upload 3D files and edit them with comments, detailed instructions and animations via a drag-and-drop interface. The platform automatically scales down the level of detail on CAD models to meet the capabilities of the devices that will be rendering them. Once published, a customer&#8217;s users can access the models and instructions via WorkLink&#8217;s mobile and HoloLens apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117015" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117015" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2117015 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg 2278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=1536,931 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1241 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-5.12.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117015" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Scope AR</p></div></p>
<p>Scope AR&#8217;s focus on commercial education, on-the-job training and troubleshooting have seen renewed interest as COVID era guidelines have pushed more meetings into virtual spaces.</p>
<p>While AR hasn&#8217;t seen the full embrace of the COVID-era digital transformation, the remote work boom in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also boosted business for Scope AR&#8217;s products, Montgomerie says. With the company expanding its list of customers while also helping frontline manufacturing operations that have aimed to quickly build and repair medical equipment necessary for COVID-19 testing and treatment.</p>
<p>Montgomerie says that he had always expected AR adoption to take some time, but the the slow pace of AR headset adoption had exceeded his expectations, something that has pushed the company to fully embrace mobile-based AR integrations on phones and tablets over the years. Scope AR is an authorized reseller of the HoloLens 2, though HoloLens makes its own remote collaboration software for enterprise users as well called Remote Assist.</p>
<p>Scope AR closed a $9.7 million Series A back in 2019 &#8212; the bulk of the company&#8217;s nearly $12 million raised to date from investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not every company&#8217;s founders find themselves on a first name basis with the local bomb squad, but then again not every company is <a href="https://noyalabs.com/">Noya Labs</a>, which wants to turn the roughly 2 million cooling towers at industrial sites and buildings across the U.S. into CO2 sucking weapons in the fight against global climate change.</p>
<p>When the company first started developing prototypes of its devices that attach to water coolers, the company&#8217;s founders, Josh Santos and Daniel Cavero, did what all good founders do, they started building in their backyard.</p>
<p>The sight of a 55 gallon oil drum, a yellow refrigeration tank in a sous vide bath attached to red and blue cables didn&#8217;t sit so well with the neighbors, so Santos and Cavero found themselves playing host to the bomb squad multiple times, according to the company&#8217;s chief executive, Santos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We proved that it could capture CO2, and we achieved something that no startup should achieve,&#8221; Santos said of the dubious bomb squad distinction.</p>
<p>Santos and Cavero were inspired to begin their experiments with direct air capture by an article describing some research into plants&#8217; declining ability to capture carbon dioxide that Santos read on the Caltrain on his way to work back in 2019. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/climate/plants-co2-climate-change.html">That article</a> spurred the would-be entrepreneur and his roommate to get to work on experimenting with carbon chemistry.</p>
<p>Their first product was a consumer air purifier that would pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in homes and capture it. Homeowners could then sell the captured gases to Santos and Cavero who would then resell it. But the two quickly realized that the business model wasn&#8217;t economical, and went back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>They found their eventual application in industrial cooling towers, which the company&#8217;s tech can turn into CO2 capturing devices that have the capacity to take in between half a ton and a ton of carbon dioxide per day.</p>
<p>Noya&#8217;s tech works by adding a blend of CO2 absorbing chemicals to the water in the cooling towers. They then add an attachment to the cooling tower that activates what Santos called a regeneration process to convert the captured CO2 back into gas. Once they have captured the CO2 the company will look to resell it to industrial Co2 consumers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not green yet, at least not exactly, because that CO2 is being recirculated instead of sequestered, but Santos said it&#8217;s greener existing sources of the gas, which come from ammonia and ethanol plants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117187" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117187" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117187" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png" alt="" width="1024" height="721" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png 1878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=1536,1081 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NoyaLabsFounders.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117187" class="wp-caption-text">Noya Labs co-founders Josh Santos and Daniel Cavero. Image Credit: Noya Labs</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years from now we fully intend to have vertically integrated carbon capture and sequestration. Our first step is locally produced low cost atmospherically captured CO2,&#8221; said Santos. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were to go all in on a carbon capture that would require a lot of time for us to develop. What this initial model allows us to do is fine tune our capture technology while building up longterm to go to market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Santos called it the &#8220;Tesla roadster approach&#8221; so that the company can build up capital and get revenue and prove one piece of it as an MVP so they can prove other steps of it down the line.</p>
<p>Noya Labs already is developing a pilot plant with the <a href="https://alexandrefamilyfarm.com/">Alexandre Family Farm</a> that should capture between the estimated half a ton and one ton target.</p>
<p>To develop the initial pilot and build out its team, the company has managed to raise $1.2 million from the frontier tech investment firm Fifty Years, founded by Ela Madej and Seth Bannon, and Chris Sacca&#8217;s Lowercarbon Capital (whose mission statement to invest in companies that will buy time to &#8220;unf*ck the planet&#8221; might be one of the greatest). The company&#8217;s also in Y Combinator.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that makes us excited about this technology is that in the U.S. alone there are 2 million cooling towers. Looking conservatively &#8212; if our initial pilot plant can capture 1 ton per day &#8212; we&#8217;re at right over half a gigaton of CO2 capture.&#8221;</p>
<p>And companies are already raising their hands to pick up the CO2 that Noya would sell on the market. There&#8217;s a growing collection of startups that are using CO2 to make products. These companies range from the slightly silly, like Aether Diamonds, which uses CO2 to make&#8230; diamonds; to companies like Dimensional Energy or Prometheus fuels, which make synthetic fuels with CO2, or Opus12, which uses CO2 in its replacements for petrochemicals.</p>
<p>Prices for commercial CO2 range between $125 per ton to $5,000 per ton, according to Santos. And Noya would be producing at less than $100 per ton. Current Direct Air Capture companies sell their CO2 from somewhere between $600 to $700 per ton.</p>
<p>Stoya&#8217;s first installation could cost around $250,000, Santos said. For Bannon, that means the company passes his <a href="https://twitter.com/sethbannon/status/1214215295969030148?lang=en">&#8220;Mr. Burns test.&#8221;</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been digging into the DAC space but haven&#8217;t liked the techno-economics we&#8217;ve seen. Previous approaches have had too much capex and opex and not enough revenue potential,&#8221; Bannon wrote in an email. &#8220;That&#8217;s what Noya has solved. By leveraging existing industrial equipment, their model is profitable. And better yet, they make their carbon capture partners money, allowing them to scale this up fast. This creates an opportunity to profitably remove 1 gigaton plus a year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As far as fundraising goes, Berkshire Grey is in pretty good shape. When I visited its Massachusetts headquarters last year, following a massive $263 million Series B, the company discussed some pretty aggressive growth plans. Mind you, that was before the pandemic has really touched down in the U.S. in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>If anything, Covid-19 has accelerated interest in automation, as companies look to safeguard themselves from the inevitable effects of future pandemics. Today, Berkshire Gray <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005491/en/Berkshire-Grey-a-Leader-in-AI-Enabled-Robotics-and-Automation-Solutions-Announces-Business-Combination-with-Revolution-Acceleration-Acquisition-Corp">announced its intention</a> to become the latest tech company to go public by way of SPAC. The deal, which finds its merging with Revolution Acceleration Acquisition, could value the company at up to $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>In a release tied to the news, BG cites a 5% current warehouse automation figure – a number I’ve heard tossed around a lot in relation to these deals. It certainly points big potential for growth among retailers looking to streamline fulfillment, logistics and the like. For many, it’s as simple as finding a way to stay competitive with the likes of Amazon, which has massively bolstered its own robotics efforts through acquisitions like Kiva Systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BG offers a kind of ground-up solution for close to full automation. The technology separates it from more plug and play automation solutions like Locus and Fetch Robotics. Their offerings are more focused on automating companies faster and more cheaply. BG’s ecosystem includes a variety of different robotics, including picking, gripping and image sensing, with north of 300 patents in the space.</p>

<p>“Consumer expectations have changed, putting more pressure on supply chain operations to get the right goods to the right places at the right times, as efficiently as possible,” CEO Tom Wagner said in a release tied to the news. “Over the last 12 months the pandemic amplified the already high pressure to transform, so today it is no longer a question of if companies might transform but how quickly. We are incredibly excited about this transaction, which will enable Berkshire Grey to accelerate growth and provide new and existing customers with our leading robotics solutions.”</p>
<p>The deal would bring up up to $413 million in cash for the company. It says it plans to use the funding to address a backlog of customers and build out an international presence. It’s expected to close in Q2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As energy grids transition away from fossil fuels and towards the use of zero emission sources of power from primarily renewable energy sources, they&#8217;re going to need an ability to store and then use the massive amounts of energy that&#8217;s only generated intermittently by the sun and wind.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why technologies coming from companies like<a href="https://www.maltainc.com/"> Malta</a>, an energy storage technology developer that just raised $50 million in new financing, are attracting attention and venture capital investment.</p>
<p>Malta spun out from the special projects group at Google&#8217;s parent company Alphabet and relies on some very old technologies combined in a novel way to provide long duration energy storage that can be discharged during times of peaking demand &#8212; like the conditions that effected Texas&#8217; power grid last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest round of funding was led by the Swiss natural gas, methanol, and agricultural conglomerate Proman; with participation from previous investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the nearly ubiquitous backer of renewable energy and sustainable startups, and Alfa Laval, which makes industrial filters and heat exchangers. Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook and the chief executive and co-founder of Asana, also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Heat exchangers are central to Malta&#8217;s approach, which is based on research from the Nobel Prize winning Stanford University physics professor, Robert Laughlin. <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994054">In a 2017 paper</a>, Laughlin proposed a system that used a thermal heat-pump tapping super-cold cryogenic storage fluids and superheated molten salt to store energy.</p>
<p>Building on that initial design, engineers at Alphabet&#8217;s moonshot factory, X, began developing a modified version of the designs Laughlin proposed.</p>
<p>That modified design is what&#8217;s now being developed by Malta, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-19/gates-bezos-among-billionaires-backing-alphabet-energy-spinoff">which spun out from X in 2018</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramya Swaminathan, Malta&#8217;s chief executive officer, who previously worked for the renewable energy project developer Rye Development, said that the current Malta system can store and dispatch energy with efficiency rates of around 60%. That&#8217;s&#8230; not great, but Swaminathan said that the declining costs of renewable power means that efficiency is less important as prices continue to come down the cost curve. &#8220;In practice we are heading towards a system where electricity is priced close to zero,&#8221; Swaminathan said. Indeed, as some grids employ negative pricing models when there&#8217;s a glut of electricity generated by wind and solar power, Malta&#8217;s tech becomes more appealing she said. </span></p>
<p>Malta is far from the only company developing long-duration storage to solve the variable power production problem caused by the build out of renewable energy. <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/16/clean-renewable-energy-storage-malta-bill-gates-lithiium-ion-batteries-climate-change-green/"><em>Fortune </em>had a whole dang article</a> (which is actually something I&#8217;d wanted to write) listing the multiple companies that are tackling the energy storage dilemma.</p>
<p>They include companies like Energy Vault and Advanced Rail Energy Storage North America, which are both trying to use mechanical energy for long storage. In Energy Vault&#8217;s case that means using renewable power to lift huge one ton blocks of cement that can then be dropped to unleash that stored energy as power. ARES North America uses a similar concept, but instead of big honkin bricks, the company has trains that it moves to store and discharge energy.</p>
<p>Closer to Malta&#8217;s Cambridge, Mass. base of operations, a company called Form Energy is working on&#8230; something&#8230; that would compete with Malta&#8217;s energy storage system. That business was <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/inside-form-energy-star-studded-startup-tackling-hardest-problem-in-clean">launched by some energy storage superstars</a>, who previously had stints at companies like Tesla, the failed big battery tech developer Aquion, and A123 Systems (a granddaddy of the lithium ion battery revolution).</p>
<p>Malta&#8217;s system is able to discharge 100 megawatts over ten hours, which is equivalent to one gigawatt hour of production at a price tag that&#8217;s about price competitive with lithium ion batteries, according to Swaminathan.</p>
<p>The company is currently working on its first commercial scale plant, which it expects to commission in the 2024 or 2025 timeframe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it&#8217;s competitors are already supplying power from pretty massive storage projects. Energy Vault has had a demonstration unit connected to the Swiss national utility grid that can discharge roughly 35 megawatt hours onto the grid, <a href="https://energyvault.com/commercial-demonstration-unit/">according to the company</a>.</p>
<p>Companies like Proman like Malta because it can provide a ready customer for its chemicals and natural gas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is an exponential global need for long-duration, low-cost energy storage solutions, and we are excited to work with the Malta team and our new partners to progress Malta’s highly scalable and technically robust solution,&#8221; said David Cassidy, Chief Executive of Proman, in a statement. &#8220;Alongside our investment, Proman will bring complementary design, engineering and construction expertise to the Malta PHES technology as we begin work with Malta on a commercial scale plant.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.patch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the carbon offset API developer, has raised $4.5 million in financing to build out its business selling customers a way to calculate their carbon footprint and identify and finance offset projects that capture the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions associated with that footprint. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/andreessen-horowitz-could-make-the-carbon-offset-api-patch-its-latest-climate-bet/">Confirming TechCrunch reporting</a>, Andreessen Horowitz led the round, which also included previous investors <a href="https://versionone.vc/">VersionOne Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.maplevc.com/">MapleVC</a>, and <a href="https://www.palebluedotventures.com/">Pale Blue Dot Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Patch&#8217;s application protocol interface works for both internal and customer-facing operations. The company&#8217;s code can integrate into the user experience on a company&#8217;s internal site to track things like business flights for employees, recommending and managing the purchase of carbon credits to offset employee travel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software allows companies to choose which projects they&#8217;d like to finance to support the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with projects ranging from the tried and true reforestation and conservation projects to more high tech early stage technologies like direct air capture and sequestration projects, the company said. </span></p>
<p>Patch founders <a href="https://twitter.com/bspellacy_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennan Spellacy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-grunfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Grunfeld, </a>two former employees at the apartment rental service Sonder, stressed in an interview that the company&#8217;s offset work should not be viewed as an alternative to the decarbonization of businesses that use its service. Rather, they see Patch&#8217;s services as a compliment to other work companies need to do to transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels in business operations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117071" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg 1728w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117071" class="wp-caption-text">Patch co-founders Brennon Spellacy and Aaron Grunfeld. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.patch.io">Patch</a></p></div></p>
<p>Patch currently works with 11 carbon removal suppliers and has plans to onboard another 10 before the end of the first quarter, the company said. These are companies like <a href="https://www.carboncure.com/#:~:text=CarbonCure%20manufactures%20a%20technology%20that,process%20and%20becomes%20permanently%20embedded.">CarbonCure</a>, which injects carbon dioxide into cement and fixes it so that it&#8217;s embedded in building materials for as long as a building lasts.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Carbon removal credits can help to dramatically accelerate the deployment of technologies like CarbonCure’s, which are absolutely critical to helping us reach our global climate targets. Demand for high-quality, permanent credits is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sky-rocketing, and listing credits on Patch will help us to attract a broader range of buyers,” said Jennifer Wagner, President of CarbonCure Technologies, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>It also has around 15 customers already using its service, according to earlier TechCrunch reporting. Those buyers include companies like TripAction and the private equity firm EQT, which intends to extend the integration of Patch&#8217;s API from its own operations to those of its portfolio companies down the road, according to Spellacy.</p>
<p>Grunfeld said that the company would be spending the money to hire more staff and developing new products. From its current headcount of six employees, Patch intends to bring on another 24 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the company expands, it&#8217;s looking to some of the startups providing carbon emissions audit and verification services as a channel that the company&#8217;s API can integrate with and sell through.  These would be businesses like  <a href="https://carbonchain.com/">CarbonChain</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/persefoni-launches-with-3-5-million-and-a-carbon-accounting-system-for-big-business/">Persefoni</a>, and another Y Combinator graduate, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/yc-grad-sinai-helps-companies-understand-their-emissions-in-a-bid-to-fight-climate-change/">SINAI Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>For project developers like CarbonCure, which makes direct air capture technology, companies like</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An increasing number of businesses are taking leadership positions in an effort to reduce emissions to try to counteract global warming,” said Jeff Jordan, Managing Partner at Andreessen Horowitz. “Patch makes it much easier for companies to add carbon removal to their core business processes, aggregating verified carbon-removal supply and offering turn-key access to it to companies through an easy-to-implement API.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The weather data and forecasting startup <a href="https://www.climacell.co/">ClimaCell</a> today announced that it plans to launch its own constellation of small weather satellites. These radar-equipped satellites will allow ClimaCell to improve its ability to get a better picture of global weather and improve its forecasting abilities. The company expects the first of these to launch in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>As ClimaCell CEO Shimon Elkabetz points out in today&#8217;s announcement, ground-based radar coverage, which allows you to get information about precipitation and cloud structure, remains spotty, even in the U.S., which in turn often makes even basic forecasting more difficult. And while there are (expensive) space-based radar satellites available, those often only revisit the same area every three days, limiting their usefulness. ClimaCell hopes that its constellation of small, specialized satellites will offer hourly revisit times.</p>
<p>We started with proprietary sensing and modeling to predict the weather more accurately at every point in the world, and built on top of it one software platform that can be configured to every job and vertical,&#8221; Elkabetz writes. &#8220;[&#8230;] Now, we are evolving into a SaaS company powered by Space: We’re launching a constellation of satellites to improve weather forecasting for the entire world. For the first time, a constellation of active radar will surround Earth and provide real-time observations to feed weather forecasting at every point on the globe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s indeed a big step for the company, but we may just see more of this in the near future. While even 10 years ago it would have been hard for even a well-funded company to launch its own satellites, that&#8217;s quite different now. A number of factors contributed to this, ranging from easier access to launch services, breakthroughs in building these proprietary radar satellites and the availability of auxiliary services like ground stations as a service, which now even AWS and Microsoft offer, and a whole ecosystem of vendors that specialize in building these satellites. The ClimaCell team tells me that it is talking to a lot of vendors right now and will choose which one to go to later on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Engineering teams face steep challenges when it comes to staying on schedule, and keeping to those schedules can have an impact on the entire organization. <a href="https://www.acumen.io/">Acumen</a>, an Israeli engineering operations startup announced a $7 million seed investment today to help tackle this problem.</p>
<p>Hetz, 10D, Crescendo and Jibe participated in the round, designed to give the startup the funding to continue building out the product and bring it to market. The company, which has been working with beta customers for almost a year, also announced it was emerging from stealth today.</p>
<p>As an experienced startup founder, Acumen CEO and co-founder Nevo Alva has seen engineering teams struggle as they grow due to a lack of data and insight into how the teams are performing. He and his co-founders launched Acumen to give companies that missing visibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As engineering teams scale, they face challenges due to a lack of visibility into what&#8217;s going on in the team. Suddenly prioritizing our tasks becomes much harder. We experience interdependencies [that have an impact on the schedule] every day,&#8221; Alva explained.</p>
<p>He says this manifests itself in a decrease in productivity and velocity and ultimately missed deadlines that have an impact across the whole company. What Acumen does is collect data from a variety of planning and communications tools that the engineering teams are using to organize their various projects. It then uses machine learning to identify potential problems that could have an impact on the schedule and presents this information in a customizable dashboard.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Harness launches Continuous Insights to measure software team performance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/harness-launches-continuous-insights-to-measure-software-team-performance/embed/#?secret=vZg2LOUohe" data-secret="vZg2LOUohe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The tool is aimed at engineering team leaders, who are charged with getting their various projects completed on time with the goal of helping them understand possible bottlenecks. The software&#8217;s machine learning algorithms will learn over time what situations cause problems, and offer suggestions on how to prevent them from becoming major issues.</p>
<p>The company was founded in July 2019 and the founders spent the first 10 months working with a dozen design partners building out the first version of the product, making sure it could pass muster with various standards bodies like SOC-2. It has been in closed private beta since last year and is launching publicly this week.</p>
<p>Acumen currently has 20 employees with plans to add 10 more by the end of this year. After working remotely for most of 2020, Alva says that location is no longer really important when it comes to hiring. &#8220;It definitely becomes less and less important where they are. I think time zones still are still a consideration when speaking of remote,&#8221; he said. In fact, they have people in Israel, the US and eastern Europe at the moment among their 20 employees.</p>
<p>He recognizes that employees can feel isolated working alone, so the company has video meetings every day and spend the first part just chatting about non-work stuff as a way to stay connected. Starting today, Acumen will begin its go to market effort in earnest. While Alva recognizes there are competing products out there like Harness and Pinpoint, he thinks his company&#8217;s use of data and machine learning really helps differentiate it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since going public, most of the news out of Airbnb has been around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/airbnb/">policy</a>. Today, the company has an announcement that&#8217;s all about the product.</p>
<p>As the pandemic evolves the way we do everything, and we collectively realize that much of that new behavior will be permanent, tech companies are looking to evolve alongside us.</p>
<p>Airbnb is today introducing Flexible Search, which will allow users to forgo putting in exact dates when they look to book lodging on the platform. Instead, users can search for a weekend getaway, week-long vacation, month-long vacation or months-long vacation without setting specific dates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only does this give guests more options to browse through, but it should also increase exposure for hosts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117141" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117141" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2117141" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbnb</p></div>Airbnb says that its new <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/2021-travel/">travel trends report</a> shows that one quarter of Americans would consider traveling during off-peak times of the year or the week, and in 2021 so far, more than 1/3 of the people searching on Airbnb have been flexible in terms of date and location.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the company had to say about it in a blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s no surprise COVID-19 continues to change the way we travel, and in addition to redesigning our platform last year to make nearby and longer-term stays easier to find and book, our new Flexible Dates feature aligns with a broader shift in how people will travel in the future. The traditional travel industry was built around fixed destinations with fixed dates in mind, but that model no longer meets the needs of today’s travelers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Travel, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-coronavirus-ravaged-travel-in-2020-11604500952">air travel in particular</a>, have been devastated by the pandemic in 2020. Signs of a slow recovery are starting to sprout up, but the move to remote work (which has resulted in much, much less business travel) means that a good chunk of the depression in the travel industry is here to stay. That said, Airbnb&#8217;s travel trends report shows that the majority of folks (54 percent) miss traveling and are planning their next getaway.</p>
<p>Flexible Search will allow users to get back in the mindset of travel without having an exact plan around dates, which is particularly important as the positivity rates around the globe and country continue to shift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced this morning it will soon introduce a new experience designed for teens and tweens who are now too old for the schoolager-focused YouTube Kids app, but who may not be ready to explore all of YouTube. The company says it&#8217;s preparing to launch a beta test of new features that will give parents the ability to grant kids more limited access to YouTube through a &#8220;supervised&#8221; Google Account. This setup will restrict what tweens and teens can watch on the platform, as well as what they can do &#8212; like create videos or leave comments, for example.</p>
<p>Many parents may have already set up <a href="https://support.google.com/families/answer/7103338?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7336731">a supervised Google Account</a> for their child through Google&#8217;s <a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/">Family Link</a> parental control app. This app allows parents to restrict access across a range of products and services, control screen time, filter websites and more. Other parents may have created a supervised Google Account for their child when they first set up the child&#8217;s account on a new Android device or Chromebook.</p>
<p>If not, parents can take a few minutes to create the child&#8217;s supervised account when they&#8217;re ready to begin testing the new features. (Unfortunately, Google Edu accounts &#8212; like those kids now use for online school &#8212; aren&#8217;t supported at launch.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new features will allow parents to select between three different levels of YouTube access for their tween or teen. Initially, YouTube will test the features with parents with children under the age of consent for online services &#8212; age 13 in the U.S., but different in other countries &#8212; before expanding to older groups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116948" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_PSA-campaign.png?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>For tweens who have more recently graduated out of the YouTube Kids app, an &#8220;Explore&#8221; mode will allow them to view a broad range of videos generally suited for viewers age 9 and up &#8212; including vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, and educational content. This would allow the kids to watch things like their favorite gaming streamer with kid-friendly content, but would prevent them (in theory) from finding their way over to more sensitive content.</p>
<p>The next step up is an &#8220;Explore More&#8221; mode, where videos are generally suitable for kids 13 and up &#8212; like a PG-13 version of YouTube. This expands the set of videos kids can access and allows them access to live streams in the same categories as &#8220;Explore.&#8221;</p>
<p>For older teens, there is the &#8220;Most of YouTube&#8221; mode, which includes almost all YouTube videos except those that include <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167">age-restricted content</a> that isn&#8217;t appropriate for viewers under 18.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116947" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116947" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="639" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png 1211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=150,141 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=300,282 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=768,722 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=680,639 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Supervised-Experiences_Content-settings.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>YouTube says it will use a combination of user input, machine learning, and human review to curate which videos are included in each of the three different content settings.</p>
<p>Of course, much like YouTube Kids, that means this will not be a perfect system &#8212; it&#8217;s a heavily machine-automated attempt at curation where users will still have to flag videos that were improperly filtered. In other words, helicopter parents who closely supervise their child&#8217;s access to internet content will probably still want to use some other system &#8212; like a third-party parental control solution, perhaps &#8212; to lock down YouTube further.</p>
<p>The supervised access to YouTube comes with other restrictions, as well, the company says.</p>
<p>Parents will be able to manage the child&#8217;s watch and search history from within the child&#8217;s account settings. And certain features on YouTube will be disabled, depending on the level of access the child has.</p>
<p>For example, YouTube will disable in-app purchases, video creation, and commenting features at launch. The company says that, over time, it wants to work with parents to add some of these features back through some sort of parent-controlled approach.</p>
<p>Also key is that personalized ads won&#8217;t be served on supervised experiences, even if that content isn&#8217;t <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9713557?hl=en">designated as &#8220;made for kids&#8221;</a> &#8212; which would normally allow for personalized ads to run. Instead, all ads will be contextual, as they are on YouTube Kids. In addition, all ads will have to comply with <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9683742">kids advertising policies</a>, YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/188570?topic=30084&amp;ctx=topic">general ad policies</a>, and will be subject to the same <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9683742">category and ad content restrictions</a> as on <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/better-protecting-kids-privacy-on-youtube/">Made for Kids</a> content.</p>
<p>That said, when parents establish the supervised account for their child, they&#8217;ll be providing consent for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance">COPPA</a> compliance &#8212; the U.S. children&#8217;s privacy law that requires parents to be notified and agree to the collection and use personal data from the kids&#8217; account. So there&#8217;s a trade-off here.</p>
<p>However, the new experience may still make sense for families where kids have outgrown apps designed for younger children &#8212; or even in some cases, for younger kids who covet their big brother or sister&#8217;s version of &#8220;real YouTube.&#8221; Plus, at some point, forcing an older child to use the &#8220;Kids&#8221; app makes them feel like they&#8217;re behind their peers, too. And since not all parents use the YouTube Kids app or parental controls, there&#8217;s always the complaint that <em>&#8220;everyone else has it, so why can&#8217;t I?&#8221; </em>(It never ends.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YouTube-Kids.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube Kids app</p></div></p>
<p>This slightly more locked down experience lets parents give the child access to &#8220;real YouTube&#8221; with restrictions on what that actually means, in terms of content and features.</p>
<p>YouTube, in an <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube/">announcement</a>, shared several endorsements for the new product from a few individual youth experts, including Leslie Boggs, president of National PTA; Dr. Yalda Uhls, Center for Scholars &amp; Storytellers, UCLA &#8211; Author of Media Moms &amp; Digital Dads; Thiago Tavares, Founder and President of SaferNet Brazil; and Professor Sun Sun Lim, Singapore University of Technology &amp; Design &#8211; Author of Transcendent Parenting.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s news, notably, follows several product updates from fast-growing social video app and YouTube rival TikTok, which has rolled out a number of features aimed at better protecting its younger users.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">in April 2020 launched a &#8220;family pairing&#8221; mode</a> that lets a parent link their child&#8217;s account to their own in order to also lock down what the child can do and what content they can see. (TikTok offers a curated experience for the under-13 crowd called Restricted Mode, which can be switched on here, too.) And in January of this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok changed the privacy setting defaults</a> for users under 18 to more proactively restrict what they do on the app.</p>
<p>YouTube says its new product will launch in beta in the &#8220;coming months&#8221; in over 80 countries worldwide. It also notes that it will continue to invest in YouTube Kids for parents with younger children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many founders talk about their desire for a more diverse investor base. Richie Serna took that desire and made it a reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serna, who founded payments infrastructure startup Finix in 2016, had raised more than $95 million in venture funding from the likes of Lightspeed Venture Partners, American Express Ventures, Homebrew, Precursor Ventures, Insight Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, Visa and Activant Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based fintech last raised $30 million in an extension of its Series B round </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/payments-services-company-finix-adds-30-million-to-its-series-b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time, Finix &#8212; which says its mission is to make every company a payments company &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said it had seen its transaction volume more than quadruple from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Serna, a first-generation Mexican-American who was the first in his family to go to college (Harvard), wanted to broaden his company’s cap table even further. So he created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that ultimately raised an additional $3 million and brought more than 80 “traditionally marginalized” investors onto Finix’s cap table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is very personal for me as a founder of color &#8212; making sure we have a diverse representation of people in our investor base,” Serna said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116970" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116970" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2116970 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Richie_Serna_Headshot-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116970" class="wp-caption-text">Finix CEO and founder Richie Serna &#8211; Image courtesy of Finix</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort, Serna added, was more than just diversifying his company’s cap table. It was also an initiative aimed at giving Black and Latinx investors access to an opportunity they may not have otherwise had. Indeed, the numbers are dismal. A recent </span><a href="https://nvca.org/research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NVCA-Deloitte Human Capital Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 80% of investment partners at VC firms are white, and just 3% are Black and 3% are Hispanic/Latinx.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is about helping historically underrepresented groups build track records and get attribution for the work to help them start their careers and hopefully one day start their own fund,” Serna told TechCrunch. “So this is just one way that we at Finix can construct a rewrite of the story about the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also not a one-time thing. Moving forward, in all subsequent rounds, Finix will be allocating 10% of each round to Black and Latinx investors.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/partpic-makes-it-easier-to-find-repair-parts-for-your-whozits-whatsits-and-more/">Jewel Burks Solomon</a>, managing partner of Collab Capital and head of Google for Startups, U.S. said the opportunity to invest in &#8220;a high growth company like Finix at a time that is typically reserved for a very select group of highly connected (usually white) investors is a big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Access is the primary determinant of wealth creation,&#8221; Atlanta, Ga.-based Solomon added. &#8220;So creating an opportunity for access to folks who might not otherwise have it is game-changing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tiffani Ashley Bell, founder and executive director of The Human Utility (and now Finix investor), the SPV gives “talented, knowledgeable investors and operators from diverse backgrounds &#8212; especially Black and Latinx people &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who have traditionally been excluded from investing early in rocket ship startups&#8221; a chance to be able to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While fundraising, Finix was also looking to fill senior executive positions. Through the process, the company was able to find a few who came with a breadth of experience to help the company advance on its long-term goals — including the possibility of going public one day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a class="c-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiona-taylor-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiona-taylor-summary/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Fiona Taylor</a>, who helped steer Solar City’s IPO and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/tesla-officially-acquires-solarcity/">acquisition by Tesla</a> and most recently served as Marqeta’s SVP of operations, is COO. CTO <a class="c-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramana-satyavarapu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramana-satyavarapu/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Ramana Satyavarapu</a> was a founding member of Microsoft Office 365, the head of engineering for Google Play Search, led software infrastructure engineering at Uber, and was most recently the head of data platforms &amp; products at Two Sigma, a quantitative hedge fund.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Finix has about 100 employees, 50% of whom Serna says he’s never met in person due to the pandemic and remote work. The company plans to double its headcount over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On whether the new hires mean that an IPO is in Finix’s future, Serna replied: “We always like to think that we&#8217;re not just building for the next year, we&#8217;re building for the future. And I think if you look at the group that we&#8217;ve brought together, it&#8217;s pretty clear in terms of the direction that we&#8217;re trying to head as an organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In looking ahead, Serna said he’s also excited about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the potential of the SPV to add diversity to his company&#8217;s cap table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black investors and other Latinx entrepreneurs were the first people to believe in me and back Finix,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I’m honored to pay it forward by creating the SPV, and I hope other founders are inspired to do the same.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, the coronavirus crisis has spurred app usage in the United States as people stay indoors to limit contact with others. Mobile games particularly have enjoyed a boom, and among them, games from Chinese studios are gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Games released on the U.S. App Store and Google Play Store raked in a total of $5.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, jumping 34.3% from a year before and accounting for over a quarter of the world&#8217;s mobile gaming revenues, according to a new report from market research firm <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HtuhOgXOApY34xjVOW513A">Sensor Tower</a>.</p>
<p>In the quarter, Chinese titles contributed as much as 20% of the mobile gaming revenues in the U.S. That effectively made China the largest importer of mobile games in the U.S., thanks to a few blockbuster titles. Chinese publishers claimed 21 spots among the 100 top-grossing games in the period and collectively generated $780 million in revenues in the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest mobile gaming market, more than triple the amount from two years before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Occupying the top rank are familiar Chinese titles such as the first-person shooter game Call of Duty, a collaboration between Tencent and Activision, as well Tencent&#8217;s PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds. But smaller Chinese studios are also quickly infiltrating the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Mihoyo, a little-known studio outside China, has been turning heads in the domestic gaming industry with its hit game Genshin Impact, a role-playing action game featuring anime-style characters. It was the sixth-most highest-grossing mobile game in the U.S. during Q4, racking up over <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$100 million in revenues in the period.</span></p>
<p>Most notable is that Mihoyo has been an independent studio since its inception in 2011. Unlike many gaming startups that covet fundings from industry titans like Tencent, Mihoyo has so far raised only a modest amount from its early days. It also stirred up controversy for skipping major distributors like Tencent and phone vendors Huawei and Xiaomi, releasing Genshin Impact on Bilibili, a popular video site amongst Chinese youngsters, and games downloading platform Taptap.</p>
<p>Magic Tavern, the developer behind the puzzle game Project Makeover, one of the most installed mobile games in the U.S. since late last year, is another lesser-known studio. Founded by a team of Tsinghua graduates with offices around the world, Magic Tavern is celebrated as one of the first studios with roots in China to have gained ground in the American casual gaming market. KKR-backed gaming company AppLovin is a <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2020/11/405281">strategic investor</a> in Magic Tavern.</p>
<p>Other popular games in the U.S. also have links to China, if not directly owned by a Chinese company. Shortcut Run and Roof Nails are works from the French casual game maker Voodoo, which received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tencent-takes-minority-stake-in-french-casual-games-maker-voodoo/">minority investment</a> from Tencent last year. Tencent is also a strategic investor in Roblox, the gaming platform oriented to young gamers and slated for an IPO in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">BigCommerce</a> has partnered with Walmart to allow its customers to sell on the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer&#8217;s ecommerce marketplace, it announced this morning. Shares of Austin-based BigCommerce rose sharply in pre-market trading after the news, gaining around 10% before the bell.</p>
<p>Walmart, best-known for in-person shopping, has proven an ecommerce success story in recent years. For example, in its <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Q4FY21-Earnings-Release_Final.pdf">most recent quarter</a> while Walmart as a whole grew 7.3%, its ecommerce sales advanced 69%.</p>
<p>BigCommerce has also reported strong growth in recent quarters, supported in part by partnerships similar to the one that it announced today. The ecommerce SaaS provider rolled out an integration with Wish last year, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a call concerning its earnings, which were announced before the Walmart news was announced, BigCommerce CEO Brent Bellm told TechCrunch that his company had been impressed with customer uptake of the Wish integration. Regarding the Walmart partnership, in a second interview Bellm told TechCrunch that it was overdue on the BigCommerce side; given the historical success of the Wish deal, it will be curious to dig into how many of the ecommerce platform&#8217;s customers opt to sell on Walmart, and how quickly they do so.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also spoke with Walmart exec Jeff Clementz about the arrangement. He stressed Walmart&#8217;s online customer monthly-actives &#8212; 120 million, per his company &#8212; and the breadth of their demand; BigCommerce customers selling on Walmart could expand its product diversity, helping the traditionally physical retailer possible continue its rapid growth.</p>
<p>The two companies are incentivizing adoption of the deal amongst BigCommerce customers by waiving certain fees for a month for retailers that sign up to sell on Walmart; Clementz described it as the first time that his company had offered a &#8220;new-seller discount.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has had its eye on BigCommerce for some quarters now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/bigcommerce-files-to-go-public/">thanks in part to its 2020 IPO</a>. But the company is also interesting as its regular earnings results provide a lens into the world of ecommerce growth amongst independent digital retailers. Shopify, a chief BigCommerce rival, provides a similar view into the ecommerce world.</p>
<p>Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/">previously integrated with Walmart in the middle of 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see if the Walmart partnership helps BigCommerce continue its improving revenue growth. The company is in a marketshare race with Shopify. But while BigCommerce&#8217;s rival has posted impressive growth from its integrated solutions, like its payments service, the Austin-based company stresses what it calls a more open model. Shopify <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Shopify-Plans-No-more-transaction-fees/td-p/122233#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20Shopify%20Payments%2C%20your%20transaction%20fees%20on%20Shopify,or%200%25%20(Unlimited).">charges many customers</a> a percentage of their transaction volume for using a third-party payment solution over its own, for example, which Bellm described as a &#8220;tax&#8221; during an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merchant Solutions&#8221; revenue at Shopify, which it generates &#8220;<a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/550512644/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/c3898d01-52b6-4d9b-87dc-21744e8ba90d.pdf">principally</a>&#8221; from &#8220;payment processing fees from Shopify Payments,&#8221; <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/550512644/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Press-Release-Q4-2020.pdf">grew 116% in 2020</a> to a little over $2 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So with BigCommerce collecting a partnership with Walmart to match Shopify&#8217;s own, we&#8217;re seeing not merely two ecommerce platforms go toe-to-toe on providing their customers with as much market access as they can, but two different business philosophies compete. Akin to Microsoft Teams and Slack, it&#8217;s a competition to spectate.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The concept of the &#8220;marketing cloud&#8221; &#8212; sold by the likes of Salesforce, Oracle and Adobe &#8212; has become a standard way for large tech companies to package together and sell marketing tools to businesses that want to improve how they use digital channels to grow their business.</p>
<p>Some argue, however, that &#8220;cloud&#8221;, singular, might be a misnomer: typically those tools are not integrated well with each other and effectively are run as separate pieces of software. Today a startup called Blueshift &#8212; which claims to offer an end-to-end marketing stack, by having built it from the ground up to include both traditional marketing data as well as customer experience &#8212; is announcing some funding, pointing to the opportunity to build more efficient alternatives.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a round of $30 million, a Series C that co-founder and CEO Vijay Chittoor said it will be using to expand to more markets (it&#8217;s most active in the U.S. and Europe currently) and also to expand its technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The product already has a unified format, to ingest data from multiple sources and redistribute that out to apps. Now, we want to distribute that data to more last-mile applications,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;Our biggest initiative is to scale out the notion of us being not just an app but a platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s customers include LendingTree, Discovery Inc., Udacity, BBC and Groupon, and it has seen revenue growth of 858% in the last three years, although it&#8217;s not disclosing actual revenues, nor valuation, today.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Fort Ross Ventures, with strong participation also from Avatar Growth Capital. Past investors Softbank Ventures Asia (which led its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/blueshift-announces-15m-series-b-to-expand-ai-fueled-cross-channel-marketing-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of $15 million</a>), Storm Ventures, Conductive Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners also invested.</p>
<p>The concept for Blueshift came out of Chittoor&#8217;s direct experience at Groupon &#8212; which acquired his previous startup, social e-commerce company Mertado &#8212; and before that a long period at Walmart Labs &#8212; which Walmart rebranded after it acquired another startup where Chittoor was an early employee, semantic search company Kosmix.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenges we are solving today we saw first hand as challenges our customers saw at Groupon and Walmart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The connected customer journey is creating a thousand times more data than before, and people and brands are engaging across more touchpoints. Tracking that has become harder with legacy channel-centric applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blueshift&#8217;s approach for solving that has been, he said, &#8220;to unify the data and to make decisions at customer level.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is to say, although the customer experience today is very fragmented &#8212; you might potentially encounter something about a company or brand in multiple places, such as in a physical environment, on various social media platforms, in your email, through a web search, in a vertical search portal, in a marketplace on a site, in an app, and so on &#8212; the experience for marketers should not be.</p>
<p>The company addresses this by way of a customer data platform (CDP) it markets as &#8220;SmartHub.&#8221; Designed for non-technical users although customizable by engineers if you need it to be, users can integrate different data feeds from multiple sources, which then Blueshift crunches and organises to let you view in a more structured way.</p>
<p>That data can then be used to power actions in a number of places where you might be setting up marketing campaigns. And Chittoor pointed out &#8212; like other marketing people have &#8212; that these days, the focus on that is largely first-party data to fuel that machine, rather than buying in data from third-party sources (which is definitely part of a bigger trend).</p>
<p>“Our mission is to back category-leading companies that are poised to dominate a market. Blueshift clearly stood out to us as the leader in the enterprise CDP space,” said Ratan Singh of Fort Ross Ventures in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with the Blueshift team as they accelerate the adoption of their SmartHub CDP platform.” Singh is joining Blueshift&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mozilla has further beefed up anti-tracking measures in its Firefox browser. In a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/">blog post</a> yesterday it announced that Firefox 86 has an extra layer of anti-cookie tracking built into the enhanced tracking protection (ETP) strict mode &#8212; which it&#8217;s calling &#8216;Total Cookie Protection&#8217; (TCP).</p>
<p>This &#8220;major privacy advance&#8221;, as it bills it, prevents cross-site tracking by siloing third party cookies per website.</p>
<p>Mozilla likens this to having a separate cookie jar for each site &#8212; so, for e.g., Facebook cookies aren&#8217;t stored in the same tub as cookies for that sneaker website where you bought your latest kicks and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new layer of privacy wrapping &#8220;provides comprehensive partitioning of cookies and other site data between websites in Firefox&#8221;, explains Mozilla.</p>
<p>Along with another anti-tracking feature it <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/">announced</a> last month &#8212; targeting so called &#8216;supercookies&#8217; &#8212; aka sneaky trackers that store user IDs in &#8220;increasingly obscure&#8221; parts of the browser (like <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862">Flash storage</a>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898390">ETags</a>, and <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/">HSTS</a> flags), i.e. where it&#8217;s difficult for users to delete or block them &#8212; the features combine to &#8220;prevent websites from being able to &#8216;tag&#8217; your browser, thereby eliminating the most pervasive cross-site tracking technique&#8221;, per Mozilla.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a &#8220;limited exception&#8221; for cross-site cookies when they are needed for non-tracking purposes &#8212; Mozilla gives the example of popular third-party login providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when Total Cookie Protection detects that you intend to use a provider, will it give that provider permission to use a cross-site cookie specifically for the site you’re currently visiting. Such momentary exceptions allow for strong privacy protection without affecting your browsing experience,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Tracker blocking has long been an arms race against the adtech industry&#8217;s determination to keep surveilling web users &#8212; and thumbing its nose at the notion of consent to spy on people&#8217;s online business &#8212; pouring resource into devising fiendish new techniques to try to keep watching what Internet users are doing. But this battle has stepped up in recent years as browser makers have been taking a tougher pro-privacy/anti-tracker stance.</p>
<p>Mozilla, for example, started making tracker blocking the default <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/firefox-will-soon-start-blocking-trackers-by-default/">back in 2018</a> &#8212; going on make ETP the default in Firefox in 2019, blocking cookies from companies identified as trackers by its partner, Disconnect.</p>
<p>While Apple&#8217;s Safari browser added an &#8216;Intelligent Tracking Prevention&#8217; (ITP) feature in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-adds-a-tracker-blocker-to-desktop-safari/">2017</a> &#8212; applying machine learning to identify trackers and segregate the cross-site scripting data to protect users&#8217; browsing history from third party eyes.</p>
<p>Google has also put the cat among the adtech pigeons by announcing a planned phasing out of support for third party cookies in Chrome &#8212; which it said would be coming within two years back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">January 2020</a> &#8212; although it&#8217;s still working on this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">&#8216;privacy sandbox&#8217;</a> project, as it calls it (now under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">watchful eye of UK antitrust regulators</a>).</p>

<p>Google has been making privacy strengthening noises since 2019, in response to the rest of the browser market responding to concern about online privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/google-rolls-back-samesite-cookie-changes-to-keep-essential-online-services-from-breaking/">In April last year</a> it rolled back a change that had made it harder for sites to access third-party cookies, citing concerns that sites were able to perform essential functions during the pandemic &#8212; though this was resumed in July. But it&#8217;s fair to say that the adtech giant remains the laggard when it comes to executing on its claimed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/googles-chrome-will-soon-get-new-privacy-features-with-better-cookie-controls-and-anti-fingerprinting-tech/"> plan to beef up privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Given Chrome&#8217;s marketshare, that leaves most of the world&#8217;s web users exposed to more tracking than they otherwise would be by using a different, more privacy-pro-active browser.</p>
<p>And as Mozilla&#8217;s latest anti-cookie tracking feature shows the race to outwit adtech&#8217;s allergy to privacy (and consent) also isn&#8217;t the sort that has a finish line. So being slow to do privacy protection arguably isn&#8217;t very different to not offering much privacy protection at all.</p>
<p>To wit: One worrying development &#8212; on the non-third-party-cookie based tracking front &#8212; is detailed in this <a href="https://lirias2repo.kuleuven.be/rest/bitstreams/611713/retrieve">new paper</a> by a group of privacy researchers who conducted an analysis of CNAME tracking (aka a DNS-based anti-tracking evasion technique) and found that use of the sneaky anti-tracking evasion method had grown by around a fifth in just under two years.</p>
<p>The technique has been raising mainstream concerns about &#8216;unblockable&#8217; web tracking since around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/invasive-scheme-spotted-that-foxes-tracker-blockers/">2019</a> &#8212; when developers spotted it being used in the wild by a French newspaper website. Since then use has been rising, per the research.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WMY9fFy6WD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/invasive-scheme-spotted-that-foxes-tracker-blockers/">Invasive scheme spotted that foxes tracker blockers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Invasive scheme spotted that foxes tracker blockers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/invasive-scheme-spotted-that-foxes-tracker-blockers/embed/#?secret=WMY9fFy6WD" data-secret="WMY9fFy6WD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a nutshell the CNAME tracking technique cloaks the tracker by injecting it into the first-party context of the visited website &#8212; via the content being embedded through a subdomain of the site which is actually an alias for the tracker domain.</p>
<p>&#8220;This scheme works thanks to a DNS delegation. Most often it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">DNS CNAME record</a>,&#8221; writes one of the paper authors, privacy and security researcher Lukasz Olejnik, in a <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/large-scale-analysis-of-dns-based-tracking-evasion-broad-data-leaks-included/">blog post</a> about the research. &#8220;The tracker technically is hosted in a subdomain of the visited website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employment of such a scheme has certain consequences. It kind of fools the fundamental web security and privacy protections &#8212; to think that the user is wilfully browsing the tracker website. When a web browser sees such a scheme, some security and privacy protections are relaxed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by the use of the word &#8216;relaxed&#8217; &#8212; as Olejnik goes on to emphasize that the CNAME tracking technique has &#8220;substantial implications for web security and privacy&#8221;. Such as browsers being tricked into treating a tracker as legitimate first-party content of the visited website (which, in turn, unlocks &#8220;many benefits&#8221;, such as access to first-party cookies &#8212; which can then be sent on to remote, third-party servers controlled by the trackers so the surveilling entity can have its wicked way with the personal data).</p>
<p>So the risk is that a chunk of the clever engineering work being done to protect privacy by blocking trackers can be sidelined by getting under the anti-trackers&#8217; radar.</p>
<p>The researchers found one (infamous) tracker provider, Criteo, reverting its tracking scripts to the custom CNAME cloak scheme when it detected the Safari web browser in use &#8212; as, presumably, a way to circumvent Apple&#8217;s ITP.</p>
<p>There are further concerns over CNAME tracking too: The paper details how, as a consequence of current web architecture, the scheme &#8220;unlocks a way for broad cookie leaks&#8221;, as Olejnik puts it &#8212; explaining how the upshot of the technique being deployed can be &#8220;many unrelated, legitimate cookies&#8221; being sent to the tracker subdomain.</p>
<p>Olejnik documented this concern in a study back in 2014 &#8212; but he writes that the problem has now exploded: &#8220;As the tip of the iceberg, we found broad data leaks on 7,377 websites. Some data leaks happen on almost every website using the CNAME scheme (analytics cookies commonly leak). This suggests that this scheme is actively dangerous. It is harmful to web security and privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers found cookies leaking on 95% of the studies websites.</p>
<p>They also report finding leaks of cookies set by other third-party scripts, suggesting leaked cookies would in those instances allow the CNAME tracker to track users across websites.</p>
<p>In some instances they found that leaked information contained private or sensitive information &#8212; such as a user&#8217;s full name, location, email address and (in an additional security concern) authentication cookie.</p>
<p>The paper goes on to raise a number of web security concerns, such as when CNAME trackers are served over HTTP not HTTPS, which they found happened often, and could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>Defending against the CNAME cloaking scheme will require some major browsers to adopt new tricks, per the researchers &#8212; who note that while Firefox (global marketshare circa 4%) does offer a defence against the technique Chrome does not.</p>
<p>Engineers on the WebKit engine that underpins Apple&#8217;s Safari browser have also been working on making enhancements to ITP aimed at counteracting CNAME tracking.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/">blog post</a> last November, IPT engineer John Wilander wrote that as defence against the sneaky technique &#8220;ITP now detects third-party CNAME cloaking requests and caps the expiry of any cookies set in the HTTP response to 7 days. This cap is aligned with ITP’s expiry cap on all cookies created through JavaScript.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brave browser also <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-6/">announced</a> changes last fall aimed at combating CNAME cloaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;In version 1.25.0, uBlock Origin gained the ability to detect and block CNAME-cloaked requests using Mozilla’s terrific <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.25.0">browser.dns API</a>. However, this solution only works in Firefox, as Chromium does not provide the browser.dns API. To some extent, these requests can be blocked using custom DNS servers. However, no browsers have shipped with CNAME-based adblocking protection capabilities available and on by default,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brave 1.17, Brave Shields will now recursively check the canonical name records for any network request that isn’t otherwise blocked using an embedded DNS resolver. If the request has a CNAME record, and the same request under the canonical domain would be blocked, then the request is blocked. This solution is on by default, bringing enhanced privacy protections to millions of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the browser with the largest marketshare, Chrome, has work to do, per the researchers, who write:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Chrome does not support a DNS resolution API for extensions, the [uBlock version 1.25 under Firefox] defense could not be applied to this browser. Consequently, we find that four of the CNAME-based trackers (Oracle Eloqua, Eulerian, Criteo, and Keyade) are blocked by uBlock Origin on Firefox but not on the Chrome version.</p></blockquote>
<p>Discussing the research findings, Tom Van Goethem, another of the paper authors, said the team&#8217;s data shows that web publishers who use CNAME tracking are using it to supplement other, more &#8220;typical&#8221; third party tracking methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that publishers who adopt CNAME-based already have a considerable number of trackers (20+ per site on average), and find that this number of trackers remains stable over time. This indicates that CNAME-based tracking is not used as a replacement of the typical third-party tracking, but rather to increment their tracking capabilities, e.g. targeting users with anti-tracking mechanism,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The researchers were not focused on coming up with a causal explanation for the rise in the use of CNAME cloaking. But Van Goethem said that they found some trackers using it only against the Safari browser (&#8220;which is known to include strict anti-tracking protections&#8221;) &#8212; which suggests (at least) a partial explanation for rising use of the technique.</p>
<p>Asked what kind of community response they&#8217;d like to see to combat the CNAME scheme he said: &#8220;Ideally, more anti-tracking defenses should adopt robust measures against CNAME-based tracking such that users are protected regardless of the browser they&#8217;re using.&#8221;</p>
<p>Browsers need to deploy multiple defences to combat a variety of techniques in order to effectively defend user privacy. So, in the case of Firefox&#8217;s new TCP feature, Van Goethem noted that while it doesn&#8217;t affect CNAME-based (first-party) tracking &#8220;in essence&#8221;, it <em>does</em> protect against cookie syncing between sites that employ first-party tracking.</p>
<p>&#8220;With CNAME-based tracking, the tracker can follow the user&#8217;s activities on one specific site (that includes the tracker), but it needs to synchronize cookies with other sites to link the tracked activities of one specific user on site A to the activities of that same user on site B. Total Cookie Protection would prevent this,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Other non-cookie-based tracking techniques l&#8211; ike device fingerprinting and <a href="https://github.com/asankah/ephemeral-fingerprinting">ephemeral fingerprinting</a> &#8212; can also be used to circumvent browser-based defences against cookie-based tracking. &#8220;This means that defenses need to be complete, and provide protections against all types of tracking in order to safeguard users,&#8221; per Van Goethem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that our large-scale analysis, which shows that CNAME-based tracking is on the rise, will raise awareness, and incentivize users and browser vendors to advance defenses against this tracking mechanism,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, we hope that our study will highlight the potential security impact that publishers face by including CNAME-based trackers. Throughout our study we discovered two security issues that affect all visitors of publisher sites; in one case the issue is still not fixed (despite multiple attempts of reaching out to the tracker to report the vulnerability), putting visitors of hundreds of websites at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regulatory action/enforcement could also be helpful in curbing use of the CNAME technique, he also suggested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every new smart home device invites new questions. Questions of privacy, security and what we’re willing to give up for the sake of convenience. It’s not an anti-technology stance to welcome these conversations and assess new products as we invite them into our homes.</p>
<p>For my part, my apartment is fairly limited when it comes to smart home tech. I own two large smart speakers and a third smaller one, mostly for the convenience of networking streaming music across different rooms. My smoke detector is connected, for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that my home wasn’t on fire back when I used to leave it for extended stretches. Oh, and a couple of connected lightbulbs, mostly because why not?</p>
<p>Back when Google announced its first-party smart screen, the Home (now Nest) Hub, I thought it was a savvy decision to leave the camera off. Of course, the company included one on its larger Max device, so the option is there, if you want it. Of course, for most of these products, video cameras are a given &#8212; and understandably so, with smart screens like the new Echo Show 10 edging into the teleconferencing space as the line between work and home has become far more fuzzy for many.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116810" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116810" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8770.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116810" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon’s gotten the message here, with the addition of a large physical shutter button on the top of the device. When slid to the right, the camera on the top right is covered by a white lens cap, contrasted against the black bezel, so it’s easy to spot across the room. Doing so will pop up a notification: “Camera off. Disabling motion.”</p>
<p>The “motion” here refers to the rotating screen &#8212; the headline feature of Amazon’s latest take on the Echo Show format. The company is positioning the new tech as a game changer for the category, and while I will say it’s done a good job implementing the feature in a way that works well and quietly, it’s precisely this new addition that reignites the privacy question.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116805" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116805" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116805" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8784.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The notion of creating a home device that fades into its surroundings is really out the window with that feature. The Echo uses figure tracking to make sure the display is facing you at all times when using it, drawing attention to itself in the process. One can inherently know and passively understand that a device is using imaging and AI for tracking, but largely effectively ignore it. After all, we’ve got cameras on pretty much everything now. These things are a part of the social media and services we regularly use. When the device physically follows you around the room, however, this stuff is top of mind.</p>
<p>Having used the product for several days, I would say the feature feels unnecessary in most cases &#8212; and downright unnerving in some. I’ve placed the Show on my desk next to the computer where I’m typing this, and I’ve mostly disabled the feature. It’s probably something I could get used to over time, but with the relatively limited amount I’m going to spend with it, I prefer to use the product in a stationary manner, manually swiveling the display and flipping the screen angle up and down as needed. I adjust screens all of the time. It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Amazon will walk you through the feature during setup, including which direction you want the screen facing as a default and how much rotation it offers on either side. Keep in mind, the system really has no notion of what constitutes “straight ahead, until you adjust the setting sliders accordingly. You can adjust these later in settings, as well. There’s also a “Motion Preferences” option. Here you can limit the applications it will use to follow you, require voice to use the feature or disable it entirely.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m also someone who prefers to keep the camera shutter on while not in use, so that works out just fine. You can&#8217;t shutter the camera and have the device continue to move, since it needs to know what it&#8217;s seeing to move along with it. I will say that the moving screen has the unexpectedly nice side effect of reminding me when I’ve forgotten to disable the camera.</p>
<p>Amazon’s understandably &#8212; and thankfully &#8212; been talking up the privacy aspects since the Echo Show 10 was announced. There are eight mentions of “privacy” on the product page, but here’s the key graf:</p>
<blockquote><p>Built with multiple layers of privacy controls, including a mic/camera off button and a built-in shutter to cover the camera. Easily turn on/off motion at any time by voice, on-device, or in the Alexa app. The processing that powers screen motion happens on device &#8211; no images or videos are sent to the cloud to provide the motion feature.</p></blockquote>

<p>Notably, the tracking feature uses a vague outline of a person, rather than any sort of facial tracking. The image it processes looks more like a blotchy heat map than anything recognizable as an individual or even, generally, a human (though it&#8217;s able to distinguish human figures from pets). That, in particular, has been a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/"> hot button topic</a> for the company.</p>
<p>The rotating feature is primarily a way to reduce user friction. Amazon notes that existing Echo Show owners will swivel their devices around when they’re, say, using it in the kitchen to cook. The front-firing audio also moves as the screen does. That’s in keeping with the company’s move away from 360-degree audio in recent Echo models. This is either a plus or a minus, depending on how you use the device, and how many people are around. It can also be used to follow you as you move around while video calling (a feature the competition has offered through zooming and cropping).</p>
<p>Amazon’s taken pains in recent generations to improve the audio on these device, prioritizing the “speaker” part of smart speaker, and the new Show certainly benefits from that. I wouldn’t use it as my primary sound system, but sitting here on my desk, it delivers a nice, full sound for its size, even with the screen obscuring a big portion of the front.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch screen is a nice size, as well. Again, I wouldn’t use it to replace a TV or even a good laptop, but it’s good size for quick videos. It’s a shame Amazon and Google haven’t been able to play nice here, because YouTube has the market cornered on short-form videos that are perfect for this form factor. (If you’re so inclined, you can still access YouTube via the built-in browser, though it’s not exactly an elegant solution.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116809" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116809" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116809" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8767.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video certainly has its share of good long-form content and series (it has a ton of trash, as well, but sometimes that’s fun, too), but Amazon’s best play is partnering with third-parties to bolster its offerings. And that’s another spot where Amazon has been improving the Echo experience. Netflix and Hulu are now available on the device for video, and Apple Music and Spotify have been added on the music side.</p>
<p>There are still a number of third-party apps that would be nice additions, but that’s a pretty solid starting point. Not to mention that services like Spotify can be set as the default for music playback. That’s one of those additions that genuinely reduces friction (and honestly, Amazon Music is a far less compelling service than Prime Video at the moment).</p>
<p>Zoom &#8212; arguably the most compelling addition from a software standpoint &#8212; is coming later. For now, calls are limited to other Alexa devices. Zoom and other third-party teleconference software has the opportunity to create an entire new dimension for these products, especially with the aforementioned blurring of home and work life.</p>
<p>Honestly, where the Show is currently sitting on my desk is really the perfect placement to use it for calls while working on my computer. I’m cautiously optimistic about the implementation. At the very least, it would give me a compelling reason to get more use out of that 13-megapixel camera on a regular basis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116803" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116803" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2116803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CMC_8780.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>For the time being, I think the most compelling case to be made for both the camera and automatic screen swiveling is as a makeshift security camera. This is another “Coming Soon” feature that requires a Guard Plus subscription. With it, you can set a geofence, with the Show doubling as a smart security camera when you leave home. The system will send an alert if a person is detected in your home while you’re out.</p>
<p>This month has seen rumors that Amazon is working on a wall-mounted smart home hub. The form factor certainly makes sense, essentially serving as an Alexa-enabled touchscreen control for your various connected devices. For the time being, between Show and the Alexa mobile app, I think the bases are covered pretty well &#8212; though such a device could certainly lend a more premium experience to the space.</p>
<p>A well-placed Show will address that need for many. Certainly it does the job for my one-bedroom apartment. You can use voice or touch to control lighting, and the screen can monitor feeds from security cameras, including, naturally, Amazon-owned Ring. Additions like these have really made the smart screen category a much more compelling and capable one.</p>
<p>At $249, it’s $20 pricier than the 2018 Show. It’s hard to say how much of the increase is due to the new mechanical turning mechanism, but Amazon offered up a cheaper model without the functionality that’s almost certainly the one I would go for, for reasons outlined above. Again, not everyone will have the same misgivings.</p>
<p>And all told, it’s a well-constructed, nice addition to the Show family and one I don’t mind moving around the old-fashioned way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s almost too simple. You get a tablet made of household chemicals that can be dissolved in water which can become a cleaning spray for the kitchen, glass and bathroom, with no need to ship the water it is dissolved into because it literally comes out of your tap. That was the premise of Munich-based startup <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/">everdrop</a> and it’s been a hit not just with consumers, but also with investors. It’s now raised an €18m ($21.8m) Series A funding round led by Felix Capital, with participation from HV Capital and Vorwerk Ventures. Everdrop now plans to develop a wider range of sustainable household products and market them across Europe, and eventually the US.</p>
<p>Launched in Dec 2019, the cleaning tablet also removes the need for single-use plastic bottles, thus appealing to environmentally conscious consumers, (unusually for a consumer good company, the startup has 110,000 <a href="http://www.instagram.com/everdrop">followers</a> on Instagram).</p>
<p>Everdrop estimates it was able to eliminate over 2.5 million single-use plastic bottles with their tabs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>David Löwe, Co-Founder of everdrop told me in an interview that while it might be possible to clone the company’s formats, it would not be easy to replicate its water hardness calculator: “Plus, the individualizing of the laundry detergent is quite unique. I think there&#8217;s no one out there in other countries who are doing that at the moment… But obviously, other companies could potentially do that too.”</p>
<p>Everdrop competes with <a href="https://www.grove.co/home">Grove Collaborative</a>, <a href="https://www.blueland.com/">Blueland</a> and to some extent The Honest Company.</p>
<p>Löwe told me: “If I&#8217;m very honest, it would be cool if the other companies would do it because this is something that I&#8217;m really convinced about. If we inspire with our success, the big corporations could finally change into more sustainable products.”</p>
<p>As well as the tablet, everdrop now has a range of sustainable laundry detergents, also microplastic-free, which addresses water hardness by tailoring the detergent to the water in the customer&#8217;s home area. This means everdrop can save up to 50% of the unnecessary surfactants in the detergent. Laundry detergent is the biggest chemical emitter in private households. Everdrop estimates its approach saves 250 tons of unnecessary surfactants from going into the environment.</p>
<p>Its latest product is a “naked” dishwasher tablet which doesn’t have the plastic wrapper that usually envelops these products.</p>
<p>David Fischer, investor at HV Capital said: “It is incredible how a truly sustainable brand such as everdrop has a similar growth trajectory in its inception year as its D2C peers Hims and DollarShaveClub.”</p>
