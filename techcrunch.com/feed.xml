										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Madrid-based <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a>, a digital temp staffing agency which operates a dual-sided platform that connects temp workers with employers needing regular casual labor in sectors like transport and logistics, has added €88 million (~$108M) to its Series C &#8212; bringing the total raised following an earlier (2019) closing of the round to €166M.</p>
<p>The 2009-founded startup has raised more than $290M to date over its decade+ run but describes itself as just at the beginning of a journey to make a dent in the massive and growing market for temporary work, expecting demand to keep stepping up as more sectors and processes go digital in the coming years.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jobandtalent" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jobandtalent">Jobandtalent <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says more than 80,000 workers have used its platform to secure temp gigs in the last year across the seven markets where it operates in Europe and LatAm (namely: Spain, UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Mexico and Colombia); while 750+ employers are signed up to &#8220;recurrently manage a large part of their workforce&#8221;, as it puts it, including XPO, Ocado, Saint Gobain, Santander, Bayer, eBay, Huawei, Ceva Logistics and Carrefour.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s focused on competing with traditional staffing agencies such as Adecco and Randstad, though other similar startups are cropping up to cater to an ever more precarious temporary employment market. (And Uber, for example, launched a shift-finder app experiment called Works, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/uber-launches-a-shift-work-finder-app-uber-works-starting-in-chicago/">back in 2019</a>, also targeting demand for on-demand labor &#8212; but doing so in partnership with staffing agencies in its case).</p>
<p>Jobandtalent reports the number of workers looking for temp jobs on its platform doubling every year, while it&#8217;s grown revenue to €500M and says it&#8217;s hit positive EBITDA.</p>
<p>The beefed up Series C funding will be put towards expanding into more markets and doubling down on growing its existing footprint, it said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will keep expanding through Europe and will consider some additional opportunities (the US and some LatAm countries),&#8221; co-founder Juan <span class="gD">Urdiales</span> told us, noting that its main markets remain Spain and the UK, while its main sectors are logistics, last mile, warehousing and transport.</p>
<p>The lead investor in the expansion tranche of its C round is new investor InfraVia, a French private equity firm, which is putting in €30M &#8212; investing via a Growth Tech Fund it launched last year that&#8217;s focused on European b2b high-growth tech companies.</p>
<p>Existing Jobandtalent investors, including Atomico, Seek, DN Capital and Kibo Ventures, also participated in the Series C top-up.</p>
<p><span class="gD">Urdiales</span> said the reason it&#8217;s taken in another chunk of funding now is because of increased opportunity for growth as the coronavirus pandemic continues to accelerate demand for temping. &#8220;The reason why we are raising more is because we are seeing a high potential now to grow even faster than expected,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;The pandemic has helped us with both workers and employers in terms of adoption of our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid has accelerated the transformation of many industries. We have seen more adoption of new technologies in the last nine months than in the last five years. The staffing market is experiencing a huge transformation that will be accelerated in the upcoming years, moving from brick and mortar traditional structures to data driven platforms that will improve the experience of both workers and employers,&#8221; <span class="gD">Urdiales</span> went on in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This market is really big and we are just in the beginning of our journey (even though we have been a lot of years in the market now),&#8221;<span class="gD"> he added via email, discussing whether an IPO is on the business&#8217; roadmap in the next few years. </span>&#8220;We think that if we continue growing at the pace that we are growing now, and we add some private investors to help us with our growth plans, we may stay private for longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobandtalent has been through a number of pivots since kicking off more than a decade ago with the idea of using technology to streamline the messy and consummately human business of recruitment. It started out testing a number of approaches before settling on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/22/jobandtalent-funding/?_ga=2.235855362.201458190.1609746167-1757155993.1533833482">linguistics algorithm</a> to parse job ads and create alerts to loop in passive job seekers.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/jobandtalent-gets-42m-series-b-after-pivoting-to-mobilize-hiring-for-smes/">2016</a> it pivoted away from enterprise recruitment to focus on mobilizing hiring for SMEs &#8212; zeroing in on the growing opportunity for temp job-matching offered by the rise of gig work fuelled by smartphone apps. From there, it&#8217;s been honing tools to cater to the needs of employers that are managing large temporary workforces.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jobandtalent gets $42M Series B after pivoting to mobilize hiring for SMEs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/jobandtalent-gets-42m-series-b-after-pivoting-to-mobilize-hiring-for-smes/embed/#?secret=CNfalE91P1" data-secret="CNfalE91P1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The flip side of the rapid growth of &#8216;flexible&#8217; platform-based labor &#8212; and Jobandtalent says it&#8217;s eyeing a pool of some 500M temp workers globally &#8212; is something that gig platforms don&#8217;t usually like to talk about: Worker precariousness.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s something this startup says it wants to help with too. A key part of the proposition Jobandtalent offers to workers is increased benefits vs what a temp might otherwise expect to get.</p>
<p>The average gig platform does not offer a full suite of workers rights and benefits, just as they don&#8217;t provide a contractual guarantee of future shifts, as they<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> classify on-demand labor as &#8216;self-employed&#8217; &#8212; even as, simultaneously, they apply mobile technology to tightly manage this workforce (via data, algorithms and their own devices). </span></p>
<p>This disconnect, between the level of gig worker rights and platform control, has led to a number of legal challenges in Europe &#8212; including in several of the markets where Jobandtalent operates (such as Spain, where Glovo continues to face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">legal challenges over its classification of delivery couriers</a>, for example; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/uber-driver-reclassified-as-employee-in-france/">France</a> and the UK, where Uber has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/uber-loses-another-appeal-against-drivers-rights-in-uk/">lost a number of employment tribunals over driver status</a>).</p>
<p>EU lawmakers are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools/">eyeing conditions for gig workers</a> &#8212; considering whether legislation is needed to protect platform workers&#8217; rights. While some platform giants, like Uber, have already felt politically pressured to offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/uber-expands-its-accident-insurance-across-europe/">a level of insurance in the region</a>.</p>
<p>Jobandtalent&#8217;s promise is it&#8217;s pushing for more perks for temps &#8212; leveraging the scale of its platform to get workers a better deal, including by making precarious work more steady (by lining up the next gig) and therefore less uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the workers have access to the same benefits,&#8221; said <span class="gD">Urdiales via email when we ask about how Jobandtalent&#8217;s perks are structured</span>. &#8220;There are benefits such as advance payroll, health insurance, training courses, etc (not all the benefits are available in all countries, it depends on the level of maturity of each country).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give any worker that starts working through Jobandtalent access to those benefits and offer a high standard employment treatment, so they have a similar status to what a perm employee has,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In a press release trumpeting its investment in Jobandtalent, new investor, InfraVia, also suggests the platform makes &#8220;temporary work a fulfilling professional step&#8221; &#8212; by defining &#8220;career plans&#8221; for temporary workers so they can &#8220;progress towards permanent and rewarding positions&#8221;.</p>
<p>However when we asked <span class="gD">Urdiales what data it has on temp-to-permanent switches that have been enabled by its platform he said this is &#8220;not a common thing&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Employers are not looking to add workers to their perm workforces, and Jobandtalent is precisely trying to solve that for the workers, trying to give constant employment in different work assignments at different companies so they can find more stability,&#8221; he told us, adding: &#8220;The market is moving even more into a more precarious temporary employment market, and we believe that in this context a platform like the one that we are offering makes even more sense.&#8221;.</p>
<p>The other big carrot for workers to plug into Jobandtalent&#8217;s temp work marketplace is convenience: It takes a mobile app-based approach &#8212; offering a one-stop-shop for giggers to find their next shift, apply for the temp job (via in-app video interview), sign the contract and get paid, as well as access the touted benefits.</p>
<p>Its streamlining of admin around recruitment and payroll is also of course a key carrot for employers to get on board with Jobandtalent&#8217;s &#8216;workforce as a service&#8217; proposition &#8212; which claims an upgraded offer (such as a CRM that bakes in analytics for tracking workforce performance in real time) vs traditional temping agency processes, as well as lower costs and increased numbers of job offers.</p>
<p>Its worker-to-temp job matching tech is designed to take the (temp) recruitment strain for employer customers via a proprietary quality worker scoring algorithm which it calls a Worker Quality Score (WQS).</p>
<p><span class="gD">Urdiales told us the criteria that feeds this score include </span>attrition rate, absenteeism rate &#8212; and &#8220;some productivity metrics of the workers that we place&#8221; &#8212; when we asked for details, having found no information about the WQS on its website.</p>
<p>Algorithmic scoring of workers can have obvious implications for worker agency.</p>
<p>Nor is it without legal risk in Europe where EU citizens have rights attached to their personal data, such as access rights, and also (under the GDPR) a right to human review of any purely automated decisions that have a legal or similarly substantial impact on them (and decisions impacting access to work would be likely to qualify).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/italian-court-rules-against-discriminatory-deliveroo-rider-ranking-algorithm/">recent judgement</a>, for example, a court in Italy ruled that a reputation ranking algorithm used by on-demand delivery platform Deliveroo had discriminated against workers because the code failed to distinguish between legally protected reasons for being absent from work (such as sickness or being on strike) and more trivial reasons for not turning up for a previously booked shift. (Deliveroo no longer uses the algorithm in question.)</p>
<p>Uber is also facing legal challenges in the Netherlands to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/ubers-robo-firing-of-drivers-targeted-in-latest-european-lawsuit/">use of algorithms to automatically terminate drivers</a> and to its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/"> use of data and algorithms to profile and manage drivers</a>. While ride-hailing company Ola is facing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/ola-is-facing-a-drivers-legal-challenge-over-data-access-rights-and-algorithmic-management/">similar suit</a> over its algorithmic management of gig workers. So EU courts are certainly going to busy interrogating the intersection of app-driven algorithmic management and regional data and labor rights for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The European Commission has also proposed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">sweeping reform of the regional rulebook for digital services</a> which includes a requirement for regulatory oversight of key decision-making algorithms with the aim of shrinking the risk of negative impacts such as bias and discrimination &#8212; although any new laws are likely still years out.</p>
<p>Asked whether Jobandtalent&#8217;s worker users are provided with their own WQS and given the chance to appeal substantial decreases in the score &#8212; including the opportunity to request a human review of any automated decisions &#8212; <span class="gD">Urdiales</span> said: &#8220;The platform gives them constant feedback based on the main metrics that they can affect (voluntary attrition, absenteeism, etc) with the aim to make them improve at work and consequently improve their ability to get more jobs in the future.&#8221;</p>

But the news of a potential tie-up (however tentative) with Apple, which is known for keeping a tight lid on deals before they are announced, was enough to send shares of Hyundai Motor Company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/005380.KS/">up more than 20% </a>on the Korea Exchange during trading on Friday.</p>
<p>The talks were first reported by the Korea Economic Daily and confirmed by Hyundai to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/hyundai-shares-jump-most-since-1988-after-report-on-apple-tie-up">Bloomberg</a> in a statement that said &#8220;Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided.&#8221; The Korean auto giant also told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html">CNBC</a> that &#8220;we understand Apple is in discussion with a variety of global automakers, including Hyundai Motor. As the discussion is at its early stage, nothing has been decided.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Hyundai spokesperson declined to comment to TechCrunch. Apple has also been contacted for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY">Reuters</a> reported that Apple’s car initiative, called Project Titan, is still going on, with plans to develop an autonomous electric passenger vehicle. But the car is not expected to launch until 2024.</p>

<p>Hyundai launched its own electric vehicle brand, Ioniq, in August 2020, with plans to bring three all-electric vehicles to market over the next four years, as part of its strategy to sell one million battery electric vehicles and take a 10% share of the EV market by 2025. Hyundai also has a joint venture with autonomous driving technology company Aptiv to make Level 4 and Level 5 production-ready self-driving systems available to robotaxi, fleet operators and automakers by 2022. The Aptiv partnership was announced in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no secret that Tencent, the Chinese tech giant behind WeChat and a handful of blockbuster video games, is an aggressive investor. Even during 2020 when the pandemic slowed down economic activity in many parts of the world, Tencent was charging ahead with its investment ambitions.</p>
<p>During the year, the company participated in more than 170 funding rounds that amounted to a total of 249.5 million yuan ($38 million), according to the Chinese startup database ITJuzi. That made 2020 the most active year to date for Tencent&#8217;s investment team, which had been delivering superior results in the last decade.</p>
<p>By January 2020, over 70 of Tencent&#8217;s 800 portfolio companies had gone public and more than 160 of them surpassed $100 million in valuation, Martin Lau, Tencent&#8217;s president, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aB3sTjVL5ckni7VEOTJ0cg">told</a> a room of investees at the time. The achievement could well place Tencent side by side with some of the world&#8217;s top venture funds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tencent established an investment and M&amp;A unit back in 2008 and began to seriously ramp up financing around 2012. Since 2015, it has been funding more than 100 companies per year, ITJuzi data shows. <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="790" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png 2032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=1536,1185 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The social and entertainment giant has for long kept its funding activity close to its chest and data gleaned by third-party organizations like ITJuzi is often not exhaustive. The company did not immediately respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s questions about its investment in 2020, and the story draws mainly from public disclosures and interviews with people of knowledge.</p>
<h2>B2B interest</h2>
<p>While Tencent&#8217;s overall investment strategy has remained consistent &#8212; a diversifying portfolio with a focus on digital entertainment &#8212; it has quietly stepped up efforts in areas outside its main gaming arena. For instance, the firm has paid more attention to enterprise services ever since it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/tencent-reorg-enterprise/">B2B pivot in 2018</a>, putting more focus on cloud computing, fintech and the likes. The number of investments it made in enterprise software went from five in 2015 to 28 in 2020, according to ITJuzi.</p>
<p>In line with its new focus on enterprise, Tencent has also upped its game in fintech. In 2019 and 2020, it backed 18 and 15 fintech startups, respectively, ITJuzi shows, up from only four in 2015. The rise, though incremental, reflects the firm&#8217;s increased interest in an area that&#8217;s both hugely lucrative but also comes with many constraints.</p>
<p>In China, Tencent has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">long been competing with Ant Group</a>, the Alibaba fintech affiliate, to court users in payments, lending, wealth management, and even insurance. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">regulatory troubles facing Ant</a> are not exclusive to the Jack Ma empire and will likely come to daunt its smaller contenders, including Tencent&#8217;s fintech segments.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VU7jg12smg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">The race to be China&#8217;s top fintech platform: Ant vs Tencent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The race to be China&#8217;s top fintech platform: Ant vs Tencent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/embed/#?secret=VU7jg12smg" data-secret="VU7jg12smg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That said, Tencent is &#8220;not nearly as aggressive&#8221; as Ant when it comes to strengthening its position in China&#8217;s financial market, a person who partners with Tencent&#8217;s overseas fintech business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">told</a> TechCrunch.</p>
<h2>Fintech overseas</h2>
<p>The company is also prudent with its fintech expansion overseas in times of geopolitical tensions. So far, it&#8217;s mostly limited its ambition to providing cross-border payment services to China&#8217;s outbound tourists, rather than serving locals directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny around what Tencent and Alibaba are doing within the United States and that presents challenges,&#8221; said the CEO of a Tencent-backed startup based in the U.S. who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Through investments, however, Tencent has familiarized itself with the foreign financial markets. In 2015, the company made one fintech investment outside China. In 2020, it funded eight, according to public data collected by Crunchbase.</p>
<p>A significant portion of Tencent&#8217;s outside investments doesn&#8217;t bear strategic significance, and the company tends to let its portfolio startups operate autonomously. Partly for that reason, Tencent was slammed for prioritizing investment and financial return over product development and innovation in a viral article in 2018, titled ominously <a href="http://box5253.temp.domains/~luanbook/tencent-has-no-dream/#:~:text=Tencent%20is%20losing%20its%20edge,becoming%20utilitarian%20and%20short%2Dsighted.&amp;text=In%20practice%2C%20it%20neglects%20that,should%20come%20from%20product%20innovation.">&#8220;Tencent Has No Dream.&#8221;</a> The hands-off attitude is a stark contrast to the stranglehold practice of Alibaba, which prefers buying controlling stakes in businesses and shaking up their top management, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/alibaba-doubles-down-on-lazada/">as it did for Lazada</a>.</p>
<p>But many Tencent investments do add value to its business, even when the press announcements leave out the potential strategic synergies. Over the years, Tencent has made a series of small investments in the U.S. and other Western countries. Few of them appear to bring collaborative opportunities in the near term, but Tencent would still invite executives from these companies to China where they would learn from each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tencent made those investments really just to kind of learn what people are doing in the U.S. and how it might be able to be applied in China,&#8221; said the executive from the Tencent-backed startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any near term plans to do anything in China. But Tencent is a very reputable name, whether it&#8217;s in China or the U.S. And you know, it&#8217;s good to have the option to be able to do something more strategic in partnership with Tencent down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent&#8217;s fintech investments outside China could also be conducive to the firm&#8217;s gaming expansion overseas, according to a Hong Kong-based fund manager. The goal is to have half of its gamers to be overseas users, Tencent <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/news-bites/article/3039601/tencent-games-wants-half-its-users-be-overseas">pleged</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the gaming industry in Latin America and Southeast Asia, the biggest bottleneck is, surprisingly, not hardware but payments,&#8221; the fund manager told TechCrunch. &#8220;Of course, localization and compatibility are also important.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a long couple of days for the country, but President Trump only had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">wait 12 hours</a> before returning to his social network of choice.</p>
<p>In an uncharacteristically scripted three minute <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550">speech</a>, the president denounced the &#8220;heinous attack&#8221; on the Capitol. &#8220;The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy,&#8221; Trump said, warning the individuals involved that they will &#8220;pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The previous day, Trumped directed a crowd of his supporters who had gathered for a &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; rally near the White House to march toward Congress. That event turned into a violent riot that disrupted lawmakers&#8217; efforts to certify election results, wrought havoc within the building and left at least four people dead. As the chaos unfolded, Trump encouraged the rioters in a video posted to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> telling them they were &#8220;special&#8221; and &#8220;we love you.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe">pic.twitter.com/csX07ZVWGe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After yesterday&#8217;s video, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">Twitter locked Trump&#8217;s account</a> and required him to delete a handful of tweets before having his access restored. Facebook later<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/"> froze the president&#8217;s account</a> for the remainder of his time in office. Trump is now on very thin ice with Twitter — the company said it may suspend his account permanently if he breaks the rules again.</p>
<p>In the new video, Trump seemed to be aware that he&#8217;d gone too far. After exploring &#8220;every legal avenue&#8221; to stay in power, he backed away from a months-long crusade to override the will of American voters. Of course it&#8217;s completely possible and even likely that he&#8217;ll reverse course, sow more election misinformation and resume his dangerous quest to undermine President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s victory.</p>
<p>President Trump has had quite a few of these walk-back moments during his time in office, usually after <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/26/trump-says-both-sides-charlottesville-remark-said-perfectly/3586024002/">crossing a line</a> that makes even members of his own party <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-chris-wallace-elections-72f7d9cf6927639d1a92d4cdce995557">uncomfortable</a>. Yesterday certainly fit the bill, and even resulted in rare consequences from the social networks he relies on to communicate.</p>
<p>Trump also appeared to concede his loss for the first time, claiming that he will willingly leave office on January 20. &#8220;My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,&#8221; Trump said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If, as I suspect many of you have, you have worked your way through baking every type of cookie, bread and cake under the sun over the last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has a surprise for you: a pair of AI-generated hybrid treats, the &#8220;breakie&#8221; and the &#8220;cakie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The origin of these new items seems to have been in a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/baking-recipes-made-ai">demonstration of the company&#8217;s AutoML Tables tool</a>, a codeless model generation system that&#8217;s more spreadsheet automation than what you&#8217;d really call &#8220;artificial intelligence.&#8221; But let&#8217;s not split hairs, or else we&#8217;ll never get to the recipe.</p>
<p>Specifically it was the work of Sara Robinson, who was playing with these tools <a href="https://sararobinson.dev/2020/04/30/baking-machine-learning.html">earlier last spring</a>, as a person interested in machine learning and baking was likely to start doing around that time as cabin fever first took hold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What happened was she wanted to design a system that would look at a recipe and automatically tell you whether it was bread, cookie or cake, and why — for instance, a higher butter and sugar content might bias it toward cookie, while yeast was usually a dead giveaway for bread.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093618" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bakeml.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093618" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2093618" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bakeml.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="790" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093618" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sara Robinson</p></div></p>
<p>But of course, not every recipe is so straightforward, and the tool isn&#8217;t always 100% sure. Robinson began to wonder, what would a recipe look like that the system couldn&#8217;t decide on?</p>
<p>She fiddled around with the ingredients until she found a balance that caused the machine learning system to produce a perfect 50/50 split between cookie and cake. Naturally, she made some — behold the &#8220;cakie.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093634" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093634" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093634 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg" alt="A cakie, left, and breakies, right, with Robinson." width="1024" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg 1141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093634" class="wp-caption-text">A cakie, left, and breakies, right, with Robinson. Image Credits: Sara Robinson / Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It is yummy. And it strangely tastes like what I’d imagine would happen if I told a machine to make a cake cookie hybrid,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>The other hybrid she put together was the &#8220;breakie,&#8221; which as you surely have guessed by now is half bread, half cookie. This one ended up a little closer to &#8220;fluffy cookies, almost the consistency of a muffin.&#8221; And indeed they look like muffin tops that have lost their bottoms. But breakie sounds better than muffin tops (or &#8220;brookie,&#8221; apparently the original name).</p>
<p>These ingredients and ratios were probably invented or tried long ago, but it&#8217;s certainly an interesting way to arrive at a new recipe using only old ones.</p>
<p>The recipes below are perfectly doable, but to be transparent were not entirely generated by algorithm. It only indicates proportions of ingredients, and didn&#8217;t include any flavorings or features like vanilla or chocolate chips, both which Robinson added. The actual baking instructions had to be puzzled out as well (the AI doesn&#8217;t know what temperature is, or pans). But if you need something to try making that&#8217;s different from the usual weekend treat, you could probably do worse than one of these.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/">obvious reasons</a>, Trump doesn&#8217;t have a TikTok account. But the president&#8217;s speeches that helped incite the mob who yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot/">stormed the U.S. Capitol</a> will have no home on TikTok&#8217;s platform. The company confirmed to TechCrunch its content policy around the Capitol riots will see it removing videos of Trump&#8217;s speeches to supporters. It will also redirect specific hashtags used by rioters, like #stormthecapitol and #patriotparty, to reduce their content&#8217;s visibility in the app.</p>
<p>TikTok says that Trump&#8217;s speeches, where the president again <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-trump-say-he-loved-rioters/">reiterated claims of a fraudulent election</a>, are being removed on the grounds that they violate the company&#8217;s misinformation policy. That <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en#37">policy</a> defines misinformation as content that is inaccurate or false. And it explains that while TikTok encourages people to have respectful conversations on subjects that matter to them, it doesn&#8217;t permit misinformation that can cause harm to individuals, their community or the larger public.</p>
<p>A rioting mob intent on stopping democratic processes in the United States seems to fit squarely under that policy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, TikTok says it will allow what it calls &#8220;counter speech&#8221; against the Trump videos. This is a form of speech that&#8217;s often used to fight misinformation, where the creator presents the factual information or disputes the claims being made in another video. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">TikTok in November</a> had allowed counter speech in response to claims from Trump supporters that the election was &#8220;rigged,&#8221; even while it blocked top hashtags that were used to promote these ideas.</p>
<p>In the case of Trump&#8217;s speeches, TikTok will allow a user to, for example, use the green screen effect to comment on the speech &#8212; unless those comments support the riots.</p>
<p>In addition, TikTok is allowing some videos of the violence that took place at the Capitol to remain. For example, if the video condemns the violence or originates from a news organization, it may be allowed. TikTok is also applying its recently launched opt-in viewing screens on &#8220;newsworthy&#8221; content that may depict graphic violence.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ak6lbJmwWV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/">TikTok expands Community Guidelines, rolls out new &#8216;well-being&#8217; features</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok expands Community Guidelines, rolls out new &#8216;well-being&#8217; features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/embed/#?secret=ak6lbJmwWV" data-secret="ak6lbJmwWV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These screens, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/">announced in December</a>, appear on top of videos some viewers may find graphic or distressing. Videos with the screens applied are already eligible for TikTok&#8217;s main &#8220;For You&#8221; feed, but may not be prohibited. When a viewer encounters a screen, they can just tap a button to skip the video or they can choose to &#8220;watch anyway.&#8221; (It could not provide any example of the screens in use, however.)</p>
<p>Anecdotally, we saw videos that showed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates/2021/01/07/954446008/authorities-identify-woman-killed-by-police-during-u-s-capitol-rioting">woman who was shot and killed yesterday</a> appear on TikTok and then quickly disappear. But those we came across were from individual users, not news organizations. They were also not really condemning the riot &#8212; they were just direct video footage. It&#8217;s unclear if the specific videos we saw were those that TikTok itself censored or if the user chose to remove them instead.</p>
<p>Separately from graphic content, TikTok says it will remove videos that seek to incite, glorify or promote violence, as those also violate its Community Guidelines. In these cases, the videos will be removed as TikTok identifies them &#8212; either via automation or user reporting.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok takes down some hashtags related to election misinformation, ignores others&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/embed/#?secret=8eUVYpWPOK" data-secret="8eUVYpWPOK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">as it did in November</a>, TikTok is proactively blocking hashtags to reduce content&#8217;s visibility. It&#8217;s now blocking tags like #stormthecapitol and #patriotparty among others, and redirects those queries to its Community Guidelines. There are currently redirections across dozens of variations of those hashtags and others. The company doesn&#8217;t share its full list in order to protect its safeguards, it says.</p>
<p>TikTok had previously blocked tags like #stopthesteal and #QAnon, in a similar proactive manner.</p>
<p>We should point out that for all Twitter&#8217;s posturing about safety and moderation, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">allowed Trump to return to its app</a>, after a few key tweets were deleted. And it has yet to block hashtags associated with false claims, like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stopthesteal&amp;src=typeahead_click">#stopthesteal</a>, which continues to work today. Facebook, on the other hand,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/"> banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram</a> for at least two weeks. Like TikTok, it had previously blocked the #stopthesteal and #sharpiegate hashtags with a message about its Community Standards. (Today those searches are erroring out with messages that say &#8220;This Page Isn&#8217;t Available Right Now,&#8221; we noticed.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K1IUnr4jp0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/embed/#?secret=K1IUnr4jp0" data-secret="K1IUnr4jp0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s content moderation efforts have been fairly stringent in comparison with other social networks, as it regularly hides, downranks and removes users&#8217; posts. But it has also been accused of engaging in &#8220;censorship&#8221; by those who believe it&#8217;s being too aggressive about newsworthy content.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s led to users finding more creative ways to keep their videos from being banned &#8212; like using misspellings, coded language or clever editing to circumvent TikTok policies. At other times, creators will simply give up and direct viewers to their Instagram, where their content is backed up and less policed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hateful behavior and violence have no place on TikTok,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch, when we asked for a statement on the Capitol events. &#8220;Content or accounts that seek to incite, glorify or promote violence violate our Community Guidelines and will be removed,&#8221; they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture funds have been springing up everywhere in recent years. But a decade ago, it was far more difficult to build a new venture brand far away from a tech hub like Silicon Valley, New York, or Boston.</p>
<p>One firm that has pulled if off is <a href="https://www.ludlowventures.com/">Ludlow Ventures</a>, an 11-year-old, Detroit-based seed-stage venture firm that&#8217;s in the process of closing its fourth fund with $65 million in capital commitments, according to <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1839067/000183906721000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC paperwork</a> filed this week.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to firm founder Jonathon Triest, who declined to comment, citing SEC regulations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Triest began building Ludlow as a twentysomething University of Michigan grad who worked as strategic marketing consultant for Sony-BMG in Atlanta before returning home with his wife to be closer to family. Working initially with his attorney father, he began investing in startups on a deal-by-deal basis, using his base in Detroit to his advantage by showing by investors and founders he could grow and leverage a network.</p>
<p>Triest started to gain traction, too. Early and continuing investors include prominent individuals <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dan-gilbert" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dan-gilbert">Dan Gilbert, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the billionaire founder of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers (Ludlow has long shared an office with Gilbert&#8217;s <a href="https://www.detroit.vc/">venture firm</a>). Ludlow has also garnered growing institutional support over the years, including from Vintage Investment Partners, Grinnell College, and Foundry Group.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Umba, a digital bank for emerging markets, raises $2M Seed funding to expand across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/umba-a-digital-bank-for-emerging-markets-raises-2m-seed-funding-to-expand-across-africa/embed/#?secret=yx9ATVu3sr" data-secret="yx9ATVu3sr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Part of the appeal, seemingly, is the fresh perspective that the team brings to the many places where it is now investing. Indeed, though Ludlow was initially perceived as a regional firm, it quickly expanded outside of Detroit to invest across the U.S.</p>
<p>Just last month, it joined the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/umba-a-digital-bank-for-emerging-markets-raises-2m-seed-funding-to-expand-across-africa/">$2 million seed round</a> of <a href="https://www.umba.com/">Umba</a>, a 2.5-year-old, Lagos, Nigeria-based digital bank for emerging markets. Ludlow has also written checks in recent months &#8212; both new and follow-on &#8212; to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome</a>, a 1.5-year-old, New York-based HR software startup; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/la-based-boulevard-raises-27-million-for-its-spa-management-software/">Boulevard</a>, a four-year-old, LA-based spa management and payment platform; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/lightyear-scores-3-7m-seed-to-simplify-networking-infrastructure-procurement/">Lightyear</a>, a 16-month-old, New York-based startup that wants to make it easier for large companies to procure networking infrastructure like internet and SD-WAN.</p>
<p>Ludlow has also had numerous exits. Among the most notable, it was an early investor in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/honey-science" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="honey-science">Honey, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the LA-based coupon finder that PayPal agreed to buy for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">$4 billion in late 2019. </a>The firm also nabbed stakes in Flywheel, an Omaha-based WordPress hosting and management company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/wordpress-management-site-wp-engine-acquires-flywheel-as-it-moves-to-a-1b-valuation-and-ipo/">sold to WordPress in 2019</a> for $150 million; Gather, an Atlanta-based event management software startup acquired by Vista Equity Partners for a reported <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/09/05/event-management-software-startup-gather-gets.html">$55 million</a>; and San Francisco-based Product Hunt, which sold to AngelList for a reported $20 million in 2016.</p>
<p>Like all firms, Ludlow has had its write-downs. Navdy, for example, maker of a heads-up automotive display, went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/navdy-contacts-would-be-creditors-prepares-to-liquidate/">out of business</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>Still, in addition to its newest bets, it holds stakes in a variety of fast-growing startups. Among these is the nearly six-year-old Boston-based online notary platform <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.notarize.com/">Notarize</a>, which has now raised more than $80 million from investors and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/08/notarize-raises-35-million-amid-digital-legal-service-boom/">said last summer </a>it had seen dramatic growth owing to the pandemic and the shift to remote work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an early investor in the L.A.-based e-sports and lifestyle brand <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves</a>, which announced a $35 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/esports-org-100-thieves-raises-35-million-in-series-b/">Series B round in late 2019</a> at a $160 million post-money valuation. (Among its owners is Dan Gilbert, music manager and entrepreneur Scooter Braun and Drake.)</p>
<p>In 2018, Triest also appears to have worked a check into the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/detroit-based-stockx-secures-44m-in-series-b-funding-co-led-by-gv-formerly-google-ventures-and-battery-ventures-300712092.html">Series B round </a>of Detroit-based resale marketplace StockX, a company that was last month assigned a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">$2.8 billion </a>valuation by its newest investors.</p>

<p>Along with Triest, Ludlow is run by partner Brett deMarrais, who joined the firm in 2012, and a third investor, Blake Robbins, who joined the firm in 2016 as an associate. He was promoted to partner in 2019.</p>
<p>The firm closed its third fund, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/ludlow-ventures-raises-45m-for-third-fund/">$45 million vehicle</a>, in 2019. Its second fund, announced in 2017, also closed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/ludlow-ventures-targets-40-million-for-second-fund/">$45 million</a>. Ludlow&#8217;s debut fund closed in 2014 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/detroit-hustle-in-silicon-valley">$15.5 million</a>.</p>

<p>Volterra founder and CEO Ankur Singla, <a href="https://volterra.io/resources/blog/volterras-next-chapter-joining-f5-for-edge-2">writing in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal, says the need for this solution only accelerated during 2020 when companies were shifting rapidly to the cloud due to the pandemic. &#8220;When we started Volterra, multi-cloud and edge were still buzzwords and venture funding was still searching for tangible use cases. Fast forward three years and COVID-19 has dramatically changed the landscape — it has accelerated digitization of physical experiences and moved more of our day-to-day activities online. This is causing massive spikes in global Internet traffic while creating new attack vectors that impact the security and availability of our increasing set of daily apps,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>He sees Volterra&#8217;s capabilities fitting in well with the F5 family of products to help solve these issues. While F5 had a quiet 2020 on the M&amp;A front, today&#8217;s purchase comes on top of a couple of major acquisitions in 2019, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/f5-acquires-shape-security-for-1b/">Shape Security for $1 billion</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/f5-acquires-nginx-for-670m-to-move-into-open-source-multi-cloud-services/">NGINX for $670 million</a>.</p>
<p>The deal has been approved by both companies&#8217; boards, and is expected to close before the end of March, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic today announced the acquisition of Rad Game Tools, maker of game development tools for many years. They&#8217;ve stayed largely behind the scenes, but many gamers will recognize the colorful Bink Video logo, which has appeared in the openings of many a title over the years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work with Epic goes back decades, and joining forces is a natural next step given our alignment on products, mission, and culture,&#8221; Rad Game Tools founder and CEO Jeff Roberts said in the announcement. And it has seemingly only intensified recently.</p>
<p>Close integration with engines and platforms makes for good standards, and good standards get embraced by developers. That&#8217;s why Epic has been cozying up to Sony as well as snapping up components to fit into its Unreal engine, positioning it as an all-encompassing development platform for next-generation games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2093575" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093575" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2093575" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bink-video.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093575" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RAD Game Tools</p></div></p>
<p>Rad (styled RAD) has been in games for a long time, <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/default.htm">as its decidedly old-school website attests</a>. Bink is a video codec for games that focuses on high compression and speedy rendering, both important in the gaming world. Oodle, Telemetry, Granny 3D and Miles Sound System are all development tools beyond what the lay person would understand, but no doubt have many fans.</p>
<p>Epic may be known now as the creator of money-printing machine Fortnite, but the company has been around for decades and probably knows the Rad team well. That may help explain the friendly terms under which the acquisition will take place.</p>
<p>&#8220;RAD will continue supporting their game industry, film, and television partners, with their sales and business development team maintaining and selling licenses for their products to companies across industries &#8211; including those that do not utilize <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unreal-engine" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unreal-engine">Unreal Engine,&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Epic said in its announcement.</p>
<p>So while Bink and the rest will continue to be available for anyone to use outside Epic&#8217;s domain, they will almost certainly be better integrated with the Unreal ecosystem. As game development cost and complexity rises, means of simplification are often taken advantage of. Epic is working hard to make Unreal not just the most graphically powerful engine for development, but also the most unified.</p>
<p>A request for comment and further details on the deal sent to Rad Game Tools was intercepted by Epic and declined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like many startups, Atlanta-based <a href="https://www.voxie.com/">Voxie</a> was created to solve a problem that founder and CEO Bogdan Constantin faced himself.</p>
<p>In Constantin&#8217;s case, this was at his previous tuxedo rental startup Menguin (ultimately <a href="https://www.voxie.com/">acquired by </a>Generation Tux), where he said he had to market a product with a six-to-nine month sales cycle, as customers were usually weighing different options for their weddings.</p>
<p>Email marketing, Constantin said, would result &#8220;worse and worse&#8221; open rates over time. So one day, he decided to just try texting everyone who signed up, introducing himself as &#8220;your personal stylist here at Menguin.&#8221; Not surprisingly, he got a lot more responses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The challenge, of course, is having those kinds of text conversations across a large customer base. And that&#8217;s why <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/voxie" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="voxie">Voxie <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> — which is announcing that it has raised $6.7 million in Series A funding — offers tools to help businesses automate and manage that process.</p>
<p>Constantin claimed that compared to other text marketing tools, messages sent via Voxie feel like a real, personalized conversation — even though 80% to 90% are actually automated, with the rest of the messages written by people. Plus, Voxie will allow businesses to send their messages from a normal 10-digit phone number (rather than the more common five-digit numbers used for marketing).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093588" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093588" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093588" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Voxie" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Voxie</p></div></p>
<p>Voxie was initially built for large enterprise customers, but Constantin said that during the pandemic, the company built a lower-cost version that is now being used by &#8220;a lot of retail, restaurant franchise brands, main street brands that are struggling right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;We&#8217;re working with brands that have hundreds of locations all over the country that needed a better way to engage their customers — to ask their names, ask how many kids they have and store that information at the individual profile level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current Voxie customers include LG, Danone, Massage Heights and Buff City Soap.</p>
<p>The funding, meanwhile, was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/noro-moseley-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="noro-moseley-partners">Noro-Moseley Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Circadian Ventures and Engage Ventures, as well as Atlanta entrepreneurs Wain Kellum, Andy Powell, David Cummings and Fred Castellucci.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voxie leads the market as the only platform that allows brands to have personalized conversations with customers at scale, which we believe will be key for its target customers to succeed in a post-COVID world,” said Noro-Moseley&#8217;s John Ale in a statement. “Businesses love Voxie as they see meaningful revenue uplift quickly and the personalization of the content means customers find the messages useful and highly relevant to their needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, Constantin said the company will launch &#8220;reply to buy&#8221; functionality, allowing customers to place orders directly from their text conversations. And while Voxie is currently focused on SMS messaging, he claimed its vision is broader: &#8220;We want to deliver the right message at the right time via the right medium.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.madeiramadeira.com.br/">MadeiraMadeira</a>, the Brazilian answer to Wayfair or Ikea, is now worth $1 billion after raising $190 million in late stage financing from investors led by SoftBank&#8217;s Latin American investment fund and the Brazilian public and private investment firm, Dynamo.</p>
<p>An online marketplace specializing in home products, MadeiraMadeira offers roughly 300,000 products so customers can build, furnish, renovate and decorate their homes.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Daniel Scandian, Marcelo Scandian and Robson Privado</span>, the company has seen huge tailwinds come from the shift to online shopping in Brazil as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With stores closed, online shopping in Brazil surged. As Daniel Scandian noted, before the pandemic ecommerce penetration in Brazil was at roughly 7%, that number ballooned to 17% at the height of the pandemic in Brazil and has now stabilized at around 10%.</p>
<p>Combining third party sales with private labeled goods and its own shipping and logistics facilities has meant that MadeiraMadeira can take the best practices from several online retailers and home furnishing stores, Scandian said.</p>
<p>There are more than 10,000 sellers on the MadeiraMadeira platform and roughly 2.5 million stock keeping units. In recent years the company has added showrooms to its mix of retail facilities, where customers can check out merchandise, but complete their orders online.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s the way we can tackle the offline market with a digital mindset,&#8221; Scandian said. </span></p>
<p>Money from the most recent financing will be used to invest in expanding its logistics capabilities with the addition of new warehouse facilities to expand on its existing ten locations. The company also intends to add same day delivery and the expansion of its private label services.</p>
<p>The new capital, likely the last round before a potential public offering, included previous investors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flybridge-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flybridge-capital">Flybridge <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Monashees along with public-focused investment firms Velt, Brasil Capital and Lakewood.</p>
<p>Early investors like Monashees, Kaszek, Fundo Avila, Endeavour Catalyst and angel backers like Niraj Shah, the founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wayfair" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wayfair">Wayfair, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Build.com founder Christian Friedland were instrumental to MadeiraMadeira&#8217;s early success, Scandian said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based in Curitiba, MadeiraMadeira has over 1300 employees, with the majority of them focused on technology, logistics and product development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this new investment, we are raising our commitment to MadeiraMadeira&#8217;s long-term value creation vision as the company consolidates its position as the leader in Latin America&#8217;s home goods market. Since our initial investment, MadeiraMadeira’s management team has delivered everything they&#8217;ve promised, and our faith in them continues to grow,&#8221; said Paulo Passoni, Managing Investment Partner to SoftBank Latin America fund.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">RedHat today announced that it&#8217;s acquiring container security startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stackrox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stackrox">StackRox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>RedHat, which is perhaps best known for its enterprise Linux products has been making the shift to the cloud in recent years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">IBM purchased the company in 2018</a> for a hefty $34 billion and has been leveraging that acquisition as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">a shift to a hybrid cloud strategy</a> under CEO Arvind Krishna.</p>
<p>The acquisition fits nicely with RedHat OpenShift, its container platform, but the company says it will continue to support StackRox usage on other platforms including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. This approach is consistent with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> strategy of supporting multicloud, hybrid environments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/red-hat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="red-hat">Red Hat <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> president and CEO Paul Cormier sees the two companies working together well. &#8220;Red Hat adds StackRox&#8217;s Kubernetes-native capabilities to OpenShift&#8217;s layered security approach, furthering our mission to bring product-ready open innovation to every organization across the open hybrid cloud across IT footprints,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

<p>CEO Kamal Shah, <a href="https://www.stackrox.com/post/2021/01/red-hat-to-acquire-stackrox/">writing in a company blog post</a> announcing the acquisition, explained that the company made a bet a couple of years ago on Kubernetes and it has paid off. &#8220;Over two and half years ago, we made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and pivoted our entire product to be Kubernetes-native. While this seems obvious today; it wasn’t so then. Fast forward to 2020 and Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto operating system for cloud-native applications and hybrid cloud environments,&#8221; Shah wrote.</p>
<p>Shah sees the purchase as a way to expand the company and the road map more quickly using the resources of Red Hat (and IBM), a typical argument from CEOs of smaller acquired companies. But the trick is always finding a way to stay relevant inside such a large organization.</p>
<p>StackRox&#8217;s acquisition is part of some consolidation we have been seeing in the Kubernetes space in general and the security space more specifically. That includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">Palo Alto Networks acquiring competitor TwistLock</a> for $410 million in 2019. Another competitor, Aqua Security, which has raised $130 million, remains independent.</p>
<p>StackRox was founded in 2014 and raised over $65 million, according to Crunchbase data. Investors included Menlo Ventures, Redpoint and Sequoia Capital. The deal is expected to close this quarter subject to normal regulatory scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a new statement issued by former First Lady <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/michelle-obama" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="michelle-obama">Michelle Obama, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> she calls on Silicon Valley specifically to address its role in the violent insurrection attempt by pro-Trump rioters at the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday. Obama&#8217;s statement also calls out the obviously biased treatment that the primarily white pro-Trump fanatics faced by law enforcement relative to that received by mostly peaceful BLM supporters during their lawful demonstrations (as opposed to Wednesday&#8217;s criminal activity), but it includes a specific redress for the tech industry&#8217;s leaders and platform operators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is the time for companies to stop enabling this monstrous behavior — and go even further than they have already by permanently banning this man from their platforms and putting in place policies to prevent their technology from being used by the nation&#8217;s leaders to fuel insurrection,&#8221; Obama wrote in her statement, which she shared on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/michelleobama/"> Facebook</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Like all of you, I’ve been feeling so many emotions since yesterday. I tried to put my thoughts down here: <a href="https://t.co/9xzRvrpk7y">pic.twitter.com/9xzRvrpk7y</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1347284244763127810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The call for action goes beyond what most social platforms have done already. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook has banned Trump</a>, though it describes the term of the suspension as &#8220;indefinite&#8221; and left open the possibility for a restoration of his accounts in as little as two weeks&#8217; time once Joe Biden has officially assumed the presidency. Twitter, meanwhile, initially removed three tweets it found offended its rules by inciting violence and then locked Trump&#8217;s account pending his deletion of the same. Earlier on Thursday, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">confirmed that Trump had removed these and that his account would subsequently be restored</a> 12 hours after their deletion.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/"> Twitch has also disabled Trump&#8217;s channel</a> at least until the end of his term, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify has removed Trump&#8217;s official merchandise stores</a> from its platform.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch disables Trump&#8217;s channel until the end of his term to &#8216;minimize harm&#8217; during transition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/embed/#?secret=ELI2FJCaDs" data-secret="ELI2FJCaDs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>No social platform thus far has permanently banned Trump, so far as TechCrunch is aware, which is what Obama is calling for in her statement. While both Twitter and Facebook have discussed how Trump&#8217;s recent behavior has violated their policies regarding use of their platform, neither have yet provided any detailed information regarding how they&#8217;ll address any potential similar behavior from other world leaders going forward. In other words, we don&#8217;t yet know what would be different (if anything) should another Trump-styled megalomaniac take office and use available social channels in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Obama is hardly the only political figure to call for action from social media platforms around &#8220;sustained misuse of their platforms to sow discord and violence,&#8221; as Senator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-warner-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-warner-3">Mark Warner <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> put it in a <a href="https://twitter.com/tayhatmaker/status/1347227697903140870">statement on Wednesday</a>. Likely once the dust clears from this week&#8217;s events, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, et al. will face renewed scrutiny from lawmakers and public interest groups around any corrective action they&#8217;re taking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years after launching its service linking employer-sponsored insurance plans with surgical centers of excellence, </span><a href="https://www.carrumhealth.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrum Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $40 million in a new round of financing to capitalize on tailwinds propelling its business forward. </span></p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic exposes cracks in the U.S. healthcare system, one of the ways that employers have tried to manage the significant costs of insuring employees is by taking on the management of care themselves.</p>
<p>As they shoulder more of the burden, companies like Carrum, which offer services that manage some of the necessary points of care for businesses, at lower costs, are becoming increasingly attractive targets for investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why Carrum was able to attract investors led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiger-global">Tiger Global Management, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/greatpoint-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="greatpoint-ventures">GreatPoint Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Cross Creek, all firms that joined returning investors Wildcat Venture Partners and SpringRock Ventures in backing the company&#8217;s Series A round.</p>
<p>Carrum said the money will go toward sales and marketing to more customers, adding more services and improving its existing technology stack.</p>
<p>Carrum uses machine learning to collect and analyze data on surgical outcomes and care to identify what it considers to be surgical centers of excellence across the U.S.</p>
<p>The company offers self-insured employers the opportunity to buy services directly from surgical centers for a bundled price. That can mean savings of up to 50% on surgical expenses.</p>
<p>Using Carrum, there are no co-pays, deductibles or co-insurance. Instead, Carrum Health&#8217;s customers pay a fee and in return receive a 30-day warranty on procedures, meaning that the healthcare provider will cover any costs associated with care from botched operations or complications.</p>
<p>Employees have access to a mobile application that gives them access to virtual care before, during and after surgeries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For years, the industry has talked about redesigning healthcare to benefit patients, but the only way to really do that is to tackle the underlying economics of care, a truly difficult task,&#8221; said Sach Jain, CEO and founder of Carrum Health, in a statement. &#8220;Employers now have a modern, technology-driven solution to help patients get better care without financial headache and we’re not stopping at surgery. In 2021 we’ll be expanding our reach and impact with additional services. It’s such an honor to pave the way for a better healthcare future and we’re so excited for what’s to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Carrum Health&#8217;s customers include Quest Diagnostics, US Foods, and other, undisclosed organizations in retail, manufacturing, communications and insurance, the company said.</p>
<p>Centers of excellence on the platform include Johns Hopkins HealthCare, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mayoclinic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mayoclinic">Mayo Clinic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Tenet <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthcare-1c4f" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthcare-1c4f">Healthcare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. Happy 2021, or as our own Danny Crichton aptly names it, December 38, 2020.</p>
<p>Equity crew is back to start the new year in full force, with<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> on the mics and<a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123"> Chris</a> behind the scenes. The reunion led to extreme Dad joke energy from all of us, which helped get through the mountain of tech news that we had in front of us.</p>
<p>In fact, there was so much to talk about that we have a <em>bonus</em> episode coming out Saturday dealing with Roblox and the gaming environment. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>For now, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in today&#8217;s episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remote work space is rushing to cure your Zoom fatigue, or at least give you new ways to handle it. This week, we saw GitHub alumni raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/rewatch-seed/">millions for a video repository tool</a>, and Teamflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">raise more for a virtual platform</a> meant to mimic the serendipity (and productivity) of your currently shuttered office.</li>
<li>WeLink raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/welink-raises-185m-to-deliver-high-bandwidth-wireless-internet-to-the-home-using-5g/">a $185 million Series A round</a> and, while we could have made financial nomenclature jokes, there was much to unpack on the opportunity of 5G and wireless.</li>
<li>Divvy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">locked down $165 million</a>, making itself a unicorn in the process. Consider this one another win for Utah, and a big moment for the company itself, which is working in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">very competitive space</a>.</li>
<li>We also noted a series of new VC funds that closed in the final days of 2020, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/one-way-ventures-a-firm-focused-on-immigrant-founders-closes-second-fund/">One Way</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">USV</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">Learn Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/seattle-based-madrona-raises-320m-for-its-eighth-fund/">Madrona</a>.</li>
<li>Hopin went shoppin&#8217;, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-buys-livestreaming-startup-streamyard-for-250m-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-product-lineup/">picking up StreamYard for a quarter-billion</a> because they thought it was boppin&#8217;. Please forgive our attempt at poetry. Regardless, Hopin spent $250 million for StreamYard, a livestreaming technology platform that it intends to operate independently. The combined company has around $65 million in annual recurring revenue, with the purchased entity bringing $30 million of that on its own. A big deal.</li>
<li>Twitter is also out in the market with a checkbook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">picking up a podcasting app</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-acquihires-creative-agency-ueno-to-help-design-new-products/">design studio</a>.</li>
<li>And on the podcast front, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/amazon-s-purchase-of-wondery-is-a-big-bet-on-podcast-advertising">Amazon is also in the market</a>. This brings up the question, <em>what really is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Prime, anyways?</em></li>
<li>Finally, we had few words on why P&amp;G backing off from buying Billie impacts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">DTC startups everywhere. </a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can tell by our laughs and jokes this week, it is really good to be back. Enjoy the show, and don&#8217;t forget the Saturday extra!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a slate of temporary and permanent bans from a number of the top online platforms, popular video streaming service <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today confirmed that it has disabled the president of the United States&#8217; account. A spokesperson for the site told TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>In light of yesterday’s shocking attack on the Capitol, we have disabled President Trump’s Twitch channel. Given the current extraordinary circumstances and the President&#8217;s incendiary rhetoric, we believe this is a necessary step to protect our community and prevent Twitch from being used to incite further violence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Twitch also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">temporarily suspended</a> the president’s channel in June. At the time, it told TechCrunch, “Hateful conduct is not allowed on Twitch. In line with our policies, President Trump’s channel has been issued a temporary suspension from Twitch for comments made on stream, and the offending content has been removed.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Wednesday, the company removed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/6/22218059/pogchamp-twitch-removed-emote-ryan-gootecks-gutierrez-trump-capitol-hill">the “PogChamp” emote</a> featuring the face of gaming figure Ryan Gutierrez after he expressed support for pro-Trump rioters.</p>
<p>Twitch’s actions follow similar measures taken by Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, which over the course of the last day all placed new restrictions on the president’s account. Facebook also took the unprecedented step of suspending the president’s account for the remainder of his term, which ends on January 20.</p>
<p>The social platforms took action against the president&#8217;s accounts after he incited a group of his supporters in a riot at the Capitol. Trump encouraged a crowd to march toward Congress after a rally Wednesday in which the president again pushed false claims about a &#8220;stolen&#8221; election.</p>
<p>At the Capitol, the crowd swelled and easily overcame barriers put in place by police, flooding into the building and looting lawmakers&#8217; offices, resulting in a number of injuries and four deaths. Lawmakers were inside the building at the time and were forced to evacuate, later reconvening to certify the election results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s the image that&#8217;s been seen around the world. One of hundreds of pro-Trump supporters in the private office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after storming the Capitol and breaching security in protest of the certification of the election results for President-elect Joe Biden. Police were overrun (when they <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/video/police-selfies-protesters-amid-break-220300321.html">weren&#8217;t posing for selfies</a>) and some lawmakers&#8217; offices <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyaJoRiley/status/1347162120203493376">were trashed and looted</a>.</p>
<p>As politicians and their staffs were told to evacuate or shelter in place, one photo of a congressional computer <a href="https://twitter.com/AriCohn/status/1346920070937776132">left unlocked</a> still with an evacuation notice on the screen spread quickly around the internet. At least one computer was stolen from Sen. Jeff Merkley&#8217;s office, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/cybersecurity-202-riot-capitol-is-nightmare-scenario-cybersecurity-professionals/">reports say</a>.</p>

<p>Most lawmakers don&#8217;t have ready access to classified materials, unless it&#8217;s for their work sitting on sensitive committees, such as Judiciary or Intelligence. The classified computers are separate from the rest of the unclassified congressional network and in a designated sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIFs, in locked-down areas of the Capitol building.</p>
<p>&#8220;No indication those [classified systems] were breached,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/MiekeEoyang/status/1347000537208803328">tweeted</a> Mieke Eoyang, a former House Intelligence Committee staffer.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But the breach will likely present a major task for Congress&#8217; IT departments, which will have to figure out what&#8217;s been stolen and what security risks could still pose a threat to the Capitol&#8217;s network. Kimber Dowsett, a former government security architect, said there was no plan in place to respond to a storming of the building.</p>

<p>The threat to Congress&#8217; IT network is probably not as significant as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">the ongoing espionage campaign</a> against U.S. federal networks. But the only saving grace is that so many congressional staffers were working from home during the assault due to the ongoing pandemic, which yesterday reported a daily record of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/07/us-suffers-record-daily-coronavirus-deaths">almost 4,000 people dead</a> from COVID-19 in one day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some consolidation is underway in the world of challenger banking apps. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bbva" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bbva">BBVA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today told users of Simple &#8212; the pioneering mobile and online banking app that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/simple-acquired-for-117m-will-continue-to-operate-separately-under-its-own-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired for $117 million in 2014</a> &#8212; that it is planning to shut down the service, moving accounts to BBVA&#8217;s USA business in the process.</p>
<p>The move is part of an ongoing effort at BBVA &#8212; which had been an active investor and acquirer of startups &#8212; to streamline its business as it works on closing a merger with PNC. The latter bank <a href="https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/topics/acquisition-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> in November last year that it would acquire the U.S. business of BBVA for $11.6 billion.</p>
<p>In a note <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/banksimple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="banksimple">Simple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sent out earlier today to users &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=bbva%20simple&#038;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being shared on Twitter by a number of them</a> &#8212; the bank said that it will be transitioning their accounts to be serviced by BBVA USA, which already housed the accounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;BBVA USA has made the strategic decision to close Simple,&#8221; the note reads. &#8220;There is no immediate impact to your accounts at Simple and nothing you need to do at this time. Since your deposits are already housed at BBVA USA, they will remain in FDIC-insured accounts there, up to the applicable limits. In the future, your Simple account will become exclusively serviced by BBVA USA, but until then you can continue to access your account and your money through the Simple app or online at Simple.com.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users will receive more details in the future about the transition to BBVA, the note continued.</p>
<p>The response from Simple customers has been predictably downbeat.</p>
<p>Users migrated to the service specifically to have a faster and more modern experience compared to what they were getting through previous, incumbent providers. It&#8217;s also a pain to change banking providers and many customers were longtime users.</p>
<p>Even though Simple ultimately ended up getting acquired by one of those incumbents &#8212; BBVA, headquartered in Spain, is one of the largest banks in the world &#8212; it was run <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/simple-acquired-for-117m-will-continue-to-operate-separately-under-its-own-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely independently of its owner</a>, as part of BBVA&#8217;s attempt to bring on more modern services to attract a younger class of users.</p>
<p>We have contacted both BBVA and Simple for further comment, and BBVA&#8217;s statement confirming the shutdown is now at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like the emailed notification is the only announcement of the changes for customers directly; there are no alerts within the bank&#8217;s mobile app, nor any announcements on the Simple website.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many users Simple has currently. It had around 100,000 users when it was acquired back in 2014, and some might say that the startup was ahead of its time.</p>
<p>In the years between Simple launching and now, we&#8217;ve seen an explosion in the number and popularity of so-called neobanks or challenger banks around the world, including Nubank, Chime, Current, N26, Revolut, Monzo and many more, turning what seemed like a radical concept into one that is now fairly commonplace.</p>
<p>Tapping into using a set of APIs to bundle services, and sitting on top of other banks&#8217; infrastructure, neobanks are more fleet of foot and provide more modern interfaces on more modern platforms (such as mobile apps).</p>
<p>Foregoing some of the traditional trappings of banking like visiting physical locations and transacting with tellers, the newer banks have replaced them with algorithms that, for example, help people manage their finances through the month by analyzing their spend and suggesting ways to save money or organize their finances in a better way.</p>
<p>The turn in events for Simple plays into some of the precariousness of using newer &#8220;challenger&#8221; banking services. There is always a risk with smaller services that they might not stick around as solidly as their incumbent counterparts. At least, that is how the thinking goes. Recent years and bigger banking crises have definitely overturned some of those conceptions.</p>
<p>For its part, Simple has not always been perfect. The company has at times turned off certain features &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/online-bank-simple-makes-things-harder-by-removing-bill-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as Bill Pay</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/14/simple-account-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">types of customer accounts</a> &#8212; without warning, leaving users scrambling to replace them with alternatives.</p>
<p>The question will now be whether users decide to stick with BBVA, or turn to exploring another challenger, or migrate to one of the bigger , established names, which keep trying to modernise in the meantime. There are, after all, many options to consider these days.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p>Update: Here is BBVA&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p><em>BBVA USA continually evaluates strategic priorities and resources, including existing and potential partnerships with outside organizations. We have taken the opportunity of the pending merger with PNC to reassess our goals for BBVA USA, so that we’re focused on the things that make the most sense for the company’s future whether on a standalone basis or a potentially combined basis with PNC. As a result, today we’re accelerating some changes and stopping work on others, including the closing of Simple. These reviews are part of our normal processes, and have resulted in other ventures being closed in the past year or so based on performance and the economic environment, including Covault (2020) and Denizen (2019).</em></p>
<p><em>Simple customers already have a dual relationship with BBVA USA and Simple. We will be migrating these customers to the award-winning BBVA USA mobile app. Those same customers will become PNC customers upon the close of acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions. As part of BBVA USA, Simple customers will have access to a much broader suite of products and services, alongside the bank’s award-winning mobile app, which includes BBVA Financial Tools.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This year, Americans grappled with fear of infection, incredible loss of loved ones, financial stress, isolation and fatigue from constant uncertainty to name a few. Even though we are getting closer to returning to normality as vaccines start to roll out, we can’t write COVID-19 off just yet. We are only now beginning to see the long-lasting effects of the pandemic, specifically its dramatic impact on the mental health crisis in the United States and unfortunately, mental illness has no vaccine.</p>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.mhanational.org/issues/mental-health-america-prevalence-data#:~:text=Adult%20Prevalence%20of%20Mental%20Illness,Any%20Mental%20Illness%20(AMI)%202020&amp;text=18.57%25%20of%20adults%20are%20experiencing,a%20severe%20mental%20health%20illness.">45 million</a> American adults live with mental illness, which has only been exacerbated this year as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm">more than two in five U.S. residents</a> reported struggling with mental health issues as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-10-2020-covid-19-disrupting-mental-health-services-in-most-countries-who-survey">World Health Organization</a>, prior to the pandemic, countries around the world were spending less than 2% of national health budgets on mental health, while struggling to meet their populations’ needs. It’s evident that there is not only a lack of focus on mental healthcare, but a lack of access as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’ve seen a recent influx in telemedicine and telehealth services, and provided these solutions are evidence-based and effective, this is the only way for us to scale the widespread demand for support. Put simply, we don’t have enough clinical staff to go around.</p>
<p>When I practiced psychiatry in the U.K.’s National Health Services (NHS), I quickly realized that we were seeing patients too late, sometimes years too late, such that they had far more serious needs than if they had been able to access good quality care earlier. Back then it was clear to me this level of supply-demand gap could only be resolved by deploying technology at scale, and the events of the last year have only reinforced that.</p>
<p>Investors have taken note as well, with many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">mental health startups raising capital</a>. It’s clear that business leaders have begun to prioritize innovation as a way to pull ourselves out of crisis, with a renewed focus on products adapted to a changed world. We’ve already seen a massive uptick in digital mental health solutions with about <a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/legal/technology/psychologists-embrace-telehealth">76% of clinicians</a> solely treating patients via telemedicine. The clearest path for managing mental health at scale will be evidence-based, ethical and personalized digital solutions.</p>
<p>Not only will this influx help those who desire flexible care options, but telehealth has also increased the access to care for people who may have limited options in their local communities.</p>
<p>While increasing in popularity, digital mental health solutions have some important challenges to overcome. For one, they must win consumer trust and prove that they can handle personal data ethically and responsibly. With <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81% of Americans</a> feeling that the risks of sharing personal data outweigh the benefits, providers must show that they can responsibly secure users’ personal health data due to the sensitive nature of the information and ultimately gain that trust.</p>
<p>This must go beyond compliance with HIPAA and, in Europe, GDPR, and require the development and implementation of an ethical framework to underpin a provider’s digital mental health solutions. However, such efforts must be genuine and avoid falling into the trap of &#8220;ethics washing,&#8221; so I encourage providers to have the ethics frameworks audited by external experts and to commit to publishing the results.</p>
<p>Digital solutions must also be able to meet the needs of users on an individualized and personalized basis. Many apps meant to help manage mental health take a one-size-fits-all approach and don’t take enough advantage of the technology’s ability to adapt to peoples’ unique symptoms and personal preferences. This is not simply about offering more than one type of intervention, although that is important, it’s the recognition that people engage in technology in different ways.</p>
<p>For instance, at Koa Health we know that some users love going through a program in a step-by-step fashion, whereas others prefer to dip into activities as they need them, and it’s important that we cater equally well for both of these preferences. Generic approaches simply won’t work well for everyone.</p>
<p>Not only do digital solutions need to be responsible with data and be tailored to users, they must work harder to prove their efficacy. <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mental-health-apps-plentiful-few-provide-clinical-research">Recent research</a> has shown that 64% of mental health apps claimed efficacy yet only 14% included any evidence. The growth in the adoption of technology is encouraging, but positive impact will only result from products designed for efficacy — and able to demonstrate it in high-quality trials. The stronger the evidence base for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the more likely healthcare providers and insurers will be to distribute the solutions.</p>
<p>While vaccines are on their way, the mental health impacts of the pandemic may soon overshadow the direct impacts of the pandemic. While health tech has made promising progress, it’s imperative that digital mental healthcare places a stronger emphasis on effective, ethical and personalized care to avert an even larger mental health crisis.</p>
