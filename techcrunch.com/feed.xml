										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Panic first launched pre-orders of its adorable little retro-inspired handheld gaming device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/playdate/">Playdate</a>, it expected the first 20,000 units to ship by the end of 2021 — just in time, they hoped, for the holidays. That first batch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/panic-sells-20000-playdate-handhelds-in-under-20-minutes/">sold out in under twenty minutes</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, due to last-minute battery component issues, even those first orders have now slipped back to 2022.</p>
<p><strong>In an update email sent to impacted pre-orderers, Panic writes:</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>As our first 5,000 finished Playdate units arrived at our warehouse in California for 2021, we began to test a few of them. We quickly became concerned that some of them weren’t giving us the battery life we expected. Playdate’s battery is designed to last a very long time, and always be ready for you, even if not used for a while. But that was not the case: in fact, we found a number of units with batteries so drained, Playdate wouldn’t power on at all — and couldn’t be charged. That’s a battery worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball, and we halted production at the factory.</p>
<p>The conclusion?</p>
<p>We made the difficult, expensive decision to replace all of our existing batteries with brand new ones, from a totally different battery supplier.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Panic goes on to note that they&#8217;ve received new batteries and they&#8217;re now working as hoped&#8230; but shipping everything back to Malaysia, swapping out the batteries, and getting them back across the ocean is going to take a while.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company also discovered that the CPU it planned to use for all Playdate units shipped in 2022 is now backordered for literal years.</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, we can’t get any more of Playdate’s current CPU for — you’re not going to believe this — two years. Like, 730 days.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve heard about the “global chip shortage” everyone’s talking about? We’re here to say it is very real. Covid-19 caused an ever-cascading set of worldwide supply chain failures that are leading to many, many electronic parts being simply… gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>To work around this, the company has redesigned Playdate&#8217;s boards to support a different CPU — one they say is more readily available, but that they don&#8217;t expect to impact the way the handheld works in anyway that the user might notice.</p>
<p>The company says that although units 1 through 20,000 have slipped into 2022, they don&#8217;t currently expect orders placed thus far to slip into 2023.</p>
<p>As always, hardware is hard. Add a pandemic to the mix, and, well&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter will <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer automatically</a> crop image previews on the web after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-image-cropping-changes/">rolling out</a> full-size image previews on mobile earlier this year. On Twitter for the web, images will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline, images will look just like they did when you shot them.</p>
<p>In the past, the platform automatically cropped images to make them display in a more condensed way in the timeline, where users often scroll through without clicking on an image preview. The social media giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">tested the change</a> in March with a small subset of iOS and Android users, saying it wanted to give people an accurate preview of what an image will look like.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is now available on web!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Pic looking good in the Tweet composer? That’s how it will look on the timeline.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The tweet composer will now show anyone sharing an image a preview of what it will look like before it goes live in the timeline, resolving past concerns that Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/">algorithmic cropping</a> was biased toward highlighting white faces. The automatic image cropping was also a hassle for photographers and artists, who generally prefer to have total control over how an image is displayed.</p>
<p>Although images will now likely take up more vertical space in users’ timelines on the web, it’s less of a hassle than having to manually click through images to be able to see them in their entirety.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest change comes as Twitter has been tweaking its platform and making its services more accessible. The social media giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/"> recently rolled</a> out the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. It also launched its premium subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a>, in the U.S. and New Zealand on Monday, following its initial rollout in Canada and Australia earlier this year.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-doherty-830625123/">Marcus Doherty, Ph.D.,</a> is a co-founder and chief scientist at <a href="https://quantumbrilliance.com/">Quantum Brilliance</a>. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As the quantum computing industry continues to push forward, so do the goal posts.</p>
<p>A long-sought objective was to attain quantum “supremacy” &#8212; demonstrating that a quantum computer could solve a calculation that no traditional computer on Earth could do — without requiring a practical benefit.</p>
<p>Google claimed to reach that goal with its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03213-z">landmark scientific paper</a> in 2019, but IBM notably expressed skepticism. In any case, it was an exercise in computer science that was not of any practical relevance in the real world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since the Google announcement, the industry intensified its efforts in attaining quantum “advantage,” which is defined as achieving a business or scientific advantage by exceeding the computing capacity of the largest supercomputers in a relevant application.</p>
<p>As a reference point for comparison and benchmarking, it was certainly more useful than quantum supremacy. Quantum advantage is often connected to achieving major breakthroughs in drug discovery, financial trading or battery development.</p>
<p>However, quantum advantage ignores one important point: Should we really wait around for million-qubit quantum steampunk golden chandeliers to outperform supercomputers before we consider quantum computers meaningful? Or should we focus on measuring performance improvements in comparison to the units of hardware we use in today’s classical computers, e.g., individual CPUs (central processing units), GPUs (graphics processing units) and FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays)?</p>
<p>Because what may be a more valuable goal for this still-nascent industry is achieving quantum “utility,” or usefulness, as soon as possible. Quantum utility is defined as a quantum system outperforming classical processors of comparable size, weight and power in similar environments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Accelerating commercialization</h2>
<p>Those who have examined quantum computing in any depth know the massive impact it will have on IT, business, the economy and society. A future of quantum supercomputing mainframes with exponential speedup, error-corrected qubits and quantum internet will be a very different world than the one we live in today.</p>
<p>That said, similar to the classical mainframes of the 1960s, quantum mainframes will likely remain large and fragile machines for the foreseeable future, requiring ultra-low temperatures and complex control systems to operate. Even when fully operational, there will only be a few quantum mainframes located at supercomputing and cloud-computing facilities around the world.</p>
<p>The quantum computing industry would be better off emulating the success of classical computers. When personal computers arrived in the late 1970s and early ’80s, IBM and others were able to market new models every year that offered incremental improvements over the previous models. This market dynamic is what drove Moore’s law.</p>
<p>Quantum computing needs a similar market dynamic to scale and thrive. Investors can’t be expected to keep handing out money waiting for quantum computers to outperform the few supercomputers. An annual release of new, improved and ever more “useful” quantum computers will provide the revenue assurance that will drive the long-term investment required to achieve the technology’s full potential.</p>
<p>With a never-ending supply of useful quantum systems for a variety of applications, there is no reason to wait in line to process a calculation on one of the few massive quantum mainframes available in the cloud when you can have a quantum processor right next to you, integrated with your existing classical systems. Your application may require a calculation instantaneously that &#8220;quantum in the cloud&#8221; can’t deliver in time, or you may have to rely upon on-premise or on-board compute if there is no cloud access possible.</p>
<p>Extending the idea of quantum utility, you can imagine the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal and image processing in autonomous and intelligent technologies at the network edge in robots, driverless vehicles and satellites.</li>
<li>Industry 4.0 end-point applications such as digital twins in manufacturing facilities.</li>
<li>Distributed network applications such as battlefield situations in defense.</li>
<li>Classical computing accessories, providing a boost as needed for laptops and other common devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Room-temperature quantum computing in small form factors will be required to achieve these quantum “accelerator” applications in the next few years. There are several approaches being undertaken, but the most promising is using so-called nitrogen vacancies in diamonds to make qubits.</p>
<h2>Enabling technologies</h2>
<p>Room-temperature diamond quantum computing works by leveraging an array of processor nodes each composed of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, or defects in the ultra-pure diamond lattice, as well as a cluster of nuclear spins. The nuclear spins act as the qubits of the computer, while the NV centers act as quantum buses that mediate the operations between the qubits and their input/output.</p>
<p>The primary reason why diamond quantum computers can work at room temperature is because the ultra-hard diamond serves as a kind of quantum mechanical dead space where qubits go to survive for a few hundred microseconds.</p>
<p>Quantum scientists from the University of Stuttgart in Germany pioneered many diamond quantum computing achievements in algorithms, simulations, error correction and high-fidelity operations. However, they hit a roadblock when they tried to scale systems beyond a handful of qubits because of challenges with qubit fabrication yield and precision.</p>
<p>Since then, Australian quantum scientists have found a way to address scaling issues, as well as the miniaturization and integration of the electrical, optical and magnetic control systems of diamond quantum computers. Their work will enable the scaling up of qubit numbers while simultaneously scaling down the size, weight and power of diamond quantum systems.</p>
<p>The scientists further demonstrated that compact and robust quantum accelerators were possible for mobile applications in robotics, autonomous systems and satellites, as well as massively parallelized applications for simulating molecular dynamics in drug design, chemical synthesis, energy storage and nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Because of diamond-based computing’s unique benefits, there is currently a global research effort underway involving leading academic institutions such as the University of Cambridge and Harvard University. The Australian National University’s diamond-based quantum computing research has moved into an initial commercialization phase.</p>
<p>Other types of quantum computing technology operating at room temperatures in relatively small form factors are advancing as well, including trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum computers. However, these come with requirements of either vacuum systems and/or precision laser systems. One quantum computing startup has successfully developed a trapped-ion system that fits in two server racks. However, it’s uncertain whether these types of systems can be miniaturized even further.</p>
<h2>Recalibrating assumptions</h2>
<p>For the industry to achieve the vision of quantum accelerators that deliver quantum utility, the technology must be compatible with scalable semiconductor manufacturing processes, where the qubits are formed and integrated with control systems that are robust, low-maintenance and have a lengthy operational lifespan. As classical computers showed us, the best way to do this is to miniaturize and develop integrated quantum chips.</p>
<p>Similar to the first transistors at the dawn of ubiquitous classical computing in the 1960s, the key technical challenge to achieving widespread quantum utility will be in the fabrication of integrated quantum chips. However, like classical computing, once this fabrication is performed, the devices can be simple to use and deploy.</p>
<p>While early useful quantum systems have considerably fewer qubits than quantum mainframes, they may become a focal point of the industry and prospective markets once the first integrated chips are manufactured.</p>
<p>The downstream implications are almost unimaginable — there may not be an area where a room-temperature quantum system <em>won’t</em> make a fundamental change in how we solve problems. There is a clear message to all the product designers, software developers, market forecasters and social observers here as well: The time to get your head around quantum computing is now.</p>
<p>In the near term, useful quantum computers will massively disrupt supply chains, even entire value chains. Preparing for that impact implies understanding not only the technology, but also its economic impact. And of course, there are incredible investment opportunities in a technology moving this fast as well.</p>
<p>Quantum utility also means the future of quantum can be heterogeneous &#8212; accelerators can exist alongside mainframes and be deployed for different reasons and applications. It will encourage a groundswell of cooperation as opposed to direct competition &#8212; and accelerate innovation and adoption in the quantum industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dubuy.com/">Dubuy</a>, an e-commerce platform by UAE global logistics provider DP World, has entered Kenya with plans to launch the business-to-business (B2B) site in more countries across the continent in the coming months. This marks Dubuy&#8217;s third market in East Africa, coming months after setting up in Rwanda and unveiling plans to enter <a href="https://www.dpworld.com/news/releases/dp-world-launches-e-commerce-platform-and-opens-a-new-digital-trade-corridor-for-ethiopia/">Ethiopia</a>.</p>
<p>The wholesale <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/consumables-dominate-jumias-sales-as-buyer-habits-change/">e-commerce</a> platform, owned by the government of Dubai, launched earlier this year to help businesses buy and sell goods. Purchased goods are fulfilled through the supply chain of DP World and its logistics partners.</p>
<p>The e-commerce site is set to leverage DP World’s ports (currently eight, with three more under development) and logistics network in Africa to enter new markets in the continent. DP World’s hubs in Africa are spread across Rwanda, Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Senegal, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Djibouti and Somaliland, meaning that they will likely inform its regional expansion plans. Dubuy plans to cover all of Africa by 2025.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232836" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“With the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) now in effect, the eyes of the world will be on the continent,” Mahmood Al Bastaki, CEO of Dubai Trade World and DP World, said.</p>
<p>“African businesses are increasingly using digital channels and technologies to engage with suppliers and distributors to create agile supply chains, and digital platforms like Dubuy.com will be key to this shift. Our technology allows homegrown businesses to transform into international enterprises by providing access to new markets in Africa, the Middle East and the rest of the world,” he said.</p>
<p>The site has 4,000 active merchants and so far has received 500,000 visits from sellers and buyers in Africa, they said. Automotive supplies and kitchen appliances are most in demand. Owing to working closely with governments, traders using Dubuy are said to benefit from heavily discounted shipping tariffs, and in Kenya, the platform has an arrangement with the National Bank of Kenya for trade finance.</p>
<p>Online marketplaces have increasingly become important avenues of growth for small and medium businesses in Africa, yet the continent accounts for a small share of global e-commerce due to a number of factors, including internet connection and cost of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1190579/number-of-online-shoppers-in-africa/">only about 25%</a> of Africa’s 1.2 billion population are e-commerce users, but this is set to grow steadily as the cost of internet dips and connectivity deepens. About 28% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is connected to mobile internet, but this is expected to grow to about 40% by 2025, according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>.</p>
<p>Kenya is ranked among the top 100 fastest growing e-commerce economies in the world, according to the <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tn_unctad_ict4d17_en.pdf">2020 UNCTAD B2C Commerce Index</a>. About 72.9% of the population uses mobile money account, while 26.1% are active e-shoppers and pay bills online, making the country ripe for e-commerce.</p>
<p>Across Africa, Jumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform, leading hundreds of other B2C sites, including Chinese-owned Kilimall, Nigeria’s Marketplace Africa and South Africa’s bidorbuy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When we last checked in with </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.onlyalt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alt</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> back in March, it had </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/">just raised $31 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for its alternative asset platform — a platform, thus far, used primarily by those looking to research, trade and securely store high-value sports cards.</span></p>
<p>Just a few months later, the company has raised a $75 million Series B from a roster of top investors and pro athletes, made big hires and is prepping to launch its mobile app, all while it starts to expand the scope of the alternative assets it covers.</p>
<p>While Alt&#8217;s initial focus was sports cards — a category that founder Leore Avidar knows quite well — it has recently expanded to support other types of trading cards. Poke around its exchange and you&#8217;ll already find first edition Charizards and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards in the mix with rare Kobe and autographed Kaepernick cards. In time, they&#8217;re looking to expand beyond cards and into other alternative assets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to be in things from sneakers, to watches, to NFTs,&#8221; Avidar tells me, referring to sports cards as their &#8220;proof point.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RrPaGeThz4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/">Sports trading card platform Alt launches with $31 million in funding and plenty of market hype</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sports trading card platform Alt launches with $31 million in funding and plenty of market hype&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/embed/#?secret=RrPaGeThz4" data-secret="RrPaGeThz4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To sell a card on Alt, its condition must first be judged by one of the already well-established grading groups (PSA, BGS or SGC) then sent to Alt&#8217;s &#8220;Vault&#8221; — a light-controlled, temperature-controlled, fire-protected facility that the company casually refers to as &#8220;the Fort Knox of cards.&#8221; Once there, ownership can be instantly transferred from buyer to buyer (with Alt taking a 1.5% cut on each sale). By default, purchased cards stay in the vault; owners are free to have their cards pulled from the vault and shipped to them, but Avidar tells me that &#8220;99%&#8221; of cards stay in the vault after a transaction. They&#8217;re mostly buying these cards as investments, not to put on display. I&#8217;m also told that Alt users have stored over $70 million worth of cards in the vault so far.</p>
<p>Alt shares much of the data it has on cards; its <a href="https://app.onlyalt.com/market-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market trends</a> page charts out which categories have proven most popular in recent weeks, and highlights the players whose cards have seen the biggest shifts in value over the last seven days. Individual listings show the prices a given card has sold for over the last year and offer up an &#8220;Alt value&#8221; — a Zestimate-style worth estimate based on all of the recent transaction data Alt has access to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alt&#8217;s team is growing pretty quickly, with Avidar noting that the company currently sits at around 60 employees. Notably, it recently hired Nicole Colombo, previously eBay&#8217;s GM of collectibles and trading cards, as <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/blog/alt-welcomes-nicole-colombo-as-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its first president</a>.</p>
<p>Next up on the company&#8217;s roadmap? Launching its mobile app. After spending its life thus far in the browser, Alt says its iOS and Android apps should launch later this month. That&#8217;s pictured up top, but here&#8217;s another picture of what it&#8217;ll look like:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232894" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232894" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232894" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg 1554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg?resize=1536,940 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alt-mobile-3.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232894" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alt</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is quietly exploring a new source of revenue: loaning users money, with loans backed by the cards said user has stored with Alt. Avidar points out that banks generally won&#8217;t consider things like sports card collections as &#8220;real collateral&#8221;; Alt, meanwhile, has a pretty deep understanding of just how much any given card is worth from day to day — and, as the cards are in Alt&#8217;s vault, they can assume said cards aren&#8217;t going to just disappear or suddenly get damaged. Calling the program &#8220;<a href="https://support.onlyalt.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404829217943-Does-Alt-give-loans-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alt Lending</a>&#8220;, the team notes that it&#8217;s currently in beta and only open to select users for now.</p>
<p>The company tells me this round was raised at a valuation of &#8220;over $325 million.&#8221; The round was led by Spearhead (a new type of fund co-created by Jeff Fagnan and Naval Ravikant. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/spearhead-is-transforming-founders-into-angel-investors/">profiled Spearhead here</a>), and backed by Seven Seven Six, Vibe Capital, Breyer Capital, Shrug Capital, Apollo Projects (Max and Sam Altman&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/max-and-sam-altmans-apollo-projects-shifts-course-broadens-focus-11627297201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firm</a>, not our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">new corporate overlords</a> of a similar name), Hyperguap, A* and a number of individual investors — including a few huge names in sports, like Tom Brady, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Alex Morgan, Candace Parker and Marlon Humphrey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once I was recovered from the initial surrealism of Amazon launching its own home robot, I immediately thought about iRobot. The company cornered the home robotics market a decade ago, and while there are now countless robot vacuums, they’re all more or less riffs on the Roomba.</p>
<p>The issue with having a big hit is the same across industries and mediums &#8212; which is to say, everyone immediately starts asking what’s next. Subsequent attempts at home robots have failed to capture that lightning in a bottle &#8212; remember the pool cleaning Mirra and gutter clearing Looj? The mopping Scooba line appeared to be a moderate success, though the company ultimately shelved it in favor of the Braava brand it acquired in 2012.</p>
<p>The MIA Terra aside, the company has instead opted to focus on Roomba and the role it can play in unlocking the smart home. It’s something iRobot has talked about a lot over the past several years, with mapping and connected third-party AIs like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa playing a key role.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232318" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2191371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2191371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p><em>Don’t forget to sign up to get the upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">free newsletter version</a> of Actuator delivered to your inbox.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Amazon is a competitor of sorts. While Astro doesn’t vacuum (not yet, at least), the robot does appear focused on a number of smart home features iRobot is no doubt hoping to address with the Roomba going forward. Ultimately, <a href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-advances-voice-intelligence-home-robots-amazon-alexa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon is attempting to address</a> the longstanding question of whether users are interested in a kind of jack-of-all-trades home robot, versus, say, a robotic vacuum with additional benefits.</p>
<p>But while the two may ultimately be competitors, short term, iRobot announced that it is continuing to be committed to its Amazon partnership. Says CEO Colin Angle:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Smart home products often fail to live up to consumer expectations because they require complex programming for basic functionality and lack the ability to truly interact with them. We believe robots should be thoughtful and responsive, and clean according to the user&#8217;s unique preferences. The combination of advanced navigation, object identification and advanced voice-enabled technologies lets people interact with them in a more natural way, gaining greater control of their smart home. We&#8217;re excited to unlock even more intuitive cleaning and smart home experiences by working with Amazon to integrate cutting-edge voice capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Couple of cool research projects I had a chance to highlight this week. Both are still pretty early days. First is this one from MIT CSAIL, which asks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/teaching-robots-to-socialize/">how robots will interact with humans</a> as they become an increasingly active part of society.</p>
<p>“Robots will live in our world soon enough and they really need to learn how to communicate with us on human terms,” says researcher Boris Katz. “They need to understand when it is time for them to help and when it is time for them to see what they can do to prevent something from happening.”</p>

The system uses ultrasound to move the tiny appendages, creating vortexes in the fluid that propel the tiny robots forward and backward in straight lines.</p>

<p>On the medical tip, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/medical-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA unveiled Clara Holoscan</a> at this week’s GTC Keynote. The computing platform marks part of a big push into healthcare for the chip maker. It writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>NVIDIA Clara Holoscan is the AI computing platform for medical devices that combines hardware systems for low-latency sensor and network connectivity, optimized libraries for data processing and AI, and core microservices to run streaming, imaging, and other applications, from embedded to edge to cloud.</p></blockquote>
<p>The platform is a bid, in part, to play a role in the burgeoning world of surgical and other medical device robotics.</p>

<p>Another week, another big round for robotic delivery. Here’s a $125 million oversubscribed Series B for Kodiak Robotics, which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">as Kirsten notes</a> is “one of the last privately held autonomous truck outfits in Silicon Valley.” This latest round brings Kodiak’s total to $165 million &#8212; a nice haul since its 2018 founding.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Don Burnette told TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">We need to scale and with scale comes growth across the entire company — more drivers, more operations folks, more engineers. R&amp;D is definitely the primary utilization of the funds. Scaling the fleet is also a really big one, obviously, as you watch the space you see that there’s an ever growing interest in commercial traction and customers and partners and miles driven and the size of the autonomous freight network. So we’re going to be expanding all of those efforts and that all costs money.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, it’s way to early to be thinking about CES. Frankly, I’d prefer to really get the gears spinning about halfway through the plane ride to Vegas. But like Christmas, the tradeshow seemingly arrives earlier every year. This year, I was asked to be a judge for the annual CES Innovation Awards, and the honorees just dropped.</p>
<p>There are an handful of robotics companies on there worth noting. Of course, these things tend to be more consumer-focused (it’s the “C” in CES), which can be a tricky prospect. More often than not, robots targeted at consumers amount to little more than expensive toys.</p>
<p>With than in mind, here are some of the more notable choices in robotics,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://avular.com/essentials/">Avlar Essentials</a> are modular building blocks for testing robotic applications and developing prototypes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.doosanrobotics.com/">Doosan’s Project NINA</a> (that’s New Inspiration. New Angle.) is a system designed to “democratize filming robots.” Specifically, filmmakers can them out to create complex shots that can be controlled remotely</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hroboticsinc.com/product">H Robotics’s rebless</a> is a physical therapy system to help users rehab arms and legs</li>
<li><a href="https://blk2021.com/">Leica introduced the BLK ARC</a>, a laser scanning model that can be mounted to robots like Boston Dynamics’ spot to build mobile 3D scans</li>
<li><a href="https://www.monarchtractor.com/">Monarch</a> introduced an autonomous electric tractor</li>
<li><a href="https://www.naio-technologies.com/en/ted/">Ted</a> is a weeding robot designed specifically for use in vineyards.</li>
<li>John Deere, as we’ve noted previously, is<a href="https://www.deere.com/en/our-company/news-and-announcements/news-releases/2021/agriculture/2021mar02-john-deere-launches-see-and-spray-select/"> going pretty big on robotics</a>, including the See &amp; Spray, which targets and sprays weeds, using AI</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery platform Instacart is testing a new delivery option, which will reduce or waive the delivery fee on orders placed more than 24 hours ahead of the scheduled delivery. The new delivery option is being tested in select markets, but Instacart didn’t specify which ones when asked. The company says this new delivery option is for customers who want to plan ahead while saving on their orders.</p>
<p>The company has also rolled out additional features aimed at making shopping more affordable, including a new &#8220;Deals Tab.&#8221; The new tab will include daily coupons from retailers and companies. Users can visit the tab to browse sales in their area and save on weekly staples, bulk products or special occasion items such as birthday cakes.</p>
<p>In addition to the new Deals Tab, Instacart is also introducing a new &#8220;Dollar Store Hub&#8221; to allow users to browse dollar store deals from more than 13,000 dollar stores, including Dollar Tree, 99 Cents Only Store, Five Below and Family Dollar.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232223" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is also rolling out additional savings for its Express membership, which offers unlimited free deliveries on orders of at least $35, among other things, for $9.99 per month. Over the next few months, Express members will get 5% credit back on eligible Pickup orders, usable on future orders. Instacart has expanded Pickup to over 4,500 stores across 120 grocery partners, including ALDI, Food Lion, Gelson’s, Publix, Price Chopper, Schnucks, Shop ’n Save, Sprouts, The Fresh Market and Wegmans.</p>
<p>“Online grocery shouldn’t be a luxury, and we’re committed to making Instacart the most affordable way for families across North America to get the food they need from the retailers they love,” said Asha Sharma, Instacart’s chief operating officer, in a statement.</p>
<p>The launch of the new features follows Instacart&#8217;s recent acquisitions last month. Instacart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">acquired Caper AI</a>, a smart cart and instant checkout startup for $350 million. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/">acquired FoodStorm</a>, a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering for grocery retailers, for an undisclosed amount. The acquisitions signal the company&#8217;s plans to venture deeper into retail technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Group chief executive Rajeev Misra said the fund has invested $3 billion in Indian companies this year and can invest $5 billion to $10 billion next year, the latest aggressive play by a top investment firm in the South Asian nation, where young firms have raised over a record $20 billion this year.</p>
<p>“If we find the right companies, we could invest $5 billion to $10 billion in 2022,” said Misra at a virtual conference on Thursday, adding the caveat that SoftBank will explore such opportunities “at the right valuations.”</p>
<p>Misra said the firm has slowed the pace of investment in China, but will continue to stay in it as the Asian economy is a major center of AI in the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Scores of global investors deployed tens of billions of dollars in India in the past decade as they searched for early winners in the world’s second-most populous nation. The dealflow activities have surged significantly this year as Tiger Global, SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital and Sequoia Capital India have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">aggressively chased deals</a> and backed firms at record valuation jumps.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, in particular, has backed over two dozen startups, many still in early stages of their journeys, in India this year. The firm reportedly told shareholders earlier this year that India was one of the top priorities with its new fund.</p>
<p>India has also been a major focus for SoftBank in the past several years. Misra said there&#8217;s been an &#8220;amazing turnaround&#8221; in India, where once it was difficult to justify investments.</p>
<p>The Japanese conglomerate has helped shape many young Indian startups. Some of its investments include payments firm Paytm and budget hotel chain Oyo, both of which have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/paytm-raises-1-1-billion-from-anchor-investors-in-indias-blockbuster-ipo/">filed for initial public offerings</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also a backer of Flipkart, which sold a majority stake to Walmart in 2018. SoftBank, which had exited the firm during the acquisition, has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">deployed more capital in Flipkart.</a> Ola, the ride-hailing giant in India that is also backed by SoftBank, is also planning to explore the public markets next year. &#8220;There’s a lot of pent-up demand for tech IPOs,&#8221; Misra said.</p>
<p>SoftBank is looking to invest in more startups this year, he said. Misra identified fintech as one of the major thematic focuses that SoftBank is exploring in India. He said in the virtual conference, held by Bloomberg, that innovation in the financial inclusion space is a key to India’s goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than six months after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fresh-out-of-yc-houm-raises-8m-to-improve-the-home-rental-and-sales-market-in-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $8 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in seed funding, Chilean proptech startup Houm has raised $35 million in a Series A round led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Goodwater Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall also participated in the financing, along with existing backers OneVC, Elad Gil, Liu Jang and new investors Fen Ventures, Broadhaven and Rahul Mehta, managing partner at DST Global. With the latest round, Houm has raised a total of $45 million since its inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago-based <a href="http://www.houm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houm</a> plans to use the new capital mostly to expand to 15 new cities across Mexico, Colombia and Chile &#8212; the three countries in which it currently operates &#8212; as well as to triple its current headcount of 350.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231813" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup had used its seed capital to expand and consolidate in Bogota, Colombia, and Mexico City. (It began operations in Bogota in mid-2020 and in Mexico City in January 2021.) Houm has seen its revenue grow by over 11x in the last year, a metric that exceeded its own expectations, although it did not reveal hard revenue figures. The company is not yet profitable as it is currently focused on growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houm offers an online service that helps homeowners rent and sell properties “up to 10 times faster,” it claims, than traditional methods. Rather than using realtors, it relies on “Houmers,” self-employed professionals who prepare properties for sale or lease, and then manage them. Houmers make money each time a home they worked on is sold or rented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Benjamin Labra, who co-founded the startup with COO Nicolás Knockaert, said Houm’s ultimate goal is to “become the leading digital brokerage” in Latin America and give people an affordable alternative to leasing, selling and managing properties online. Its model is similar to that of Brazilian unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/quintoandar/">QuintoAndar</a>, which has also raised significant capital this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ninety-five percent of our properties are leased in 30 days or less, and our freelance force, the Houmers, allow us to show properties every six minutes every day,” Labra said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houm offers services to both landlords and tenants. When a property owner decides to put his or property up for rent or sale, Houm commissions a Houmer to take professional photographs and videos, at no cost to the proprietor. The Houmers also inspect the house or apartment so that prospective clients can feel more secure in their decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The properties are then published on real estate online marketplaces within 24 hours. Houm also invests in digital marketing, in an effort to provide greater visibility and access to customers. Once the property is published, Houm provides tours to prospective renters of buyers, either virtually or in person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also developed an AI algorithm called ReV, which allows clients and owners to instantly know the optimal rental or sale price of any property based on other similar properties in the area they are considering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As potential tenants make offers, Houm performs a background check on the candidates and presents the options to the owners. After that, the company creates a digital contract to all parties involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Houm is the only and biggest proptech in the Spanish-speaking LatAm doing rentals, sales and property management,” Labra told TechCrunch. “Because there is no MLS and no exclusivity in the real estate industry in LatAm, having its huge freelance force in the ground allows Houm to be faster and win the deals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic, he said, accelerated by “many years” the practice of using the internet to rent and sell properties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was very beneficial for us due that we have an online end-to-end process and people will always need a home, so we provided the service that they were seeking,” Labra said. “We had an important tailwind that helped our growth to rocket sooner than expected, and this practice is here to stay.”</span></p>
<p>Hatim Khety, partner at Goodwater Capital, noted that home seekers in Latin America have been underserved for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Houm’s seamless search experience and digital closing process, the company is pioneering a consumer experience that is significantly better than the status quo,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;Landlords similarly love Houm’s end-to-end technology platform for pricing, listing, and managing their properties, driving shorter vacancies and greater rental income. We are thrilled to be partnering with Benjamín and the entire Houm team on their journey to increase housing accessibility across Latin America.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We last heard from <a href="http://Ometria.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ometria</a>, an “AI-powered” customer marketing platform allowing brands and retailers to personalize marketing messages, in 2019 when it raised $21 million in a Series B.</p>
<p>It’s now completed a $40 million Series C round, led by InfraVia Growth, with participation from existing investors Octopus Ventures, Sonae IM, Summit Action, Adjuvo and Columbia Lake Partners, as well as several early investors, including Chairman Lance Batchelor. This brings its total funding to over $75 million.</p>
<p>The company says the funding will be used to triple the size of the company’s product and engineering team, especially now that consumers are gaining more control about what personal data they share and with whom.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232753" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s also now hired a number of key new staff: Chief Technology Office Markus Plattner (former CTO of Sizmek by Amazon), Chief Revenue Office Paul Barnes (former MD of App Annie) and Chief Marketing Officer Michelle Schroeder (formerly of Simon Data and Tinyclues).</p>
<p>Ometria CEO and founder Ivan Mazour said: “Retail marketers have been promised personalization by almost every marketing technology vendor and yet our inboxes, as consumers, rarely reflect that promise. The cause of this customer experience gap lies in their tech stack. Ometria platform is built to close this gap.”</p>
<p>Guillaume Santamaria, partner at InfraVia Capital Partners, said: “Successful commerce now hinges completely on the ability for brands to differentiate through building superior customer experiences, and Ometria provides the solution for achieving this.</p>
<p>Ometria&#8217;s main competitors include email service providers (Emarsys, Sailthru, Selligent, Bronto, Dotmailer), behavioral marketing tools (CloudIQ, SaleCycle, Yieldify) and customer insight companies (More2, AgileOne).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers for its &#8220;Co-Marketer&#8221; platform &#8212; which uses data science to automatically create and optimize personalized marketing experiences several communications platforms &#8212; now include Steve Madden, Aden + Anais, Pepe Jeans, MADE.com, Notonthehighstreet.com, Hotel Chocolat, Feelunique and others.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Mazour added: “Retail marketers have trouble keeping up with customer expectations, which are going through the roof, with a million people through 30 different touchpoint, like SMS email etc., etc. The hybrid of human-machine and computer intelligence is the only way to serve this need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last month, <a href="https://www.rippling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rippling</a>, the now five-year-old company founded by serial entrepreneur Parker Conrad, raised $250 million in Series C funding in a round that pushed its valuation to a whopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/parker-conrads-rippling-is-now-valued-at-6-5-billion-more-than-zenefits-at-its-peak/">$6.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Conrad is taking the wraps off what had investors so excited about the outfit, which already helps companies manage their employees’ payroll, benefits, devices and apps, but which is adding an almost astonishing number of features to its existing lineup, beginning today.</p>
<p>Indeed, talking with Conrad earlier this week, there was no doubt about his ambition to build a very big company. He even compared its potential to that of Salesforce. Salesforce &#8220;is tying together all of the business systems that you use around this idea of a common customer identity,&#8221; he said. Rippling is &#8220;meanwhile saying, &#8216;Hey, look, there&#8217;s this other way that you need to do this, which is tying all these systems together around a common employee identity and making <em>that</em> the centerpiece of this unified sort of schema across all the different business software you&#8217;re using in your business.'&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232423" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s bold, considering how much HR software and IT software already exists in the world &#8212; some of it created previously by Conrad. It&#8217;s also compelling when viewed as a whole. (We saw the investor presentation.) In fact, all these new features are getting their own overarching branding; they are now part of Rippling&#8217;s &#8220;Unity&#8221; platform, which is driven by five separate product units, each with bells and whistles that the deepest-pocketed customers are likely to order as a complete package given that they are more powerful together. (Note that right now, pricing for the whole enchilada &#8212; &#8220;unlimited Unity&#8221; &#8212; is $25 per person per month.)</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s under the hood exactly? The first and seemingly most important piece of Unity is a &#8220;no-code&#8221; system that promises to allow company execs &#8212; whether they work in HR or sales or the engineering department &#8212; to create custom triggers that set off actions automatically in Rippling and in third-party apps connected to Rippling. (Until now, Rippling has set up third-party apps for its customers&#8217; employees but not been integrated with them. In this new phase for Rippling, it&#8217;s very much focused on integrating the data and services of a growing number of such outfits &#8212; with their consent &#8212; like the credit card company Ramp, and Checkr, which runs background checks on employees.)</p>
<p>Among the many examples Conrad offered here include the ability to set a workflow to automatically detect potential pay inequity, and to set a cross-system workflow that notifies engineering via Slack that an engineer can’t resolve a high-priority ticket in JIRA because they are out of office.</p>
<p>The second bucket in Unity centers around an analytics suite that Rippling says it has built from the ground up to support analysis of very large data sets. Conrad uses employee compensation to highlight this particular one. Many companies pay their employees referral bonuses when they hire candidates that they referred to recruiting, for example. Normally, he says, businesses have to export such data from multiple systems into an Excel spreadsheet to figure out who to pay, how much to pay, and whether certain employees are eligible for referral bonuses; Rippling, he says, will now make it possible to see that data in one place, where the answers become clear much faster.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A third overarching piece of Rippling centers on access, including the ability to easily configure employees&#8217; access to all the various SaaS products that companies use today in just a few keyboard taps. Similarly, according to Conrad, Rippling is making it dead simple to add employees to the right spending policies in a company&#8217;s corporate card or spend management system, and to the right part-time-off system. (Different employees have different holidays depending on where they are the world.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to  revoke access to everything in one fell swoop when that employee and the company part ways, says Conrad.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232631" style="width: 1306px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232631" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2232631 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png" alt="" width="1296" height="936" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png 1296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=768,555 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=680,491 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rippling</p></div></p>
<p>Not last, Unity invites users to do as much as they like in terms of customization through a scripting language that Rippling has launched called RQL that can be used to create &#8220;formula fields&#8221; inside of its analytics suite. It plainly borrows core concepts and syntax from Excel, as Conrad readily notes, but he says he has also incorporated capabilities from SQL such as &#8220;select&#8221; statements, as well as some elements from Python.</p>
<p>You can learn much more about all of this stuff <a href="https://www.rippling.com/blog/introducing-rippling-unity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we asked Conrad about some of the bigger picture issues, like whether Rippling favors certain third-party providers with whom it is doing integrations. On this front, he said that Rippling &#8220;wants to work with everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we have a pretty deep integration with Ramp,&#8221; he offered, &#8220;and I think we&#8217;re also interested in and talking with Brex about sort of deepening the integration that we have with Brex. We&#8217;re also talking with Expensify about deepening the integration we have with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more third-party services, the better, he said, suggesting that every piece of data makes Rippling that much stickier. When it comes to corporate expenses specifically, he said he expects that &#8220;over the next three to six months, you&#8217;re actually going to see a lot of the transactional spend management data in [Rippling], so that clients can run analytics and reporting on spending within their organization. They can see how much the people in their part of the organization are spending over time, where the money is going, who are the top vendors and in what the categories,&#8221; and even trigger an alert when spending exceeds a certain amount within a particular classification, &#8220;within Rippling or even back inside of systems like Brex and Ramp and Expensify.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said in some cases, Rippling is even integrating with third-party systems whose offerings mirror some of that Rippling has built in-house. He points to time-and-attendance systems, saying that Rippling has its own, but that there are &#8220;cases where it makes sense for someone to use Rippling time tracking for their employees, and there are cases where it makes sense for them to use a third-party time-and-attendance system. And we want both of those experiences to be great.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As developers push code across multiple clouds, figuring out what infrastructure you own becomes a real challenge, usually involving writing custom scripts. <a href="http://cloudquery.io">CloudQuery</a>, an early-stage startup, wanted to make it easier, and built an open source tool to do the work for you. Today, the company announced a $3.5 million seed round led by Boldstart Ventures with help from Work-Bench, Mango Capital and Haystack.</p>
<p>CloudQuery CEO and co-founder Yevgeny Pats said that on a high level, &#8220;We are an open source, cloud assets inventory [tool] powered by SQL.&#8221; He says that when he sold his previous startup, Fuzzit, to GitLab, and he was working on multiple cloud platforms, he found himself struggling to figure out the layout of his infrastructure across clouds and how all the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Furthermore, much to his surprise, he couldn&#8217;t find an open source tool to help. It seemed that there wasn&#8217;t a solution out there that gave him the kind of visibility that developers who were writing infrastructure as code had, utilizing tools like Terraform from HashiCorp.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232727" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So he did what any good entrepreneur would do. He set out to build that tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where I embarked on a new journey to start CloudQuery, where we want to become this platform and to build this ecosystem where developers can focus solely on the business and security logic with a query engine that they know, [SQL], and they don&#8217;t need to learn a new one to [put] together business and security objectives,&#8221; Pats explained.</p>
<p>The tool launched just nine months ago, but Pats found he was far from the only one with this problem; already, major companies like Bloomberg, Salesforce and Zendesk have downloaded and started using the tool because it replaces a lot of manual work writing scripts.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Earlier this year], I just released it on GitHub and launched it on Hacker News, and within three months we got quite a bit of traction and adoption from developers, DevOps engineers and SREs [site reliability engineers], and I decided to raise money and double down on that opportunity to continue expanding and developing the open source project,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of monetization, Pats would prefer to build the community first. As the product gains traction, the plan is to build a SaaS version of the product that minimizes some of the complexity around using the open source tool and provides some special features for enterprise customers.</p>
<p>The company currently has 11 employees with plans to get to 14 by the first quarter of next year. Being open source means you can also get help from the community and operate more leanly. Pats says that being a fully remote company helps when it comes to building a more diverse workforce, but it&#8217;s a tough hiring market, which makes it more challenging.</p>
<p>He said that he intends to stay fully remote and take some of the lessons he learned while working at GitLab and implement them at his company. One of those lessons is ensuring teams are built around reasonable time zones, because if you have people spread out across the world, it can make it challenging to find reasonable times to meet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://www.sivo.com/">Sivo</a> wants to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/sivo-a-young-stripe-for-debt-led-by-an-veteran-operator-seems-to-have-investors-clamoring/">do for debt</a> what Stripe did for payments: Make it as easy to access a debt facility as plugging into an API. And just as Stripe helped unlock a slew of new businesses thanks to the ease with which they could embed payments into their apps and services, Sivo wants to power a new generation of lending offerings.</p>
<p>Early returns have been positive: In just about three months since launch, Sivo has received about $4 billion in demand and actually signed $1.5 billion in term sheets from originators who wish to leverage its debt-as-a-service offering. And, according to founder and CEO Kate Hiscox, the company is in the process of onboarding 600 originators who are hoping to tap into its programmatic debt lines.</p>
<h2>Securing and proving out a lending model</h2>
<p>Historically, when a startup would launch to spin up a new credit or lending product, it would have to lend off its balance sheet, which meant raising money through equity financing and then using those funds to test out lending models and build some history.</p>
<p>Then, when they had enough data, they would go to a bank or some other financial institution to raise a debt facility. That process could take months as the bank would ask for reams of data, negotiate terms and create complicated legal agreements around the terms of the debt funding.</p>
<p>In contrast, Sivo’s debt offering has no warrants involved, no advance rates, arrangement fees, facility fees or big complex agreements, according to Hiscox. Instead, Sivo works sort of like a secured credit card. That is, when companies sign up, they open a business banking account through Sivo’s platform and deposit some amount of collateral to secure the initial debt limit.</p>
<p>Originators on the platform can configure their debt line to match the needs of their business, and then Sivo evaluates how their lending programs are performing through its banking product. If originators prove their models by hitting certain pre-defined KPIs, Sivo will then extend more leverage that they can borrow against.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">record venture capital totals</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/venture-capital-is-going-to-need-a-record-breaking-run-of-ipos-to-clear-its-own-decks/">record numbers of startups worth $1 billion or more</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">eye-watering revenue multiples</a> available for private and public technology companies alike, you could be forgiven for having concern that we&#8217;re heading for a dot-com-style correction.</p>
<p>The believers are not convinced. And for good reason, it turns out.</p>

<hr />
<p>It is always risky to say <em>it&#8217;s different this time</em>, but today&#8217;s technology boom and the dot-com rush are, in fact, rather different. In the dot-com period, companies with little to no revenue went public at titanic valuations, leading to a simply massive accretion of risk in the public markets. Regular folks wound up exposed to that risk and were burned when the winds shifted and tech valuations plummeted.</p>

<p>But while it has <em>been</em> fair to say that risks have been contained by company quality &#8212; the existence of revenue and the shock-dampening effect of strong revenue multiples for technology concerns, broadly &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen a steady erosion of the argument in recent quarters. Even more, we&#8217;re seeing the quality of tech companies that go public at times decline, leading to more risk available to consumer investors &#8212; not just the professionals.</p>
<h2>Revenue-lite becomes revenue-free</h2>
<p>There are two vectors that underpin the argument that inherent risk in today&#8217;s rich technology valuations is not a concern. The first is that the valuations in question are not built on air. The second is that the public is not directly exposed to high-risk companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Startup </em>valuations are not a concern because the public cannot get involved in companies that could yet go poof, and the companies in question have real revenues.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[The average refrigerator door is opened and closed 20 times per day, but with everyone at home during the pandemic, that rose to over 100 times, sparking an increase in door repair requests.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you live in a home, something always breaks. And it can be difficult to know who to call and if you can afford the repairs. That’s where <a href="https://puls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puls Technologies</a> come in.</p>
<p>Now armed with $15 million in fresh capital led by Hanaco Venture Capital, the Livermore, California-based company, which offers on-demand home repair services through its mobile app, is also going after the home insurance market by launching an appliance warranty option for appliances like refrigerators, washers, dryers and ovens, starting at about $29 per month.</p>
<p>To do this, Puls taps into prediction algorithms to match the technician with the job so that repairs are made in a timely and hassle-free manner and typically within one or two days, versus weeks. The company works with more than 7,000 vetted technicians in 20 cities across the United States.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232479" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EveGOMU6rK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/puls-raises-50-million-for-in-home-technical-support/">Puls raises $50 million for in-home technical support</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Puls raises $50 million for in-home technical support&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/puls-raises-50-million-for-in-home-technical-support/embed/#?secret=EveGOMU6rK" data-secret="EveGOMU6rK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company initially got started in 2015 as a mobile phone repair service, and in 2020 underwent a management shift that pivoted the business model to memberships, Gabi Peles, Puls CEO, said via email.</p>
<p>It decided to go after appliance warranties after not only seeing the thousands of complaints that come from customers each year related to traditional home warranty services, but also how <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/just-39percent-of-americans-could-pay-for-a-1000-emergency-expense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of Americans are unable to afford an unexpected $1,000 expense</a>.</p>
<p>“High fees, fine print, excluding costly issues and the delay of dispatching handymen to a job portray the limitations of pre-existing warranty plans,” Peles said. “Puls allows users to gain more coverage for most home appliances at a reasonable price. We are also committed to enhancing the experience of technicians, providing them with a platform that drives new business by increasing the daily amount of jobs they can access and offering additional income opportunities with upselling and cross-selling.”</p>
<p>Under its previous management structure, Puls raised $96 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/puls-raises-50-million-for-in-home-technical-support/">$50 million round</a> back in 2018. This latest $15 million is the first under the company’s new management, Peles said.</p>

<p>The company grew 100% over the last six months, including nearly doubling its employee base to 60 in the past year. It saw some of that demand related to the global pandemic, when the need for home repairs increased due to people spending more time at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Peles explained that the average refrigerator door is opened and closed 20 times per day, but with everyone at home, that rose to over 100 times, sparking an increase in the number of door repair requests.</p>
<p>To continue meeting that demand, Puls intends to use the new funding to expand its footprint to over 40 cities and expects to reach over 100 employees by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lior Prosor, general partner and co-founder of Hanaco Venture Capital, said via email that Puls was going after a home repair and maintenance services market in the U.S. that was both large and fragmented across hundreds of thousands of different service providers.</p>
<p>That leaves both technicians and homeowners underserved: the technician lacks the tools to excel at their jobs, while the homeowner receives lackluster service, he added. Puls changes that for technicians by handling the scheduling, pricing, billing and customer service so that they can focus on the customer.</p>
<p>“We saw a great opportunity to double down on the company&#8217;s operating model change in 2020,” Prosor said. “We had a strong conviction in Gabi’s vision that Puls&#8217; assets could be used to build the best home care company in the insurtech market.</p>
<p>“The business is at a clear inflection point with new membership and warranty products driving increasing and exciting business metrics that point to a sustainable growth trajectory,” he added. “The platform is both cost-effective and has proven product-market-fit across both project-based jobs and &#8216;Click &amp; Fix&#8217; subscription services, with an exciting pipeline of new offerings in its warranty and home insurance products.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linktree, the popular “link in bio” service, is launching a Shopify integration to give users a way to promote their businesses and products directly on its platform. With this integration, Linktree users can launch a Shopify storefront on their Linktree to showcase their products and services to drive more sales.</p>
<p>The feature is available now for free to all Linktree users. Linktree says that the partnership with Shopify allows creators to grow while connecting to global audiences.</p>
<p>Once users link their Shopify accounts with Linktree, they’ll be able to choose which products or collections to promote. There’s also an option to live sync Shopify collections onto Linktree, so that any changes made on Shopify are reflected on Linktree automatically. Users can display up to six products at a time and host multiple links for different collections or stores.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are excited to welcome Shopify to our ever-expanding list of Linktree functionalities that enable users to streamline shopping, better connect with audiences and ultimately, drive more purchases,” said Alex Zaccaria, co-founder and CEO of Linktree, in a statement. “Linktree intends to integrate more platforms relied on by creators to monetize and run their online business.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229674" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229674" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2229674" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229674" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Linktree</p></div></p>
<p>Linktree says its collaboration with Shopify is the latest in a series of creator-focused efforts. The Shopify collaboration comes a few months after Linktree <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/linktree-partners-with-paypal-to-allow-users-globally-to-accept-direct-payments/">partnered with PayPal</a> to expand its recently launched “Commerce Links” tools for direct payment on Linktree. Launched in March, Commerce Links allow users to take payments directly on their Linktree profile without opening a new browser or tab.</p>
<p>The company also recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linktree-announces-acquisition-of-songlinkodesli-and-launches-music-link-feature-301358565.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its acquisition</a> of automated music link aggregation platform Songlink/Odesli. Linktree is integrating Songlink/Odesli into its newly launched “Music Link” feature, which automatically displays the same song or album across all music streaming services to let users listen to content on their preferred platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with several “link in bio” platforms, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and Beacons. In March, Linktree announced it raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/"> $45 million in Series B funding</a>. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and Coatue, with participation from returning investors AirTree Ventures and Insight Partners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company referred to the 60 days of interest-free financing as “a game-changer” for an industry where it typically takes over 100 days to get paid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flexbase.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flexbase</a> is turning construction financing on its head with a new credit card — the industry’s first, according to the founders — that offers up to 60 days interest-free financing.</p>
<p>The company, which develops automated payments tools for contractors and the construction industry, was started by Zaid Rahman and Hadi Solh to target small- and mid-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Rahman, a Theil Fellow, and Solh grew up in construction families, hearing stories around the dinner table of cash flow pain points. When Rahman’s father, who ran a construction company in Dubai, had a customer not pay a multimillion-dollar invoice, he suffered a heart attack. Rahman and Solh joined to form Flexbase so companies would have easier access to capital so that cash flow problems could be avoided.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232573" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Most construction companies are either broke or one degree away,” Rahman told TechCrunch. “One of those reasons is that most clients don’t like to pay on time. Another is that banks don’t like construction companies because of that cash flow problem, so the company is less likely to get short-term capital. That is also why they go bankrupt so often.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any construction company can apply for Flexbase Card, which is launching in Houston first, but the co-founders said those who use the card with the other Flexbase tools will be able to gain deeper insight into the company’s financial data and be eligible to borrow larger credit amounts.</p>
<p>Solh referred to the 60 days of financing as “a game-changer” for an industry where it typically takes more than 100 days to get paid. One of the drivers for that is that while the typical invoice can be one or two pages, construction invoices can easily be 50 to 100 pages, which includes state and county compliance documents. If even one piece is missing, the entire invoice can be rejected, Rahman said.</p>
<p>By automating expense management, Flexbase can reduce the time it takes for invoices to flow between accounts receivables and accounts payable and decrease the time to payment by 50 days.</p>
<p>“You can’t evaluate construction companies like other businesses when it comes to capital, but by doing the underwriting, we provide companies with enough credit to grow their businesses,” Rahman added. “We are providing you enough credit in two minutes to grow the kinds of projects and the client base.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its proprietary technology enables The Naked Market to quickly gauge what products are winning with consumers so they can be scaled.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food and beverage startup <a href="http://www.thenakedmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Naked Market</a> bagged $27.5 million of Series A investment, led by Integrated Capital, to continue developing its line of healthier food brands.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2019 by Harrison Fugman, Alex Kost and Tim Marbach, who created a “fast fail” method to develop new foods that includes an end-to-end infrastructure that can go from idea to market in about three months. The company also handles distribution.</p>
<p>On the other side is a proprietary data tool called The Machine that gathers over 15 million data points from places like Shopify, direct customer feedback, Amazon, retail point of sale and search engine trends, to unearth category opportunities for the company to pursue. In addition, a direct customer feedback loop enables The Naked Market to quickly gauge which products are winning with consumers so they can be scaled.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232364" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This portfolio approach is different because we are using a data-driven fast fail strategy,” CEO Fugman told TechCrunch. “We can start to identify foods and bring them to market in a matter of months versus years, and if we see a brand does not have product market fit, we can shut it down quickly.”</p>

<p>Since its inception, The Naked Market has produced five brands, including Flock Chicken Chips, AvoCrazy, Project Breakfast and Beach House Bowls. Its latest brand, Rob’s Backstage Popcorn, is a joint venture with the Jonas Brothers.</p>
<p>Joining Integrated Capital in the round are Great Oaks Venture Capital, Pacific Tiger Group, Sope Creek Capital and Clearco. The Naked Market has raised over $33 million, which includes an earlier $6 million seed round.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Yam, executive director at Integrated Capital, met Fugman and Kost in Hong Kong and had already gotten to know them well when they presented Yam with their business plan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yam said he liked the approach of going after the market size and the white space for challenger brands. He also was intrigued by the data-driven technology.</p>
<p>“The data-driven approach to identify winners and losers early on makes them a perfect platform to go after this market,” he added. “Their ability to bring products to market in a short amount of time, with asset-light infrastructure, is a big opportunity.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/snack-food-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack food market</a> was valued at $427 billion in 2020, and is expected to grow 3% annually through 2026. Fugman said a multibillion market like that “gets us excited to have this kind of landscape for disruption.” He notes that customer preference toward more healthier snacks over the past decade are giving companies, like his that are investing in R&amp;D, a seat at the table.</p>
<p>“Incumbents aren’t investing in R&amp;D, or if they are, they are spending low, single digits there, and this creates an opportunity,” Fugman added. “We are looking for categories where we can create a brand that goes after a market leader, and we feel that we have cracked the equation to identify the market and create a brand and reasonable scale.”</p>
<p>The Naked Market’s products have been on the market for just over 12 months, and the new funding will “pour fuel on that fire,” he said. The new capital will enable the company to scale its existing brands, create new products and pursue M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>The company has 10 employees and is experiencing triple-digit growth since its founding two years ago. Fugman expects to launch new brands in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>For now, the company is selling online but has intentions of going into retailers in coming years and has some partners already lined up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance lags behind other financial services in the adoption of digital technologies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, a few unicorns have popped up from the modern digital insurance space such as Tractable and Lemonade; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this sector hasn&#8217;t raced to the stage as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as say, payments or lending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the global insurance market worth over $5 trillion, there are different opportunities to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be tapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite the presence of large incumbents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, one startup is carving a niche for itself. By way of using APIs, <a href="https://root.co.za/">Root</a> is helping businesses and developers launch insurance products faster than the traditional way. The company, based in South Africa, has raised $3 million in seed funding to scale outside the country and build the infrastructure for the global digital insurance economy.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232495" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capital firms <a href="https://www.invenfin.com/">Invenfin</a>, Base Capital, Savannah Fund, P1 Ventures, Luno and FireID took part in the round, including some high-impact angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root started off with the premise that many barriers, including compliance and capital, prevented software developers and businesses from building and innovating around insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/louwhopley">Louw Hopley</a> told TechCrunch he noticed in 2015 that while other financial services started to use APIs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help developers build products tailored to their offerings, nothing was being built around insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got quite a strong feeling that insurance is stuck in the 1900s. There’s still a lot of paper </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even as consumer behaviour has moved to digital real-time. There’s a personalized kind of environment pretty much in every industry, but insurance is struggling to catch up,” he said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that’s kind of what we’re trying to figure out to break down those barriers and package it behind easy to use APIs so that people can start solving for this new modern digital personalized age</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopley launched Root in 2016 to cater to this need. <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-stewart-5b686490">Jonathan Stewart</a> joined as a co-founder leading sales and partnerships in 2018.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root&#8217;s first product was programmable bank accounts and cards but it has moved on to providing insurance APIs which is now its core offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root plugs on top of insurance companies,m who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">underwrite the products that developers and business analysts, using Root, build and integrate into their existing customer experiences, which can exist on a website, chatbot or a mobile application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232693" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232693" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Root" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg 5476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Root</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five-year-old company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targets non-insurance companies with a steady client base; businesses offering insurance as a secondary product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, telcos, retailers and banks. However, it also powers affinity insurance players; some of the largest in South Africa actually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these clients include Mr Price Money, FinChoice, Telkom, Metropolitan, Sanlam and Guardrisk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Root’s insurance infrastructure, these companies have processed millions of policies and thousands of claims each month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South African company makes money through subscription licensing fees based on its client’s size and complexity of their needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to helping developers and businesses launch insurance products, Root provides channels for these businesses to reach more customers and takes care of compliance issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Root intends to roll out its flexible low-code digital insurance platform as it expands to other markets, Europe in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopley does not mention the countries Root will expand into; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, judging by the level of insurance play in the region, the U.K., Germany and France might be at the top of the list</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Root has plans to hire more technical and business talent in Europe, Hopley says a large part of the company’s team will remain in South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, the company’s focus, especially as it expands into new terrain, is to build the operating system for the global insurance industry, said Hopley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there needs to be a standard platform on which people innovate and build their products and integrate with. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that means we want to be the platform all product innovators, actuaries and developers will log into to build insurance products and get them to market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if you do that you can drive much more innovation faster because you kind of enable sub economies to spin up and other people to start building specific solutions into insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integrates the whole industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Paul Rutherford of Base Capital said Root’s APIs bring simplicity to the complex world of insurance and improve consumers&#8217; and insurers’ experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikael Hajjar of P1 Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, notes that Root might be the best positioned Africa insurtech startup to gain market share in Europe and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
