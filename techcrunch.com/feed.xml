										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indonesia-based insurtech startup <a href="https://www.fuse.co.id/en/home-en/">Fuse</a> announced today it has secured $25 million of Series B extension round as it plans to enter more countries including Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia. The startup has closed three funding rounds of Series B within the past six months, bringing the company&#8217;s total raised to over $70 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fresh capital was led by an undisclosed global fintech fund with participation from existing investors East Ventures, GGV Capital, eWTP and Emtek. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Launched in 2017, Fuse connects insurance companies with multiple distribution channels and partners to make insurance services accessible and affordable through its technology. Fuse uses mobile applications to offer an agent-focused service, B2A (Business to Agent/ Broker). Fuse Pro app enables agents and broker partners to maximize choices for their customers. The startup also has B2C and B2B2C (micro insurance and financial institute), which provides digital small-ticket size insurance products, distributing insurance products cost-effectively to end customers by partnerships with e-commerce channels like Tokopedia.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246437" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Southeast Asia’s rapidly growing digitally savvy middle class that is expected to grow to 350 million consumers with $300 billion in disposable income makes the region an attractive market for insurtech companies. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pandemic accelerated the digital transformation in the insurance industry, one of the most conservative sectors. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fuse plans to tap into the huge and underpenetrated insurance industry in other countries in Southeast Asia, where </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://economysea.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">more than 70 percent of Southeast Asia&#8217;s population</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is connected to the internet. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We deeply believe that digital insurance transformation can help more people get protection with insurance, and hopefully, the insurance penetration rate can increase substantially in the coming years in Indonesia as well as Southeast Asia,” said Andy Yeung, CEO of Fuse.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fuse claims it currently has more than 60,000 marketers or agent partners using the Fuse Pro mobile app. More than 40 insurance companies, including general and life insurance companies, use Fuse’s platform to offer over 300 insurance products for partners or end customers. The company has exceeded $70 million in gross written premium (GWP) for the first three quarters of 2021. The company said it has the largest GWP in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has over 460 employees, with branch offices in Indonesia, Vietnam, and China.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are very glad to be recognized by a leading global fintech fund which had looked into most insurtech players in Southeast Asia and decided to invest in Fuse. We are very excited to get access and insights from other fintech and insurtech portfolio companies in this global network. The strong interest of global investors reconfirms our current ecosystem approach – using Fuse’s technology platform to make insurance more </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accessible for Southeast Asia’s underpenetrated population,” Yeong said.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SenseTime, one of China&#8217;s most valuable AI solution providers, is putting its $767 million<a href="https://media-sensetime.todayir.com/202112070631111799815632_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> public listing</a> on hold, the company <a href="https://media-sensetime.todayir.com/20211213121601129910049428_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement came three weeks after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange gave the go-ahead to SenseTime&#8217;s IPO. On December 10, the U.S. Department of Treasury added the firm to a list of <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Chinese military-industrial complex Companies,&#8221; </a>saying it &#8220;has developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target’s ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The military blacklist bars U.S. investors from purchasing or selling publicly traded securities of SenseTime.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246415" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In response to the U.S. government&#8217;s decision, SenseTime is postponing its IPO and will publish a supplementary prospectus with a new listing timetable to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;safeguard the interests&#8221; of its potential investors.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly oppose the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it,&#8221; SenseTime said in a statement. &#8220;The accusations are unfounded and reflect a fundamental misperception of our company. We regret to have been caught in the middle of geopolitical tension.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2019, SenseTime was placed on the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> U.S. Entity List</a> that blocked it from doing business with American companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1n6BkqaCP0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Well, it turns out the Beatles didn&#8217;t get broken up by Yoko after all. But Peter Jackson may have gotten closer. His Get Back movie seemed to be so far over the top that even Beatlemaniacs like myself had had enough. But no. On this edition of the Gang, we still can&#8217;t stop talking about it. Random reviews by every third person on the street exonerate Yoko, complain about the weak material, and generally agree that they still want to see the director&#8217;s 15 hour cut. It&#8217;s like that Groundhog Day with the four fabs endlessly repeating the same mistakes that led to the end of the greatest show on earth. It&#8217;s easy to believe George Harrison when he later said the Beatles weren&#8217;t that good, but where does that leave us?</p>
<p>The portions weren&#8217;t big enough. Paul was too bossy. John was checked out. Yeah, so what. Have you ever read the first draft of the Gettysburg Address? Actually, I bet that is the first draft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246301" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve finally got Twitter Spaces to work, or at least the Record part. Then Jack Dorsey leaves and sets off massive speculation about the Blockverse or whatever. What started as a retirement plan for Sergei and Larry (Alphabet) brought Facebook&#8217;s reboot to Meta to preserve Mort Zuckerberg&#8217;s hammerlock on social media forward. I&#8217;ve renamed Marc to Mort as part of the new branding. The Beatles did this first with Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band. They keep moving in and out of style.</p>
<p>Media speculation is that Dorsey is realigning the Twitter stack under Square/Block&#8217;s crypto wallet super-app. Look, he quits. Look, he&#8217;s still there. But tellingly, Square has been much more successful with the Wall Street crowd than Twitter, and this identity shuffle could turn out to be significant as Twitter builds out its software stack under Dorsey&#8217;s successor. It&#8217;s in many ways reminiscent of that earlier time when XML and the Web Services stack spawned RSS, blogging, podcasting, and then the Cloud. Today, it&#8217;s newsletters, live streaming, and live conferencing a la Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces. Scratch reminiscent; it&#8217;s what some are trying to namejack as Web3.</p>
<p>Last week, one of the founders of the Identity movement died, the wonderful Kim Cameron. Doc Searls, one of the founders of the long-running Internet Identity Workshop conference, recalled the group grew out of a special edition of the Gillmor Gang on the last day of 2004 and a subsequent in-person gathering at Esther Dyson&#8217;s PC Forum conference. Kim brought a gentle sense of humor, deep knowledge in the potential of identity mixed with open standards cooperation, and the leverage of his role at Microsoft. As the Identity Gang morphed into IIW, Kim brought his personal and big tech identities to the table.</p>
<p>Doc and I went looking for the Identity Gang show and eventually, with the help of Phil Windley and Doug Kaye of IT Conversations, got the link to work. In the meantime, Doc and I recorded a Clubhouse room conversation. We&#8217;re early in the live recorded audio rollout, but the tracks are laid and the conversation is underway once more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim drew up what he called the Seven Laws of Identity. Then crucially, he got Microsoft to agree to many of them. &#8220;One of his laws said: A plurality of operators,&#8221; Doc remembers. &#8220;That was huge. And for Microsoft at the time, well, they all but ran the world, to sign off on a plurality of operators, which Kim got them to do. It was a big deal. It was a huge deal, even though there was no formal way that it happened. But it was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won a whole bunch of — I wouldn&#8217;t call them political battles — but certainly skirmishes inside the company to make sure that they didn&#8217;t try to do with whatever they would do next with identity that they did with Passport. It was a hugely influential thing and it still is. It&#8217;s informing the development going on today with what&#8217;s called SSI for self-sovereign identity, which is basically exactly what his laws say: minimum disclosure for constrained users and user control and consent. It basically puts you as an individual back in charge of the way your identity is used or identifying things about yourself can be done online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s individual or corporate identity, the lesson of the Beatles is the fierce battle to be the greater sum of its parts. These four men in their late twenties had conquered the world by submerging themselves in a collaborative harness they knew couldn&#8217;t last. Harrison openly debated breaking away to do his own record, but he rationalized it as a way of coming back to the hive for more Beatles. McCartney, in a private 1 on 1 with his songwriting partner, told Lennon he was the real boss, Paul the second boss. John pushed back, &#8220;Not always.&#8221; Paul wasn&#8217;t having any of it. &#8220;No, always.&#8221;</p>
<p>History seems to live in the cracks between what a few people agree is the way forward. I&#8217;ve always been interested in the creative space that emerges from the tension of collaboration. As Keith Teare says on this session of the Gillmor Gang, the elevation of Bret Taylor to Chairman of the Twitter board and co-CEO of Salesforce represents not the bad but the good side of Silicon Valley, &#8220;which is people have each other&#8217;s backs and care about outcomes for companies they don&#8217;t work for. And one of the best things about the Valley is it&#8217;s incredibly collaborative, and problems are discussed openly and fairly transparently, and people know each other because it&#8217;s such a small place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two of us going nowhere, sang John and Paul. Not likely.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. patent system, which should fuel invention, is increasingly being abused to hinder innovation. It desperately needs reform, and there’s one critical fix that can happen <em>today</em> to help ensure the system works for innovators and entrepreneurs of all sizes.</p>
<p>Kathi Vidal, the Biden administration’s nominee to lead the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), recently had her <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/bidens-pto-pick-calls-clarity-patent-eligibility-controversy-2021-12-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation hearing</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senators from both parties — including Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Republican Thom Tillis of North Carolina — asked Vidal about issues related to the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/turning-away-a-patent-challenge-the-nhk-fintiv-rule-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHK-Fintiv rule</a>, which was unilaterally imposed by the previous USPTO director in direct contradiction to bipartisan legislation passed by Congress. NHK-Fintiv restricts access to transparent, expert infringement claim review at the USPTO, instead forcing innovators to enter into expensive litigation or settlements.</p>
<p>The prominence of this questioning during a short hearing reflects how important the issue is for the USPTO and the U.S. innovation economy at large. Once confirmed, the next director will almost certainly have to grapple with aspects of NHK-Fintiv. But the USPTO should not wait &#8212; it can act right now to protect American innovators.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over a decade ago, the America Invents Act created the inter partes review (IPR) process at the USPTO. IPR allowed for patent infringement claims to be resolved in a transparent manner by unbiased, expert judges rather than requiring businesses to spend huge amounts of money and time on often baseless litigation or settlements. This review is critically important because not everyone engages in patent infringement claims in good faith. In recent years, almost <a href="https://www.unifiedpatents.com/insights/2020-patent-dispute-report-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all patent litigation has involved groups known as non-practicing entities (NPEs) or “patent trolls.”</p>
<p>Patent trolls are shell companies — frequently backed by hedge funds or other litigation financiers — that buy unused, broad patents and then weaponize them against legitimate American innovators. Patent trolls never intend to use the patents they purchase to produce anything of value. Instead, they exist only to extort judgments and settlements for their investors from companies that do.</p>
<p>At Intel, we face more than our fair share of patent trolls. But this is not only a problem for large manufacturers. Trolls have been known to send<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/a-patent-troll-targeting-small-businesses-is-sued-by-washington-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> thousands of identical demand letters</a> to small businesses over basic day-to-day operations like conducting business on the internet. They count on many businesses paying a settlement or licensing fee rather than engaging in extremely costly litigation, and they also hope to hit the occasional jackpot with a non-expert jury ruling in their favor.</p>
<p>Patent troll litigation has real consequences for American business. Companies targeted by patent trolls are forced to pay<a href="https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-evidence-is-in-patent-trolls-do-hurt-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $29 billion</a> in direct out-of-pocket costs per year, and the average settlement is over <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=168089005022002067078127026079102108046069006038058066023091083111116003118096004123122025060038021096117066106122103116015090014008073002058069064064120099085073035075071078086124079094097097122004001118083096126069082009118000028126093070125005024&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.5 million</a>. This is money that could instead be invested in growing a business, hiring new workers or engaging in R&amp;D, and not all businesses can afford to settle or go through a costly, prolonged trial. The IPR process was an effective protection against this type of predatory behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when the previous USPTO director imposed the NHK-Fintiv rule, it tilted the playing field back in favor of those who seek to abuse the patent system. Under NHK-Fintiv, IPR can be denied if there is pending litigation, without even considering the merits of the infringement claim. This flies in the face of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/1249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America Invents Act</a>, which intended IPR to vitiate the need for expensive litigation when patents or claims are found invalid. What’s more, as Leahy noted during Vidal’s hearing, recent analysis has shown that the trial dates that the USPTO relies on for issuing these “discretionary denials” are <a href="https://www.lexblog.com/2021/10/29/how-reliable-are-trial-dates-relied-on-by-the-ptab-in-the-fintiv-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaccurate over 90%</a> of the time.</p>
<p>NHK-Fintiv must be repealed in order to restore the IPR process as Congress originally intended. While this should continue to be a key issue as Vidal’s confirmation process moves forward, the Department of Commerce and USPTO have the authority to act <em>now</em> to protect American innovators.</p>
<p>They must not wait any longer. Patent trolls should not have the upper hand over American innovators for one day longer than necessary.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>Governments that purchase spyware tend to share a common pretext: the need to fight terrorist and other public safety threats. But we know that when autocratic regimes acquire state-of-the-art surveillance technology, they also intend to use it against activists, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/citizen-lab-iphone-nso-group/">journalists</a>, academics and any other dissenting voices they deem a threat. Spyware programs — used to infect phones and other hardware without the owner&#8217;s knowledge in order to track movements and steal information — are tools of repression just as surely as guns.</p>
<p>There have been too many well-documented cases to ignore this basic 21st century reality. Yet companies continue to sell their spyware to despotic governments, in some cases claiming ignorance about what is likely to happen next. This trend has rocked the community of political dissidents across the globe and has put them at greater risk of arrest and much worse.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We know because this technology has been used on us. As a naturalized American from Saudi Arabia and a British academic, we count ourselves and many colleagues among the victims.</p>

<p>One of us, Ali Al-Ahmed, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-dissident-sues-twitter-second-time-account-hack-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw the Saudi government steal</a> his personal data from Twitter, then use it to track down, imprison and torture his Twitter followers.</p>
<p>The other one of us, Matthew Hedges, was a graduate student on a research trip to the United Arab Emirates when he discovered that authorities had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/uae-linked-to-listing-of-hundreds-of-uk-phones-in-pegasus-project-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked</a> his phone even before he arrived in the country. He was arrested in 2018, charged with spying and initially sentenced to life in prison. Ultimately held for six months, he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-46451590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept in handcuffs and fed debilitating drugs</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Painful though these experiences continue to be for us, we are relatively safe living in the United States and Britain. But our experiences are all too common. They highlight the ongoing, systemic abuse that authoritarian regimes inflict on people every day, in violation of international law and all principles of human rights.</p>
<p>By enabling despots to track citizens&#8217; every move, spyware vendors make this kind of maltreatment possible. Dissidents around the world will have targets on their backs until democratic governments crack down on companies that turn a blind eye to this use of their wares.</p>
<p>The time has come for decisive action from democratic countries, including the United States, to curb this abuse. Leaders in Western democracies talk about the need to rein in Big Tech. And yet, in the endless tug-of-war between government regulation and tech companies, &#8220;users have become the main casualties,&#8221; as a new <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from Freedom House, a watchdog organization, put it. Too often, ordinary online citizens are vulnerable to predation by their own governments.</p>
<p>China and Russia get the lion&#8217;s share of global public attention for state-sponsored hacking and repression for the sheer scale of their operations. But U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia are often among the worst offenders.</p>
<p>For example, some of the Middle East&#8217;s most ruthless suppressors of dissent, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, buy spyware from the Israeli company NSO Group. These governments have used NSO&#8217;s Pegasus software to hack into the phones of numerous human rights activists and critics — often well beyond their own borders.</p>
<p>Sometimes the autocrats running these regimes have purely personal motives, as in the case of Dubai&#8217;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. A British court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/world/europe/dubai-sheik-hacked-phones-ex-wife-uk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that he used Pegasus to spy on his ex-wife and several of his children.</p>
<p>The public only learned of this because an NSO Group official called a prominent British lawyer late one night to tip her off about the surveillance. As bad as the sheikh’s abuse of Pegasus was, more alarming is that NSO Group knew he was using their technology for illicit ends. In this case, senior managers felt sufficiently exposed to blow the whistle, but the firm has not divulged what it may know about other abuses by its clients.</p>
<p>Nor is NSO Group alone in selling spyware to police forces and intelligence services known to abuse human rights. The Israeli firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">Candiru</a> and Cyberbit are in the same business. Products from the German company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/">Finfisher</a> and the Italian firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/08/adobe-is-patching-a-hole-the-hacking-team-used-to-exploit-flash/">Hacking Team</a> (now rebranded Memento Labs after a 2015 scandal) have also been linked to abuses.</p>
<p>NSO has reportedly terminated its contracts with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-khashoggi-hacking-nso.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Arabia</a> and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nso-ended-pegasus-contract-with-uae-over-dubai-leaders-hacking-2021-10-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Arab Emirates</a>, saying they misused Pegasus. But corporate self-enforcement is not enough. Democratic governments must send a clear message to these companies: that they will face export bans, and senior company staff will face sanctions if their products are used to violate human rights.</p>
<p>Another important step would be for the U.S. Commerce Department and its counterparts in Britain, the European Union and other democracies to expand the use of blacklists that restrict trade with companies enabling abuse. The Commerce Department already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">includes</a> NSO Group, Candiru, Russian company Positive Technologies and the Singaporean firm Computer Security Initiative Consultancy on its &#8220;Entity List,&#8221; meaning that those outfits can&#8217;t buy components from U.S. sellers without a special license. But a broader global campaign of this kind could go further.</p>
<p>Finally, democratic countries should establish transparent, uniform rules for using spyware. This past week, the White House hosted a virtual Summit for Democracy of global leaders with the express purpose of fighting authoritarianism and promoting human rights. As this coalition gets to work, spyware should be at the top of its agenda.</p>
<p>Clearly, we have entered a new era of electronic espionage and digital repression. Only by enacting stronger regulatory and legal protections can democracies ensure their survival, enable free speech to flourish and safeguard their citizens&#8217; well-being.</p>

<p>Modi’s account &#8212; whose handle is @narendramodi &#8212; tweeted after the midnight that India had officially adopted bitcoin as a legal tender, prompting suspicions about a hack because of the timing of the announcement and also as New Delhi in recent months has suggested that it will be introducing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/india-plans-law-that-will-prohibit-all-private-cryptocurrencies-with-certain-exceptions/">a strict law to regulate cryptocurrency</a>. Late last month, country&#8217;s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said New Delhi had no proposal to recognize bitcoin as a currency in the country.</p>
<p>The Sunday tweet, which has since been deleted, included a link to a sketchy website and said New Delhi had purchased some bitcoins and was planning to distribute them among the nation’s residents.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> out this week. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245422" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h3>App economy in 2021 reaches $133-135 billion</h3>
<p>This week, both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">Sensor Tower</a> and <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Annie</a> released their year-end estimates on the app economy in 2021. Sensor Tower is forecasting that, by the end of the year, Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play will see a combined record consumer spend of $133 billion and 143.6 billion downloads. Its report came out first and we covered it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">here on TechCrunch</a>. Today, we&#8217;ve got App Annie&#8217;s report in our hands, too.</p>
<p>App Annie&#8217;s estimates come in slightly higher than Sensor Tower&#8217;s on consumer spend, but lower on downloads. App Annie says global consumers will spend a record $135 billion across the App Store and Google Play in 2021, up from $112 billion in 2020. However, it reports 140 billion new app installs, instead of 143.6 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The firm also found iOS spending continues to top Android spending. It notes that 65 cents in every <span class="il">app</span> economy dollar is now spent by Apple users. And gamers spend the most. They will have contributed around 60% of the iOS revenue and nearly 80% of Google Play revenue in 2021. In total, gaming contributed around $90 billion of the total global spend in 2021.</p>
<p>App Annie also saw many of the same trends as Sensor Tower did, including the revenue growth in non-gaming categories, particularly entertainment and social apps &#8212; the former which is rising to $12 billion next year, or double that of 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of app downloads, India was the top market, contributing 20% of global downloads across both stores, followed by the U.S. (9%), then Brazil (8%).</p>

<p>App Annie selected TikTok as a top &#8220;breakout&#8221; app for consumer spending the year. (It&#8217;s No. 2 on App Annie&#8217;s &#8220;breakout&#8221; chart that ranks the apps that saw the biggest change in the past 12 months.) But TikTok is also influencing other apps. For example, a video editing app called CapCut &#8212; a popular TikTok editing tool &#8212; was the No. 1 breakout app by downloads.</p>

<p>App Annie&#8217;s report focuses more on &#8220;breakout&#8221; apps and games rather than the traditional top apps by downloads and consumer spending. It&#8217;s an interesting way to view the data as it points to more newcomers and fast risers, but it doesn&#8217;t tell you which were the &#8220;biggest&#8221; apps of the year, necessarily.

<h3>Apple doesn&#8217;t have to change its App Store yet, court rules</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2031365" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2031365" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2031365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?w=680" alt="Epic Games Inc.

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">will not have to implement changes</a> to its in-app purchase system and App Store guidelines as ordered by the judge’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruling in its court battle</a> with Epic Games. Apple largely won that case, as the court ruled Apple was not acting as a monopolist. But the company had been ordered to stop preventing app developers from adding links that pointed users to other means of paying for their in-app purchases outside the App Store. Both Apple and Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">appealed</a> the original ruling — Epic because it was not successful with its larger antitrust claims, and Apple because it disagreed with this aspect of the ruling over in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Apple originally had until December 9 to update its App Store policies, but had asked the court for a stay on the injunction regarding the changes to its in-app purchasing guidelines until the appeal was decided. Apple had tried to argue its case for a stay before but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">the lower court denied the motion</a>. Its latest attempt, however, was granted by the U.S. Court of Appels for the Ninth Circuit after Apple argued, among other things, that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-threatens-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-outside-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would have to come up with</a> a whole new system to commission purchases that took place outside the App Store. <em>Yep, that&#8217;s right</em> &#8212; Apple doesn&#8217;t think that allowing app developers to point to their own websites for payments means it can&#8217;t still take a cut. (After all, isn&#8217;t that what Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to do in South Korea?)</p>
<p>In any event, Apple successfully argued this would cause &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; as Apple wouldn&#8217;t get back the money, time and resources it spent on this new system if the appeal came through in its favor. As a result, Apple won&#8217;t have to make any changes until the appeals court has heard the case.</p>
<h3>Instagram goes to Congress</h3>

<p>Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">testified before Congress</a> for the first time Wednesday to defend the app&#8217;s teen safety track record. Senators were not impressed with the 3 AM release of promised teen safety features the night before the testimony as some sort of last-minute effort to look like the company had plans to fix its systems. There was a sense of frustration in asking Mosseri many of the same questions that had been asked to other Meta execs over the past couple of years, Sen. Blackburn (R-TN) noted, saying &#8220;I feel like the conversation repeats itself ad nauseam. Nothing changes &#8212; nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mosseri denied that research showed Instagram&#8217;s products were addictive and said the company had put into place protections and age-approrpriate experiences for minor ages 13-17 on the app. But Blackburn&#8217;s office had discovered teens&#8217; accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">still defaulted to public rather than private</a> when created on the web. Mosseri also used the hearing to propose a new industry body that would create a series of best practices for apps around things like age verification, parental controls and product designs for teens and kids.</p>
<p>Social media algorithms got a beating during the hearing as well, and Mosseri revealed Instagram was planning t<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-says-the-app-will-offer-a-chronological-feed-option-early-next-year/">o bring back the chronological feed next year</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Dating</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tinder offered a look back at 2021 with its &#8220;<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-12-06-Tinder-Year-in-Swipe-2021-TM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year in Swipe</a>.&#8221;</strong> The company shared silly metrics like a 40% increase in the side-eye emoji in bios in the year, as well as more interesting ones, like a 52% increase in mentions of &#8220;video call&#8221; in bios, and 20% increase in &#8220;close by&#8221; and &#8220;nearby&#8221; in bios, indicating a desire to connect in real life. Users also prompted they were vaxxed (bio mentions grew by over 3x) and vax badges were the most popular badge among Gen Z users.</li>

<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ViacomCBS is partnering with Wattpad,</strong> an app hosting an original stories community whose projects are often adapted into books, TV and film by major companies, including Netflix, Hulu and others. <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/viacomcbs-international-studios-partners-with-wattpad-webtoon-studiosto-discover-diverse-talent-and-develop-series-from-webtoon-and-wattpad-hits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ViacomCBS says</a> it will work with Wattpad and sister company Webtoon, both now owned by Naver, to develop original content for its sites and networks, including the Paramount+ streaming service.</li>

<li><strong>Twitter&#8217;s live audio rooms, Twitter Spaces, can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">now be recorded</a> for later listening.</strong> The feature works on iOS, Android and now the web, too.</li>

<li><strong>Netflix again expanded its mobile gaming lineup with three more casual gaming titles,</strong> &#8220;Dominoes Cafe,&#8221; &#8220;Knittens&#8221; and &#8220;Wonderputt Forever,&#8221; and says it has two more coming soon, a rhythm game, &#8220;Haxtech Mayhem,&#8221; and a card strategy game, &#8220;Arcanium: Rise of Akhan.&#8221; The company now has a gaming catalog of at least 10 games.</li>

The debate got so heated, some WildWorks employees moderating the Discord had to step back for their own mental health after threats, vulgarity and hate were directed at them.</li>

<h3><strong>Government &amp; Policy</strong></h3>

<li><strong>A <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report by The Information revealed</a> Apple CEO Tim Cook signed a five-year agreement with Chinese officials</strong> which committed Apple to doing its part to help develop China&#8217;s economy and progress through investments, business deals and worker training, to help better its ties with the Chinese government &#8212; which has not yet retailed against Apple, despite U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies, like Huawei.</li>
<li><strong>The U.S. Justice Dept.&#8217;s antitrust investigation of Apple is <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-treatment-of-roblox-in-spotlight-in-doj-antitrust-probe?irclickid=XJDwoH1oAxyIRbBy4Ny0hXW6UkGzpnw5TTi5XA0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;utm_term=macrumors.com&amp;rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now exploring how Apple&#8217;s treatment of Roblox</a> seems to differ from how it&#8217;s treating Fortnite,</strong> owned by Epic Games (which is appealing its own antitrust lawsuit). Roblox had changed its website and app to replace the word &#8220;games&#8221; with &#8220;experiences&#8221; after an Apple exec said in court that Apple wouldn&#8217;t consider Roblox a game.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-sues-russia-over-app-store-abuse-warning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued Russia&#8217;s Federal Antimonopoly Service</a> over a warning it received about its App Store related to the anti-steering clause in its App Store policies,</strong> which says developers can&#8217;t inform customers in-app or through emails about other ways to pay for goods and services beyond the app, which Russia has determined to be market abuse. Apple had failed to comply with the changes requested, which could see it facing fines.</li>
<li><strong>Ireland&#8217;s data protection regulator, the DPC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/dpc-instagram-draft-decision/">announced</a> a draft decision sent to other EU DPAs</strong> in relation to a Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) investigation over Instagram&#8217;s handling of children&#8217;s data. It could still be more than half a year before any final decision on the complaint is made.</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A report by <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Markup</a> details how Tile&#8217;s new owner, family communication app Life360, is a large location data broker</strong> that sells data to Cuebiq, Allstate&#8217;s Arity, SafeGraph and X-Mode. (The first two are disclosed in the app&#8217;s privacy policy.) Data brokers resell the information gathered from apps to other customers, like hedge funds or for use in targeted advertising. However, X-Mode has sold to the U.S. DoD and SafeGraph has sold to the CDC in the past. Life360 as of last year had a policy against selling data to government agencies, however. The company says its contracts probit re-identifying individuals, after it anonymizes their data. Two former employees confirmed Life360 takes precautions to remove location histories from individuals, but said it doesn&#8217;t further fuzz, hash or aggregate or reduce the precision of the location data, as it should. The app doesn&#8217;t sell data on users under 13, per COPPA guidelines. It offers an opt-out of data sharing on its Permissions screen and the company says &#8220;millions&#8221; of its customers have used that option.</li>
<li>The FT (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/apple-reaches-quiet-truce-over-iphone-privacy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica</a>) reports that<strong> Apple has allowed companies like Facebook and Snap to continue tracking user data </strong>from those who have asked the apps &#8220;not to track&#8221; them as long as the data is anonymized and aggregated instead of being tied to specific user profiles. This allows companies to target ads at a cohort level, which some argue is a looser interpretation of the &#8220;do not track&#8221; rules.</li>
<li>Verizon&#8217;s network is collecting data about some users&#8217; browsing history, location, apps and contacts, according to a report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Input</a>. The data is shared unless the customer opts out from the setting in the My Verizon app.</li>

<p>Looking to decorate for the holidays?&#8230;Not your home, that is, but your phone?</p>
<p>A number of iOS home screen theming apps have rolled out holiday features, allowing users who celebrate to theme their icons, widgets and wallpapers to get into the Christmas spirit. Apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aesthetic-kit/id1533330948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aesthetic Kit</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brass-custom-icons-widgets/id1533158013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brass</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screenkit-app-icons-widgets/id1533393982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ScreenKit</a> have <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1533393982?eventid=6442685334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tons of Christmas Themes</a>, which they&#8217;re promoting by way of those new App Store Events. If you come across an event, you can tap it to launch directly into the Christmas section of the app you have installed. If you&#8217;re not into Christmas, the winter themes could be another good look for this time of year. In addition to the iOS home screen apps, other apps focused on motivational quote widgets, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motivation-daily-quotes/id876080126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motivation</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-daily-affirmations/id874656917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Am</a>, among others, have also added selections of Christmas-themed quotes and affirmations (great for those trying to survive a trip home to see the fam, perhaps!).</p>
<p>More companies are embracing the iOS home screen customization trend, which has remained popular since the launch of the iOS 14 widgets. People figured out how to use Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts to update their icons&#8217; look to match their widgets and wallpapers, creating a whole new category of apps as app makers emerged to simplify the process through the use of downloadable profiles that can install all your icon designs at once. (Apple, for now, turns a blind eye to the use of profiles for this purpose. But if Apple comes out later with its own version of Android&#8217;s Material You, well, who knows&#8230;).</p>
<p>Some apps also offer custom icons for their paying customers, but Twitter is taking things even further. Although its Twitter Blue subscription doesn&#8217;t just offer alternative icons, it&#8217;s making seasonally themed icons, too. Its winter collection is rolling out now.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still not <em>ENTIRELY</em> sure Apple meant to approve this one, so get it while you can? The new Apple Watch app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser/id1590622755">uBrowser</a>, offers a limited mobile browser experience for Watch owners. It lets you create bookmarks, see your recently visited pages and search the web using DuckDuckGo, which means it&#8217;s&#8230;kinda like a real browser. Except, of course, many web pages can&#8217;t run on watchOS through the app &#8212; particularly JavaScript-heavy pages or those that would require video playback. Web pages that need a login won&#8217;t work either. The app uses the Authentication dialogue to open a website on watchOS (this is meant to allow users a way to provide their credentials to an app that requires web authentication.) The app also offers an iOS companion where you can manage your bookmarks.</p>
<p>Founder Arno Appenzeller says he began work on the app after seeing complaints that said the new Series 7 Watch needed a browser &#8212; and he agreed. He decided to see if his app would pass App Review, as other browser apps had. This was a risk as the other browser apps are different &#8212; the watchOS app Parrot requires an iPhone to be nearby and Lazer only supports a reader mode experience, for example. UBrowser was approved twice so far &#8212; once for launch and a second time for an update, so maybe it&#8217;s not a mistake! The app is 99 cents on the App Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>If you don’t understand this headline, let’s start with a quick history lesson.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift is rerecording all of her albums, but not in the name of nostalgia. Instead, Swift is taking on this much-anticipated project so that she can control her music instead of a separate music label. The first of her iconic albums came out this year, annotated with &#8220;(Taylor’s Version)&#8221; so longtime fans can stream music that benefits the star not the archival music owned by the label.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246130" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup lesson, baked within Swift’s bold move, is less of a leap than you’d think: 2021 reminded me of the power of self-advocacy and the importance of changing your mind.</p>
<p>In 2021, we saw employees begin to ask more from their employers. The Great Resignation was more than just a hiring nightmare, it was a concerted effort from employees to leave current jobs in pursuit of something more, less or balanced. Some even went the solo route, pursuing the glamor of the creator economy and betting on themselves. These individuals, like Swift, made me think about how to manage and scale influence as you mature in your career. Sometimes, that means rerecording all of your albums. Other times, it means speaking up about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/10/venture-capital-2021/">the gaslighting that happens in fundraising. </a></p>
<p>Self-advocacy can often hinge on unlearning things you thought to be true. For Swift, she changed her mind on the role she wants to play in owning her music. In 2014, Swift turned to the WSJ to argue against streaming, piracy and file-sharing, saying that “music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It&#8217;s my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album&#8217;s price point is.&#8221; In 2021, Swift turned her attention away from taking down Spotify and Apple Music, and instead focused on ownership as a channel to establish value.</p>
<p>This year, I changed my mind on a lot of stuff, from what constitutes an unconventional path to entrepreneurship to when it’s time to question the status quo (despite it being status quo). My job stayed the same — report on emerging fund managers and founders, and the contrarian decisions they make — but the way I executed looks differently. For example, I used to think asking founders about their competitors was a good litmus test for candidness, but now I ask the same folks for their most disagreeable belief on how to build — and it works far, far better.</p>
<p>The empowerment of the individual, and urge to Speak Now, has been a defining feeling of the year. For more on what I unlearned about startups this year, check out my TechCrunch+ column: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/what-i-unlearned-about-startups-this-year/">“What I unlearned about startups this year.”</a></p>
<p>Before we jump into the rest of this newsletter, I want to pass on my condolences and prayers to anyone who knew Tyson Clark, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/tyson-clark-a-general-partner-with-gv-has-passed-away/">a general partner at GV who passed away</a> this week at the age of 43. Clark was one of the most prominent Black investors in the venture industry, with a respectful legacy that will clearly be missed by many.</p>
<p>For the rest of today, we’ll talk about diversity in money, climate versus crypto and the trucking creator economy. As always, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natashathereporter/?hl=en">@natashathereporter. </a></p>
<h2>Diverse investor initiatives</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246109" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg" alt="zane venture fund" width="1024" height="731" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg 5492w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=1536,1097 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=2048,1463 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC01088-Edit.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zane Venture FundWhen Shila Nieves Burney was doing first close for <a href="https://www.zane.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zane Venture Fund</a>, a venture capital firm she built to invest in diverse founding teams, she realized that she didn’t see any women by herself, and barely any people of color.</p>
<p>“This is a problem,” she said. “And I felt like that I could continue to raise like this, but I’m going to continue to make white men rich.” Today, the emerging fund manager announced the closing of a $1 million &#8220;diverse investor initiative&#8221; in which ZVF allocated 25 slots in its debut fund to LPs who identify as women and people of color. SEC filings show that Zane Venture Fund is seeking <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1851434/000090571821000709/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">to raise up to $25 million for its debut fund, </a> so Burney’s carve-out plays a small yet empowering role in who benefits from the vehicle’s eventual returns.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While Burney explained that the broader fundraising environment for minority emerging managers “has slowed down tremendously” compared to earlier this year. It reminds her of when she was first fundraising in 2018, when LPs said that diversity was not a strategy nor differentiator. “I just keep on doing it as my thesis, and while that was the wave a year ago, it’s just cold right now … we’re finding our tribe of LPs.”</p>

<p>Climate is shaping up to be the spotlight sector of 2022. Most recently, I scooped the launch of Climactic,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/climactic-raj-kapoor-josh-felser/"> a new firm built by former Lyft CSO and a Freestyle Capital co-founder</a>. The duo is taking on the newly hot sector by focusing on companies that will help enterprises execute on their carbon emissions goals.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Kapoor admitted that Climactic expertise-specific climate knowledge is “light” compared to the “OG climate investors.” Entrepreneurs are largely asking Climactic for enterprise sales, marketing and pricing help; not nitty-gritty explanations on the bounds of cellular meat commercialization. The firm has employed a number of consultants who have been former head of sales and marketing at other companies, leading to cross-pollination between scientists in charge of revolutionary technology, and people who are less in the weeds.</p>

<p>TrueNorth! Built by Jin Stedge and Sanjaya Wijeratne, the early-stage startup raised $50 million this year to empower independent truckers to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/truenorth-has-raised-50-million-from-sam-altman-and-others-to-empower-independent-truckers/"> run their current businesses more efficiently. </a>It helps with finding, booking and coordinating gigs, accepting payments and optimizing routes.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>: The business-in-a-box format may have gotten quieter in startup pitch land, but it’s still very much a viable strategy — especially in antiquated businesses. As I mentioned during the latest Equity, TrueNorth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/your-local-trucker-is-giving-us-creator-economy-vibes/">is giving me creator economy vibes</a> (and is positioning itself to expand to many more, hopefully lucrative verticals).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>What a week, y’all. What a week. Somehow the news is still at it, even if we’re an inch away from the back half of December. So much for a holiday slowdown! Up first, some notes on the week’s key news, then we’re talking vector search and some final book recs. Into the breach!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The end of SPACs as we know them:</strong> It’s a gosh darn dumb idea to spend time calling <em>top</em> on any particular market movement &#8212; it’s a great way to look silly in public. Still, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/business/trump-spac-stock.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing smoke</a> surrounding the Trump Media SPAC has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/the-sec-is-curious-about-trumps-spac-deal/">reached smog levels</a> as the BuzzFeed SPAC deal did everything in its power to fail at the finish line, only to limp public and then shed nearly half its value. Top? Top.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto vs. TradFi: </strong>It’s not my place to get in the middle of religious warfare, but the technology market really does need to decide how to fund and build crypto companies. And the answer probably isn’t venture capital? This week we saw the <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/long-time-lyft-cfo-departs-to-become-cfo-at-nft-marketplace-opensea/">OpenSea IPO expectations</a></strong> met not with warmth by its users, but contempt. Going <em>public?</em> Why not issue a token and stay in the crypto space? Well, because a lot of trad money went into OpenSea, and those investors need to pay back <em>their</em> investors in dollars, not digital duckets. How to solve this? Unclear, but I wonder if, long term, we’ll see crypto companies build entirely off traditional finance rails. Why not?</li>
<li><strong>SaaS multiples: </strong>I am sorry that I did not write this up, but we’ve seen one of the <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1469341159034134528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpest negative movements</a></strong> in software valuations in recent memory recently. Sure, prices are still high but not nearly as much as they were. Watch out, overpriced unicorns.</li>
<li><strong>And, finally, Instacart just lost its president: </strong>Mere months after she joined, <strong><a href="https://t.co/mvO5xymHwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart is shedding a high-profile hire</a></strong>. The Exchange wrote a tiny bit about Instacart back in November, noting reports indicating that Instacart’s growth rate has slammed back to Earth after its pandemic bump moderated. The company <em>is</em> still growing, albeit slowly. Slow growth, however, won’t let the company go public at a price that makes sense. So, what’s ahead? We have no idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get coverage for your company. And, vector search.</h2>
<p>One of the best bits of being a reporter in the technology space is spending time with smart people who can explain the future to you. Not in the <em>soon we’ll be in the metaverse</em> sense, but in the <em>here’s a tech that is going to change the way we handle information in the future</em> sense.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246180" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Enter<a href="https://twitter.com/bobvanluijt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Bob van Luijt</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.semi.technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semi Technologies</a>. The startup is building <a href="https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weaviate</a>. Like with a great many startups today, Semi is a for-profit OSS company. More simply, it is building a business atop an open source project, namely Weaviate.</p>
<p>Bob was kind enough to not only spend a few hours talking me through his company, the market for searching unstructured data and how Weaviate works but also to scrape TechCrunch’s 2021 output and put it into a little GUI so that I could play around with it.</p>
<p>This is a great way to get reporters to care about your company, by the way. Not the scraping work; that was an extra kindness &#8212; but to spend a lot of time answering somewhat silly questions with patience, even when the reporter in question has to retread lots of ground.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A reallllly underrated skill that some founders have is the capability to teach me stuff with patience</p>
<p>writing about a co later this week because the CEO has spent a good bit of time slowly taking me through a bit of tech I had previously never touched/learned about</p>
<p>&mdash; alex (@alex) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1466091537339666432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Anyway, vector search. What Weaviate allows for is the searching of unstructured data, quickly. Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-lab-vector-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says that vector search</a> “uses deep learning models to encode data sets into meaningful vector representations, where distance between vectors represent the similarities between items.”</p>
<p>Bob made this a bit simpler with an example. In a traditional database, you might have data indicating that the Statue of Liberty is in New York City and that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris. But to snag those data points, you’d have to search for something precise. With vector search — via Weaviate or a related software product — you can ask the data to show you what the database has about landmarks in France. And get the Eiffel Tower data to arise.</p>
<p>Neat, right? Very. Tinkering with <a href="https://techcrunch.vectors.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the TechCrunch portal that Bob and his team were kind enough to set up</a>, I was most taken with a question that they suggested: “Who writes the TechCrunch newsletter when Alex Wilhelm is out?” Frankly, this is a fun query due to its imprecision. Which TechCrunch newsletter? And what does <em>out</em> mean? Well, the search results managed to find a bit of text from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tracking-startup-focus-in-the-latest-y-combinator-cohort/">this very column</a> noting that I was taking a day off and that Anna would be handling the newsletter herself.</p>
<p>Very cool. Semi Technologies is a pretty young company, but one that I am keeping tabs on. For a few reasons, first of which being that open source startups are nearly always more interesting than their closed-code brethren. Mostly because founders building with OSS tech tend to have a slightly less hard-grind approach to business, and because I like Bob.</p>
<p>More to come once I can condense my nearly 3,000 words of spaghetti notes from calls with Semi into something a bit more coherent.</p>

<h2>Book Recs</h2>
<p>After spending quite a lot of time this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/gift-guide-the-best-non-business-books-for-2021-recommended-by-vcs/">working on our two-part</a> venture capital book recommendation list, we’re adding some of our own favorites to the mix. Of course, grains of salt as books are as personal as paintings, but we can’t help but share some of the best stuff that we read this year!</p>
<h3>Some of Anna’s favorite 2021 reads:</h3>
<p><strong>Fiction:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-be-Mild-Adventures-Anxious/dp/0751574732" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Born to be Mild: Adventures for the Anxious</strong></a><strong>, by Rob Temple</strong></p>
<p>According to my records, this was the first book I read in 2021, but 12 months on, it really stuck with me. You may know its author, Rob Temple, as the man behind the hilarious social media accounts and book series <a href="https://twitter.com/SoVeryBritish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Very British Problems</a>. But this book is different. It is an account of his struggle with anxiety and of his attempts to get out of his comfort zone. It is touching, highly relatable and often very funny — if you are a Sue Townsend fan like me, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll love this, too.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Numbers-Statistics-Knowing/dp/1474619967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How to Read Numbers: A Guide to Statistics in the News (and Knowing When to Trust Them)</strong></a><strong>, by David Chivers and Tom Chivers</strong></p>
<p>This is the book I am reading right now, with the caveat that I am not nearly done yet — but this is very promising. It might add fuel to the media backlash, but it has a point: A lot of the numbers we read about in the news need to be taken carefully. Which makes it a great read for journalists and news readers alike. The more expert readers become at reading numbers, the more sophisticated we will be able to get in our analysis.</p>
<h3>Some of Alex’s favorite 2021 reads:</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Salvation-Novel-Sequence-Book-ebook/dp/B07837SGSY/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Salvation+Sequence&amp;qid=1639162670&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Salvation Sequence</strong></a><strong>, by Peter F. Hamilton</strong></p>
<p>The best science fiction doesn’t simply slap spaceships atop the world we live in and call it a day. Indeed, the best science fiction remolds everything, from economics to humanity to science to physics itself. “The Salvation Sequence” is a series of books I read this year that did just that. From economics and dealing with aliens to what it means to truly be human and future politics, it’s all in there. And it’s a hell of a ride. I can’t wait for the next installment to come out so that I can read the whole damn series again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Called-Empire-Arkady-Martine-ebook/dp/B07C7BCB88/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=A+Memory+Called+Empire&amp;qid=1639162683&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A Memory Called Empire</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Desolation-Called-Peace-Teixcalaan-Book-ebook/dp/B07QPJHNSM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=A+Desolation+Called+Peace&amp;qid=1639162691&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A Desolation Called Peace</strong></a><strong>, by Arkady Martine</strong></p>
<p>There is more than one way to draw the future. Martine sketches a future where the concept of civilization and barbarism collide with art and empire. And memory. And hidden technologies and war. It’s more than I can truly describe for you in a short blurb, other than to say that what Martine has managed to build inside her sci-fi universe is nearly more art than science. And that’s high, <em>high</em> praise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Sun-Between-Earth-Book-ebook/dp/B084G9YRK3/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Black+Sun&amp;qid=1639162699&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Black Sun</strong></a><strong>, by Rebecca Roanhorse</strong></p>
<p>Fantasy novels are far too often rip-offs of European feudal history. Oh your duke is being an ass? Better get the serfs to rebel! That sort of thing. And then there’s Black Sun, which takes fantasy in an entirely different direction. Seemingly inspired by South and Central American traditions, it’s a gosh darn rollercoaster of good. A must read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Graduate-Novel-Scholomance-Book-ebook/dp/B08K7KY8Q7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Last+Graduate&amp;qid=1639162706&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Last Graduate</strong></a><strong>, by Naomi Novik</strong></p>
<p>Novik is a damn fine writer. “Uprooted” and “Spinning Silver” both kicked ass. But her masterwork, from my perspective, is “A Deadly Education.” It came out back in late 2020. And thus my countdown to its sequel, “The Last Graduate,” started. Rare is it that I count down the days until a book comes out, but here I had no choice. And “The Last Graduate” was superb. If you want to meet a protagonist unlike any you’ve ever read, and enter a world where everything has teeth, read these books. Read them. You will thank yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Safety in modern cars is no longer simply a question of engineering. It&#8217;s a technology and design challenge that is dependent on sensors and software and hinges on a user experience that is clear and intuitive for drivers.</p>
<p>So how does Volvo, a company synonymous with safety, convince customers that it&#8217;s innovative, forward thinking and nimble without dropping its core safety message? The stakes: either Volvo keeps up with the speed of change in this brave new world or it risks its reputation as the automaker most identified with safety.</p>
<p>Hints about how Volvo intends to hit that fast-moving, innovative yet safe sweet spot can be found in its approach towards going public — it&#8217;s taking the traditional IPO path — and its future vehicle plans. In contrast, its spin-off sibling Polestar, is going public via a merger with blank check company and has tried to position itself as a nimble leader in tech and design.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246181" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polestar&#8217;s approach inadvertently helps distinguish Volvo itself as the more cautionary leader in safety. It also sets up Volvo for differentiation, but with access to the latest innovations proved out on Polestar models.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we&#8217;re seeing is a transformation of the industry like we did in the mobile industry some time ago, where new capabilities, new possibilities, new sensors are coming in, so I think it&#8217;s a really interesting area,&#8221; said Thomas Stovicek, head of UX for Volvo. &#8220;At the same time, that can provide a lot of complexity for the user, so when we talk about user experience we very often talk about ease of use for a customer and understanding problems when you put it in the environment in a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even a brand considered the vanguard for safety can have setbacks. Modern vehicle safety extends beyond the car to the vast amounts of data required to operate these systems. Volvo announced Friday that some of its research and development data was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/volvo-had-some-rd-data-stolen-in-security-breach/">stolen in a security breach</a>. The company was quick to address safety concerns in a statement, &#8220;Volvo does not see, with currently available information, that this has an impact on the safety or security of its customers&#8217; cars or their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Olaf versus Elsa</h2>
<p>Polestar charts a different course when it defines corporate identity, Volvo is &#8220;safety and autonomy-centric&#8221; whereas Polestar is &#8220;technology and performance centric.&#8221; Volvo is also &#8220;safe and responsible&#8221; and Polestar is &#8220;sustainable and progressive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Polestar is cool and minimal; being in a Volvo is more like a warm security blanket. To continue on the Scandinavian metaphor, think about the plot of Frozen: Volvo&#8217;s exudes the comforting allure of Olaf while Polestar is ice-queen trailblazer Elsa.</p>
<p>Volvo&#8217;s strategy has been to proceed with caution, which runs counter to how its sister brand Polestar has evolved.</p>
<p>For instance, even though Volvo was involved in the development of the Android Automotive operating system with Google, the Polestar brand introduced the system first, and subsequently earned headlines like &#8220;<a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37516315/polestar-2-ev-drive/">Polestar Wants to Make Electric Cars in a Way Volvo Can&#8217;t</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polestar as a newcomer, is still relatively small, selling about 10,000 vehicles a year to Volvo&#8217;s half million, and is looking to make a name for itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polestar is and will be the technology leader for the larger Group, a Polestar spokesperson wrote in an email. &#8220;A good example already in-market is the Google infotainment system: it debuted on Polestar 2 first; Volvo then followed with XC40 Recharge and now XC60. You&#8217;ll see more of that in the coming years as new technologies roll out &#8212; Polestar first, then Volvo.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Lightening the load</h2>
<p>In contrast to Polestar&#8217;s forward thinking message, when it comes to customer-facing tech, Volvo has shifted the in-car experience to less-is-more. That system is also underpinned by the advent of Android Automotive OS.</p>
<p>Volvo wants the system to lighten the cognitive load on the driver, and employs behavioral psychologists on its research team to understand how information varies from person to person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think at a high level principle, we&#8217;re trying to simplify that complexity and provide that in a way to users,&#8221; says Stovicek. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more that can be done. Zero collision is something that we&#8217;re striving for and I think that there&#8217;s a lot of interesting things to do with the new capabilities that are coming in the platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means less dinging, buzzing and distracting notifications, unless used to alert the driver of an emergency. A Volvo spokesperson said, &#8220;It is not about hiding features per se, but it&#8217;s about simplifying the user experience and minimizing distractions for the driver.</p>
<p>Volvo Cars designs and develops everything around the person using it &#8212; not around the technology &#8212; and strives for an as intuitive user experience as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, as screens have crept into cars, automakers threw the kitchen sink into their suite of infotainment control. When Volvo first introduced the XC90, it was among the first group of automakers to make the screen standard using the older Sensus OS. The brand is now working to further distill the information it presents to the driver. They&#8217;ve commissioned NVIDIA to collect anonymized safety data on inputs lidar sensors, radar, and cameras that require graphic processing to improve their understanding.</p>

<p>On a recent drive of the Volvo XC60, I noticed that the infotainment screen was both simplified and brighter than the last generation. I also noticed that the wireless charging system didn&#8217;t readily kick in. I had to open the settings in order to activate it. Less choice on the immediate screen is the antithesis of new cars over the past decade.</p>
<p>For decades, Volvo has doubled down on its reputation for making the safest vehicles on the road. When Volvo makes claims about its safety record, it&#8217;s a reputation that&#8217;s been earned through the company&#8217;s breakthrough R&amp;D.</p>
<p>In 1959, it was seatbelts. In 1972, the rear-facing car seat, followed by a booster seat in 1978. Side impact collision protection was introduced in 1994. Collision avoidance and then pedestrian protection followed in 2008. That same year, Volvo set a goal that no one should be seriously injured in their cars. In 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#8217;s New Car Assessment Program gave 11 Volvo vehicles a top safety rating.</p>
<h2>Hands free</h2>
<p>What carmakers are up against is the desire of their customers to effectively override their onboard system using the least safe aspect of driving: personal smartphones. Volvo is prioritizing ways to keep the devices out of consumers hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users were using their mobile phone in order to achieve certain functionality that we were not providing in the car and that created an unsafe like environment and we wanted to avoid that,&#8221; said Annika Adolfsson, assistant head of UX &amp; Event at Design Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>This solution was built into the Android Automotive architecture to accommodate third party apps and a platform that would be safe to use while driving.</p>
<p>Volvo worked with the Android, Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play Stories teams, and the results show up in a simple, clean experience. &#8220;What is more interesting in the products we have developed is that it&#8217;s a platform that will live for a long time, Adolfsson says.</p>
<p>Volvo is also addressing the future safety by intervening as soon as the driver gets in the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have tried to think about how this experience of someone coming into the car for the first time and how can we help them,&#8221; Adolfsson said. &#8220;In our previous cars, you had to go and find the settings.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Safety first</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2246339" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246339" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2246339 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Volvo_S90_Small_Overlap_Crash_Test.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246339" class="wp-caption-text">Volvo S90 Small Overlap Crash Test <strong>Image credit</strong>: Volvo</p></div></p>
<p>Far too often, examples appear that show safety and technology advancement are not always congruous, especially when human judgment is involved.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where things get sticky. Search &#8220;Tesla and self-driving accident.&#8221; Despite Tesla&#8217;s reputation for taking chances, it hasn&#8217;t dinged the company&#8217;s astronomical value. (It&#8217;s worth adding that Tesla still earns high marks on Model 3 crash safety.)</p>
<p>Tesla and Volvo, like all automakers, are in a sprint to incorporate more ADAS functionality into future products to be on the cutting edge. But the integration of new technology isn&#8217;t always aligned with consumer trust, and a general sense of feeling safe.</p>
<p>Only one in 10 drivers would feel comfortable in a fully autonomous vehicle, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/widespread-av-adoption-starts-with-driver-assistance-systems-consumers-can-trust/">recent study by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://group.volvocars.com/company/innovation/autonomous-drive">On its website</a>, Volvo says &#8220;Recent consumer surveys show that Volvo is the car maker most trusted to safely introduce autonomy.&#8221; The company writes that its a few years away from a fully autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>What Volvo is betting on is that it can convince its customers it can be both early to self-driving systems and safer than ever, all while it also convinces consumers that it can be a premier electric vehicle maker. To get there, it&#8217;s proceeding with caution for good reason.</p>
<p>Of course, this thinking begs the question: why does technology that will ultimately make roads safer have to be called tech first? It&#8217;s an interesting conundrum on what it means to play it safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taylor Swift has impeccable timing. First, she released “Red,” an album about heartbreak and hurt, while I was in the thick of high school. My now-retired Tumblr is still thankful. More recently, Swift took on a project to rerecord her earlier albums, reclaiming her music from her old record label &#8212; this time with her own ownership as a key difference. Her first rerecording, of “Fearless” &#8212; annotated with “(Taylor’s Version)” &#8212; came out this year.</p>
<p>Of course, I think there’s a pretty obvious tech angle here. Swift made a statement on artist empowerment and the importance of singer-owned music &#8212; record labels be damned &#8212; the same year that we saw tech defined by the Great Resignation, emerging entrepreneurs and distributed work. Like Swift, I think the tech scene is going through an uncomfortable period of changing their minds, questioning authority and getting closer to self-advocacy as a result.</p>
<p>Looking back, I unlearned a lot about startups this year, especially when it comes to due diligence, formalization and what it means to be contrarian.</p>
<h2>Due diligence is a differentiator</h2>
<p>When Spark Capital decided to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">sever all ties</a>” with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading a deal in the company, I immediately thought that it would set precedent across the venture capital industry. The move was triggered by a Business Insider investigation that exposed allegations from a woman who said that a member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>In some ways, I was right: Unshackled Ventures and Seven Seven Six <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">chose to step away</a> from the company as well, donating any profits from their respective investments to organizations focused on survivors of sexual assault. In other ways, I was not. It’s clear that there continues to be a disconnect between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/y-combinator-demo-day-dispo-due-diligence/">what happened with Dispo and the world of fast-moving due diligence.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford plans to increase production of the all-electric Mustang Mach E next year with the goal of tripling its current capacity by 2023 to meet &#8220;incredible demand,&#8221; CEO Jim Farley tweeted late Friday.</p>
<p>This is the first time the automaker has provided specific outlook for the Mustang Mach E.</p>
<p>Ford said in November that it would increase its production capacity of electric vehicles to 600,000 units globally by 2023 — a goal that would be spread across the Mustang Mach E, F-150 Lightning and commercial E-transit vans. If Ford hits that 600,000 figure it would double the number it had expected to produce over the next two years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tweet from Farley reads: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to produce Mustang Mach Es fast enough to meet the incredible demand, but we are sure going to try. So starting in 2022 we are increasing production and expect to reach 200,000+ units per year for North America and Europe by 2023. That&#8217;s 3X our 2021 output.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford confirmed to TechCrunch that it will be able to increase production capacity of the Mustang Mach E by building some of the vehicles at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico.</p>
<p>The tweet came the same day that <a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/ford-delays-explorer-aviator-evs-boost-mustang-mach-e-output" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automotive News reported</a> Ford was delaying the start of production of battery-electric versions of the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator crossovers by about 18 months, according to memos sent to suppliers and viewed by Automotive News. The EV versions of the Explorer and Aviator were supposed to be assembled at its Cuautitlan, Mexico factory.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ford has previously said it expected sales to be around 50,000 Mustang Mach E vehicles for the first year of production (MY 2021) in North America and Europe. Ford has sold <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2021/10/Sales/FoE-Q3-2021-salesTables_EU.pdf">15,602 Mach Es</a> in Europe through the end of the third quarter and 24,791 through end of November <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2021/12/02/ford-sales-21-november.pdf">in the U.S.</a>, according to the company&#8217;s latest sales data. At 40,393 vehicles to date, the company should hit its 50,000 sales goal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 10, 2021! Yes, it is Friday at last, which means we’re about one week away from news grinding to a halt so that we can all enter nerd hibernation for two weeks. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1469393611083194371">Not that your humble servant is counting down</a>. Still, we have a really solid mix of tech news today, featuring companies big and small. To work! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/"><strong>Better.com CEO gets the (partial) boot:</strong></a> It’s rare that a tech exec goes viral. Mark Zuckerberg has managed thanks to some of his more stilted attempts at engaging with regulars. But most tech denizens just aren’t pop culture figures. Until they are, of course. Such is the case with Better.com’s CEO, who went viral — everywhere, including TikTok — for callously firing a bunch of his staff via Zoom. Anyway, it turns out that he’s not a lovely person the rest of the time either and is now stepping back from his company.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/5-things-you-may-have-missed-in-atomicos-2021-europe-report/"><strong>Europe’s tech boom set to continue:</strong></a> The Exchange crew spent a good chunk of this Friday parsing the latest Atomic-Dealroom report on the European startup scene. Our takeaway was that while 2021 was a wildly good year for EU startups, the best could be just ahead, in calendar terms.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/"><strong>Hungry? Just Flink it:</strong></a><strong> </strong>OK so it turns out that turning startup name “Flink” into a verb is a bit awkward, but with the German instant grocery delivery service raising three-quarters of a billion dollars in a single go — pushing its valuation to $2.85 billion — it seems fair to expect that the Berlin-based company wants to reach verb status at least in its home market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The 2021 IPO cycle is coming to a close, with just Samsara’s debut yet to come by our reckoning. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/">what should we make of HashiCorp’s and Nubank’s pair of public offerings that touched down this week</a>? That the market for both OSS and fintech remains more than attractive enough to defend unicorn valuations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/renttherunway-style-uk-fashion-rental-marketplace-hurr-raises-5-4m-round-led-by-octopus/"><strong>HURR wants to iterate on the Rent the Runway model:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Rent the Runway’s IPO showed that the innovative business was struggling to cover its own operating costs. It has since stumbled as a public business. But that’s not stopping HURR, a British comp to the U.S. fashion rental giant. However, as TechCrunch noted in a bulletin regarding the company’s recent $5.4 million seed round, it has a few business model tweaks and additions that could prove material.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/wisdom-seed/"><strong>Wisdom sounds pretty neat:</strong></a> Wisdom is a startup that, per TechCrunch reporting, has built a “social audio app that’s focused on surfacing ‘life advice’ and broadening access to mentorship.” It sounds a bit like the Equity podcast, and by <em>like</em> we mean the <em>complete opposite</em>. Jokes aside, Wisdom just raised $2 million more. It declined to share user numbers, instead offering up the community-adjusted EBITDA of audio startup metrics, namely that “mentors on its platform have shared some 600,000 minutes” of audio. Cool?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nuvocargo-raises-20-5m-at-a-180m-valuation-to-bolster-trade-between-the-us-and-mexico/"><strong>Startup raises from Tiger, doubles valuation, didn’t even need the cash:</strong></a> I think that we could recycle that teaser line daily in this newsletter and not really ever miss. Still, today’s Tiger round is Nuvocargo, a Latin American logistics startup that is focused on facilitating cross-border trade. Its new $20.5 million round more than doubled its valuation to $180 million, up from $70 million earlier this year. “The company says it still had most of that cash in the bank when Tiger approached it,” TechCrunch notes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/tiggy-ready-to-take-on-canadian-food-delivery-incumbents-with-15-minute-option/"><strong>Everyone is building dark stores:</strong></a> The dark-store model for building rapid-delivery businesses is more than just a European project. Tiggy, a Canadian startup, just raised a $6.35 million round for its work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/breakout-ventures-has-a-new-112-5-million-fund-backed-by-tony-fadell-chris-sacca-and-others/"><strong>Breakout Ventures makes it to fund two:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the word from our own Connie Loizos. Fund II from Breakout is a $112.5 million vehicle, including money from the Thiel Foundation, oddly enough. Thiel money recycling in tech has struck us as odd ever since we realized he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding a political candidate busy attacking tech companies</a>.</li>

<p>Since the pandemic began, the rules of the game for growth marketing have changed considerably.</p>
<p>Consumers are embracing Apple’s iOS 14.5’s privacy changes, regulators are taking a greater interest in browser cookies, and The Great Resignation are just a few X factors, but there are many others.</p>
<p>“What worked yesterday may not work today and likely won’t work tomorrow,” writes Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer at Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures, and Simon Lejeune, user acquisition lead at Wealthsimple.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/3-disruptive-trends-that-will-shape-marketing-in-2022/">Here’s what they’re preparing for:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Less data, more privacy and the return of growth hacking.</li>
<li>TikTok, influencers and the dominance of native creative.</li>
<li>The Great Resignation and the Gettysburg for growth talent.</li>

That’s good. Enough to truly shake up its economic performance? We’ll see in its Q4 2021 numbers. Still, it’s a nice little data point about the growth of e-commerce in Africa.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch Experts returns with predictions for 2022, insights on product-led growth and strategies for early-stage startups that hope to expand internationally.</p>
<p>Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer at Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures, and Simon Lejeune, who leads user acquisition at Wealthsimple, shared three trends that they believe will shape marketing in 2022. With an eye on topics like privacy, growth hacking and influencer marketing, they wrote about the shifts they&#8217;re expecting in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Kerry Cunningham, senior principal at 6sense, updated a model that he and his former colleagues named the &#8220;Intent Data Framework (IDF).&#8221; Last year, he revised it to include &#8220;Buyer Signals Framework (BSF),&#8221; but she has reworked it again to include product-led growth.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245396" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Marjorie Radlo-Zandi, a seasoned entrepreneur, board member, mentor and angel investor, shared strategies founders can use when expanding internationally. From researching your market to setting goals, she covers it all and provides several examples.</p>
<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p>(TechCrunch) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/from-ph-d-to-boutique-software-developer-an-interview-with-solweys-andrew-drach/">From Ph.D. to boutique software developer: An interview with Solwey’s Andrew Drach</a>: Anna Heim interviewed Andrew Drach, a software development consultant who was widely recommended by respondents in a recent survey. Drach, who operates Solwey Consulting and Callentis Consulting Group with his wife Monika, spoke about how his academic background informs his work and why he preferred a boutique model when it comes servicing clients,</p>
<blockquote><p>We both had strained experiences working with large agencies and staffing agencies and feeling abandoned or not important enough to have the full attention of the managers or project owners. Furthermore, we both had seen firsthand how terrifyingly crippling waterfall and broken agile could be for the progress of a project. So we set out to build Solwey and Callentis as small-by-design agencies. We directly engage with our clients, and Monika and I take personal responsibility for every single deliverable from our team.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Growth marketing</h2>

Instead of relying on one signal such as a verbal expression of intent, &#8220;the best way to use them is to throw them into the algorithmic blender with all the other signals that are available to identify patterns that can help prioritize sales efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/4-key-strategies-for-succeeding-at-international-expansion/">(TechCrunch+) 4 key strategies for succeeding at international expansion:</a> We&#8217;ll give you part of one key strategy that&#8217;s behind the paywall: &#8220;In order to achieve international growth, you need to plan based on ROI estimates,&#8221; Radlo-Zandi writes. &#8220;Narrow down the markets for the first phase of global growth by determining which is most viable and sizable for what you offer. Assess how easy or difficult it will be to enter a particular market, and whether its size justifies the effort it will take to establish a solid footprint.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/3-disruptive-trends-that-will-shape-marketing-in-2022/">(TechCrunch+) 3 disruptive trends that will shape marketing in 2022:</a> When making predictions for 2022, Metrick and Lejeune looked back at three trends that drove growth in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less data, more privacy and the return of growth hacking.</li>
<li>TikTok, influencers and the dominance of native creative.</li>
<li>The Great Resignation and the Gettysburg for growth talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;This year has firmly illustrated that there will be no return to a predictable past,&#8221; they write. &#8220;2022 will reward marketers who look ahead with agility and are open to combining historical data with experimentation to chart a new path forward.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that the Bay Area's share of startup funding is shrinking shouldn't be cause for alarm — it's good news for the entire country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Detroit became the center of America&#8217;s automobile industry largely for logistical reasons: its midwestern location, high population density and proximity to raw materials were just a few factors that assured investors it was an optimal spot for building an industrial hub.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley&#8217;s tech ecosystem, on the other hand, was initially seeded by military research and a surge in college admissions after the Second World War that fostered a community of technologists and investors.</p>
<p>But those aren&#8217;t permanent geographic traits like being close to ports or large deposits of iron and copper ore.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246153" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Decades after Palo Alto&#8217;s first garage startup, talent and capital has become more evenly distributed: This year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/silicon-valleys-share-of-us-vc-funding-falls-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-decade/">Bay Area startups only attracted 27% of all U.S. seed- and early-stage venture dollars</a>.</p>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Use discount code <strong>TCPLUSROUNDUP</strong></a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>“It’s been more than 10 years since that percentage fell below 30%,” reports Mary Ann Azevedo, who analyzed “Beyond Silicon Valley,” a report released by investment firm Revolution and PitchBook.</p>
<p>She identified several factors pushing investors in major tech hubs to venture outside their own backyards in search of opportunities. Many readers may be surprised to learn which city is now the top destination for dollars from NYC and SF-based investors.</p>
<p>“This momentum we’re seeing now? You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said Revolution founder and CEO Steve Case.</p>
<p>Some might think &#8220;Silicon Valley’s share of US VC funding falls to lowest level in more than a decade&#8221; is a scary headline, but from my perspective as a resident, it&#8217;s great news. The San Francisco Bay Area has received tremendous benefits from making itself a magnet for technology talent and money, but it&#8217;s also had unintended impacts on the region&#8217;s infrastructure, housing and income inequality.</p>
<p>I mean, we have the best food and weather, but we certainly haven&#8217;t cornered the market on good ideas. If more people are starting up in cities like Cincinnati, Portland and Buffalo, not only will those communities benefit directly, we&#8217;ll also see new products and services that reflect a greater diversity of thought and location.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading, and I hope you have a great weekend.</p>

<p>A marketer is one of a startup&#8217;s most important first hires, but finding out just who your end users are and what they want from your product is even more important.</p>
<p>“You must first get to know your potential customer and what is going on in their life that will ultimately trigger them into using you,” writes Lucy Heskins, an early-stage startup marketing adviser.</p>
<p>Heskins shares three key questions that will help you better understand target customers, along with recommendations for how to apply the data you&#8217;ll gather in future marketing campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would a customer subscribe to your product?</li>
<li>What triggers your customer to decide your product is the one?</li>
<li>Who else are you competing against?</li>
</ul>

<p>Investment management is one of a few industries where a manager’s win comes at another’s loss, writes Versatile VC founder David Teten and Katina Stefanova, CIO and CEO of Marto Capital.</p>
<p>“If you eat a great steak dinner, it doesn’t imply that others have to eat hot dogs. In asset management, each new money manager who generates alpha (returns above the passive benchmark performance) does so at the expense of other managers who underperform.”</p>
<p>In the first post in a series that examines investment management, Teten and Stefanova give us a look at the current state of the industry and explain why it is primed for disruption.</p>

<p>In his latest guest post for TechCrunch+, OpenView partner Kyle Poyar explains why usage-based pricing “is a company-wide effort” that “requires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.”</p>
<p>It’s no fad: UBP went mainstream because SaaS companies that use it see dramatically higher growth and retention rates.</p>
<p>Citing examples from powerhouses like Twilio, Stripe, AWS and others, Poyar explains how UBP companies “share their customers’ success” and reduce their risk of ending up with a CRM packed “with lots of unprofitable customers.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists frequently say that valuing startups is “more art than science.” If that’s true, then it’s absurdist art, because most seed-stage businesses have no value.</p>
<p>In fact, seed-stage startups — companies that have not yet released a product, regardless of how many rounds they’ve raised — are probably worth less than zero using any rational valuation methodology. The only certainty at this stage is that the startup will keep losing more money until a product is released, at which point it’s <em>possible</em> that revenue may be generated. The chances of going out of business are high.</p>
<p>It’s not that much better for early-stage startups, which again, are not defined by rounds like Series A or Series B, but by how much <em>business progress </em>they’ve made. Once a seed-stage company has released a working product, the startup has reduced one of the two major risks facing the business: commercialization. At this stage, now a company must prove the new product or service can be turned into a scalable business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like seed-stage startups, early-stage companies are still very fragile, with little predictability of revenue or cash flows. By definition, once the business has become predictable, the company is in the growth or expansion stage. Without predictability, traditional valuation tools like discounted cash flow (DCF) are nearly useless.</p>
<p>So venture capitalists lie to entrepreneurs and pretend that seed- and early-stage startups have intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Why would investors agree to ascribe value to assets that have no objective current economic value?</p>
<p>I’ve heard many corporate executives ask this exact question, <a href="https://medium.com/touchdownvc/why-corporations-should-invest-in-startups-not-just-buy-them-196299d2438b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wondering whether it wouldn’t be better simply to acquire startups instead of funding them</a>, usually in hopes that rational valuation techniques can be applied.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The best answer, based on my experience as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur for three decades, has nothing to do with valuation methodology and everything to do with teamwork, belief and commitment. Investors <em>must</em> be on the same team as the entrepreneurs they fund. And this means that each party needs an opportunity to win and must demonstrate that they believe in common goals. In venture capital, where <a href="https://medium.com/touchdownvc/grow-to-win-aded51a06526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors rely on high growth rates</a>, a “win-win” compensation design is much more important than a “technically correct” valuation.</p>
<p>At the seed stage, where the value is arguably zero, investors would own all of the startup with an investment of any amount. Obviously, no entrepreneur would willingly accept such an arrangement.</p>
<p>Thus, to be fair to the entrepreneur, the lie is born. We pretend the startup has value so that the startup’s team is motivated and everyone involved has a chance to win. The VC also won’t take a majority of the startup in most cases, because a control position means the entrepreneur is “working for” the investors. The philosophy of venture capital is that the entrepreneur runs the business and the investor provides capital and support in exchange for a minority share and a non-operational role.</p>
<p>I learned this from Bill Draper, who was one of the first venture capitalists on the West Coast in the 1960s. He said that in those early days, the goal was just to keep it simple, in contrast to the “financial engineering” that typified growth-stage investing on the East Coast.</p>
<p>His mantra back then was “half for the entrepreneur and half for the investors.” When investors realized that employees need motivation too, this became a third for the entrepreneur, a third for the investors and a third for employees. It’s not dramatically different today.</p>
<p>So if this is true, is there any role for valuation discipline at the seed or early stage?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, because the investor still needs to evaluate the deal as a potential source of return against other alternative investment opportunities, so long as the resulting valuation is fair to the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In fact, a good analogy for how this works may come from real estate. Prior to becoming a venture capitalist in 1992, I worked as a real estate appraiser. Appraisers use three main methodologies when valuing a property: intrinsic value, income-producing value and market value.</p>
<p>Intrinsic value is often called “replacement cost” in real estate. It’s what it would cost to buy a similar parcel of land and rebuild the same house from scratch, estimating the cost of labor and materials. In real estate appraising, this method carries almost no weight, just as in venture capital.</p>
<p>The income method in real estate applies to properties that produce predictable cash flow, like apartment buildings or established rental properties. For obvious reasons, this method is impossible to apply to seed- and early-stage startups where there is no profit and nothing is predictable except for expenses. This is why DCF isn’t used to value startups.</p>
<p>The dominant valuation technique used in real estate appraisals is the third methodology, market value. This approach seeks to understand how the market values similar assets, as defined by location, style, square footage and transaction recency. In other words, what have other buyers demonstrated they will pay for similar houses in the same neighborhood during the last six months?</p>
<p>Real estate appraisers use comparable sales to determine an adjusted price per square foot as the principal basis for calculating valuations when applying the market value method.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists do something very similar. There are clear valuation ranges for startups by stage and by round, which represent an established market value. These figures are even published by PitchBook, CB Insights and other organizations that track startup investment activity.</p>
<p>VCs then look for comparable sales in the exit values of startups with similar business models in the same industry, measuring price-to-revenue for M&amp;A and IPOs. We then apply these multiples to projections of future revenues to determine if we can achieve a “risk-adjusted” multiple at today’s market price.</p>
<p>For a venture capitalist, it doesn’t matter if a startup has an intrinsic value of zero today if there’s a reasonable chance to make 10x our money or better. It’s the potential multiple that matters, not whether we can apply traditional finance metrics to a startup.</p>
<p>This is completely different than how valuations are typically calculated when making an acquisition, creating potential confusion for corporate development personnel who’ve added venture capital investing as a new responsibility.</p>
<p>When a corporation makes acquisitions, each transaction must make independent financial sense. Venture capitalists, however, can accept the risk of seed- and early-stage startups — including a rational expectation of experiencing some failures — by taking a portfolio approach. VC investors don’t require a fixed or predictable return but seek a blended return on a pool of capital that is invested in multiple startups. According to PitchBook, the average VC fund has 18.4 portfolio companies and top-quartile performance has generally corresponded to returning approximately 2x aggregate committed capital over the last few decades.</p>
<p>All that’s required to justify a seed- or early-stage investment is to believe that the potential multiple on investment offsets the risk that capital may not be returned. This is based on the premise that the most VCs can lose is 1x their money &#8212; and the most they can make is unlimited. Of course, <a href="https://avc.com/2021/11/seed-rounds-at-100mm-post-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors need to be rational about whether the potential multiple is realistic and worth the risk</a>, investor Fred Wilson noted.</p>
<p>And this means venture capitalists are free to participate in the fiction about what seed- and early-stage startups are worth today. The real purpose of valuations at this stage is to find a split that is fair and motivational for everyone involved.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Where is Silicon Valley, really?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Where is Silicon Valley, really?</p>
<p>In 2021, it&#8217;s no longer a Bay Area hub backed by Sand Hill Road investors — it&#8217;s everywhere. The decentralization of capital to emerging ecosystems has done more than empower local entrepreneurs to raise that follow-on round, it&#8217;s also changed our work as journalists.</p>
<p>After Mary Ann published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/silicon-valleys-share-of-us-vc-funding-falls-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-decade/">an exclusive look at how fundraising is moving beyond Silicon Valley</a>, we decided to unpack our views on the trend&#8217;s long-term impact. Mary Ann followed up her reporting with a few thoughts about how the rise of startup hubs across America is hardly new and certainly nothing to be afraid of. Natasha and Alex dug into data-focused reporting, a key plank of the startup journalism game that is evolving as the market matures. What can we say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/your-local-trucker-is-giving-us-creator-economy-vibes/">the Equity team can&#8217;t stop talking! </a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a>: Funding data doesn&#8217;t matter the way it used to.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann</a>: The decentralization of startups isn&#8217;t new, even if it is accelerating.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a>: The declining impact of aggregated startup funding data is good news.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natasha: Funding data doesn’t matter the way it used to</h2>
<p>I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that, in a world of fast-moving deals and the end of HQs, startup geography data has never mattered less.</p>
<p>Now that you’re paying attention, I’m going to slightly hedge that and say that this somewhat controversial mindset doesn’t include emerging markets. For the longest time, startup data helped us understand how an entrepreneurial scene was growing. The concentration of capital in late-stage deals, for example, would show that the winners are winning but perhaps at the cost of smaller upstarts. A thriving angel scene would let us know that pre-seed startups are going to enjoy a boost of activation energy.</p>
<p>But what happens when the bounds of traditional geography goes away? You can be a startup based in Boston, but where do the concentration of your employees live? Where do your investors live? You may have answers, but maybe they will only be correct for the month.</p>
<p>Digital nomads aside, my point is that distributed work’s popularization clouds a little bit of our classic &#8220;local startup&#8221; news coverage. Detroit’s scene may be booming, but thanks to a nod from Miami and a wire from Boston. I think this means that our data needs to focus more on networks than ever before, understanding — at an aggregate level — how a startup&#8217;s success has a ripple effect across other communities. In other words, Duolingo&#8217;s public debut may have benefitted Pittsburgh&#8217;s local startup scene, but what if the company&#8217;s growth will now only look international? That&#8217;s a hypothetical, but I think we&#8217;ll need to ask deeper questions of funding data and ground-level wins.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA["In my opinion, the word ‘agile’ has been loosely applied to many different approaches and strategies to manage projects so the discussion of ‘fake’ versus ‘real’ agile is tricky without a specific context or example."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software consultant Andrew Drach&#8217;s two companies <a href="https://callentis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Callentis</a> and <a href="https://www.solwey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solwey</a> demonstrate his entrepreneurial skills, but his clients also value his educational background, as we learned through TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey to identify the best software consultants for startups</a>.</p>
<p>Telling us why her company picked Solwey, eDiscovery Assistant&#8217;s Kelly Twigger cited &#8220;Andrew&#8217;s Ph.D. and analytical background related to data,&#8221; as well as the consulting expertise for startups that he provides.</p>
<p>Expertise is only useful when it&#8217;s implemented, though — and Solwey does this too, Twigger said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t just add tasks to a Trello board for them to complete, we discuss the goals, why and how best to achieve them with cost/benefit analysis in mind.&#8221; This point was seconded by other survey respondents, so we reached out to Drach and his team to learn more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245713" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your recent background and current companies?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Drach:</strong> I have been doing consulting in engineering and software on and off pretty much ever since I started coding. And after a few years working in academia, I realized that I did not want to go the tenure-track faculty route. I told my wife [Monika Jociunaite] that as much as I was passionate about science, I had decided to leave academia and grow freelance consulting into an agency and that she should join me.</p>
<p>Monika was a perfect co-founder with complementary experience and skill set. Her background includes two master’s degrees — in international business and marketing — and she spent 5+ years working in large international corporations. She was curious to explore a more creative side of marketing as she enjoyed working on UX/UI projects in the past; and I knew firsthand that for the end users, high-quality code without good UX/UI is no different from broken code.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December of 2016, Monika and I established two sister companies: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solwey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solwey Consulting</a>, focused on technology strategy and execution, UX/UI design and business intelligence; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/callentis-cg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Callentis Consulting Group</a>, a research and development business focused on translational research and technology transfer from academia to industry practice.</p>
<p>More specifically, Solwey provides consulting in all stages of software design and development strategy and execution. We work with our clients on architecture and infrastructure design, optimization of UX/UI design and user flows, back-end and front-end software development for web and mobile, and business intelligence/data analytics to enable our clients to rapidly grow and move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose the boutique consultancy model?</strong></p>
<p>We both had strained experiences working with large agencies and staffing agencies and feeling abandoned or not important enough to have the full attention of the managers or project owners. Furthermore, we both had seen firsthand how terrifyingly crippling waterfall and broken agile could be for the progress of a project. So we set out to build Solwey and Callentis as small-by-design agencies. We directly engage with our clients, and Monika and I take personal responsibility for every single deliverable from our team.</p>
<p><strong>How is your team structured?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to build a virtual-first, remote-first agency from day one. While it seemed unconventional in pre-pandemic days, this allowed us to stay as lean as the best startups out there, while drastically improving our hiring prospects. We have been incredibly lucky with the talent that joined our team and to celebrate several of our employees&#8217; fourth anniversary while being just a five-year-old agency.</p>
<p>Currently, we have eight full-time developers, a DevOps manager and our Chief Operating Officer Nima [Kargah-Ostadi] who has a Ph.D. in engineering with a decade of experience leading engineering and research teams and is a certified Project Management Professional (PMP).</p>
<p><strong>How have you been finding clients?</strong></p>
<p>When we started, I just googled platforms for remote contracts for software developers and registered on a few of them. In a couple of days, we had already got a contract, so we immediately got hooked on the freelancing platforms; Upwork was a primary source of projects because it was so quick to find a contract there. But over time as we grew and increased the rates and team size, Upwork became less of a fit for us. Nowadays, we get referrals from former clients, new contracts from returning clients, quite a few requests from organic and paid search, and listings on B2B platforms like Clutch.</p>
<p>My focus in 2021 has been on diversifying our source of leads and we have been experimenting with many different approaches. So far, the least successful has been hiring business development reps and trying out cold outreach (emails and LinkedIn) but maybe we were just doing it wrong. On the other side of the spectrum, we have had great success establishing partnerships with VC funds and marketing agencies. Other approaches (social media, paid ads, content marketing, networking) also provided interesting results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Are startups your main clients, and what do they require? </strong></p>
<p>60% to 70% of our clients are startups or small companies at various stages. We have helped startups at pre-seed stage to create prototypes and guide their technology development plans. At seed stage, we work with them to develop their minimum viable product (MVP), and in subsequent stages, we get to help them with some of their many newly formed initiatives.</p>
<p>Some of these companies approach us before even having a technology team, some are starting to hire and grow their development team, and some have a fully staffed technology team that is swamped with existing work and cannot take on more initiatives.</p>
<p>We always strive to help startups hire and complete their technology team, especially if they have an idea that revolves around technology. In fact, I have served as interim chief technology officer (CTO) for three startups.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think architecture design advice is important?</strong></p>
<p>Early-stage clients are typically focused on their MVP and launch schedules. Too often, we need to walk this delicate path of helping them move as fast as possible to beat the competition and impress their investors, while at the same time try to stop them from rushing into architectural or strategy decisions that could come back to bite them hard when it is time to enhance some features, add new functionality, iterate or aggressively scale. Meanwhile, we are doing our best to provide guidance, prevent some common issues and explain why early investments in architecture or formal operational processes would help in the near future.</p>
<p>We tend to focus our recommendations on the time span of roughly six to 12 months so that we do not get stuck with premature optimization. A custom-tailored architectural design allows for a more efficient development process, fast iteration and gets to the robust and scalable software solution leaner and with fewer bumps along the way.</p>
<p><strong>What is your billing model? </strong></p>
<p>Monika and I strongly believe that transparency and easy-to-understand billing have helped us a lot in building trust and strong relationships with our clients. We use a project-based billing model with a flat hourly rate.</p>
<p>During the preliminary diagnostic conversations with our prospective clients, we try to understand their priorities and carve out a reasonable scope for projects divided into stepwise phases. Nima and I then put together a Gantt chart to visualize a realistic schedule of tasks and estimate the number of hours it would take to design, develop, test and deploy the anticipated solution given client and resource conditions. The proposed budget is simply this number of hours multiplied by our hourly flat rate, which includes all overhead costs.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your typical timeline?</strong></p>
<p>For a typical startup product that is at initial phases of developing an MVP, we typically recommend two weeks for discovery and requirements gathering, four weeks for UX/UI design along with infrastructure and architecture design, eight weeks for agile development and continuous testing to implement the major functionality and finally two weeks for deploying the MVP solution and last-minute tweaks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245725" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245725" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2245725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png" alt="Solwey's timeline" width="1024" height="259" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png 2176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=1536,388 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=2048,518 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Solweys-timeline.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Solwey</p></div></p>
<p>We work with our clients to postpone any tasks that were collectively identified as non-blocking or non-critical to keep the MVP lean enough to have a successful launch within such a short timeline. This is because in our experience, four months is long enough time to develop most MVPs and short enough to enable rapid launch and get much needed feedback from users and investors that guarantee the success of the startup in subsequent phases.</p>
<p><strong>Two of your clients mentioned coming to you after not-so-great experiences with other firms. Could you explain what this is like? And do you have any advice for startups wanting to avoid bad experiences?</strong></p>
<p>The very first thing I tell our clients in the diagnostics call, is that sometimes things do not work out, but their negative experience does not mean that working with external teams is always going to fail or that their previous technology partner was unqualified or had bad intentions. I joke sometimes that our team should be called “iteration #3.” A majority of projects that we take over usually went through two iterations: once with an agency outside of the United States, due to cheaper rates, and another time with a junior or midlevel freelancer. And while there is absolutely nothing wrong with either approach, founders tend to underestimate the level of hands-on coordination required to complete the project in those scenarios.</p>
<p>Advice on avoiding a bad experience? Setting clear expectations and communication. Whether a startup is engaged with a staff-augmentation agency, or a temporary hire, or a freelancer, or an agency like us, it all boils down to having clear delineation of tasks and frequent check-ins to ensure that any potential issues surface quickly and the team can pivot quickly. Will there be unexpected issues, delays, complications? Certainly. But it matters how these obstacles are communicated and addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any thoughts on fake agile versus real agile? And why do you believe in the latter?</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, the word &#8220;agile&#8221; has been loosely applied to many different approaches and strategies to manage projects so the discussion of &#8220;fake&#8221; versus &#8220;real&#8221; agile is tricky without a specific context or example. Through our interactions with different teams, we have encountered cases when the agile process ended up being extremely inefficient for a number of reasons. Sometimes, a manager or team lead would be laser-focused on agile ceremonies designed for large distributed teams while the total team size is just two developers working in the same room. In other cases, the process was set to be so fluid that the priorities would shift several times a day. And sometimes, the team would define weekly or biweekly sprints, but then would have a rigid quarterly plan that looks exactly like a waterfall approach.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not sure that our process would fall into the strict definition of agile because we adjust it and try to accommodate client preferences to reduce any potential friction. We have several important requirements, including daily check-ins with our designers and developers, weekly sprints with well-defined tasks, regular release schedules, continuous integration flows, striving to have design assets be ready 1-2 sprints ahead of development, etc. But beyond those, we do our best to accommodate and provide recommendations to the client as the process would be quite different for a one-person team versus a late-stage startup with dozens of team members spread across multiple time zones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Don&#8217;t worry, Y Combinator fans, you&#8217;ll be able to write off this entire opinion piece as the disgruntled musings of &#8220;a failed startup founder who was never able to get into Y Combinator,&#8221; because seen through one lens, that&#8217;s exactly what I am. But, damn it, for a while there, being a Y Combinator company meant something. People who&#8217;d gone through Y Combinator spoke through it in hushed tones, as if God&#8217;s own light had shined upon them, and they had been touched by the wings of an angel.</p>
<p>Truth is, for a lot of companies, being part of Y Combinator was a huge breakthrough, and getting the YC stamp of approval meant something. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The selection criteria were stringent, and whenever there was a YC demo day, the entire startup ecosystem would be wafting themselves with a sense of arousal and excitement. The press would be sharpening its proverbial pencils, and investors would be clamoring for the most promising startups. Both groups did that for the same reason: To make it through the YC selection process and survive it through the end of the program meant that the companies at least reached a basic level of competence. </span></p>
<p>People who don&#8217;t know much about martial arts think that earning a black belt is a big deal. It is &#8212; but in most systems, it shows just that you have basic proficiency, and that you can be trusted to practice with some level of safety and competency. People who understand martial arts understand that the true deep study starts at the black-belt level. In a way, the same was true for Y Combinator: Get accepted and work your way through the program, and you&#8217;ve got your black belt. Congrats, pop some champagne, pat yourself on the back. Now the real work begins.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245960" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So when Y Combinator&#8217;s new boss Geoff Ralston says <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/y-combinator-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he can see Y Combinator fund 1,000 companies per batch</a> at some point in the none-too-distant future, my read is that the firm is tooling up to change from being a boutique martial arts gym to a mass-market dojo that&#8217;s trying to train a ludicrous number of founders into fighting-fit karate kids. Although, if you remember &#8220;Karate Kid,&#8221; the smaller, scrappier gym was, ultimately, a better place to be.</p>
<p>The move would make a lot of sense for Y Combinator &#8212; if, as Ralston claims, they will be able to keep the quality of founders and the selection criteria at a high level, the firm is effectively creating an index fund of startups. At the stage Y Combinator invests, they can pick up a not-insignificant percentage of the companies for not a lot of money. If 1‰ (that&#8217;s 1 out of a thousand) startups turn into an Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, GitLab, Dropbox, Amplitude, Matterport, PagerDuty, Stripe, Instacart, Cruise, Brex, Reddit, Zapier, Gusto, Flexport, Monzo, Mux or Rippling, it&#8217;s a hell of a business model. That impressive list of startups isn&#8217;t a coincidence; those are all companies you&#8217;ve probably heard of, and all Y Combinator portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t for the investors; they&#8217;re going to be just fine. The challenge is for the startups. Some will argue that network effects get better when the network gets bigger; and that might be true &#8212; but that is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Not least because the very best founders don&#8217;t have time to actually participate in the network; especially in the early days, they&#8217;re heads down building their startups, not rolling up their sleeves to help other founders.</p>
<p>As a founder, I&#8217;d question whether it&#8217;s worthwhile to be a part of a 1,000-strong cohort. Will the Y Combinator badge of honor help you get a meeting with an investor? Will it help you get bumped to the top of a journalist&#8217;s email inbox? Or will it simply cease to be valuable as a filter to the outside world, and drastically reduce the value of having been a Y Combinator alum in the first place?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>My personal suspicion is that Y Combinator becoming huge(r) is great for YC and its limited partners (i.e. the people investing into YC). For the startups, there&#8217;s a point of diminishing returns. I think that point was a while back when the cohorts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">ballooned to 377 startups</a> and became completely unwieldy for anyone who was trying to keep an overview of what was happening inside its rapidly expanding walls.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a question of time before someone starts offering the service and exclusivity of what YC did in the early days &#8212; there are already a few contenders in the running &#8212; and when one of them starts gaining traction and building up a portfolio of its own, YC would be left with an index fund of the also-rans. I would be delighted to be wrong, but it feels like this is the beginning of the end of the Silicon Valley institution.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Electronic interfaces, platforms and marketplaces form a key layer in the digital infrastructure behind e-commerce, serving as gatekeepers between consumers and producers of digital content or digitally sold products.</p>
<p>These gatekeepers offer third-party companies access to a global market by providing their own infrastructure. It is therefore not surprising that their growth is often driven by a strong influx of third-party companies, which can expand internationally with their products and content without having to build their own technological infrastructure.</p>
<p>An increasing number of online retailers use such platforms for their e-commerce businesses, which has made these platforms an integral part of compliance procedures.</p>
<h2>The EU VAT reform</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2021 there was a big change in the European Union’s Value Added Tax (VAT) law, impacting online retailers, marketplaces and their e-commerce businesses across the EU. Since 1993, the VAT law in the European Union concerning cross-border e-commerce was in large part unchanged and was originally introduced for mail order businesses that used catalogues.</p>
<p>But EU member states realized a few years ago that EU VAT law was no longer on track with the developments taking place in the e-commerce ecosystem.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In the worst case, non-compliance with these regulations will mean that VAT will not have been paid for thousands of transactions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This has led to many problems for marketplaces like Amazon, as they have a significant number of third-party merchants based outside the EU. For example, third-party merchants account for about 50%-60% of Amazon Germany&#8217;s revenue, and more than half of these merchants based in China.</p>
<p>The VAT problems that arise from this led to enormous tax losses in the past, because third-party merchants, especially those from China, did not declare the VAT that was actually due in the EU, giving them a huge market advantage over the EU merchants. The EU has recognized this and initiated the VAT reform, which primarily places responsibility on the marketplaces.</p>
<p>The EU VAT e-commerce package, under specific circumstances, can make online sellers and marketplaces liable to pay VAT and leads to certain challenges and risks.</p>
<p>Since July, it has been key for marketplaces to determine the VAT due for every transaction and establish related processes such as VAT rate determination, invoicing, filing and reporting. This is applicable to marketplaces when they are liable to pay tax on transactions by sellers not based in the EU or for distance sales from non-EU countries.</p>
<p>Marketplaces have to be aware of additional indirect tax regulations to avoid massive tax and financial risks. Not adapting to the new regulations can result in paying VAT and interest retrospectively for the sales made on the platform. In Germany, this would mean paying 19% VAT on the net sales, with fines and interest added on top. In countries like Italy, the surcharges can reach up to 240%.</p>
<h2>Broad range of VAT rates across the EU</h2>
<p>It is not only necessary for online merchants to determine the VAT rate for their products, but marketplace operators, being liable for VAT under certain circumstances, also have to ensure the application of the correct VAT rate in every EU member state.</p>
