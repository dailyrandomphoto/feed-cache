										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There may be plenty of funding for some startups these days. But plenty of companies will tell you otherwise. <a href="https://govclab.com/">VC Lab</a>, an accelerator for venture capital firms, wants to create investors who will back the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A basic hurdle to this goal is the standard paperwork you need to set up a new fund. It currently requires specialized lawyers whose time can cost more than $100,000 per fund formation.</p>
<p>Today, VC Lab is providing a set of <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/09/27/cornerstone-limited-partner-agreement/">freely available boilerplate documents</a> intended to streamline the process, save everyone time and money and make fund governance structures more accessible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219068" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We have general partners launching funds from all around the world,” co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeoressi/">Adeo Ressi</a> explains. “The last cohort enrolled venture investors from 62 different countries, including Central Asia, Africa, and every other place you can imagine.”</p>
<p>Legal costs are the last thing they need.</p>
<p>“The new managers who are getting into venture are coming in with a passion for change — the funds often have a very focused thesis, and they tend to be smaller in size. They really want to help the companies they work with to succeed at any cost. They don’t need 200 to 400 pages of legal agreements governing every small decision that they make. They need lean and light, easy-to-use agreements.”</p>
<p>The package, which <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/10/08/releasing-cornerstone-to-fix-vc/">VC Lab is calling Cornerstone</a>, is a short 33 pages that include a term sheet, a subscription agreement and an LPA (and this <a href="https://govclab.com/2021/10/07/how-to-use-cornerstone-to-form-a-fund/">user guide</a>). Similar fund formation documents regularly run into the hundreds of pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s been widespread recognition that fund formation docs are ridiculously complex and in need of an overhaul,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hansekim/">Hans Kim</a>, a longtime startup lawyer in Silicon Valley who co-authored the new package. “I’ve had numerous founder clients who made money and want to put their capital to good use through investing. But if they get more serious than personal angel investing, you refer them to a fund formation lawyer. Then they see the price and have to think twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Improvements include a streamlined list of definitions, simplified sections on management fees and triggers for limited operator mode, according to co-author <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richgora/">Rich Gora</a> of Gora LLC. The current document includes details for domiciling the firm in the United States with plans for other popular locations like Canada, the Netherlands and Singapore coming soon.</p>
<p>As a fund formation lawyer who works with a wide variety of investors, he says the goal is to help businesspeople work out business issues in plain terms. Once the parties have talked through what they want to agree to, they can take the product to an expert like himself to finalize.</p>
<p>“Over the last 10 months,” he says about the writing process, “we looked at every single industry LP agreement we could find. We took concepts that would be 20 lines and distilled them into three. The concepts are there but the lawyer verbiage is gone.”</p>
<p>Ressi estimates that the new documents can cut legal costs in half or more, depending on factors like how many LPs you bring in. There’s also a shortage of lawyers with fund formation expertise, he notes. Providing standard documents will speed this process up and help the global venture capital ecosystem develop faster.</p>
<p>VC Lab was formed within the <a href="https://fi.co/">Founder Institute</a>, a global startup accelerator that has already made similar contributions to the startup ecosystem. Nearly nine years ago it helped develop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/thefunded-founder-institute-and-wilson-sonsini-debut-startup-friendly-seed-financing-vehicle-convertible-equity/">the concept of convertible equity</a>, a precursor to the SAFE note, which removes the debt elements from convertible notes.</p>
<p>“We believe that all the bottlenecks need to be done away with,” Ressi says about startup investing. “Then, there will be an explosion of new VCs and new LPs all around the world who are entering the asset class. That will create a real positive change for humanity because, no matter where you are in the world, you can pursue an idea to make the world a better place and find the resources you need to make it a reality. Unfortunately, this is not true today.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 15, 2021! Happy Friday to you and yours; I am proud of us all for making it through a week that was more than hectic. Up top, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/final-hours-to-save-100-on-passes-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">discounts end on our space event in very short order</a>. And with no further ado, let’s get into the news! – <a href="twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wq9aroH8im"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/final-hours-to-save-100-on-passes-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">Final hours to save $100 on passes to TC Sessions: Space 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/f12-isnt-hacking-missouri-governor-threatens-to-prosecute-local-journalist-for-finding-exposed-state-data/">Missouri governor conflates journalism, hacking</a>:</strong> The United States is a large nation with many smart and many less-smart people. A story from the latter category ended up in our wheelhouse when a state governor decided that a journalist pointing out security flaws in an official website was malicious hacking. Perhaps stories like this are why so many Gen Z folks are doomers?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/instacart-shopper-activists-are-going-on-strike/">Instacart shoppers are going on strike</a>: </strong>Try to recall a time when some section of the Instacart workforce was happy and not either about to strike or on strike. It’s hard, yeah? This Saturday, “some Instacart shoppers will go on strike, protesting the company’s low pay and lack of communication with its laborers,” TechCrunch reports. Let’s see if this particular piece of the larger Striketober saga ends up with worker-friendly results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/apple-removes-a-popular-quran-app-in-china-after-request-from-local-regulators/">Apple yanks Quran app after Chinese regulators ask</a>:</strong> The day after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft announced</a> that it was going to pull LinkedIn’s main service from China after failing to reconcile that country’s government and its own views, Apple appears to have complied with a Chinese state request to remove “Quran Majeed, a popular app for reading the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information” from the Chinese app store. This isn’t a small act, given the Chinese state’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-details-torture-cover-ups-china-s-internment-camps-revealed-n1270014">abuse of Muslims inside its borders</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s take our time today in the world of startups, it being Friday and all.</p>
<p>First up, we have a great piece from <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan">Rebecca Bellan</a> digging into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/meet-the-startups-changing-mobility-for-emerging-middle-classes/">host of startups that are helping emerging middle classes around the world get places</a>. This list includes, and I quote, “Swvl, Treepz, Jatri, SafeBoda, Urbvan, Chalo and Buser,” among others. If you are into the transportation tech beat, it’s a great read.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andystinnes/">Andy Stinnes</a>, a general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/the-venture-bull-market-is-great-for-founders-but-not-in-the-way-they-might-expect/">wrote an essay for the blog today</a> discussing that while the present-day venture capital bull market (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">here</a>) is a general good for founders, “closer inspection reveals that these trends are a lot more nuanced and apply very unequally across the funding continuum from seed to the late stage.” If you are looking to raise capital, it’s worth your time.</p>
<p>Moving along, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/tayhatmaker">Taylor Hatmaker</a> did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/core-manticore-metaverse-game-creation-hands-on/">yeoman’s work digging into Core</a>, a metaverse environment where she wandered around, finding the landscape to be both great-looking and “seamless.” If you want a peek into what could be the future of gaming and social interaction, this is for you.</p>
<p>And, before we get to the rest of our startup rundown, I wrote an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/an-interview-with-visionary-founder-ceo-on-large-unicorns-ipo-day/">imaginary interview with a made-up CEO concerning a fictional IPO</a>. For more context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/an-interview-with-a-leading-venture-capitalist/">head here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">SoundCloud lands Pandora partnership, new radio station</a>:</strong> As Spotify grew to become a music behemoth, SoundCloud stuck closer to the underground. And it survived, which some didn’t expect. Today, the upstart music service announced a deal with Pandora that could help bring it a bit more audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/clubhouse-music-mode/">Clubhouse adds “music mode”</a></strong>: Sticking to a musical theme for another measure or two, Clubhouse has built out a way for musicians to better stream their music live on the service. So, I suppose Clubhouse can now also be <a href="http://instantrimshot.com/">coffeehouse</a>?</li>
<li><strong>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/spot-ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-22m-with-a-platform-to-draw-out-more-intelligence-from-organizations-basic-security-videos/">Spot AI leaves stealth with its security cam search tool</a>:</strong> Flush with $22 million and freshly denuded of its “stealth” tag, Spot AI is out in the public view today, which is fitting as its core product deals with security cameras and how they are ingested. The company “reads” footage from the devices, allowing the video itself to be searchable. Which is cool, if vaguely creepy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bringing it in-house: What to look for when hiring a general counsel</h2>
<p>Experienced lawyers may be drawn away from big firms to join a startup as general counsel for a variety of reasons, LinkSquares’ chief legal officer Tim Parilla writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“For some, it’s an attempt to find a better work-life balance (whoops!), while others are eager to build and manage their own team or see it as an opportunity to work for a mission-driven company,” he writes.</p>
<p>For founders, it’s an opportunity to snag a seasoned professional who can build in-depth knowledge of your business &#8212; rather than relying on a generic (and costly) outside law firm.</p>
<p>Parilla offers detailed tips on what startup leaders should look for in an in-house counsel (as well as a few things that would indicate a lawyer is not fit for your business).</p>

Facebook’s Custom Audience tool may be just a bit too custom for our liking.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/porsches-all-electric-taycan-outsells-its-flagship-911-sports-car/">Sorry, gearheads, people want electric sports cars</a>:</strong> While the Porsche 911 is an iconic car, period, it’s losing to an internal rival in the sales war. TechCrunch reports that the petroleum-powered 911 was outsold by the electric Porsche Taycan during the first three quarters of 2021. I did <em>not</em> expect that for some years.</li>

The popular title has a big update coming on November 5. Dubbed Happy Home Paradise, I am sure it does what it says on the tin.</li>
<li>And, to close out the news today, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/smartphone-sales-down-6-as-chip-shortages-begin-to-impact-market/">global smartphone sales dipped 6% last year</a></strong>, likely due to the global chip shortage that is bedeviling industries from autos to computers and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-says-peace-crucial-chip-040004228.html">boosting tensions surrounding Taiwanese sovereignty</a>.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, we realized that we were swamped with work and overloaded with information. So we came up with an idea to fix that.</p>
<p>At Travelpayouts, we plan a strategy for a year, then each team plans iterations for every quarter, and within a quarter, we plan for two weeks ahead. By doing it this way, every day propels the company towards its goals.</p>
<p>However, unexpected challenges and tasks show up in all areas on a daily basis. For example, managers are sometimes overloaded with meetings that affect their productivity. So it is not surprising that some tasks just fall short of deadlines and accumulate over time.</p>
<p>To improve our productivity, we introduced a Getting Shit Done Day (GSDD): Our employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved (we encourage our employees to avoid social media on this day, but we are not looking over their shoulder). The goal of GSDD is to increase the amount of time we spend in deep work by minimizing distractions for one day every other week.</p>
<p>After two months of testing the GSDD in our marketing and business development departments, we’ve seen some results. First, long-term projects, which took weeks before, began to wrap up earlier. Second, we were able to explore a few topics that we never got around to: For example, monetizing our own traffic through affiliate programs, effective outreach methods, and email marketing best practices.</p>
<p>Thanks to the GSDD, we have also delved into tasks that were otherwise sidelined:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix fired an employee who led the company&#8217;s trans employee resource group and planned a walkout on October 20, a current and former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation confirmed to TechCrunch. The termination was first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle">reported by The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>Netflix workers planned the walkout to protest statements that its co-CEO Ted Sarandos made about Dave Chappelle&#8217;s recently released special, &#8220;The Closer.&#8221; The company claims<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo"> </a>that it fired the employee in question because the company suspects that they leaked internal information.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,&#8221; a Netflix representative told TechCrunch. &#8220;We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218933" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on &#8220;The Closer&#8221; that appeared in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">story by Bloomberg</a>, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham&#8217;s recent comedy special &#8220;Inside&#8221; and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever?srnd=pursuits-vp">best-ever debut.</a></p>
<p>Earlier this month, as Netflix prepared to release &#8220;The Closer,&#8221; employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">raised concerns</a> about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show &#8212; Chapelle goes as far as declaring that he&#8217;s &#8220;Team TERF,&#8221; referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who conflate gender with biological sex and oppose the movement for transgender rights. When Netflix released the special on October 5 anyway, employees and Netflix subscribers alike lashed out against the streaming service.</p>
<p>The day after the special&#8217;s release, a trans software engineer at Netflix, Terra Field, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236">viral thread</a> about the impact of anti-trans rhetoric. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Promoting TERF ideology (which is what we did by giving it a platform yesterday) directly harms trans people, it is not some neutral act. This is not an argument with two sides. It is an argument with trans people who want to be alive and people who don&#8217;t want us to be,&#8221; Field wrote. </span></p>

But Field was <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908">reinstated</a> the next day after finding that she didn&#8217;t try to attend the meeting with ill intent &#8212; in fact, a director had shared the link, leading her to think she could attend. But some Netflix employees were fed up, especially after co-CEO Ted Sarandos <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-defense-1235088647/">wrote in an email</a> to them that &#8220;content on screen doesn&#8217;t directly translate to real-world harm.&#8221; He continued, &#8220;we have &#8216;Sex Education,&#8217; &#8216;Orange Is the New Black,&#8217; &#8216;Control Z,&#8217; Hannah Gadsby and Dave Chappelle all on Netflix. Key to this is increasing diversity on the content team itself.&#8221;</div>
<p>A lesbian comedian celebrated for her Emmy-winning Netflix special &#8220;Nanette,&#8221; Hannah Gadsby spoke out against Sarandos&#8217; attempt to paint her as a figurehead for queer inclusivity at Netflix.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t pay me nearly enough to deal with the real world consequences of the hate speech dog whistling you refuse to acknowledge, Ted,&#8221; she wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVCiLl9FWoB/?utm_medium=copy_link">on Instagram</a>. &#8220;Fuck you and your amoral algorithm cult.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We are only in the first chapter of Latin America’s long journey to tech growth. But with the region’s thirst for innovation, the market is expected to expand<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"> nearly tenfold</a> over the next decade, with open banking through the use of APIs leading the way and acting as digital transformation facilitators.</p>
<p>With LatAm businesses and startups continuously integrating with new-age platforms and services, adopting an API-driven transformation strategy has become essential – as a result, the entire financial system is being “APIfied.”</p>
<p>In other words, this open API ecosystem, in which third-party service providers access consumer data from financial institutions, means financial services will be optimized to lower costs and time spent on transactions and improve user experience.</p>
<p>The advantages of having open communication between different products and services are nearly infinite for credit scoring, moving money between bank accounts, and spanning verticals like the neobanks, credit providers, and personal finance products Latin Americans use every day.</p>
<p>In 2019, API usage was more mature in the<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/estrategias-con-apis-en-am%C3%A9rica-latina-y-tendencias-nicholas/"> financial and e-commerce</a> sectors, but it is now venturing into other areas such as marketing and insurance. <a href="https://www.delitosfinancieros.org/fintech-pagos-digitales-y-las-nuevas-herramientas-financieras-para-el-comercio-electronico-en-america-latina/">Fintech companies</a> are increasingly collaborating with traditional players like banks, payment agencies, insurance providers and stock exchanges. Cryptocurrency trading platforms and companies are also fighting for their space in the spotlight and have adopted API platforms to support crypto-assets since most of their operations are already digitized.</p>
<p>The API revolution seems well underway. So, what’s next for LatAm?</p>
<h2>The key to tech penetration in LatAm: APIs</h2>
<p>Until recently, many traditional financial institutions and banks in LatAm were gatekeepers, with a bank account being the prerequisite for consumers to participate in the economy. And prior to the <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap112.pdf">advent of fintech</a>, these financial institutions’ back-office infrastructures for risk management, credit decisions, and fraud detection involved manual effort and required cross-departmental coordination.</p>
<p>Each step was carried out by a person, from registering a user to the production of products and services. This often left customer data unexploited, increased transaction costs, impeded innovation and degraded customer experience.</p>
<p>As financial institutions grapple with digital transformation, <a href="https://www.fintechamericas.co/news/the-art-of-collaboration-how-banks-fintech-can-partner-for-success/">Andres Meta, VP at Grupo Bind</a> and co-founder of Arfintech, said many banks are partnering with fintechs or accessing technology-based products to create unique business models and stay relevant.</p>
<p>One way to revamp the back-office, lower costs and improve communication is to use APIs. This will enable access to information, improve consumption of products and services, and disrupt and de-structure established value chains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We can&#8217;t check out every investing outfit&#8217;s demo day. But one event that we try to catch every year is that of <a href="https://www.pear.vc/">Pear</a>, which is held annually each fall and features (blessedly) just a dozen or so very nascent startups.</p>
<p>Pear, a seed-stage venture firm founded in 2013, has an impressive track record when it comes to identifying promising companies from their earliest stages &#8212; including DoorDash, Gusto, Aurora Solar, Vanta, Branch Metrics and Guardant Health. As notably, despite introducing a far smaller number of teams to investors than Y Combinator and more renowned accelerator programs, there always seem to be at least one or two projects in Pear&#8217;s Demo Day mix that turn into actual, sustainable and, sometimes, sizable companies.</p>
<p>Consider that over seven previous &#8220;batches&#8221; that featured a collective 69 teams altogether, Pear has helped push into the market Xilis, which uses “micro-organoids” to quickly make thousands of 3D replicas of a patient’s tumor that can then be tested for drug compatibility faster (it closed a <a href="https://www.precisiononcologynews.com/cancer/xilis-raises-70m-series-financing-support-miniature-organoid-platform-technology">$70 million</a> Series A round this summer); the relationship intelligence company Affinity (which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/affinity-a-relationship-intelligence-company-raises-80m-to-help-close-deals/">$80 million</a> in Series C funding last month), and Viz.ai, whose software helps doctors diagnose strokes and coordinate care (and whose funding now tops $150 million after closing its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-viz-ai-raises-71-million-in-new-funding-11615980601">most recent round</a> back in March). It has some others it can, and does, boast about, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, the event, held this past Wednesday, shined a light on 13 of these very nascent teams. Pear also connected investors in attendance with five of its own portfolio companies that were just coming out of stealth mode. For those of you who might be interested in tracking emerging themes or actual investment opportunities, here&#8217;s a quick rundown of who pitched what (with the Pear-backed companies at the end of this list).</p>
<p>Note that we did not write the descriptions below. These were the exact pitches that the teams delivered straight to investors in attendance, so you&#8217;ll naturally spot a bit of hyperbole (because, startups).</p>
<p><a href="http://joinburst.com"><strong>Burst</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Sameer Kapur (CPO), Vishnu Chakroborty (CTO), Gautam Ajjarapu (CEO)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

With Aklivity, teams are relieved of the hodgepodge of integration frameworks and disjointed manual efforts associated with managing streaming APIs today. Before Aklivity, the team pioneered WebSocket and founded a company that brought the technology to dozens of global enterprises. An established pipeline and key strategic relationships are in place to deliver streaming API Management to over 21,000 organizations and make swift progress on a $2 billion market opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://savviai.com"><strong>SAVVI</strong></a></p>

Teams using SAVVI have seen a 1,500% ROI over traditional ML methods.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transcera.bio/"><strong>Transcera</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Hunter Globe (CEO), Wayne Lencer (Academic Co-Founder), Justin Wolfe (CSO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Biologic drugs have been one of the biggest revolutions in medicine of the last 30 years. Blockbuster biologics like Humira changed the way we treat chronic diseases, from Crohn’s Disease to cancer, and created a $375 billion market. But there’s a problem. Biologics are large, complex molecules that are not naturally absorbed in the body. The way we get around this today is by injecting or infusing biologic drugs, so they can get more directly to the bloodstream. Many patients won’t stick with an injectable treatment long term. Others won’t take one at all. Pharma companies have been trying to enable oral absorption of large molecule drugs for years. These approaches don’t work well, and result in very low levels of absorption &#8211; usually less than 1% of the total administered drug. We developed a better way &#8211; a platform that enables greater absorption of biologics following oral administration. After 30 years of research on cholera and how the bacteria infects the human body, Dr. Wayne Lencer, a Harvard Professor and Transcera co-founder, discovered a type of lipid which can carry larger molecules across the body’s cellular barriers. His lab at Boston Children’s Hospital synthesized and simplified these carriers to enhance absorption of biologic drugs. This is a platform technology which we plan to apply to many chronic diseases. But we’re starting with oral peptide drugs for diabetes and obesity.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://omniscientlabs.io"><strong>Omniscient Labs</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Andrew Fang (CTO), Jon Braatz (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Omniscient Lab’s geospatial image intelligence platform uses computer vision to automatically monitor locations, starting with defense and intelligence customers. More than 90% of collected imagery isn’t actually reviewed, resulting in critical information and threats being missed. Omniscient’s platform detects equipment, facilities&#8217; and surfaces&#8217; historical patterns, while integrating with existing workflows. They’ve received grants from the Air Force and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency that can lead to large contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://recorahealth.com"><strong>Recora</strong></a></p>
<p>Founder: Abhishek Chandra (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;One in three of us will die of heart disease – it’s time to change that.Recora is the enterprise platform for cardiac care. We help members recover from home after a heart attack. Right now, patients drive to a hospital to complete a recovery program. These facilities are 40 miles away and have 6 week wait times. So 96% of people don’t finish and quickly get hospitalized again.<br />
Using video visits and connected devices, we’ve designed a virtual cardiac recovery program. We ran a 200-patient pilot last year and showed 3x better outcomes. Today we cover 23,000 patients across 12 hospitals and are enrolling them at 220% month-over-month. Just these three contracts are a $46 million opportunity. We’re on track to close 20 contracts in 26 states over the next twelve months, and corner a $10 billion market. Before Recora, we founded and scaled Spring Health, a $2 billion mental health platform. Now we’re redefining the future of heart health so that everyone can live a long, full, and optimal life.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://kensa.ai/"><strong>Kensa AI</strong></a></p>
<p>Founder: Nathan Schuett (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Kensa AI develops image processing software to automate and improve visual inspections for civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges, dams, buildings, cell towers, etc.). The company’s initial focus is on concrete and steel structures, combining hi-res 3D reconstructions captured by drones with deep learning to detect cracks, spalling, delamination, and other common defects. Kensa AI’s customers are some of the largest owners and developers of infrastructure around the world, and include Class 1 railroads, electric utilities, and multinational engineering companies. With a team of 5 and projected revenues of $800,000 in 2021, Kensa AI is growing quickly and establish a data moat on some of the world’s most important infrastructure assets. The founder and CEO graduated from Stanford, and he’s now raising a seed round to grow the company’s leadership position in 3D digital twins and AI-based inspection for industrial assets.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://farmraise.com"><strong>FarmRaise</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Jayce Hafner (CEO), Albert Albedi (Head of Product), Sami Tellatin (COO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Over half of American farms don&#8217;t have the tools or bandwidth they need to identify ways to improve their farms and become profitable. Our API links to the farmer&#8217;s bank account where our algorithm assesses the financials to provide a &#8220;Farm Read,&#8221; scoring the farmer&#8217;s financial health. We regularly monitor the farm data to continuously provide clean financials and recommendations on how to improve their farms. We use this farm specific data to connect farmers with capital to improve their score.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://gatsby.events"><strong>Gatsby</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Zach Rivkin (CEO), Chris Zelazo (Co-Founder), Michael Zuccarino (Co-Founder)</p>
<p>&#8220;Great businesses are built on personal relationships, and personal relationships are built on Gatsby — the personal CRM for the future of professional network management. Gatsby is the system of record for your network providing low touch points for you to augment network information and allowing the creation of intelligent workflows for managing it, such as triaging important contacts and bringing the right people to your attention at the right time or managing gatherings and events so the key people show up. We are starting to sell to investing professionals as our initial wedge and plan to expand into all professionals for who managing their network is key.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smarty.ai/"><strong>Smarty</strong></a></p>
<p>Founders: Denzil Eden (CEO)</p>
<p>&#8220;Smarty is an intelligence layer that connects you to all your data and applications from its one-stop hub. You talk to Smarty wherever you are online, and Smarty automates routine workflows so your focus is only on what matters most. Use pre-built recipes, create custom triggers yourself, or use natural language commands and choose how your data automatically moves between the applications you use. The founder and CEO Denzil, a graduate of MIT and HBS, is the human behind the bot. She created Smarty to empower passionate professionals to shortcut through routine tasks, to utilize known best practices, and to learn from their past personal data on how to be their smartest selves.&#8221;</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A recent Corporate Counsel <a href="https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2021/09/02/fintech-startups-are-luring-in-fortune-500-finance-lawyers/">article</a> highlighted a growing trend: More senior legal leaders are migrating to startups to take on general counsel roles. For some, it’s an attempt to find a better work-life balance (whoops!), while others are eager to build and manage their own team or see it as an opportunity to work for a mission-driven company.</p>
<p>This is great news for startups, especially those in regulated industries, where building strong in-house legal teams has been a challenge and fees can really add up if they choose a law firm. Founders can find top-tier talent out there, and discovering the right resource for your early to mid-sized company has never been more likely.</p>
<p>The abundance of available legal talent brings challenges as well as opportunities. Whether you’re the CEO of a high-growth startup or even a mid-sized technology company, finding the right legal leader will have implications for your business down the line. It’s a move you want to get right from the very beginning.</p>
<h2>Know what a GC can bring to the business</h2>
<p>The primary benefit of bringing on an in-house attorney is that they will become an expert in every aspect of your business, which will let them provide more actionable legal advice as well as a (sometimes) unique input on various business decisions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You don’t want a lawyer who will panic and create more chaos in an already chaotic environment, and you definitely don’t want the lawyer who presents you and the rest of the management team “the facts” and leaves the decision to you (it’s a &#8220;business decision”).					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Another big aspect is that law firms are, by nature, highly risk-averse. This can often be at odds with the business&#8217; ability to accomplish its objectives. However, CEOs are going to take risks to move the business forward, and having an excellent lawyer in-house who can manage the potential downside of those risks is critical.</p>
<p>CEOs need a lawyer who they can trust to manage a situation after it becomes an issue, as well as one who is thoughtful and clear on communicating potential risks up front. Leaders don’t need someone telling them not to take risks, or saying, “I told you so” when things go wrong; they need someone who can manage the consequences (good and bad) of business decisions in a calm, organized and professional manner.</p>
<p>Finally, cost is a factor. Law firms traditionally charge an hourly rate, which can become frustrating to manage and fiscally untenable for a startup trying to stretch funding. While alternative fee arrangements are becoming more commonplace, most firms limit those arrangements to a relatively “plain vanilla” representation and will charge hourly for more complex matters.</p>
<p>Hiring a full-time lawyer and paying that lawyer a decent wage will allow you to better manage costs and they, over time, should provide you with better advice.</p>
<h2>Experience and attitude matter</h2>
<p>An important aspect to evaluate is the risk appetite of a legal chief candidate. Many in-house attorneys claim to be &#8220;commercial,&#8221; but that’s rarely the case. Relatively few in-house leaders are willing to actually make the call to take on almost certain risk to accomplish a business objective.</p>
<p>There’s something about how lawyers are trained that makes us jump to the worst-case scenario, but in reality, there’s a lot of room between taking the risk and the catastrophic scenario. Great GCs make the business decision, shoulder the risk, and do so with the confidence that they can manage the results to preserve the commercial value of the decision while managing the matter to prevent the worst-case scenario.</p>

The paper &#8212; entitled &#8220;Unique on Facebook: Formulation [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06636.pdf">research paper</a> written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s targeting tools to deliver an ad <em>exclusively</em> to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook&#8217;s platform assigns them.</p>
<p>The paper &#8212; entitled &#8220;Unique on Facebook: Formulation and Evidence of (Nano)targeting Individual Users with non-PII Data&#8221; &#8212; describes a &#8220;data-driven model&#8221; that defines a metric showing the probability a Facebook user can be uniquely identified based on interests attached to them by the ad platform.</p>
<p>The researchers demonstrate that they were able to use Facebook&#8217;s Ads manager tool to target a number of ads in such a way that each ad only reached a single, intended Facebook user.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The research raises fresh questions about potentially harmful uses of Facebook&#8217;s ad targeting tools, and &#8212; more broadly &#8212; questions about the legality of the tech giant&#8217;s personal data processing empire given that the information it collects on people can be used to uniquely identify individuals, picking them out of the crowd of others on its platform even purely based on their interests.</p>
<p>The findings could increase pressure on lawmakers to ban or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">phase out</a> behavioral advertising &#8212; which has been under attack for years, over concerns it poses a smorgasbord of individual and societal harms. And, at the least, the paper seems likely to drive calls for robust checks and balances on how such invasive tools can be used.</p>
<p>The findings also underscore the importance of independent research being able to interrogate algorithmic adtech &#8212; and should increase pressure on platforms not to close down researchers&#8217; access.</p>
<h2>Interests on Facebook are personal data</h2>
<p>&#8220;The results from our model reveal that the 4 rarest interests or 22 random interests from the interests set FB [Facebook] assigns to a user make them unique on FB with a 90% probability,&#8221; write the researchers from Madrid&#8217;s University Carlos III, the Graz University of Technology in Austria and the Spanish IT company, GTD System &amp; Software Engineering, detailing one key finding &#8212; that having a rare interest or lots of interests that Facebook knows about can make you easily identifiable on its platform, even among a sea of billions of other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that addresses individuals’ uniqueness considering a user base at the worldwide population’s order of magnitude,&#8221; they go on, referring to the scale inherent in Facebook&#8217;s data mining of its more than 2.8 billion active users (NB: The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/them-too/">processes information about non-users</a>, meaning its reach scales to even more internet users than are active on Facebook).</p>
<p>The researchers suggest the paper presents the first evidence of &#8220;the possibility of systematically exploiting the FB advertising platform to implement nanotargeting based on non-PII [interest-based] data&#8221;.</p>
<p>There have been earlier controversies over Facebook&#8217;s ad platform being a conduit for one-to-one manipulative &#8212; such as this 2019 <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/husband-brainwash-wife-spinner-ads-facebook/">Daily Dot</a> article about a company called the Spinner which was selling a &#8220;service&#8221; to sex-frustrated husbands to target psychologically manipulative messages at their wives and girlfriends. The suggestive, subliminally manipulative ads would pop up on the targets&#8217; Facebook and Instagram feeds.</p>
<p>The research paper also references an incident in U.K. political life, back in 2017, when Labour Party campaign chiefs apparently successfully used Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience ad-targeting tool to &#8220;pull the wool&#8221; over former leader Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s eyes. But in that case the targeting was not just at Corbyn; it also reached his<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> associates, and a few aligned journalists.</span></p>
<p>With this research the team demonstrates it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s Ads Manager tool to target ads at just one Facebook user &#8212; a process they&#8217;re referring to as &#8220;nanotargeting&#8221; (versus the current adtech &#8220;standard&#8221; of microtargeting &#8220;interest-based&#8221; advertising at groups of users).</p>
<p>&#8220;We run an experiment through 21 Facebook ad campaigns that target three of the authors of this paper to prove that, if an advertiser knows enough interests from a user, the Facebook Advertising Platform can be systematically exploited to deliver ads exclusively to a specific user&#8221;, they write, adding that the paper provides &#8220;the first empirical evidence&#8221; that one-to-one/nanotargeting can be &#8220;systematically implemented on FB by just knowing a random set of interests of the targeted user&#8221;.</p>
<p>The interest data they used for their analysis was collected from 2,390 Facebook users via a browser extension they created that the users had installed before January 2017.</p>
<p>The extension, called <a href="https://www.it.uc3m.es/acrumin/papers/CHI_2017.pdf">Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users</a>, parsed each user&#8217;s Facebook ad preferences page to gather the interests assigned to them, as well as providing a real-time estimate about the revenue they generate for Facebook based on the ads they receive while browsing the platform.</p>
<p>While the interest data was gathered before 2017, the researchers&#8217; experiments testing whether one-to-one targeting is possible through Facebook&#8217;s ad platform took place last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, we have configured nanotargeting ad campaigns targeting three authors of this paper&#8221;, they explain, discussing the results of their tests. &#8220;We tested the results of our data-driven model by creating tailored audiences for each targeted author using combinations of 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 20, and 22 randomly selected interests from the list of interests FB had assigned them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In total, we ran 21 ad campaigns between October and November 2020 to demonstrate that nanotargeting is feasible today. Our experiment validates the results of our model, showing that if an attacker knows 18+ random interests from a user, they will be able to nanotarget them with a very high probability. In particular, 8 out of the 9 ad campaigns that used 18+ interests in our experiment successfully nanotargeted the chosen user&#8221;.</p>
<p>So having 18 or more Facebook interests just got really interesting to anyone who wants to manipulate you.</p>
<h2>Nothing to stop nanotargeting</h2>
<p>One way to prevent one-to-one targeting would be if Facebook were to put a robust a limit on the minimum audience size.</p>
<p>Per the paper, the adtech giant provides a &#8220;Potential Reach&#8221; value to advertisers using its Ads Campaign Manager tool if the potential audience size for a campaign is greater than 1,000 (or greater than 20, prior to 2018 when Facebook increased the limit).</p>
<p>However the researchers found that Facebook does not actually prevent advertisers running a campaign targeting fewer users than those potential reach limits &#8212; the platform just does not tell advertisers how many (or, well, few) people their messaging will reach.</p>
<p>They were able to demonstrate this by running multiple campaigns that successfully targeted a single Facebook user &#8212; validating that the audience size for their ads was one by looking at data generated by Facebook&#8217;s ad reporting tools (&#8220;FB reported that only one user had been reached&#8221;); having a log record in their web server generated by the (sole) user click on the ad; and &#8212; in a third validation step &#8212; they asked each nanotargeted user to collect a snapshot of the ad and its associated “Why am I seeing this ad?” option. Which they say matched their targeting parameters in the successfully nanotargeted cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main conclusions derived from our experiment are the following: (i) nanotargeting a user on FB is highly likely if an attacker can infer 18+ interests from the targeted user; (ii) nanotargeting is extremely cheap, and (iii) based on our experiments, 2/3 of the nanotargeted ads are expected to be delivered to the targeted user in less than 7 effective campaign hours,&#8221; they add in a summary of the results.</p>
<p>In another section of the paper discussing countermeasures to prevent nanotargeting, the researchers argue that Facebook&#8217;s claimed limits on audience size &#8220;have been proven to be completely ineffective&#8221; &#8212; and assert that the tech giant&#8217;s limit of 20 is &#8220;not currently being applied&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also suggest there are workarounds for the limit of 100 that Facebook claims it applies to Custom Audiences (another targeting tool that involves advertisers uploading PII).</p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important countermeasure Facebook implements to prevent advertisers from targeting very narrow audiences are the limits imposed on the minimum number of users that can form an audience. However, those limits have been proven to be completely ineffective. On the one hand, Korolova et. al state that, motivated by the results of their paper, Facebook disallowed configuring audiences of size smaller than 20 using the Ads Campaign Manager. Our research shows that this limit is not currently being applied. On the other hand, FB enforces a minimum Custom Audience size of 100 users. As presented in Section 7.2.2, several works in the literature showed different ways to overcome this limit and implement nanotargeting ad campaigns using Custom Audiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the researchers refer throughout their paper to interest-based data as &#8220;non-PII&#8221; [aka, personally identifiable information] it is important to note that that framing is meaningless in a European legal context &#8212; where the law, under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes a much broader view of personal data.</p>
<p>PII is a more common term in the U.S. &#8212; which does not have comprehensive (federal) privacy legislation equivalent to the pan-EU GDPR.</p>
<p>Adtech companies also typically prefer to refer to PII, given it&#8217;s far more bounded a category versus all the information they actually process which can be used to identify and profile individuals to target them with ads.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">GDPR</a>, personal data does not only include the obvious identifiers, like a person&#8217;s name or email address (aka &#8216;PII&#8217;), but can also encompass information that can be used &#8212; indirectly &#8212; to identify an individual, such as a person&#8217;s location or indeed their interests.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant chunk from the GDPR (Article 4(1)) [emphasis ours]:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier <strong>or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person</strong>;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other research has also repeatedly &#8212; over decades &#8212; shown that re-identification of individuals is possible with, at times, just a handful of pieces of &#8220;non-PII&#8221; information, such as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/on-the-reidentifiability-of-credit-card-metadata/overview/">credit card metadata</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/">Netflix viewing habits</a>.</p>
<p>So it should not surprise us that Facebook&#8217;s vast people profiling, ad targeting empire, which continuously and pervasively mines internet users&#8217; activity for interest-based signals (aka, personal data) to profile individuals for the purpose of targeting them with &#8220;relevant&#8221; ads, has created a new attack vector for &#8212; potentially &#8212; manipulating almost anyone in the world if you know enough about them (and they have a Facebook account).</p>
<p>But that does not mean there are no legal problems here.</p>
<p>Indeed, the legal basis that Facebook claims for processing people&#8217;s personal data for ad targeting has been under challenge in the EU for years.</p>
<h2>Legal basis for ad targeting</h2>
<p>The tech giant used to claim that users consent to their personal data being used for ad targeting. However it does not offer a free, specific and informed choice to people over whether they want to be profiled for behavioral ads or just want to connect with their friends and family. (And free, specific and informed is the GDPR standard for consent.)</p>
<p>If you want to use Facebook you have to accept your information being used for ad targeting. This is what EU privacy campaigners have dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">forced consent</a>&#8220;. Aka, coercion, not consent.</p>
<p>However, since the GDPR came into application (back in May 2018), Facebook has &#8212; seemingly &#8212; switched to claiming it&#8217;s legally able to process Europeans&#8217; information for ads because users are actually in a contract with it to receive ads.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">preliminary decision</a> by Facebook&#8217;s lead EU regulator, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which was published earlier this week, has proposed to fine the company $36 million for not being transparent enough about that silent switch.</p>
<p>And while the DPC doesn&#8217;t seem to have a problem with Facebook&#8217;s ad contract claim, other European regulators disagree &#8212; and are likely to object to Ireland&#8217;s draft decision &#8212; so <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the regulatory scrutiny over that particular Facebook GDPR complaint is ongoing and far from over. </span></p>
<p>If the tech giant is ultimately found to be bypassing EU law it could finally be forced to give users a free choice over whether their information can be used for ad targeting &#8212; which would essentially blast an existential hole in its ad targeting empire, since even holding a few pieces of interest data is personal data, as this research underlines.</p>
<p>For now, though, the tech giant is using its customary tactic of denying there&#8217;s anything to see here.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the research, a Facebook spokesperson dismissed the paper &#8212; claiming it is &#8220;wrong about how our ad system works&#8221;.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s statement goes on to try to divert attention from the researchers&#8217; core conclusions in an effort to minimize the significance of their findings &#8212; with its spokesperson writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>This research is wrong about how our ad system works. The list of ads targeting interests we associate with a person are not accessible to advertisers, unless that person chooses to share them. Without that information or specific details that identify the person who saw an ad, the researchers’ method would be useless to an advertiser attempting to break our rules<em>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to Facebook&#8217;s rebuttal, one of the paper&#8217;s authors &#8212; Angel Cuevas &#8212; described its argument as &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; &#8212; saying the company should be deploying stronger countermeasures to prevent the risk of nanotargeting, rather than trying to claim there is no problem.</p>
<p>In the paper the researchers identify a number of harmful risks they say could be associated with nanotargeting &#8212; such as psychological persuasion, user manipulation and blackmailing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is surprising to find that Facebook is implicitly recognizing that nanotargeting is feasible and the only countermeasure is assuming advertisers are unable to infer users interests,&#8221; Cuevas told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many ways interests could be inferred by advertisers. We did that in our paper with a browser plug-in (with explicit consent from users for research purposes). Even more, beyond interests there are other parameters (we did not use in our research) such as age, gender, city, zip code, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think this is an unfortunate argument. We believe a player like Facebook can implement stronger countermeasures than assuming advertisers are unable to infer user interests to be later used to define audiences in the Facebook ads platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>One might recall &#8212; for example &#8212; the 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/">Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal</a>, where a developer that had access to Facebook&#8217;s platform was able to extract data on millions of users, without most of the users&#8217; knowledge or consent &#8212; via a quiz app.</p>
<p>So, as Cuevas says, it&#8217;s not hard to envisage similarly opaque and underhanded tactics being deployed by advertisers/attackers/agents to harvest Facebook users&#8217; interest data to try to manipulate specific individuals.</p>
<p>In the paper the researchers note that a few days after their<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> nanotargeting experiment had ended Facebook shuttered the account they&#8217;d used to run the campaigns &#8212; without explanation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The tech giant did not respond to specific questions we put to it about the research, including why it closed the account &#8212; and, if it did so because it had detected the nanotargeting issue, why it failed to prevent the ads running and targeting a single user in the first place. </span></p>
<h2>Expect litigation</h2>
<p>What might the wider implications be for Facebook&#8217;s business as a result of this research?</p>
<p>One privacy researcher we spoke to suggested the research will certainly be useful for litigation &#8212; which is growing in Europe, given the slow pace of privacy enforcement by EU regulators against Facebook specifically (and adtech more generally).</p>
<p>Another pointed out that the findings underline how Facebook has the ability to &#8220;systematically re-identity&#8221; users at scale &#8212; &#8220;while pretending it does not process &#8216;personal data&#8217; on the data&#8221; &#8212; suggesting the tech giant has amassed enough data on enough people that it can, essentially, circumvent narrowly bounded legal restrictions that might seek to put limits on its processing of PII.</p>
<p>So regulators looking to put meaningful limits on harms that can flow from behavioral advertising will need to be wise to how Facebook&#8217;s own algorithms can seek out and make use of proxies in the masses of data it holds and attaches to users &#8212; and its likely line of associated argument that its processing therefore avoids any legal implications (a tactic Facebook has used on the issue of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/facebook-faces-fresh-criticism-over-ad-targeting-of-sensitive-interests/">inferred sensitive interests</a>, for example).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">FB could use such categories, or others without labels, as proxies to systematically re-identify and single out (groups of) users at scale while pretending that it does not process &#39;personal data&#39; on the way.</p>

<p>Another privacy watcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent privacy researcher and consultant, called the research staggering &#8212; describing the paper as among the top 10 most important privacy research results of this decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching 1 user out of 2.8bn? While the Facebook platform claimed there are precautions making such microtargeting impossible? So far, this is among the top 10 most important privacy research results in this decade,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Such precision is totally identifying and singling out individuals. This is highly privacy invasive. I&#39;m SHOCKED that the researchers and the press describe it as &#39;without personal data&#39;. Not true! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDPR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GDPR</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ePrivacy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ePrivacy</a> <a href="https://t.co/LOe707CKyf">pic.twitter.com/LOe707CKyf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1448667592676175876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;It seems that users are identifiable by their interests in the meaning of article 4(1) of the GDPR, meaning that interests constitute personal data. The only caveat is that we are not certain how such a processing would scale [given the nanotesting was only tested on three users].&#8221;</p>
<p>Olejnik said the research shows the targeting is based on personal data &#8212; and &#8220;perhaps even special category data in the meaning of GDPR Article 9&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would mean that the user&#8217;s explicit consent is needed. Unless of course appropriate protections were made. But based on the paper we conclude that these, if present, are not sufficient,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the research indicates a breach of the GDPR, Olejnik said: &#8220;DPAs should investigate. No question about it,&#8221; adding: &#8220;Even if the matter may be technically challenging, building a case should take two days max.&#8221;</p>
<p>We flagged the research to Facebook&#8217;s lead DPA in Europe, the Irish DPC &#8212; asking the privacy regulator whether it would investigate to determine if there had been a breach of the GDPR or not &#8212; but at the time of writing it had not responded.</p>
<h2>Towards a ban on microtargeting?</h2>
<p>On the question of whether the paper strengthens the case for outlawing microtargeting, Olejnik argues that curbing the practice &#8220;is the way forward&#8221; &#8212; but says the question now is how to do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if the current industry and political environment would be prepared for a total ban now. We should demand technical precautions, at the very least,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, we were already told that these were in place but it appears this is not the case [in the case of nanotargeting on Facebook].&#8221;</p>
<p>Olejnik also suggested there could be changes coming down the pipe based on some of the ideas built into Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposal &#8212; which has, however, been stalled as a result of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">adtech complaints triggering competition scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>Asked for his views on a ban on microtargeting, Cuevas told us: &#8220;My personal position here is that we need to understand the tradeoff between privacy risks and economy (jobs, innovation, etc.). Our research definitely shows that the adtech industry should understand that just thinking of PII information (email, phone, postal address, etc.) is not enough and they need to implement more strict measures regarding the way audiences can be defined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saying that, we do not agree that microtargeting &#8212; understood as the capacity of defining an audience with (at least) tens of thousands of users &#8212; should be banned. There is a very important market behind microtargeting that creates many jobs and this is a very innovative sector that does interesting things that are not necessarily bad. Therefore, our position is limiting the potential of microtargeting to guarantee the privacy of the users.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the area of privacy we believe the open question that is not solved yet is the consent,&#8221; he also said. &#8220;The research community and the adtech ecosystem have to work (ideally together) to create an efficient solution that obtains the informed consent from users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming out, there are more legal requirements looming on the horizon for AI-driven tools in Europe.</p>
<p>Incoming EU legislation for high-risk applications of artificial intelligence &#8212; which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposed earlier this year</a> &#8212; has suggested a total ban on AI systems that deploy &#8220;subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness in order to materially distort a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s at least interesting to speculate whether Facebook&#8217;s platform might face a ban under the EU&#8217;s future AI Regulation &#8212; unless the company puts proper safeguards in place that robustly prevent the risk of its ad tools being used to blackmail or psychologically manipulate individual users.</p>
<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s lucrative business as usual for Facebook&#8217;s eyeball targeting empire.</p>
<p>Asked about plans for future research into the platform, Cuevas said the obvious next piece of work they want to do is to combine interests with other demographic information to see if nanotargeting is &#8220;even easier&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, it is very likely that an advertiser could can combine the age, gender, city (or zip code) of the user with a few interests to nanotarget a user,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;We would like to understand how many of these parameters you need to combine. Inferring the gender, age, location and few interests from a user may be much easier than inferring few tens of interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cuevas added that the nanotargeting paper has been accepted for presentation at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2021/schedule/">ACM Internet Measurement Conference</a> next month.</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction: We originally misstated that the researchers had used Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience tool to nanotarget individual users &#8212; the tool is actually called Facebook Ads Manager</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Climate in the last decade has been unprecedented in many ways, none of them good.</p>
<p>Wildfires in California have consumed entire towns; thousands of miles away, New Yorkers inhale the ashes. Across Europe and Japan, flash floods wreak widespread devastation. We all see the videos on YouTube and CNN. And we shrug.</p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/">6th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report</a> concluded that human-created climate change is taking place faster than we thought, calling it a &#8220;code-red alert.&#8221; At just 2 degrees warmer than today, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02323/full">one estimate predicts more than 300,000,000 climate-related deaths</a> globally by 2100. And that’s the optimistic estimate. Global warming is overwhelming and feels impossible to fix. What the hell can we do?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like many of you, I am an optimist. Humanity has come to the limits of nature many times in the past, and has overcome them with technology. We have always adapted ourselves to our environment; changing our technology and behavior due to environmental change is part of our history.</p>
<p>Regulation will help incentivize corporations to clean up, but only technology can solve the intractable problem of sustainably giving us what we desire. Thoughtless consumption brought us climate change, but it is also true that mindful consumption can get us out of it.</p>
<p>How do we use capitalism to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions worldwide? Follow the carbon. That leads us to the three main bottlenecks on the road to net-zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>What follows is necessarily a high-level overview of huge and complex industries. I’ve purposely left out granular details so we could address the overarching issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Electrification: 36 gigatons CO2 emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $7 trillion</h3>
<p>Global carbon usage is highest in energy production as we burn coal, oil and natural gas to power our cars, cities and industry (yes, coal is still mined and burned in 2021). That’s a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es400399h">whopping 36 gigatons of CO2 emissions per year</a>. Why do we still burn coal? It&#8217;s cheap, on-demand, universal, portable, an order of magnitude more efficient than lithium-ion batteries, and much safer.</p>
<p>But it needs to be eliminated, very soon.</p>
<p>The IPCC report found that 89% of global CO2 emissions come from fossil fuels. Further, it tells us we must cut these emissions in half over the next decade or risk a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in average global temperatures.</p>
<p>Currently, wind and solar cannot produce electricity 100% of the time; generated energy must be stored rather than just dumped if unused, as it is done today. There are many ways of producing clean energy today, including nuclear, tidal, hydroelectric, geothermal and other means. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/fusion-energy-is-coming-and-maybe-sooner-than-you-think/">Fusion is advancing every year</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Civilization was born alongside the sheep and cow, but 10,000 years later, the sheep, cow and pig are killing us. They emit 10% of global greenhouse gases, and global demand for meat is skyrocketing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We will need more than double today’s clean energy output to service growing demand. But until we can store this energy and use it in cars, boats, airplanes and more, clean energy production will not eliminate the need for oil and coal. Energy storage is the main bottleneck for a global electric economy. We need bigger, safer and cleaner batteries that can be used everywhere from the grid to our cars to our homes, and keep the lights on when we need them most.</p>
<p>You and I won’t be buying these batteries, but they will power everything we do buy. From cars to the cargo ships that deliver them to the airplanes that carry us, they will all eventually be electric. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/united-airlines-to-buy-100-19-seat-electric-planes-from-heart-aerospace-.html">Boeing just ordered 100 electric planes from Heart Aerospace</a>, in which it also invested. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/world/yara-birkeland-norway-crewless-container-ship-spc-intl/index.html">world’s first electric cargo ship</a>, the Yara Birkeland, built by Marin Teknikk, is scheduled to have its maiden voyage soon.</p>
<p>There are no fewer than a dozen electric aircraft companies and six dozen electric vehicle companies. But the bottleneck for these efforts to scale and replace all fossil fuel planes, ships and cars with equivalent performance is a humble battery capable of delivering sustained, high power output over a long period of time. Without that fundamental advancement, these companies will stay in the conceptual stage for a long time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lithium-based battery technology still only has one-tenth the maximum energy density of gasoline (which is around 50 megajoules per kilogram). It isn&#8217;t enough. The closest we can get with lithium-ion technology is the lithium-air battery, which has a theoretical energy density of 40 megajoules per kilogram, but new electrolytes need to be invented for it to work. Like Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier to usher in the supersonic era, we need to break through this density barrier to power our green future.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that melanin, our skin pigment, has also shown promise as a potent cathode that can make rechargeable sodium batteries a possibility. This would enable large-scale “salt” batteries that can be used to create a safe and clean grid storage solution. Researchers have also used viruses to create nanolayers of different elements to make higher-performance cathodes. Other lines of research have shown that batteries driven by enzymatic catalysts can potentially use sugar water to slowly charge your car or house with bio-electricity. None of the solutions above are within a decade to market; all are in the research stage.</p>
<p>The winners of the electrification wars will aggregate these technologies across industries and provide consumers with a seamless, wonderful experience. From fast wireless charging of electronics and vehicles to self-adapting national electrical grids, an electrified world will be quieter, efficient and clean. I am excited about the prospect of living in a fully electric world.</p>
<h2>Rematerialization: 10.2 gigatons emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $12 trillion</h3>
<p>Every object in the room you’re sitting in was made unsustainably and reeks of carbon emissions. The cement floor, sofa, dining table, desk, refrigerator, sink, chairs, even the walls contribute to climate change. Consumers have no choice; they can’t buy green, and we need to change this.</p>
<p>Durable goods and our built environment alone account for <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es400399h">more than 10.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions yearly</a>, or nearly one-third of total emissions. The heights of dirty industry need to be toppled and rebuilt from scratch with a new goal in mind: Sustainable production for hundreds of years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Cement</strong></p>
<p>Global cement production emits <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/low-carbon-concrete-can-fight-global-warming">nearly 2.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year</a>. There are dozens of green cement companies now trying various approaches to eliminating CO2 emissions from cement and concrete. At IndieBio, I invested in Carbix, a company that takes CO2 emissions and uses them to make olivine cement. They have made a few bricks and are years from the market.</p>
<p>The main barrier for most green cement formulators is proving equivalent structural performance. Getting to scale is expensive. However, a few companies promising greener concrete are coming to market in the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Steel</strong></p>
<p>Making steel and aluminum is energy-intensive. In fact, aluminum is referred to by many commodity traders as “energy in solid form.” Powering our foundries with clean energy and reducing their carbon usage <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel">will help eliminate 8% of emissions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wood</strong></p>
<p>Trees are our biggest carbon sinks. They suck in CO2 from the air and exhale the oxygen we breathe. So why do we still cut them down?</p>
<p>Hopefully, soon we won’t have to. Companies are using flax and other natural fibers to create bio-composites that are stiffer than steel and lighter than wood, or developing sustainable bamboo for exterior building panels. Others are experimenting with mushroom mycelium to grow entire buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Leather and fabrics</strong></p>
<p>Cows contribute 7.1 gigatons of CO2 per year to global warming, <a href="https://clear.ucdavis.edu/explainers/using-global-emission-statistics-distracting-us-climate-change-solutions">a full 14.5% of the total</a>. We don’t just eat them, we use their skin a lot. Leather is everywhere, from shoes and couches to purses and clothing. We need to replace this material if we are to eliminate cows from our supply chain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a dozen companies are making headway into eliminating plastic and leather from fashion. All are finding tremendous traction with consumer companies looking to provide their consumers with vegan and sustainable products.</p>
<p>Fabrics like polyester are made of petrochemicals. Fermentation technologies excel at making oils from sugar water by using algae or yeast as a factory. Fermentation is scalable and exists today, while a newer technology called cell-free synthesis is being applied to these same problems. We can expect new green fabrics in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial chemicals</strong></p>
<p>Break down oil and you get a list of unpronounceable names that make much of our world. These chemicals are used in engines, antifreeze, cosmetics and even foods. To eliminate any need for oil, these products must be replaced through fermentation, which converts sugar into chemicals.</p>
<p>The sugar can come from corn or even waste CO2 in chimneys. Cells don’t have to be alive either, as cell-free synthesis allows the enzymes themselves to do the work. A huge number of companies have been started to remake all these chemicals through varieties of fermentation and synthesis.</p>
<p>Rematerializing our planets with sustainable, carbon-neutral sources can remove up to 10 gigatons of emissions from our economy. Our houses and everything inside them will eventually become carbon-neutral through rematerialization. I am excited about breaking this bottleneck to progress because it naturally leads to better products for everyone.</p>
<h2>Food: 3.6 gigatons C02 emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $10 trillion</h3>
<p>The first slide of a presentation I gave to explain the new food revolution depicted cavemen with spears being mauled by a giant prehistoric bear. The point? Protein is important enough to die for. As we transitioned from hunting to farming, our society reorganized around cities and the division of labor.</p>
<p>Civilization was born alongside the sheep and cow, but 10,000 years later, the sheep, cow and pig are killing us. They <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">emit 10% of global greenhouse gases</a>, and global demand for meat is skyrocketing. Over the past six years at IndieBio, I&#8217;ve invested in Clara Foods, Geltor, Memphis Meats (now Upside Foods), NotCo,and many others to reinvent agriculture through fermentation, plant-based formulations and cell-based culture.</p>
<p>These startups reinvented familiar foods like burgers, mayonnaise, popcorn shrimp, egg whites, poke bowls, sausages and chicken wings. As affluent societies began eating more processed foods, foods became products: Cows became burgers, pigs became bacon and chickens are now nuggets. A legion of food-as-product companies have followed in their footsteps and there are entire conferences dedicated to them. &#8220;Food is hot&#8221; is an understatement in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Having been a part of the food revolution from its earliest days, I am struck by the magnitude of these revolutions once they really get going. I am also wary of revolutions that stall. Cell-based foods should be on the market next year and consumers will get to decide for themselves if the revolution is for them. So the final shape and form of the world once the revolutions roll through society and become the new normal is not easy to predict.</p>
<p>I am a fan of history, so I look into the past to see where we are going next. My mother’s recipe for curry chicken is a good place to start. It calls for chicken thighs with the bone in, chopped. If I want to make a low-carbon, animal-free version of that recipe, I’d have to use something other than chicken, but what? Just’s cell-based chicken nuggets? No, breaded chicken nuggets won’t work, nor would soy alternatives. Beyond Curry? My mom wouldn&#8217;t approve.</p>
<h2>Biofarming real food</h2>
<p>For agriculture to be reinvented for everyone, not just the 1%, we must make food. Real, natural food. Steaks, chicken breasts and thighs, bone-in meats and spare ribs. Not a processed version of these products, but ingredients to make whole-food dishes.</p>
<p>Food 3.0 is biofarming. Biofarming will have to solve for taste and wholesome nutrition. Delicious foods with no processing other than mom’s recipe. Regenerative agriculture will enable carbon-neutral vegetables and plants if we can help farmers get their yields high enough to turn a profit while a field is fallow for a season. Numerous technologies are helping to achieve this.</p>
<h2>We aren’t F’d yet</h2>
<p>Bloomberg recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/climate-change-linked-to-5-million-deaths-a-year-new-study-shows">reported</a> that there have been over 5 million deaths a year globally from climate change-related events from 2009 to 2019. That&#8217;s 1 in 10 deaths on the planet. Since we do not track this statistic (we track heat stroke, drowning, landslide, suicide, and the things that directly kill us), nor other effects like people not having children and extreme anxiety, it is impossible to know the true magnitude of misery climate change will bring. How far will we let this go before we all act? How many more will have to die?</p>
<p>The new normal doesn’t need to be this way. Scientists can choose to apply their work to solve the paradox of carbon and production. Investors can choose to put money into companies rebuilding our world to be gentle and green. And entrepreneurs can choose to build companies that reshape our carbon economy for the greatest opportunity in history. The above road map represents the ability to erase nearly all carbon emissions by humanity.</p>
<p>We are far from doomed. Together, we will all build and we will all fight for our future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM-owned Pandora is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pandora-launches-the-lookout-by-soundcloud-301401002.html">partnering with SoundCloud</a> to launch &#8220;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3324202-1&amp;h=2999458705&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpandora.app.link%2FDKybDpowkkb&amp;a=HERE">The Lookout by SoundCloud</a>,&#8221; a new station available on Pandora that aims to showcase music from the “hip hop superstars of tomorrow.” Today’s announcement comes as Pandora’s parent company, SiriusXM, recently partnered with SoundCloud to launch a show of the same name on its Hip-Hop Nation channel. It’s no surprise that SiriusXM is joining forces with SoundCloud across its properties, as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/music-streaming-pioneer-soundcloud-raises-75m-from-pandora-owner-siriusxm/">invested $75 million in SoundCloud</a> last year.</p>
<p>The Lookout by SoundCloud features new artists weekly, like Toosii, Sheff G, Metro Marrs, Young Devyn, $NOT, Dro Kenji, Cico P, Flo Milli, Nevi, SoFaygo, Isaiah Rashad, Sleepy Rose and more. The station features songs heard on the SiriusXM SoundCloud show.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a hit slot on SiriusXM&#8217;s Hip-Hop Nation and now a new home on Pandora, SoundCloud&#8217;s top playlist, &#8216;The Lookout&#8217;, is the go-to source with the largest digital audio reach for fans to discover the best in breaking hip hop,&#8221; said R. Caiaffa, the interim head of music at SoundCloud, in a statement. &#8220;Joining forces with Pandora to expand &#8216;The Lookout by SoundCloud&#8217; amps up our shared commitment to help the emerging hip-hop artist community to get heard and discovered.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218810" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new station originates from one of SoundCloud’s most popular playlists, ‘The Lookout,’ which launched in 2019. The playlist has since become a popular destination for discovering the next generation of rising stars in hip hop.</p>
<p>SiriusXM notes that The Lookout has spotlighted some of today’s biggest artists in hip hop before they became household names, including Pop Smoke, Megan Thee Stallion, Roddy Ricch, Rod Wave and more.</p>
<p>It’s clear that SiriusXM is looking to attract more younger listeners across its offerings with its various partnerships with SoundCloud. Additionally, SiriusXM recently launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/siriusxm-launches-tiktok-radio-a-music-channel-featuring-viral-hits-hosted-by-tiktok-stars/">TikTok Radio channel</a>, which features TikTok creators as channel hosts, in another push to capture a younger audience. The station is designed to sound like a radio version of TikTok’s &#8220;For You&#8221; feed.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, SiriusXM and Pandora have also struck deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">Simplecast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">Stitcher</a> to become more competitive in both music and podcast streaming. Most recently, SiriusXM partnered with audio entertainment production studio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/siriusxm-partners-with-audio-up-to-develop-new-original-podcasts/">Audio Up</a> to develop new original scripted podcasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In emerging economies, where spending billions to build public transit infrastructure can be out of reach, startups are using technology to meet the mobility needs of a rising urban middle class.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swvl.com/">Swvl</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/plentywaka-founder-onyeka-akumah-on-african-startups-and-global-expansion/">Treepz</a>, <a href="https://www.jatri.co/">Jatri</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/">SafeBoda</a>, <a href="https://urbvan.com/">Urbvan</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">Chalo</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-startup-buser-raises-138-million-lgt-softbank-others-2021-06-10/">Buser</a> are just a few of the startups that have popped up in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America in recent years,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> all with a focus on providing on-demand access to transportation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are these startups products of the emerging markets, but because mobility is so essential to a thriving economy, they’re actually driving development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that if you want to get good economies of scale and see the positive spillovers of a big urban space, you need to be able to get around at a low cost and in an efficient way,” Nikos Tsafos, the James R. Schlesinger Chair in Energy and Geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told TechCrunch. “What this does is it enlarges the labor market and makes it more efficient.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2204834" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Necessity might be the mother of innovation, but that innovation isn&#8217;t limited to the economies where it was conceived. These startups are also providing a less car-centric blueprint for the rest of the world, including economies with existing public transit.</p>
<p>The table stakes stretch beyond the financial future of a handful of startups. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If startups like these don&#8217;t succeed, one of the risks is that as GDP continues to grow in emerging markets, populations with more discretionary funds will end up purchasing their own vehicles, which will only contribute to the global climate crisis.</span></p>
<h3><b>Swvl: Repurposing underutilized vehicles for shared transport</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl is a Dubai-based startup that provides shared transportation services for intracity and intercity trips for both individual commuters and corporations, schools and tour operators. Since its founding in 2017, the startup has expanded across UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kenya and Pakistan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its business model revolves around repurposing underutilized buses or minivans that are privately owned, usually by small or medium-sized businesses and fleet owners, for different uses throughout the day. For example, when a bus that usually drives kids to and from school only twice a day signs on with Swvl, it will also be used for a combination of intracity B2C routes, corporate drives, intercity rides or tour group rides.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This significantly increases utilization of that vehicle,&#8221; Mostafa Kandil, CEO and founder of Swvl, told TechCrunch. &#8220;With every incremental utilization of the vehicle, the fixed component of the cost of the vehicle itself gets amortized over more and more rides, so we’re able to pay less and less on a per-unit level and on a per-ride level. Hence, we’re able to continuously drop our price to the end consumer while actually significantly increasing our margin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders can book a seat on a fixed route and track their ride at every step. In cities where public transit is unreliable or dangerous, services like Swvl’s can be a game-changer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Swvl is close to becoming a unicorn is a signal of the strength of this industry. In July, the company entered into a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">SPAC agreement with Queen&#8217;s Gambit Growth Capital</a> with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an implied enterprise value of $1.5 billion, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl says it is forecasting an annualized gross revenue of $79 million through December, which is an increase of about 55% from February 2020 revenues of $51 million. By 2025, the startup also plans to achieve $1 billion in annual gross revenue and operate in 20 countries on five continents, with SaaS or transportation as a Service (TaaS) expansions set to occur across Europe, the U.S. and the APAC region through a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/swvl-expands-into-europe-latam-and-apac-via-acquisition-of-mass-transit-saas-platform-shotl-301358508.html"> recent acquisition of Spanish-based mass transit SaaS platform Shotl</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the immediate need to provide basic transportation to growing middle classes, Kandil says the initial product-market fit is naturally within emerging markets, but he sees Swvl’s services in global terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Governments across the world spend billions of dollars on transportation infrastructure that are actually becoming obsolete,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you think about New York in the summer versus in the winter, it’s a totally different city. The movements, the patterns in a city change quite significantly throughout the year, but the public transportation system doesn’t really change. So what we are building is the mass transit system of the future that can serve any type of city with a public transportation system that’s demand-responsive, that can change every day, every hour, and can self-optimize based on how the entire city is moving.”</span></p>
<h3><b>How Treepz provides ‘Uber for buses’ in Nigeria</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onyeka Akumah, CEO and founder of Treepz, formerly Plentywaka, said the day his startup was conceived was the day he got off a plane in Lagos and had to take two bikes, a boat and then a bus just to get around town for meetings. He described the bus experience as a harrowing one where he literally “had to hold one of the doors throughout the trip from falling off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lagos is Nigeria’s largest city, with 14 million residents who have to commute daily. While the country has the most startups in Africa, it falls short of other metrics that would help it rank competitively among other African nations, according to an </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/05/24/south-afria-future-tech-ecosystem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African Tech Ecosystem ranking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For entrepreneurship to thrive, fDi Intelligence, the specialist division within Financial Times that published the report, says a country must have cost-effectiveness, country-wide tech talent, cooperative government, good internet access and healthy infrastructure. Much of this simply cannot be achieved if people can&#8217;t move around easily, efficiently and cheaply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treepz provides another example of the public sector stepping forward and, hopefully, driving the country toward prosperity. The startup offers a similar service to Swvl, one where commuters can book intracity or intercity travel through an app, reserve their seat and track their ride. While Treepz has expanded throughout the country, it also plans to move into Uganda, Ghana and a handful of other African nations over the next few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people have to commute on a daily basis using public transportation, and if they can’t afford an Uber ride, and they want to get to work on time, this is the only way they can do it,” Akumah told TechCrunch. “We wanted to give people a better way to commute with predictability, where they can know when the bus will get here, the certainty that they will have a seat on the vehicle, that it’s a decent vehicle and a safe one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Swvl allows customers to book a seat online and then pay the driver later with cash, Treepz presently won’t accept cash, which is part of the reason the service is really geared toward the middle class. Akumah said at the moment, cash is too risky because it invites corruption at the worst and difficulty keeping track of sales at best.</span></p>
<h3><b>Creating accountability for Bangladesh’s public transport with Jatri</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bangladesh-based Jatri aims to address the problem of inconsistent public transportation timetables, payment difficulties and constantly changing routes. The startup says it’s the first bus tracking and digital ticketing platform in Bangladesh, serving both bus companies that need to regulate how their buses were functioning and commuters who need a more frictionless service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders can subscribe, plan their trips, track buses and secure tickets, while operators can utilize Jatri’s bus trip analytics. The company is also working on creating data that regulators can use for urban planning purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jatri was founded in 2019 and in that time has digitized the operations of thousands of bus partners, hosting more than 3.5 million transport tickets on its platform across three cities. Earlier this month, the startup raised a $1.2 million pre-Series A round that it says it will use to expand its nationwide coverage. It recently partnered with BRTC, a state-owned transport corporation of Bangladesh, to provide its tracking and ticketing services for many of its routes, with the possibility of nationwide adoption.</span></p>
<h3>The role of transportation in emerging markets</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the middle class grows and incomes rise, people tend to become more concerned with the quality of services like mass transit. </span><a href="https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/bangladeshs-rising-middle-class-myths-and-realities-1614610680"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rising expectations could potentially become a source of friction for a country like Bangladesh, where its citizens may experience what economist Albert Hirschman described as the “tunnel effect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when vulnerable members of society start to see increased inequality based on an uneven growth process. They initially tolerate it, expecting that their time for prosperity will come. But if they do not catch up in time, their tolerance may morph into frustration &#8212; and ultimately sociopolitical upheavals. </span></p>
<p>Which is what makes the emergence of startups dedicated to easing the strain of public transportation so vital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transportation systems have the ability to connect people to jobs, as well as leisure and like green spaces and entertainment,&#8221; said Tsafos. &#8220;Those are the central elements for the vibrancy of the city, so what I would be expecting is in the absence of those transportation solutions is a city that&#8217;s underperforming and is not living up to its potential because you just have a fragmented urban space that can&#8217;t take full advantage of the human capital that resides in this sort of broad metropolitan area.&#8221;</p>

Global web standards that specify how to support screen reader users as well as other people with disabilities have been available since 1999, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/web-accessibility-blind-users-dominos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wired.com/story/web-accessibility-blind-users-dominos/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdb1YOPvAZoi0vK4ZikzwOQjSFNw">an estimated 70% of websites</a> are still not accessible. Why is that? And more importantly, what can be done?</p>

Be sure to join <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9a5EUx9efS8G_pRc65-Dicxw5xg">Sight Tech Global</a> for this very important session.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To understand the technical challenge to accessibility, it’s helpful to contrast screen readers with web browsers. For more than 20 years, web developers have been building consensus on how web browsers should interpret and display web code so every web page can look and feel the same no matter which browser or device is used to view it. Companies that develop browsers and other key stakeholders in the web industry have invested heavily to create standards and build massive infrastructure that runs millions of tests every day. These tests guarantee the thousands of little coding agreements that make it possible to “write code once and then run it everywhere.” When code operates the same way in two different browsers, it is called “browser interoperability.” Browser interoperability is one of the key ingredients in the explosion of the web.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, there has never been a similar consensus when it comes to screen reader interoperability. People using screen readers experience the same website differently depending on which screen reader, browser and device they are using. Conversely, there is no way for developers to code and test once for all screen readers. They have to test each combination and then make difficult choices because there are many types of experiences that cannot be made to work equally well in all screen readers. So, in addition to making accessible web development expensive and needlessly frustrating, the lack of screen reader interoperability is inherently exclusionary. If you need a screen reader but don’t use one of the same screen readers that the web developer used, it is likely you will run into challenges, if not outright barriers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lack of interoperability for not only screen readers but all assistive technologies is one of the most significant obstacles to a more inclusive web. It is responsible for much of the inconsistency in accessibility quality, and it explains why there is so little automation to make accessibility faster and easier for developers, content creators and accessibility auditors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enter the W3C ARIA-AT Community Group, which has been intensely focused on solving this deeply embedded problem. The acronym stands for World Wide Web Consortium Accessible Rich Internet Application and Assistive Technology (ARIA-AT), which encompasses the standards-driving work of the W3C experts who are collaborating on the project. Facebook is underwriting the cost of the project and lending Matt King, a technical program manager for Facebook accessibility, to lead the effort.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At Sight Tech Global, Matt King will join Facebook’s Mike Shebanek and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fairchild-15381928/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fairchild-15381928/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWsGvJxdrdWv6fg0q2EPeDJ27Frg">Michael Fairchild</a>, a senior accessibility consultant at Deque Systems, to explain how the ARIA-AT project is about to make a step-change in web accessibility by building consensus around screen reader behavior expectations and developing the tests, automation technologies and testing infrastructure needed to bring screen reader interoperability to the world of web engineering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The ARIA-AT project is bringing to fruition a dream that has fueled years of work,&#8221; says King. “It will fundamentally change how we engineer web accessibility so it is finally practical to build experiences that are as reliable and enjoyable for assistive technology users as they are for anyone else. ARIA-AT will provide a missing cornerstone of equity for people who rely on assistive technologies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://datasociety.net/people/fleet-chancey/">moderator</a> for the discussion will be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chancey-fleet-35063317" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/chancey-fleet-35063317&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8jzNgV9dhElZfTL6RStTpoV1-rA">Chancey Fleet</a>, assistive technology coordinator at the New York Public Library, “whose writing, organizing and advocacy aims to catalyze critical inquiry into how cloud-connected accessibility tools benefit and harm, empower and expose communities of disability.”</p>

<p>Microsoft worked with merchandise manufacturer Ukonic! on the mini fridge, which has LEDs and a design to match the Xbox Series X. The small appliance can hold up to 12 cans of your favorite energy drink or another beverage. There&#8217;s some space in the door&#8217;s shelves for snacks too. A DC power adaptor is included, and there&#8217;s a USB port, which could come in handy for recharging your Xbox Wireless Controller.</p>
<p>The mini fridge will be available via Target in the US and Canada. Folks in the UK can buy it from Game for £90. The fridge will also ship in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Netherlands and Poland at the outset. Microsoft plans to bring the Xbox Mini Fridge to more markets next year, though where and when depends on regulatory approvals and restrictions in each country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Missouri governor Mike Parson is facing a monumental backlash after threatening to prosecute a journalist for responsibly reporting a serious <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vulnerability/">security lapse</a> in the state’s website.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist Josh Renaud <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agencys-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html">reported</a> that the website for the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) was exposing over 100,000 teachers’ Social Security numbers. These SSNs were discovered by viewing the HTML source code of the site&#8217;s web pages, allowing anyone with an internet connection to find the sensitive information by right-clicking the page and hitting &#8220;view page source.&#8221; For many, viewing a web page&#8217;s source code is as simple as hitting F12 on your keyboard.</p>
<p>The Post-Dispatch reported the vulnerability to state authorities to patch the website, and delayed publishing a story about the problem to give the state enough time to fix the problem. The DESE has since <a href="https://oa.mo.gov/commissioners-office/news/state-missouri-addresses-data-vulnerability">confirmed</a> that the &#8220;educator certification search tool was disabled immediately&#8221; and that the vulnerability is now fixed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218696" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That should have been the end of it. While any other official might have thanked the newspaper for uncovering the flaw and for giving a heads-up before going public<b>, </b>Missouri’s Republican Governor Mike Parson described the journalist who uncovered the vulnerability as a “hacker”, and said the newspaper uncovered the flaw in &#8220;an attempt to embarrass the state&#8221;.</p>
<p>“A hacker is someone who gains unauthorized access to information or content. This individual did not have permission to do what they did,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “This individual is not a victim. They were acting against a state agency to compromise teachers’ personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines to their news outlet.</p>

<p>“The state is committed to bring to justice anyone who hacked our system and anyone who aided and abetted them to do so,&#8221; said Parson. The governor has also referred the case to county prosecutors.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the governor’s response to the Post-Dispatch report — and his clearly confused understanding of the term &#8220;hacker&#8221; — has sparked criticism, even from within his own party. Republican lawmaker Tony Lovasco wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/tonylovasco/status/1448672694065668105">Twitter</a> that it was &#8220;clear the governor&#8217;s office has a fundamental misunderstanding of both web technology and industry-standard procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities,” adding that “journalists responsibly sounding an alarm on data privacy is not criminal hacking.”</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden also called out Parson&#8217;s remarks, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1448733737856888840">tweeting</a>: “Journalism isn&#8217;t a crime. Cybersecurity research isn&#8217;t either. Real leaders don&#8217;t unleash their attack dogs on the press when they expose government failures, they roll up their sleeves and fix the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally, those within the cybersecurity industry have also been quick to weigh in on Parson&#8217;s comments. Rachel Tobac, a hacker and CEO of SocialProof Security, <a href="https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1448732967967223816">tweeted</a>: “If your code leaks personal data via public development tools that any person can see by simply pressing F12 on a keyboard then you have a huge data leak issue, not a hacking situation, on your hands.”</p>
<p>The Post-Dispatch is also taking Parson’s response with a pinch of salt, and is standing by Renaud. The paper said its journalist “did the responsible thing by reporting his findings to DESE so that the state could act to prevent disclosure and misuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>“A hacker is someone who subverts computer security with malicious or criminal intent. Here, there was no breach of any firewall or security and certainly no malicious intent,&#8221; it added in a statement. &#8220;For DESE to deflect its failures by referring to this as ‘hacking’ is unfounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, while Parson is vowing to hold the Post-Dispatch &#8220;accountable&#8221; for the supposed crime of helping the state find and fix a security vulnerability, the chances of Renaud facing an eventual conviction are likely slim, given a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/">case of Van Buren v. United States</a>, which ruled that a person violates the law when they access files or other information that they would otherwise be unable to.</p>
<p>But should the state take action, a prosecution could have a chilling effect on journalism and security research, further amplifying the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/what3words-legal-threat-whatfreewords/">problem of researchers facing legal threats and attacks</a> after discovering and reporting security flaws to their owners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security cameras, for better or for worse, are part and parcel of how many businesses monitor spaces in the workplace for security or operational reasons. Now, a startup is coming out of stealth with funding for tech designed to make the video produced by those cameras more useful. <a href="https://www.spot.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spot AI</a> has built a software platform that &#8220;reads&#8221; that video footage &#8212; regardless of the type or quality of camera it was created on &#8212; and makes video produced by those cameras searchable by anyone who needs it, both by way of words and by way of images in the frames shot by the cameras.</p>
<p>Spot AI has been quietly building its technology and customer base since 2018, and already has hundreds of customers and thousands of users. Notably, its customers reach well beyond tech early adopters, spanning from SpaceX to transportation company Cheeseman, Mixt and Northland Cold Storage.</p>
<p>Now that Spot AI is releasing its product more generally, it is disclosing $22 million in funding, a $20 million Series A led by Redpoint Ventures with Bessemer Venture Partners also participating, and a previous $2 million seed round from angels, Village Global and Stanford StartX (where the three founders studied). Other investors are not being disclosed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The gap in the market that Spot AI is aiming to fill is the one created by some of the more legacy technology used by organizations today: a huge amount of security cameras &#8212; in 2019 estimated at <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-u-s-uses-surveillance-cameras-just-as-much-as-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million in the U.S. alone</a>, although that also includes public video surveillance &#8212; are in use in the workplace today, usually set up around entrances to buildings, in office buildings themselves, in factories and other campus environments and so on, both to track the movement of people as well as the state of inanimate objects and locations used by the business (for example, machines, doorways, rooms and so on).</p>
<p>The issue is that many of these cameras are very old, analogue set-ups; and whether they are older or newer hardware, the video that is produced on them is of a very basic nature. It&#8217;s there for single-purpose uses; it is not indexable and older video gets erased; and often it doesn&#8217;t even work as it is supposed to. Indeed, security cam footage is neglected enough that people usually only realize how badly something works or didn&#8217;t work at all just when they actually need to see some footage (only to discover it is not there). And some of the more sophisticated solutions that do exist are very expensive and unlikely to be adopted quickly by the wider market of very non-tech, analogue companies.</p>
<p>On top of all this, security cameras have a very bad rap, not helped by their multifaceted, starring role in video surveillance systems. Backlash happens both because of how they get used in public environments &#8212; perhaps in the name of public safety, but still there as quiet observers and recorders of everything we do whether we want them there or not &#8212; and in how private security video footage gets appropriated in the aftermath of being recorded. In those cases, some of that is intentional, such as when Amazon&#8217;s Ring has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ring-police-warrants-neighbors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared footage with police</a>. And some is unintentional &#8212; see the <a href="https://therecord.media/verkada-hacker-charged-in-the-us-for-hacking-more-than-100-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosure of hackers accessing and posting video</a> from another startup building video systems for enterprises, Verkada.</p>
<p>Spot AI is entering the above market with all good intentions, CEO and co-founder Tanuj Thapliyal said in an interview. The startup&#8217;s theory is that security cameras are already important and the point is to figure out how to use them better, for more productive purposes that can cover not just security, but health and safety and operations working as they should.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you make the video data [produced by these cameras] more useful and accessible to more people in the workplace, then you transform it from this idea of surveillance to the idea of video intelligence,&#8221; said Thapliyal, who co-founded the company with Rish Gupta and Sud Bhatija. &#8220;It can help you make all sorts of important decisions.&#8221; Its ethos seems to come out of the idea that these cameras are here, so we need to find better ways of using them more effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>The Spot AI system currently comes in three parts. The first is a<a href="https://www.spot.ai/product/cameras" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> set of cameras</a> that Spot AI offers as an option to any of its customers, free of charge, currently to keep even if a customer decides to cease working with Spot AI. These cameras, 5MP, IP-based devices, are designed to upgrade the quality of video feeds, although Thapliyal points out that the Spot AI system can actually work with footage from any camera at all if necessary.</p>
<p>The second part is a <a href="https://www.spot.ai/product/nvr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network video recorder</a> that captures video from all of the cameras you have deployed. These are edge computers, fitted with AI chips that process and begin reading and categorizing the video that is captured, turning it into data that can be then searched through the third part of Spot AI&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>That third part is a <a href="https://www.spot.ai/product/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dashboard</a> that both lets users search through a company&#8217;s video troves by keywords or processes, and create frames and alerts on current streams to note when something has occurred in the frame (for example, a door opening, or a person entering a space, or even something not working as it should).</p>
<p>The idea is that this part of the video service will become more sophisticated over time (and indeed there are more features being added even going from stealth into GA). While there are a number of IoT plays out there that are designed to help monitor connected devices, the pitch with Spot AI is that it can be more attuned to how connected and not-connected things are moving about in physical spaces, regardless of whether they involve connected devices or not.</p>
<p>I asked Thapliyal about the security issues reported about Verkada &#8212; both the incident involving<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> malicious hackers</a> earlier this year, and another accusation <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdyqm/surveillance-startup-used-own-cameras-to-harass-coworkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going back years</a> about how some employees at the company itself abused its video systems. The company is close enough in targeting similar markets &#8212; and coincidentally both have a connection to Meraki, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/18/cisco-acquires-enterprise-wi-fi-startup-meraki-for-1-2-billion-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiFi tech company acquired by Cisco</a>, in that both are founded by ex-Meraki employees &#8212; that I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how Spot AI might insulate itself from similar issues, something that customers presumably also ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verkada sells hardware, and their cloud software only works with their hardware,&#8221; he responded, adding that &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty expensive; up to a few thousand dollars <a href="https://www.verkada.com/pricing/#security-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per camera</a>.&#8221; (Spot AI&#8217;s cameras are free, while the <a href="https://www.spot.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployments begin at $2,200</a>.) &#8220;They also sell more hardware for building security &#8212; like access control, environmental sensors, etc.,&#8221; he added, calling it, &#8220;a terrific set of products with terrific software.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he noted, &#8220;We&#8217;re not in the hardware business. Our only focus is to make video easier to access and use. We only charge for software, and give away all camera hardware for free if customers want them. Our bet is that if we can help more customers get more value out of video, then we can earn more of their business through a software subscription.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on security, the company&#8217;s concept is very different, built around a zero-trust architecture &#8220;that siloes access away between customers and requires multi-factor authentication for any systems access,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like other technology companies, we are always reviewing, challenging and improving our cybersecurity. Our goal is to provide a great web dashboard, and let customers choose what&#8217;s best for them. For example, cloud backup of video is an optional feature that customers can opt into, at no extra charge. The product fully works with private and local storage already included in the subscription. This is particularly helpful for healthcare customers that have HIPAA requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see the company having a position, and product set, that is aiming to address issues around security. The proof will be in the pudding, and it still remains predicated on the basic idea of video surveillance being something that can be used without being abused. That could make it a non-starter for many. It&#8217;s worth pointing out that for now, Spot AI has no intention of selling to public safety or government: its focus is solely on private enterprises and the opportunity to rethink their security camera investments and usage.</p>
<p>And indeed, it seems that for investors, the main message is how the company has created a tech platform with enough utility that it is finding traction in as wide a way as possible, including with non-tech customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a flood of new users and companies driving daily decisions using their cameras. In an industry crowded with legacy vendors, Spot AI&#8217;s software-focused model is by far the simplest choice for customers,” said Tomasz Tunguz, MD at Redpoint Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Today, only the world’s biggest businesses have access to proprietary AI camera systems, while most small and midsize businesses are left behind,” added Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Spot AI’s easy-to-use technology is accelerating the consumption of video data across all businesses, big and small.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The all-electric Porsche Taycan outsold the German automaker&#8217;s iconic internal combustion-powered 911 sports car in the first nine months of the year, a milestone for the EV that was introduced in late 2019.</p>
<p>The sales figures <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/company/porsche-increase-deliveries-quarter-3-2021-26063.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=mail&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-newsletter">released Friday</a> show that Porsche delivered 217,198 vehicles worldwide in the first three quarters, a 13% increase year over year. The results were driven by a nearly threefold increase in Taycan deliveries as well as growth by its popular gas-powered Macan vehicle. Those figures show Porsche recovered from the <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2020/company/porsche-deliveries-quarter-3-2020-22584.html">5% dip in sales</a> it experienced in the nine-month period between 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While the gas-powered Porsche Cayenne led the portfolio with 62,451 vehicles delivered in the first nine months of the year, it actually represents a 2.8% decline from the same time period in 2020. Strong demand for the smaller Macan SUV, which saw a 12% increase in deliveries to 61,944 vehicles, the Taycan and 911 helped fuel Porsche&#8217;s overall increase.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Porsche delivered 28,640 Taycan vehicles in the January-to-September period, pushing ahead of the company&#8217;s longtime flagship, the Porsche 911 sports car. Porsche delivered 27,972 of its 911 sports cars, a 10% increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Porsche delivered 20,275 Panameras and 15,916 of its 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman vehicles, all of which rose about 1% from last year.</p>
<p>While the bulk of Porsche sales are represented by combustion vehicles, the success of the Taycan could bolster the company&#8217;s push into EVs. Porsche plans to introduce an all-electric version of the Macan in 2023.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This week was one of our strongest shows yet, with a wide diversity of news items that were genuinely fun (and complicated) to chew through.</p>
<p>And even though we started off kind of grumpy, we laughed through tech difficulties, crypto puns and fintech CAC. It&#8217;s called coping.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218479" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/seven-years-after-raising-542m-at-a-2b-valuation-magic-leap-raises-500m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Magic Leap raised $500 million</a>, about which we have thoughts; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/mindbody-acquires-classpass-in-all-stock-deal-and-secures-500-million-investment/">Mindbody&#8217;s acquisition of ClassPass</a> caught our eye for obvious reasons (and the fact that it <em>also</em> raised $500 million); and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/sowork-just-convinced-investors-and-tinder-that-virtual-coworking-is-here-to-stay/">we dug into SoWork&#8217;s fascinating business proposition</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">mPharma and the race to horizontal, holistic mental health</a>: Telehealth is great and useful but no panacea. However, in the realm of mental health it&#8217;s potentially life-changing for millions.</li>
<li> OpenSea went from being one of the main characters in our fraud show to being the underdog that we&#8217;re rooting for &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">now that Coinbase is building a copycat</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we tried to keep the show tight, a ton of news was left on the cutting room floor. The good news, though, is that we&#8217;re back tomorrow with a spicy bonus episode about Microsoft pulling LinkedIn from the Chinese market. Oof.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nintendo announced today that &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#8221; has some big updates set for November 5.</p>
<p>This includes the arrival of characters from past games like Brewster, Kapp&#8217;n and Harriet; farming and cooking DIY recipes; new furniture items; and even a paid DLC called &#8220;Happy Home Paradise,&#8221; coming the same day for $24.99.</p>
<p>Nintendo also previously teased that Brewster, the coffee-brewing pigeon (strangely not a rooster), will make his way to &#8220;New Horizons.&#8221; In past games, Brewster has run a cafe called &#8220;The Roost.&#8221; Nintendo shared more information today, showing us how players can grab a cup o&#8217; joe for just 200 bells a cup with friends from other islands. If you have amiibo cards, you can call characters to drink coffee with you (and if you don&#8217;t, you can nab the next &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; amiibo pack, $5.99 for six cards, on November 5).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Kapp&#8217;n is also coming to &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons.&#8221; The turtle will take you on his boat (and sing sea shanties on the way) to visit mysterious new islands, which might have different flora, seasons or times of day from your home island &#8212; it&#8217;s like using a Nook Miles Ticket to search for foreign fruit, only with more possibilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Harv&#8217;s island, Harriet is coming to stay. The pink poodle ran the Shampoodle shop in past &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; games, and in &#8220;New Horizons,&#8221; she&#8217;ll help players learn new hairstyles. In the update, players can help Harv and Harriet build a plaza with various shops, where existing visitors like Sahara and Kicks can come to sell their wares. Katrina, the fortune-telling cat, will also make her &#8220;New Horizons&#8221; debut.</p>
<p>This update will also bring several quality-of-life improvements that players have been asking for. With the ability to enact island ordinances, players can talk to Isabelle to change what time of day villagers are most active. This can be helpful for gamers whose real-life schedules only allow them to play at a certain time of day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, everyone&#8217;s favorite capitalist raccoon, Tom Nook, will let you purchase more storage, so your home can hold up to 5,000 items, up from 2,400. You&#8217;ll also be able to have up to 10 bridges and inclines each on your island, up from eight, as well as ladders to make it easier to climb up ledges.</p>
<p>Other new items like a storage shed and ABDs (automatic bell dispensers) will make it easier to access home storage, bells and Nook Miles from anywhere on the island. We&#8217;ll need the ABDs to pay for the new items that are coming to Nook&#8217;s Cranny, including lighting and ceiling decor, which are accessible once you get a &#8220;pro decorating license&#8221; from Tom Nook.</p>

<p>For everyone who loves to cook <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYutF8qr7AY">a bit too much</a> in &#8220;Breath of the Wild,&#8221; rejoice. Now, a la &#8220;Stardew Valley,&#8221; we can grow vegetables on our islands, and then use DIY recipes to cook up tasty meals for our island friends. Finally, some nutrition beyond just native fruits.</p>
<p>The update will also let you plant and dig up gyroids on your island, but it&#8217;s probably best not to eat those. And while you&#8217;re making minestrone soup for Judy, you can listen to KK Slider&#8217;s latest hits, as 12 new songs will become available to collect. If you encounter a picture-perfect moment along the way, you can use the updated in-game camera app to take photos from your character&#8217;s vantage point &#8212; if you use the &#8220;tripod mode,&#8221; your character can get in the image, too.</p>
<p>If you feel a bit stiff after catching up on all the new updates, you can join in on a group stretching session in the plaza with your villagers. This connects with the motion controls on your joy-cons, though pressing buttons to simulate the stretches also works.</p>

<p>This will be the final free content update for &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons.&#8221; Key word: free.</p>
<p>Nintendo also announced a DLC for &#8220;New Horizons&#8221; today, called &#8220;Happy Home Paradise.&#8221; The DLC is priced at $24.99, but will also be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online+ expansion pack, a new online membership that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">teased in September</a>, offering access to classic Nintendo 64 and SEGA games.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; announcement revealed that Nintendo Switch Online+ will cost $49.99 for an individual yearly membership and $79.99 for a family yearly membership. Nintendo&#8217;s existing online plan costs $19.99 per year, or $34.99 for a yearly family plan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218773" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218773" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?w=680" alt="froggy chair in animal crossing" width="680" height="416" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png 1884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=1536,939 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>The DLC will let you &#8220;go to work&#8221; (ah, yes, paying Nintendo to pretend-work &#8212; the &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; way) at a nearby island archipelago, where you can design vacation homes for villagers. Through the DLC, your character will learn new design techniques, like making counters different heights, adding partitions to rooms, polishing furniture to unlock new capabilities, adding custom lighting and more. Thankfully, your character gets paid for their labor (Tom Nook isn&#8217;t always great about this) in Poki, which can be exchanged to purchase DLC-exclusive furniture. You can also apply the design techniques from the DLC to your island, and when you gain enough expertise, you can remodel existing villagers&#8217; homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#8221; debuted for Nintendo Switch in March 2020, right as the United States was heading into its first coronavirus lockdown. The idyllic social simulation game became the console&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805_3e.pdf">second-best-selling game</a> yet, helping people around the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/02/virtual-worlds-video-games-coronavirus-social-networks-fortnite-animal-crossing/">connect during an isolating time</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the game&#8217;s smash success, Nintendo has barely updated the game since its launch, save for some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/animal-crossing-swimming-new-horizons/">deep-sea diving</a>. At a certain point, there&#8217;s only so much you can do after getting a five-star island, and logging in every day can feel like a chore.</p>
<p>So today&#8217;s announcements mark a chance for Nintendo to corral us back to our virtual islands, where our anthropomorphic animal friends have been missing us, and where we&#8217;ll have to get rid of the cockroaches in our pixelated homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has removed Quran Majeed, a popular app for reading the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information, in China, in compliance with Chinese government requests, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230">a report</a> by BBC. The move comes as part of a bigger shift in the country to crack down on foreign content, or simply making it harder for that content to exist within the Great Firewall. Just yesterday, LinkedIn said that it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">removing the Chinese version of its site</a> by the end of this year in the face of growing compliance requirements by the state.</p>
<p>One of the most popular religious apps in China, Quran Majeed is available globally and has approximately 35 million users.</p>
<p>The Quran Majeed app remains available in other countries on the App Store, and on Google Play &#8212; although Google Play is technically also not available in China (people can access it via a VPN, however).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218635" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://applecensorship.com/">The Apple Censorship website</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which monitors apps on Apple’s App Store, was the first to notice that Quran Majeed was recently deleted.</span></p>
<p>China officially recognizes Islam as a religion but it has also faced criticism for human rights violations and genocide against the Muslim-majority Uyghur population in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>We have contacted Apple for a comment on this story and will update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p>Apple has faced a lot of controversy over the years over how it complies with local rules. Critics believe many local content-focused regulations in certain countries amount to censorship, and Apple is too quick to comply. Apple argues that its first priority is to respect laws of the countries in which it operates, irrespective of whether or not it agrees with the regulations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple’s <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">human rights policy</a> states: “We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments.”</p>
<p>There is consistency in what Apple will do, it seems. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-privacy-censorship.html">a report in The New York Times</a> in May, Apple will take down an app in China if the app in question discusses certain banned topics, including Tiananmen Square, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, and independence for Tibet and Taiwan.</p>
<p>There are added complications for Apple as a business that point to the company continuing to follow state rules: China is one of Apple’s biggest markets, and Apple also heavily relies on the country to keep its hardware supply chain running.</p>
<p>Quran Majeed is not the only app to face removal from China&#8217;s Apple App Store. <a href="https://www.olivetree.com/">Olive Tree’s Bible App</a> was also withdrawn in China this week. Olive Tree claims that Apple proactively took it down.</p>
