										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may have heard of payments startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/paddle">Paddle</a> which has raised $93.3m or perhaps Heroes which raised $65M to become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/">&#8220;Thrasio of Europe”</a> but you might not have heard so much about a backer of these startups, <a href="https://fuel.ventures/">Fuel Ventures</a>, at least not yet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about to change as Fuel Ventures comes out of the door with a new £45million / $63.6 million early-stage focused VC fund, aiming at 60 UK tech startups over the next 12 months. This is quite the pace for an early-stage fund, but Fuel’s founder and managing partner Mark Pearson told me at length how he is confident of making it one of the most prolific early-stage investors in the UK.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2015, Fuel has raised £80m in capital to invest in seed and series A founders, and the VC will also be aiming for pre-seed ventures with the new fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the last 12 months Fuel says its founders have raised over £180m in follow-on funding.  Notable investments include: OnBuy (eCommerce marketplace), Capdesk (equity management platform), OutFund (alternative finance provider), Heroes (scaling Amazon businesses), Moot Group (homeware and furnishing ecommerce business).</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, founder and managing partner of Fuel Ventures, said: “Since we launched our first fund five years ago the country’s tech ecosystem has gone from strength to strength and evolved into an ecosystem that’s the envy of many around the world. Now is not the time to take the foot of the pedal and say job done. We have a responsibility to invest in the future of the UK tech landscape and build on the strong work done so far. This, for us, means making sure we are providing capital for forward-thinking entrepreneurs and their innovative early-stage businesses &#8211; even if that means just having an idea or MVP.”</p>
<p>In addition to the new £45million fund, Fuel is also opening up a workspace in central London to serve its portfolio.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Pearson, who cut his teeth of a startup called MyVoucherCodes, said: “I exited that successfully and left it with about 10 million in revenues. I then started to be a pretty active angel investor, such as in Paddle.  When I sold my company I decided to do this full time and found there weren&#8217;t many entrepreneurial investors with startup experience themselves, compared to what you see in the US. So I put my entrepreneur hat on, trying to be as founder-friendly as possible. That was five years ago when Fuel Ventures started.”</p>
<p>He told me: &#8220;I still think there&#8217;s a funding gap between the seed and the Series A. We have always sat in the seed stage. We wanted to just write a decent check to allow these companies what it takes to hire the best talent, build out their product at scale and get them into the institutional funds. We can help you, we will roll up our sleeves, and we&#8217;re going to build the business with you. Our network of investors and LPS tend to be entrepreneur types as it is.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This spring, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebook-confirms-test-of-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-u-s/">confirmed</a> it was testing Venmo-like QR codes for person-to-person payments inside its app in the U.S. Today, the company announced those codes are now launching publicly to all U.S. users, allowing anyone to send or request money through Facebook Pay &#8212; even if they&#8217;re not Facebook friends.</p>
<p>The QR codes work similarly to those found in other payment apps, like Venmo.</p>
<p>The feature can be found under the &#8220;Facebook Pay&#8221; section in Messenger&#8217;s settings, accessed by tapping on your profile icon at the top left of the screen. Here, you&#8217;ll be presented with your personalized QR code which looks much like a regular QR code except that it features your profile icon in the middle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Underneath, you&#8217;ll be shown your personal Facebook Pay UR which is in the format of &#8220;https://m.me/pay/UserName.&#8221; This can also be copied and sent to other users when you&#8217;re requesting a payment.</p>
<p>Facebook notes that the codes will work between any U.S. Messenger users, and won&#8217;t require a separate payment app or any sort of contact entry or upload process to get started.</p>
<p>Users who want to be able to send and receive money in Messenger have to be at least 18 years old, and will have to have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">Visa or Mastercard debit card</a>, a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775"> PayPal account</a> or one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">supported</a> prepaid cards or government-issued cards, in order to use the payments feature. They’ll also need to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/217942441564255/">set</a> their preferred currency to U.S. dollars in the app.</p>
<p>After setup is complete, you can choose which payment method you want as your default and optionally protect payments behind a PIN code of your choosing.</p>
<p>The QR code is also available from the Facebook Pay section of the main Facebook app, in a carousel at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Facebook Pay first <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/simplifying-payments-with-facebook-pay/">launched</a> in November 2019, as a way to establish a payment system that extends across the company’s apps for not just person-to-person payments, but also other features, like donations, Stars, and e-commerce, among other things. Though the QR codes take cues from Venmo and others, the service as it stands today is not necessarily a rival to payment apps because Facebook partners with PayPal as one of the supported payment methods.</p>
<p>However, although the payments experience is separate from Facebook’s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-novi/">cryptocurrency wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.novi.com/">Novi,</a> that&#8217;s something that could perhaps change in the future.</p>

<p>The feature was <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/06/10/new-chat-themes-and-more-now-on-messenger/">introduced</a> alongside a few other Messenger updates, including a new Quick Reply bar that makes it easier to respond to a photo or video without having to return to the main chat thread. Facebook also added new chat themes including one for Olivia Rodrigo fans, another for World Oceans Day, and one that promotes the new F9 movie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jumpcut founder <a href="https://www.hosanagar.com/">Kartik Hosanagar</a> is a professor at the Wharton School, but about ten years ago, he spent his summer in an unlikely way: he wrote a screenplay. Set in India, his script garnered some interest from producers, but no one took the plunge to fund a film by a first-time Indian director.</p>
<p>Now, films featuring diverse casts are gaining traction – this year, Chloé Zhao became the first woman of color, and only the second woman ever, to win the Academy Award for Best Director. At the previous ceremony, Bong Joon-ho&#8217;s &#8220;Parasite&#8221; became the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Still, according to a recent report from McKinsey &amp; Company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/movies/hollywood-black-representation.html">Hollywood leaves $10 billion on the table</a> each year due to the industry&#8217;s lack of diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make a bet on underrepresented voices or underrepresented stories?&#8221; asked Hosanagar. &#8220;While there&#8217;s awareness, there&#8217;s no action, because nobody knows how to do it. So that&#8217;s what got me into <a href="https://jumpcutmedia.com/">Jumpcut</a>. It&#8217;s this rare company where 20 years of my work on data science and entrepreneurship meets with who I am outside of my work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Wharton, Hosanagar is the Faculty Lead for the <a href="https://analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/ai-for-business/">AI for Business</a> program. He was a founder of Yodle, which was acquired by web.com for $340 million in 2016. But for this next venture, he wanted to tackle Hollywood&#8217;s homogeneity hands-on by using his experience with data science to de-risk media projects from underrepresented creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision is to create a more inclusive era of global content creation,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Hosanagar started working on Jumpcut in 2019, but today, the <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic</a>-backed company launches out of stealth as the first data science-driven studio working to elevate underrepresented voices in film. Already the studio has 12 TV and film projects in the works with partners like 36-time Academy Award nominee Lawrence Bender (&#8220;Pulp Fiction,&#8221; &#8220;Good Will Hunting&#8221;), Emmy Award-winning producer Shelby Stone (&#8220;Bessie,&#8221; &#8220;The Chi&#8221;), and showrunner Scott Rosenbaum (&#8220;Chuck,&#8221; &#8220;The Shield&#8221;).</p>
<p>Jumpcut models itself after Y-Combinator in its approach, pairing emerging talent with buyers and producers. First, Jumpcut uses an algorithm to scan hundreds of thousands of videos from platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and Wattpad to find promising talent. The algorithm narrows down the extensive field to locate creators who are consistently finding new audiences and increasing their engagement. Then, the Jumpcut team – including advisors and veterans from Netflix, Buzzfeed, CBS, Sony, and WarnerMedia – identifies who to connect with.</p>
<p>In one example of the algorithm&#8217;s success, Hosanagar pointed to Anna Hopkins, an actress who has appeared on shows like &#8220;The Expanse&#8221; and &#8220;Shadowhunters.&#8221; Though Hopkins has found some success in front of the camera, she also wants to write.</p>
<p>&#8220;We discovered some of her short films, and the algorithm identified it because people had strong emotional reactions in the comments, like, &#8216;heartwarming but in a positive way,&#8217; or &#8216;give me a tissue,'&#8221; Hosanagar explained. Since Hopkins isn&#8217;t publicly known as a writer, she assumed that Jumpcut found her through a television network she had pitched a script to, but that wasn&#8217;t the case. &#8220;We said, &#8216;no, our algorithms found you.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Once a creator is identified by Jumpcut, they can A/B test their ideas with audiences of over 100,000 potential viewers, which helps the company prove to funders through data science that these ideas can sell.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea there is that we don&#8217;t wait for creators to get discovered by the traditional Hollywood agencies, because that requires the creators to have access to the top agents, and that again brings you back to the old boys club,&#8221; Hosanagar said. &#8220;We&#8217;re automating a lot of that process and discovering these people who are creating great stories that are resonating with audiences, not waiting for some Hollywood agency to discover them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the creators have an idea that tests well with a wide audience, they&#8217;re invited to Jumpcut Collective, an incubator program that helps artists develop an idea from a concept to a pitch in 6 weeks. Then, Jumpcut helps match projects with producing partners and buyers.</p>
<p>So far, Jumpcut has hosted three incubator programs. Out of the twelve Jumpcut projects currently underway, Hosanagar says that nine or ten of them came out of the incubator. One project, for example, is now being developed in partnership with Disney&#8217;s Asia Pacific Division.</p>
<p>Jumpcut isn&#8217;t disclosing the amount raised in this round of seed funding, but confirms that Atomic is the only investor in their seed round.</p>
<p>Hosanagar is joined on the project by Dilip Rajan, his former student and a former product manager at BuzzFeed, and Winnie Kemp, a former SVP of Originals at Super Deluxe and CBS. There, she developed and executive produced &#8220;Chambers,&#8221; the first show with a Native American lead, and &#8220;This Close,&#8221; the first show with deaf creators and cast. Most of their funding will go toward payroll, which includes engineers, data scientists, and product managers on the product side of the company, as well as development executives on the creative side, who run the incubator.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global economy’s transition to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage.

<p>With<a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/new-climate-predictions-increase-likelihood-of-temporarily-reaching-15-%C2%B0c-next-5"> reports forecasting a 40% chance</a> that the world’s temperature will rise over the next five years beyond the limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius laid out in the Paris climate agreement, it is clear that there’s little time to waste when it comes to creating next-generation batteries, which can easily take <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35367888/the-eternal-promise-of-solid-state-batteries/">another 10 years to fully commercialize</a>.</p>
<p>To meet the increasing pressures to electrify, a completely novel approach to building batteries is the only way to scale rechargeable batteries quickly enough to curb greenhouse-gas emissions globally and avoid the worst-case scenario for the climate crisis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The challenges to battery innovation</h2>
<p>Over the last few decades, battery experts, automakers, Tier 1 suppliers, investors and others looking to electrify have spent billions of dollars globally on creating next-generation batteries by focusing predominantly on battery chemistry. Yet the industry is still grappling with two major fundamental technical challenges that are stunting the proliferation of batteries:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Energy/power tradeoff: </strong>All batteries manufactured today face an energy-to-power tradeoff. Batteries can store more energy <em>or</em> they can charge/discharge more quickly. In terms of electric vehicles, this means no single battery can provide both long range and fast charging.</li>
<li><strong>Anode-cathode mismatch: </strong>Today’s most promising battery technologies maximize the energy density of anodes, the negative electrode of the pair of electrodes that make up every lithium-ion battery cell. However, anodes already have greater energy density than their positive counterpart, the cathode. Cathode energy density needs to eventually match that of the anode in order to get the most energy storage capacity out of a certain battery size. Without breakthroughs in increasing cathode energy density, many of today’s most exciting battery technologies will not be able to deliver on their full potential. As it currently stands, the most commonly used lithium-ion battery cannot meet the needs of the wide-ranging applications of an all-electric future. Many companies have tried to address these demands through new battery chemistries to optimize the high-power-to-energy-density ratio to varying degrees of success, but very few are close to achieving the performance metrics required for mass scale and commercialization.</li>
</ol>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Ultimately, the winning technologies in the race toward total electrification will be the ones that have the most significant impact on performance, lowered costs and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Are solid-state batteries the holy grail?</h2>
<p>Battery researchers have championed the solid-state battery as the holy grail of battery technology due to its ability to achieve high energy density and increased safety. However, until recently, the technology has fallen short in practice.</p>
<p>Solid-state batteries have significantly higher energy density and are potentially safer because they do not use flammable liquid electrolytes. However, the technology is still nascent and has a long way to go to achieve commercialization. The manufacturing process for solid-state batteries has to be improved to lower costs, especially for an automotive industry that aims to achieve aggressive cost reductions as low as $50/kWh in the coming years.</p>
<p>The other substantial challenge to implementing solid-state technology is the limitation of total energy density that can be stored in the cathodes per unit of volume. The obvious solution to this dilemma would be to have batteries with thicker cathodes. However, a thicker cathode would reduce the mechanical and thermal stability of the battery. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation &#8212; all of which cause premature battery failure. In addition, thicker cathodes limit diffusion and decrease power. The result is that there is a practical limit to the thickness of cathodes, which restricts the power of anodes.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=3d7ulgV9Ns" data-secret="3d7ulgV9Ns" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>New takes on materials with silicon</h2>
<p>In most cases, companies that are developing silicon-based batteries are mixing up to 30% silicon with graphite to boost energy density. The batteries made by <a href="https://silanano.com/">Sila Nanotechnologies</a> are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to increase energy density. Another approach is to use 100% pure silicon anodes, which are limited by very thin electrodes and high production costs, to generate even higher energy density, like <a href="https://www.amprius.com/technology">Amprius’</a> approach.</p>
<p>While silicon provides considerably greater energy density, there is a significant drawback that has limited its adoption until now: The material undergoes volume expansion and shrinkage while charging and discharging, limiting battery life and performance. This leads to degradation issues that manufacturers need to solve before commercial adoption. Despite those challenges, some silicon-based batteries are already being deployed commercially, including in the automotive sector, where Tesla leads in silicon adoption for EVs.</p>
<h2>The imperative for electrification requires a new focus on battery design</h2>
<p>Advances to battery architecture and cell design show significant promise for unlocking improvements with existing and emerging battery chemistries.</p>
<p>Probably the most notable from a mainstream perspective is Tesla’s “biscuit tin” battery cell that the company unveiled at its 2020 Battery Day. It&#8217;s still using lithium-ion chemistry, but the company removed the tabs in the cell that act as the positive and negative connection points between the anode and cathode and the battery casing, and instead use a shingled design within the cell. This change in design helps reduce manufacturing costs while boosting driving range and removes many of the thermal barriers that a cell can encounter when fast-charging with DC electricity.</p>
<p>Transitioning away from a traditional 2D electrode structure to a 3D structure is another approach that is gaining traction in the industry. The 3D structure yields high energy <em>and</em> high power performance in both the anode and cathode for every battery chemistry.</p>
<p>Although still in the R&amp;D and testing phases, 3D electrodes have achieved two times higher accessible capacity, 50% less charging time and 150% longer lifetime for high-performance products at market-competitive prices. Therefore, in order to advance battery capabilities to unlock the full potential of energy storage for a range of applications, it is critical to develop solutions that emphasize altering the physical structure of batteries.</p>
<h2>Winning the battery race</h2>
<p>It’s not just performance improvements that will win the battery race, but perfecting production and cost reduction as well. To capture a considerable share of the ballooning battery market that is projected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/08/2206703/28124/en/Global-Battery-Market-Report-2020-2027.html">$279.7 billion by 2027</a>, countries around the world must find ways to achieve low-cost battery manufacturing at scale. Prioritizing “drop-in” solutions and innovative production methods that can be incorporated with existing assembly lines and materials will be key.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/18/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-supercharges-the-future-of-transportation-and-manufacturing/">American Jobs Plan</a> highlights the importance of domestic battery production to the country’s goal of being a leader in electrification while meeting ambitious carbon reduction targets. Commitments like these will play a key role in establishing who can maintain a critical competitive edge in the battery space and take the largest share of <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/electric-vehicle-market">the $162 billion global EV market</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the winning technologies in the race toward total electrification will be the ones that have the most significant impact on performance, lowered costs and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure. By taking a holistic approach and focusing more on innovating cell design while also fine-tuning leading chemistries, we can achieve the next steps in battery performance and rapid commercialization that the world desperately needs.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping up with such a variety of investments may prove difficult to those who want to handle managing their investment portfolios </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/99percent-of-americans-dont-use-a-financial-advisor-heres-why.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on their own</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.moneyminx.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Minx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new San Diego-based startup co-founded by husband and wife team Hussein and Jessica Yahfoufi, wants to help with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Money Minx aims to build a &#8220;Personal Finance OS&#8221; for every household. The platform is designed to help people track all of their investments &#8212; yes, including crypto and NFTs &#8212; in one place, in whatever currency. The company claims that its AI can also go a step further, and help people spot opportunities in their portfolio as well as catch potential risks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built Money Minx to help people cover all their bases, better understand their personal balance sheet and grow their net worth,” Hussein said. “No financial advisor needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money Minx also aims to provide people with easy-to-use tools to create dashboards and reports. In its &#8220;soft launch&#8221; phase, the startup has been growing rapidly &#8212; from $15 million in assets tracked at the end of March to $107 million by mid-May. Its user base is growing by 40% month over month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many founders do, Hussein says he and Jessica developed the platform to meet a need of their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built this because we needed it as ‘do it yourself investors,’ said Hussein, who previously started crowdfunding site </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/03/appsplit-is-crowdfunding-for-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appsplit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and works as a CTO at a San Diego-based fintech company. “I didn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to hire a financial advisor and spend 1% of my portfolio every year for them to tell me what to do.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever bought a subscription inside an iOS app and later decided you wanted to cancel, upgrade or downgrade, or ask for a refund, you may have had trouble figuring out how to go about making that request or change. Some people today still believe that they can stop their subscription charges simply by deleting an app from their iPhone. Others may dig around unsuccessfully inside their iPhone&#8217;s Settings or on the App Store to try to find out how to ask for a refund. With the updates Apple announced in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/storekit/">StoreKit 2</a> during its Worldwide Developers Conference this week, things may start to get a little easier for app customers.</p>
<p>StoreKit is Apple&#8217;s developer framework for managing in-app purchases &#8212; an area that&#8217;s become more complex in recent years, as apps have transitioned from offering one-time purchases to ongoing subscriptions with different tiers, lengths, and feature sets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163943" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163943" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2163943" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg 1198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg?resize=768,347 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-12.59.21-PM.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, users who want to manage or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">cancel subscriptions</a> can do so from the App Store or their iPhone Settings. But some don&#8217;t realize the path to this section from Settings starts by tapping on your Apple ID (your name and profile photo at the top of the screen). They may also get frustrated if they&#8217;re not familiar with how to navigate their Settings or the App Store.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are a <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-to-get-refund-itunes-app-store">variety of ways</a> users can request refunds on their in-app subscriptions. They can dig in their inbox for their receipt from Apple, then click the &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; link it includes to request a refund when something went wrong. This could be useful in scenarios where you&#8217;ve bought a subscription by mistake (or your kid has!), or where the promised features didn&#8217;t work as intended.</p>
<p>Apple also<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084"> provides</a> a <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/?s=6">dedicated website</a> where users can directly request refunds for apps or content. (When you Google for something like &#8220;request a refund apple&#8221; or similar queries, a page that explains the process typically comes up at the top of the search results.)</p>
<p>Still, many users aren&#8217;t technically savvy. For them, the easiest way to manage subscriptions or ask for refunds would be to do so from within the app itself. For this reason, many conscientious app developers tend to include links to point customers to Apple&#8217;s pages for subscription management or refunds inside their apps.</p>
<p>But StoreKit 2 is introducing new tools that will allow developers to implement these sort of features more easily.</p>
<p>One new tool is a Manage subscriptions API, which lets an app developer display the manage subscriptions page for their customer directly inside their app &#8212; without redirecting the customer to the App Store. Optionally, developers can choose to display a &#8220;Save Offer&#8221; screen to present the customer with a discount of some kind to keep them from cancelling, or it could display an exit survey so you can ask the customer why they decided to end their subscription.</p>
<p>When implemented, the customer will be able to view a screen inside the app that looks just like the one they&#8217;d visit in the App Store to cancel or change a subscription. After cancelling, they&#8217;ll be shown a confirmation screen with the cancellation details and the service expiration date.</p>
<p>If the customer wants to request a refund, a new Refund request API will allow the customer to begin their refund request directly in the app itself &#8212; again, without being redirected to the App Store or other website. On the screen that displays, the customer can select which item they want refund and check the reason why they&#8217;re making the request. Apple handles the refund process and will send either an approval or refund declined notification back to the developer&#8217;s server.</p>
<p>However, some developers argue that the changes don&#8217;t go far enough. They want to be in charge of managing customer subscriptions and handling refunds themselves, through programmatic means. Plus, Apple can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210904">take up to 48 hours</a> for the customer to receive an update on their refund request, which can be confusing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve made the process a bit smoother, but developers still can&#8217;t initiate refunds or cancellations themselves,&#8221; notes <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a> CEO Jacob Eiting, whose company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/revenuecat-raises-40m-series-b-for-its-in-app-subscription-platform/">provides tools</a> to app developers to manage their in-app purchases. &#8220;It&#8217;s a step in the right direction, but could actually lead to more confusion between developers and consumers about who is responsible for issuing refunds.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, because the forms are now going to be more accessible from inside the app, the customer may believe the developer is handling the refund process when, really, Apple continues to do so.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">People could write in after uninstalling the app. Or have subscribed on a device they no longer have. There are so many cases that this ignores.</p>
<p>This is only a marginal improvement over opening the manage subscriptions URL.</p>
<p>&mdash; Jacob Eiting (@jeiting) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting/status/1402232229196140551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Some developers pointed out that there are other scenarios this process doesn&#8217;t address. For example, if the customer has already uninstalled the app or no longer has the device in question, they&#8217;ll still need to be directed to other means of asking for refunds, just as before.</p>
<p>For consumers, though, subscription management tools like this mean more developers may begin to put buttons to manage subscriptions and ask for refunds directly inside their app, which is a better experience. In time, as customers learn they can more easily use the app and manage subscriptions, app developers may see better customer retention, higher engagement, and better App Store reviews, notes Apple.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new additions to SwiftUI, been wanting Pull to Refresh and to improve accessibility. Then surprisingly StoreKit 2, especially for users requesting refunds and managaging subscriptions seamlessly (also great for Buffer).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The StoreKit 2 changes weren&#8217;t limited to APIs for managing subscriptions and refunds.</p>
<p>Developers will also gain access to a new Invoice Lookup API that allows them to look up the in-app purchases for the customer, validate their invoice and identify any problems with the purchase &#8212; for example, if there were any refunds already provided by the App Store.</p>
<p>A new Refunded Purchases API will allow developers to look up all the refunds for the customer.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sounds like StoreKit can validate receipts on device and allow users to request refunds. Didn’t have those on my bingo card but wow those are some nice quality-of-life updates!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A new Renewal Extension API will allow developers to extend the renewal data for paid, active subscriptions in the case of an outage &#8212; like when dealing with customer support issues when a streaming service went down, for example. This API lets developers extend the subscription up to twice per calendar year, each up to 90 days in the future.</p>
<p>And finally, a new Consumption API will allow developers to share information about a customer&#8217;s in-app purchase with the App Store. In most cases, customers begin consuming content soon after purchase &#8212; information that&#8217;s helpful in the refund decision process. The API will allow the App Store to see if the user consumed the in-app purchase partially, fully, or not at all.</p>
<p>Another change will help customers when they reinstall apps or download them on new devices. Before, users would have to manually &#8220;restore purchases&#8221; to sync the status of the completed transactions back to that newly downloaded or reinstalled app. Now, that information will be automatically fetched by StoreKit 2 so the apps are immediately up-to-date with whatever it is the user paid for.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very interesting changes to StoreKit. Apps will now be able to automatically restore and sync purchases, so users won&#39;t need to restore when the app is reinstalled or downloaded on a new device! <a href="https://t.co/WSs6L9rTvK">https://t.co/WSs6L9rTvK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Marcos Tanaka (@mactanaka) <a href="https://twitter.com/mactanaka/status/1402328794430590985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While, overall, the changes make for a significant update to the StoreKit framework, Apple&#8217;s hesitancy to allow developers more control over their own subscription-based customers speaks, in part, to how much it wants to control in-app purchases. This is perhaps because it got burned in the past when it tried allowing developers to manage their own refunds.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423410/apple-hulu-subscription-in-app-purchase-tweet">The Verge noted last month</a> while the Epic Games-Apple antitrust trial was underway, Apple had once provided Hulu will access to a subscription API, then discovered Hulu had been offering a way to automatically cancel subscriptions made through the App Store when customers wanted to upgrade to higher-priced subscription plans. Apple realized it needed to take action to protect against this misuse of the API, and Hulu later lost access. It has not since made that API more broadly available.</p>
<p>On the flip side, having Apple, not the developers, in charge of subscription management and refunds means Apple takes on the responsibilities around preventing fraud &#8212; including fraud perpetrated by both customers and developers alike. Customers may also prefer that there&#8217;s one single place to go for managing their subscription billing: Apple. They may not want to have to deal with each developer individually, as their experience would end up being inconsistent.</p>
<p>These changes matter because subscription revenue contributes to a sizable amount of Apple&#8217;s lucrative App Store business. Ahead of WWDC 21, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/">reported</a> the sale of digital goods and services on the App Store grew to $86 billion in 2020, up 40% over the the year prior. Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/">said it paid out more than $200 billion</a> to developers since the App Store launched in 2008.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As I’m typing this, I’ve just finished my second panel for our big <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility event</a>. The write-ups will be ready in time for next week’s roundup, but a couple of things worth thinking about in the meantime.</p>
<p>The first is partnerships with big companies like Walmart. I get the sense that Walmart really loves to play the field when it comes to partnering with small tech startups. And honestly, why not, right?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of upside and relatively little downside. At the end of the day, a company like Walmart is looking for a competitive advantage against Amazon, the galactic emperor of competitive advantages. Amazon, of course, has invested a ton in robotics, including acquisitions and first-party development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2069046" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2069046" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2069046" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png" alt="bossa nova-robots veanne cao" width="816" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bossa-nova-veanne-cao.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2069046" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veanne Cao/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>For startups, there’s tremendous up and downside here. It’s hard not to see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/walmart-reportedly-ends-contract-with-inventory-robotics-startup-bossa-nova/">a company like Bossa Nova</a> as a kind of cautionary tale on that front. The promising inventory scanning startup took a massive hit when Walmart backed out of a deal the company had invested large resources into. It left Bossa Nova shaken, to say the least.</p>
<p>There’s no easy math on this one. When a company like Walmart knocks on your door with a big contract, you want to jump in with both feet. But how do you avoid putting all of your eggs in that one basket. When it comes to emerging tech, companies like Walmart like to play the field.</p>
<p>Another subject I’ve been thinking a lot about of late is whether universities are doing enough to foster innovation in their own backyard. There are plenty of good and bad examples of this, but as someone who writes about robots, I keep coming back to Carnegie Mellon. Other big robotics schools like MIT and Stanford haven’t had to concern themselves with talent drain, in large part due to location.</p>

<p>So, how does a school like CMU both help budding entrepreneurs transition from laboratory to startup and keep that talent in its own backyard? The good news is I’ll be able to take that question directly to the source. I’ll be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">interviewing CMU President Farnam Jahanian</a> at TC’s upcoming virtual Pittsburgh event on June 29. Here&#8217;s a quote from Jahanian to whet your appetite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carnegie Mellon’s decades-long leadership in research and education in AI and robotics has catalyzed an innovation ecosystem in the Pittsburgh region where entrepreneurship, creativity and placemaking intersect. These emerging technologies are changing the way we farm, enabling millions to learn a new language, leading the race to develop self-driving vehicles, and even going to the moon. We are committed to empowering citizens across Pittsburgh to take part in the economic benefits of these innovations as they continue to transform our world.</p></blockquote>

<p>As we head into summer, the investments in the category aren’t coming quite as fast and furiously as they were earlier in the year. But I have it on good authority that we’ll be seeing some more robotics funding announcements in the not too distant future. Of course, for all of the reasons I’ve alluded to before, the warehouse space continues to be hot. And this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/croatias-gideon-brothers-raises-31m-for-its-%E2%80%A83d-vision-enabled-autonomous-warehouse-robots/">a Croatian firm named Gideon Brothers</a> announced a $31 million raise. From a recent piece by Mike, here’s CEO Matija Kopić:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of smart automation, and we are ready to meet the unprecedented market demand. The best way to do it is by marrying our proprietary solutions with the largest, most demanding customers out there. Our strategic partners have real challenges that our robots are already solving, and, with us, they’re seizing the incredible opportunity right now to effect robotic-powered change to some of the world’s most innovative organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kopić and team should clearly all consider changing their last name to Gideon and doing a whole Ramones thing. Of course, they’re the ones who just raised $31 million, so maybe they’re doing something right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A mobile security startup has found seven security flaws in Samsung&#8217;s pre-installed mobile apps, which it says if abused could have allowed attackers broad access to a victim&#8217;s personal data.</p>
<p>Oversecured said the vulnerabilities were found in several apps and components bundled with Samsung phones and tablets. Oversecured founder Sergey Toshin told TechCrunch that the vulnerabilities were verified on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ but that all Samsung devices could be potentially affected because the baked-in apps are responsible for system functionality.</p>
<p>Toshin said the vulnerabilities could have allowed a malicious app on the same device to steal a victim&#8217;s photos, videos, contacts, call records and messages, and change settings &#8220;without any user consent or notice&#8221; by hijacking the permissions from Samsung&#8217;s stock apps.</p>
<p>One of the flaws could have allowed the theft of data by exploiting a vulnerability in Samsung&#8217;s Secure Folder app, which has a &#8220;large set&#8221; of rights across the device. In a proof-of-concept, Toshin showed the bug could be used to steal contacts data. Another bug in Samsung&#8217;s Knox security software could have been abused to install other malicious apps, while a bug in Samsung Dex could have been used to scrape data from user notifications from apps, email inboxes and messages.</p>
<p>Oversecured <a href="https://blog.oversecured.com/Two-weeks-of-securing-Samsung-devices-Part-1/">published technical details</a> of the vulnerabilities in a blog post, and said it reported the bugs to Samsung, which fixed the flaws.</p>
<p>Samsung confirmed the flaws affected &#8220;selected&#8221; Galaxy devices but would not provide a list of specific devices. &#8220;There have been no known reported issues globally and users should be assured that their sensitive information was not at risk,&#8221; but provided no evidence for this claim. &#8220;We addressed the potential vulnerability by developing and issuing security patches via software update in April and May, 2021 as soon as we identified this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which launched earlier this year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/oversecured-mobile-app-security-bug-bounty/">self-funding $1 million</a> in bug bounty payouts, uses automation to search for vulnerabilities in Android code. Toshin has found similar security flaws <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/tiktok-android-bugs-account-hijack/">in TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/android-bug-apps-data/">Android&#8217;s Google Play app</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When companies are considering buying a particular software service, they typically want to test it in their own environments, a process that can be surprisingly challenging. <a href="https://www.testbox.com/">TestBox</a>, a new startup, wants to change that by providing a fully working package with pre-populated data to give the team a way to test and collaborate on the product before making a buying decision.</p>
<p>Today the company announced it was making the product widely available; they also announced a $2.7 million seed round from SignalFire and Firstminute Capital along with several other investors and industry angels.</p>
<p>Company co-founder Sam Senior says he and his co-founder Peter Holland recognized that it was challenging for companies buying software to test it in a realistic way. &#8220;So TestBox is the very first time that companies are going to be able to test drive multiple pieces of enterprise software with an insanely easy-to-use live environment that&#8217;s uniquely configured to them with guided walk-throughs to make it really easy for them to get up to speed,&#8221; Senior explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that until now, even with free versions or free testing periods, it was hard to test and collaborate in that kind of environment with key stakeholders in the company. TestBox comes pre-populated with data generated by GPT-3 OpenAI to test how the software behaves and lets participants grade different features on a simple star rating system and provide comments as needed. All the feedback is recorded in a &#8220;notebook,&#8221; giving the company a central place to gather all the data.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="74CIXg6nWM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/freemium-isnt-a-trend-its-the-future-of-saas/">Freemium isn’t a trend &#8212; it’s the future of SaaS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Freemium isn’t a trend &#8212; it’s the future of SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/freemium-isnt-a-trend-its-the-future-of-saas/embed/#?secret=74CIXg6nWM" data-secret="74CIXg6nWM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it puts the company buying the software more in control of the process instead of being driven by the vendor, which is typically the case. &#8220;Actually, now [the customer gets to] be the one who defines the experience, making them lead the process, while making it collaborative, and giving them more confidence [in their decision],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For now, the company plans to concentrate on customer support software and is working with Zendesk, HubSpot and Freshdesk, but has plans to expand and add partners over time. It has been talking with Salesforce about adding Service Cloud and hopes to have them in some form on the platform later this year. It also plans to expand into other verticals over time, like CRM, martech and IT help desks.</p>
<p>Senior is a former Bain consultant who worked with companies buying enterprise software, and saw the issues firsthand that they faced when it came to testing software before buying. He quit his job last summer, and began by talking to 70 customers, vendors and experts to get a real sense of what they were looking for in a solution.</p>
<p>He then teamed up with Holland and built the first version of the software before raising their seed money last October. The company began hiring in February and has eight employees at this point, but he wants to keep it pretty lean through the early stage of the company&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Even at this early stage, the company is already taking a diverse approach to hiring. &#8220;Already when we have been working with recruiting firms, we&#8217;ve been saying that they need to split the pipeline as much as they can, and that&#8217;s been something we have spent a long, long time on. [&#8230;] We spent actually six months with an open role on the front end because we are looking to build more diversity in our team as quickly as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He reports that the company has a fairly equitable gender and ethnic split to this point, and holds monthly events to raise awareness internally about different groups, letting employees lead the way when it makes sense.</p>
<p>At least for now, he&#8217;s planning on running the company in a distributed manner, but acknowledges that as it gets bigger, he may have to look at having a centralized office as a home base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.infosum.com">InfoSum</a>, a startup which takes a federated approach to third party data enrichment, has launched a new product (called InfoSum Bridge) that it says significantly expands the customer identity linking capabilities of its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;InfoSum Bridge incorporates multiple identity providers across every identity type &#8212; both online and offline, in any technical framework &#8212; including deterministic, probabilistic, and cohort-level matches,&#8221; it writes in a press release.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also disclosing some early adopters of the product &#8212; naming data-for-ads and data-aggregator giants Merkle, MMA and Experian as dipping in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Idea being they can continue to enrich (first party) data by being able to make linkages, via InfoSum&#8217;s layer, with other &#8216;trusted partners&#8217; who may have gleaned more tidbits of info on those self-same users.</p>
<p>InfoSum says it has 50 enterprise customers using InfoSum Bridge at this point. The three companies it&#8217;s named in the release all play in the digital marketing space.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The 2016-founded startup (then called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/cognitivelogic-raises-3m-to-help-enterprises-pool-big-data-while-keeping-privacy-intact/">CognitiveLogic</a>) sells customers a promise of &#8216;privacy-safe&#8217; data enrichment run via a technical architecture that allows queries to be run &#8212; and insights gleaned &#8212; across multiple databases yet maintains each pot as a separate silo. This means the raw data isn&#8217;t being passed around between interested entities. </span></p>
<p>Why is that important? Third party data collection is drying up, after one (thousand) too many privacy scandals in recent years &#8212; combing with the legal risk attached to background trading of people&#8217;s data as a result of data protection regimes like Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>That puts the spotlight squarely on first party data. However businesses whose models have been dependent on access to big data about people &#8212; i.e. being able to make scores of connections by joining up information on people from different databases/sources (aka profiling) &#8212; are unlikely to be content with relying purely on what they&#8217;ve been able to learn by themselves.</p>
<p>This is where InfoSum comes in, billing itself as a &#8220;neutral data collaboration platform&#8221;.</p>
<p>Companies that may have been accustomed to getting their hands on lashings of personal data in years past, as a result of rampant, industry-wide third party data collection (via technologies like tracking cookies) combined with (<em>ehem</em>) lax data governance &#8212; are having to cast around for alternatives. And that appears to be stoking InfoSum&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>And on the marketing front, remember, third party cookies are in the process of going away <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">as Google tightens that screw</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are growing faster than Slack (at equivalent stage e.g. Series A-&gt;B) because we are the one solution that is replacing the old way of doing things,&#8221; founder Nick Halstead tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Experian, Liveramp, Axciom, TransUnion, they all offer solutions to take your data. InfoSum is offering the equivalent of the &#8216;Cisco router for customer data&#8217; &#8212; we don&#8217;t own the data we are just selling boxes to make it all connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement today &#8212; &#8216;InfoSum Bridge&#8217; &#8212; is the next generation of building the ultimate network to &#8216;Bridge the industry chasm&#8217; it has right now of 100&#8217;s of competing ID&#8217;s, technical solutions and identity types, bringing a infrastructure approach,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>We took a deep dive into InfoSum&#8217;s first product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/infosums-first-product-touts-decentralized-big-data-insights/">back in 2018 </a>&#8212; when it was just offering early adopters a glimpse of the &#8220;art of the possible&#8221;, as it put it then.</p>
<p>Three+ years on it&#8217;s touting a significantly expansion of its pipeline, having baked in support for multiple ID vendors/types, as well as adding probabilistic capabilities (to do matching on users where there is no ID).</p>
<p>Per a spokesman: &#8220;InfoSum Bridge is an extension of our existing and previous infrastructure. It enables a significant expansion of both our customer identity linking, and the limits of what is possible for data collaboration in a secure and privacy-focused manner. This is a combination of new product enhancements and announcement of partnerships. We’ve built capabilities to support across all ID vendors and types but also probabilistic and support for those publishers with unauthenticated audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>InfoSum bills its platform as &#8220;the future of identity connectivity&#8221;. Although, as Halstead notes, there is now growing competition for that concept, as the adtech industry scrambles to build out alternative tracking systems and ID services ahead of Google crushing their cookies for good.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s essentially making a play to be the trusted, independent layer that can link them all.</p>
<p>Exactly what this technical wizardry means for Internet users&#8217; privacy is difficult to say. If, for example, it continues to enable manipulative microtargeting that&#8217;s hardly going to sum to progress.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9eFN3qN57n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/06/cambridge-analyticas-nix-said-it-licensed-millions-of-data-points-from-axciom-experian-infogroup-to-target-us-voters/">Cambridge Analytica&#8217;s Nix said it licensed &#8216;millions of data points&#8217; from Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup to target US voters</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cambridge Analytica&#8217;s Nix said it licensed &#8216;millions of data points&#8217; from Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup to target US voters&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/06/cambridge-analyticas-nix-said-it-licensed-millions-of-data-points-from-axciom-experian-infogroup-to-target-us-voters/embed/#?secret=9eFN3qN57n" data-secret="9eFN3qN57n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>InfoSum has previously told us its approach is designed to avoid individuals being linked and identified via the matching &#8212; with, for example, limits placed on the bin sizes. Although its platform is also configurable (which puts privacy levers in its customers hands). Plus there could be edge cases where overlapped datasets result in a 100% match for an individual. So a lot is unclear.</p>
<p>The security story looks cleaner, though.</p>
<p>If the data is properly managed by InfoSum (and it touts &#8220;comprehensive independent audits&#8221;, as well as pointing to the decentralized architecture as an advantage) that&#8217;s a big improvement on &#8212; at least &#8212; one alternative scenario of whole databases being passed around between businesses which may be (to put it politely) disinterested in securing people&#8217;s data themselves.</p>
<p>InfoSum&#8217;s PR includes the three canned quotes (below) from the trio of marketing industry users it&#8217;s disclosing today.</p>
<p>All of whom sound very happy indeed that they&#8217;ve found a way to keep their &#8220;data-driven&#8221; marketing alive while simultaneously getting to claim it&#8217;s &#8220;privacy-safe&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">John Lee, Global Chief Strategy Officer, Merkle: &#8220;The conversation around identity is continuing to be top of mind for marketers across the industry, and as the landscape rapidly changes, it&#8217;s essential that brands have avenues to work together using first-party identity and data in a privacy-safe way. The InfoSum Bridge solution provides our clients and partners a way to collaborate using their first-party data, resolved to Merkury IDs and data, with even greater freedom and confidence than with traditional clean room or safe haven approaches.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lou Paskalis, Chairman, MMA Global Media and Data Board: “As marketers struggle to better leverage their first-party data in the transition from the cookie era to the consent era, I would have expected more innovative solutions to emerge.  One bright spot is InfoSum, which offers a proprietary technology to connect data, yet never share that data. This is the most customer-friendly and compliant technology that I’ve seen that enables marketers to fully realize the true potential of their first party data. What InfoSum has devised is an elegant way to respect consumers’ privacy choices while enabling marketers to realize the full benefit of their first party data.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colin Grieves, Managing Director Experian: “At Experian we are committed to a culture of customer-centric data innovation, helping develop more meaningful and seamless connections between brands and their audiences. InfoSum Bridge gives us a scalable environment for secure, data connectivity and collaboration. Bridge is at the core of the Experian Match offering, which allows brands and publishers alike the ability to understand and engage the right consumers in the digital arena at scale, whilst safeguarding consumer data and privacy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thing is, clever technical architecture that enables big data fuelled modelling and profiling of people to continue, via pattern matching to identify &#8216;lookalike&#8217; customers who can (for example) be bucketed and targeted with ads, doesn&#8217;t actually sum to privacy as most people would understand it&#8230; But, for sure, impressive tech architecture guys.</p>
<p>The same issue attaches to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">FloCs</a>, Google&#8217;s proposed replacement for tracking cookies &#8212; which also relies on federation (and which the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">EFF</a> has branded a &#8220;terrible idea&#8221;, warning that such an approach actually risks <em>amplifying</em> predatory targeting).</p>
<p>The tenacity with which the marketing industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">seeks to cling to microtargeting</a> does at least underline why rights-focused regulatory oversight of adtech is going to be essential if we&#8217;re to stamp out systematic societal horrors like ads that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/us-privacy-consumer-competition-and-civil-rights-groups-urge-ban-on-surveillance-advertising/">scale bias</a> by discriminating against protected groups, or the anti-democratic manipulation of voters that&#8217;s enabled by opaque targeting and hyper-targeted messaging, circumventing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/legislators-from-ten-parliaments-put-the-squeeze-on-facebook/">necessary public scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Privacy is not just important for the individual. It&#8217;s a collective good. And keeping that collective commons safe from those who would seek to exploit it &#8212; for a quick buck or worse &#8212; is going to require a whole other type of oversight architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors placing capital in earlier and earlier tech deals has been a historical trend for the last few years, but this strategy was generally reserved for the traditional, &#8216;high-growth&#8217; VC arena. VCs needed to snag earlier ad earlier deals otherwise they would be diluted at a later stage. But with startups coming up with models which can book revenues faster, they have increasingly less need for the VC deal which typically leaves founders with less control and less equity than the newly-ensconced VC on their board. That said, capital at this early stage for &#8216;growth-based&#8217; startups was often hard to come by. Thus, the ‘early growth fund’ has been invented to address this issue.</p>
<p>Now, the latest arrival in this arena is Balderton, one of the Europe’s top VC funds, with may uicorns uder its belt.</p>
<p>Balderton has now launched a $680M ‘early growth’ fund to invest in high-potential tech companies, targeting around 15 companies at the early-growth stage, sector agostic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It plans to invest between $25m and $50m per company through both primary and secondary investments. The fund will be lead by Bernard Liautaud, David Thévenon, and Rana Yared.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2000, Balderton has raised $4bn to invest in European startups and backed more than 230 companies, primarily at the Series A stage. Its investments include Depop, GoCardless, Infarm, Revolut, THG, Vestiaire Collective, and Zego. The firm’s &#8216;Liquidity I&#8217; portfolio also includes Darktrace, Flywire, Graphcore, and Truecaller.</p>
<p>Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner said: “I’ve been an investor at Balderton since 2008, and it has been incredible to see the increasing number of ambitious European founders, and to be able to support them financially through those critical first three to five years with our early stage funds. With this Growth Fund, we can now support them as they scale to become global industry leaders. We predict a $50 billion growth opportunity in Europe in the next three years alone, and we want to be the first choice for those ambitious founders.” </p>
<p>Rana Yared, General Partner, added: “Our approach for this fund will be ‘one of few’. This means personalised attention from the entire partnership, plus access to Balderton’s leading platform team. We’re looking for fifteen or so really exceptional companies that have the potential to be sector leaders and disrupt global industries.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To catch up on this busy IPO week, Marqeta, Monday.com, Zeta Global and 1stDibs are on the docket. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re digging into the final IPO prices set by fintech unicorn Marqeta and enterprise productivity unicorn Monday.com this morning. Briefly, it&#8217;s good news.</p>
<p>A small programming note: The Exchange is off next week. I am taking some time to do nothing other than eat, read books and lose at lawn games. Regular service will resume the week after.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>To catch up on this busy IPO week, Marqeta, Monday.com and two other IPOs are on the docket. The final pair are Zeta Global and 1stDibs, debuts that matter, if a bit less so for our purposes than the others.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;ll unpack the final price of each, comparing it to its IPO valuation range and drawing a few conclusions about where we stand in the larger unicorn liquidity cycle.</p>
<p>This is familiar ground for us, but given the sheer flow of IPOs we cannot sit back and presume that our knowledge is current; things are happening with enough speed that regular revisions of our market views are key.</p>
<p>And we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/as-monday-com-targets-6b-ipo-valuation-zoom-and-salesforce-commit-150m/">may have been too conservative before</a>, so we have a bit of clean-up ahead of us.</p>
<h2>Strong pricing</h2>
<p>Why do we care about IPO pricing? After all, the DoorDash and Airbnb IPOs showed that the value at which a company opens life as a public entity can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">wildly differ</a> from where bankers estimated it should be valued.</p>
<p>Two quick things: First, IPO pricing sets the terms for the floating company&#8217;s fundraise; IPOs are fundraising events that often take the place of one last private round, so their price matters from a dilution perspective. And a lot of the hottest IPOs from the last six months have given back some of their early gains, making their official IPO price relevant.</p>
<p>DoorDash, for example, priced at $102 before soaring as high as $256 per share after its debut. Today, the company is worth $135.50 in pre-market trading. That&#8217;s a lot closer to its IPO price than we might have anticipated after watching its first days as a floating stock.</p>
<p>So, this stuff really does matter, and the numbers that we see below will help private companies price their next venture rounds. Furthermore, strong public market pricing could help keep alive the current game of wealthy private groups like Tiger hunting ever-earlier-stage startups with promising &#8212; if nascent &#8212; growth rates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo will be moving freight for a major customer of transportation logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services under what the two companies are calling a “test run” that will take place in one of the country’s busiest trade corridors.</p>
<p>Waymo Via, the company’s trucking and cargo transportation service, will transport goods along Interstate 45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas. The trucks will be powered by the Waymo Driver autonomous platform, though a Waymo “autonomous specialists,” a commercially-licensed truck driver and a software technician will be riding in each truck to monitor the operations.</p>
<p>This is not the first time J.B. Hunt and Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, have worked together. It seems the companies have been preparing for a trial deployment of autonomous trucks for some time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’ve also worked closely with J.B. Hunt for some time now on operational and market studies and will continue to do so as we roll out autonomous driving technology,” Waymo said in a blog post. “We’ve explored topics such as best practices for regular maintenance, what future facility layouts will look like, and which lanes are best suited for autonomous driving technology, to help ensure long-term preparedness on both sides.”</p>
<p>Waymo declined to share with TechCrunch the specific number of trucks that will be used for the test run, but a spokesperson said that it will be a limited duration pilot “with the goal of jointly developing a long term plan for how our companies can work together.”</p>
<p>Waymo Driver is a Level 4 platform, meaning that it could theoretically operate without a human safety driver behind the wheel, but only under certain conditions (like clear weather).</p>
<p>The autonomous driving company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/daimler-trucks-partners-with-waymo-to-build-self-driving-semi-trucks/">partnered with Daimler Trucks</a> to equip Daimler freightliners with the Waymo Driver. That’s in addition to partnerships <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/waymo-volvo-partner-to-develop-electric-robotaxis/">with Volvo</a> to develop electric robotaxis, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/waymo-and-fiat-chrysler-expand-partnership-to-develop-self-driving-ram-vans/">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles</a> for autonomous cargo vans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fixed-term-funds (FTFs) have historically been a bank-to-bank market. FTF products allow for investing into some of the safest assets including, UK Government bonds, US Government bonds and highly-rated corporations. They allow holders of large amounts of cash (such as charities, private funds, family offices etc) to reduce and diversify their risk, but also increasing returns.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring is a fintech startup that is aiming to opening up access to this area of financial markets, by creating a Fixed-Term Fund platform. It&#8217;s now raised a $10 million Series A investment round co-led by MMC Ventures and Anthemis Group. Existing investors, including ETFS Capital, participated, taking the total its raised to $15 million.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring says its FTF platform gives holders of large cash balances online access to a menu of proprietary cash investments on a daily basis. This gives them access to an asset class that is usually only available to major financial institutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Kevin Cook (CEO), Matthew Longhurst and James Skillen, Cook said in a statement: “Following a break-out 12 months in which we increased AUM by 10x, we wanted to bring in the best possible investment partners to support our ambitious growth plans. We have long admired both Anthemis Group and MMC, so I am delighted that they co-led the round and we are excited to work with Sean, Ollie and their respective teams, as we move into the next phase of our journey to redefine cash investment and front-office treasury.”</p>
<p>Given the current low and negative interest rates and an uncertain global financial outlook, TreasurySpring says its platform is likely to appeal as an alternative to traditional bank deposits and money market funds. It says it&#8217;s now issued more than $9B of FTFs to a client base which includes FTSE 100 and other listed companies, fund managers, large private companies, charities, and family offices.</p>
<p>Yann Ranchere, partner at Anthemis Group said: &#8220;With its ambitious and mission-driven team, TreaurySpring is opening the traditional money market industry to a whole new pool of participants.”</p>
<p>Oliver Richards, partner at MMC Ventures added: “Having worked with the team at TreasurySpring for the last two years, we have absolute confidence in their ability to deliver on their unique vision to level the playing field in cash investing and short-term funding, through a platform that not only brings value to its clients and issuers but also enhances the diversification and systemic stability of the money markets as a whole.”</p>
<p>Does TreasurySpring have any direct competitors? The compay sdays not. That said, bank deposits and money market funds are still the only tools available to most holders of large cash balances, so the banks and asset managers that offer these products are competitors, &#8220;to an extent&#8221; admits the firm. Howeverr, they are also &#8220;collaborators in many instances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook said: &#8220;Adoption of the platform is being driven by a realisation that the risks and returns of the traditional [deposit and MMF] options are becoming ever less attractive, whilst building out the infrastructure to do anything else is complex, cumbersome, time consuming and expensive.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[RSA Security has spun out its fraud and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rsa-security/">RSA Security</a> has spun out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fraud/">fraud</a> and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Led by CEO Reed Taussig, who was appointed head of RSA&#8217;s Anti-Fraud Business Unit last year after previously serving as CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/threatmetrix/">ThreatMetrix</a>, the new company will focus solely on fraud detection and management and payments authentication services.</p>
<p>Outseer will continue to operate under the RSA umbrella and will inherit three core services, which are already used by more than 6,000 financial institutions, from the company: Outseer Fraud Manager (formerly RSA Adaptive Authentication), a risk-based account monitoring service; 3-D Secure (formerly Adaptive Authentication for eCommerce), a card-not-present and digital payment authentication mapping service; and FraudAction, which detects and takes down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> sites, dodgy apps and fraudulent social media pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outseer says its product portfolio is supported by deep investments in data and science, including a global network of verified fraud and transaction data, and a risk engine that the company claims delivers 95% fraud detection rates.</p>
<p>Commenting on the spinout, Taussig said: “Outseer is the culmination of decades of science-driven innovation in anti-fraud and payments authentication solutions. As the digital economy continues to deepen, the Outseer mission to liberate the world from transactional fraud is essential. Our role as a revenue enabler for the global economy will only strengthen as every digital business continues to scale.”</p>
<p>RSA, meanwhile, will continue to focus on integrated risk management and security products, including Archer for risk management, NetWitness for threat detection and response, and SecureID for identity and access management (IAM) capabilities.</p>
<p>The spinout comes less than a year after private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">which recently bought FireEye’s product business for $1.2 billion</a>, acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">RSA Security from Dell Technologies for more than $2 billion</a>. Dell had previously acquired RSA as part of its purchase of EMC in 2016.</p>
<p>It also comes amid a huge rise in online fraud fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission said in March that more than 217,000 Americans had filed a coronavirus-related fraud report since January 2020, with losses to COVID-linked fraud totaling $382 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Similarly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fielded 542,300 fraud complaints in 2020, a 54% increase over 2019.</p>
<p>RSA said that with the COVID-19 pandemic having fueled “unprecedented” growth in fraudulent transactions, Outseer will focus its innovation on payments authentication, mapping to the EMV 3-D Secure 2.x payment standard, and incorporating new technology integrations across the payments and commerce ecosystem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Outseer’s reason for being isn’t just focused on eliminating payments and account fraud,” Taussig added. “These fraudulent transactions are often the pretext for more sinister drug and human trafficking, terrorism, and other nefarious behavior. Outseer has the ability to help make the world a safer place.”</p>
<p>Valuation information for Outseer was not disclosed, nor were headcount figures mentioned in the spinout announcement. Outseer didn&#8217;t immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear outcome of the pandemic was pushing more people to do their shopping online, and that was as true for B2B as it was for B2C. Knowing which of your B2B customers are most likely to convert puts any sales team ahead of the game. <a href="https://www.slintel.com/">Slintel</a>, a startup providing that kind of data, announced a $20 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The company has attracted some big-name investors with GGV leading the round and Accel, Sequoia and Stellaris also participating. The investment brings the total raised to over $24 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/slintel-grabs-4-2m-seed-to-expand-sales-intelligence-platform/">a $4.2 million seed round</a> from last November.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a quick turnaround from seed to A, and company founder and CEO Deepak Anchala, says that while he had plenty of runway left from the seed round, the demand was such that it seemed prudent to take the A money sooner than he had planned. &#8220;So we had enough cash in the bank, but investors came to us and we got a pretty good valuation compared to the previous round, so we decided to take it and use that money to go faster,&#8221; Anchala said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Certainly the market dynamics were working in Slintel&#8217;s favor. Without giving revenue details, Anchala said that revenue grew 5x last year in the middle of the worst of the pandemic. He says that meant buyers were spending less time with sales and marketing folks to understand products and more time online researching on their own.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/">Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=TQCSY7jHBh" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So what Slintel does as a product is we mine buyer insights. We understand where the buyers are in their journey, what their pain points are, what products they use, what they need and when they need it. So we understand all of this to create a 360 degree view of the buyer that you provide these insights to sales and marketing teams to help them sell better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After growing at such a rapid clip last year, the company expected more modest growth this year at perhaps 3x, but with the added investment, he expects to grow faster again. &#8220;With the funding we&#8217;re actually looking at much bigger numbers. We&#8217;re looking at 5x in our revenue this year, and also trying for 4x revenue next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that the money gives him the opportunity to improve the product and put more investment into marketing, which he believes will contribute to additional sales. Since the round closed 6 weeks ago, he says that he has increased his advertising budget and is also hopes to attract customers via SEO, free tools on the company website and events.</p>
<p>The company had 45 employees at the time of its seed round in November and has more than doubled that number in the interim to 100 spread out across 10 cities. He expects to double again by this time next year as the company is growing quickly. As a global company with some employees in India and some in the U.S., he intends to be remote first even after offices begin to reopen in different areas. He says that he plans to have company gatherings each quarter to let people gather in person on occasion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In June of last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/kn0thing?lang=en">Alexis Ohanian</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital/">he was leaving Initialized Capital</a>, the venture firm he co-founded alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a> in 2011. Nearly a year later, he&#8217;s announcing that his new venture firm, <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/">Seven Seven Six</a>, has raised $150 million for its first fund.</p>
<p>Seven Seven Six is named for the year of the first Olympics, when a cook from nearby village ended up winning the Stadion race. Ohanian&#8217;s idea with the name stems from the fact that the cook was likely a fantastic athlete, but not necessarily the <em>best </em>athlete out there; many people were excluded from the first Olympic games, from athletes outside of Greece to those who didn&#8217;t have the means to show up to women, who weren&#8217;t even allowed to watch the games.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I thought about that track record, and all the things that I&#8217;ve been proud of as an entrepreneur and investor, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like I was celebrating the cook,&#8221; said Ohanian. &#8220;I&#8217;m still very proud of that track record, but I know that I could have done better. I want the idea that we&#8217;re always on the first starting line trying to do better in pursuit of greater returns.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that this pursuit, to leave no entrepreneurial rock unturned, is not necessarily something he wants to do because he enjoys it and it feels good, but because &#8220;it will make more money, it&#8217;s more successful and more effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equity and inclusion, then, is built into the DNA of Seven Seven Six. Half of the firm&#8217;s limited partners are women, and 15 percent are black or indigenous people.</p>
<p>Alongside Ohanian, Katelin Holloway and Lissie Garvin are taking founding positions at Seven Seven Six. Both worked with Ohanian at Initialized and Reddit.</p>
<p>One other unique piece of Seven Seven Six is that it is introducing a 2% &#8220;Growth and Caregiving Commitment.&#8221; Ohanian explained that, when he was going through Y Combinator, he was going through a rough time in his personal life. His mother was suffering from an illness, and his girlfriend (at the time) had been in an accident abroad.</p>
<p>So, as he was establishing a business, he was also traveling to see the people he loved who needed him. The financial burden added even more complexity to his life, and an incalculable level of stress.</p>
<p>The 2% commitment sets aside an extra two percent of an investment Seven Seven Six makes into a particular company, to offer financial support to founders for whatever they might need, from childcare to travel to surfing lessons, if that&#8217;s what it takes to help a founder perform in a healthy, balanced way.</p>
<p>Transparency is also a key part of Seven Seven Six&#8217;s philosophy. The firm plans to report on the spending out of this 2% commitment, as well as the diversity and inclusion breakdown of its investments each year.</p>
<p>Thus far, the VC firm has made 17 investments. From the release:</p>

<p>Seven Seven Six primarily wants to invest in seed rounds, and lead those rounds as much as possible. The fund joins a host of others that have raised this year as VCs continue to enjoy a low interest-rate environment that is helping bring cash to their investment firms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Threat intelligence company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/recorded-future/">Recorded Future</a> is launching a $20 million fund for early-stage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startups/">startups</a> developing novel data intelligence tools.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Fund will provide seed and Series A funding to startups that already have venture capital funding, Recorded Future says, as well as equip them with resources to help with the development and integration of intelligence applications in order to accelerate their go-to-market strategy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future, which provides customers with information to help them better understand the external cyber threats they are facing, will invest in startups that aim to tackle significant problems that require novel approaches using datasets and collection platforms, which the company says could be anything from technical internet sensors to satellites. It’s also keen to invest in startups building intelligence analysis toolsets that make use of technologies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> and machine learning, as well as intelligence-driven applications that can be integrated into its own Intelligence Platform and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Recorded Future co-founder and chief executive Christopher Ahlberg said: “In a world of aggressive uncertainty, intelligence is the only equalizer. With the launch of the Intelligence Fund, we are investing in the next generation of entrepreneurs who share our vision for securing the world with intelligence.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So far, the Intelligence Fund has invested in two companies, the first being SecurityTrails, which provides customers with a comprehensive overview of current and historical domain and IP address data. The second investment went to Gemini Advisory, a fraud intelligence platform specializing in finding compromised data on the dark web, which Recorded Future went on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recorded-future-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-gemini-advisory-301248485.html">to acquire</a> earlier this year for $52 million in a bid to bolster its own threat intelligence capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future told TechCrunch that future investments could also be made with an eye to acquiring, but added that funding could also be given purely on the basis that the startup would make a good business or technology partner. Recorded Future was itself acquired by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/"> private equity firm Insight Partners back in 2019 for $780 million</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The acquisition effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/">bought out the company&#8217;s earlier investors</a>, including Google&#8217;s venture arm GV, and In-Q-Tel, the non-profit venture arm of the U.S. intelligence community.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the fund, Michael Triplett, managing partner at Insight Partners, said: “Cyberattacks continue to impact global enterprises across the globe, and we’re excited to see Recorded Future invest in intelligence startups tackling the business-critical issues that organizations face today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
