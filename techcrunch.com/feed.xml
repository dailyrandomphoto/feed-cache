										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer just announced that he will stepping down from the role next year and transition to a part-time position as a &#8220;Senior Fellow&#8221; at the company. It&#8217;s one of the biggest leadership departures for Facebook in recent memory.</p>
<p>He will be replaced in the role by long-time executive Andrew Bosworth who has most recently led the company&#8217;s Facebook Reality Labs. Bosworth will continue to lead the AR/VR organization in his new role.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/note-from-mark-zuckerberg/">shared a note</a> on the departure in the company&#8217;s newsroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I want to take a moment to thank Schrep for his extraordinary contributions to our community and our company over the last 13 years. He has played a critical role in almost everything we’ve done — from building and scaling our teams to mentoring many of our key leaders, and from helping us develop new technologies like AI and VR to operating our infrastructure and business services at global scale. Schrep and I have had a close partnership over the years, and in addition to being a great leader, he’s also a great person and a close friend. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is a difficult decision because of how much I love Facebook and how excited I am about the future we are building together, Schroepfer wrote in a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/schrep/posts/10159715842464443"> Facebook post</a>. &#8220;This change in role will allow me to dedicate more time to my family and my personal philanthropic efforts while staying deeply connected to the company working on key initiatives including recruiting and developing technical talent and continuing to foster our AI investments in critical technologies like PyTorch.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Updating</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve never struggled to click the correct one of three different download buttons on one of those &#8220;YouTube to mp4&#8221; websites, well, haven&#8217;t you led an honorable internet life! But now, YouTube is testing a feature for Premium subscribers that might render those bootleg websites somewhat obsolete.</p>
<p>From now through October 19, Premium users can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">test a feature</a> that lets them download videos from their browser. This test, which brings an existing mobile feature to the web, is part of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">ongoing program</a> that allows Premium users to test out what the platform is working on.</p>
<p>Videos will be downloadable by default for Premium users &#8212; uploaders don&#8217;t need to opt-in. Subscribers with access to the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Opera browsers can click a &#8220;Download&#8221; button while watching a video, or click a 3-dot menu while browsing. Then, users will be able to access their downloaded videos on a downloads feed, which is also accessible via sidebar navigation.</p>

<p>Unlike those third-party sites, YouTube won&#8217;t give you a video file to store on your hard drive forever.</p>
<p>Instead, YouTube tells TechCrunch, the viewer gains access to a cached version of the video &#8212; it&#8217;s like downloading a Netflix show to watch offline while you&#8217;re on a plane. Users can view their downloaded videos by navigating to the YouTube website while they&#8217;re offline. Then, they will see text showing that they are offline, which will take them to a new page showing the videos they&#8217;ve downloaded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature also works on YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/24/youtube-install-pwa/">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA). Downloaded YouTube videos will remain available as long as the user&#8217;s device connects to the internet at least once every 30 days.</p>
<p>The feature was first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/">Android Police</a>, which noticed the changes to the YouTube.com/new website. YouTube declined to say if and when it may have more officially communicated the test to its users, but typically, Premium members can browse the available experiments as a perk that comes with a YouTube Premium subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/giving-users-more-transparency-their-google-ad-experience/">announced</a> a change to its online ads, which will now display new disclosures that allow web searchers to see not just who the advertiser is and why the ad was served to you, but also what other ads the advertiser has run with Google, starting with the most recent. The changes are a part of Google&#8217;s broader revamp of its ads business in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny and a broader shift across the tech industry to technologies that promote transparency and consumer privacy.</p>
<p>In this case, Google is building on last year&#8217;s launch of its <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/advertiser-identity-verification-for-transparency/" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/products/ads/advertiser-identity-verification-for-transparency/&quot;}">advertiser identity verification program</a>, which requires advertisers to disclose their personal information &#8212; including documents that prove they are who they say they are and those that confirm which country they operate from &#8212; as well as details about what they&#8217;re selling. These disclosures began rolling out last year to advertisers who buy ads from Google&#8217;s network. So far, Google says it&#8217;s begun verifying advertisers in over 90 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s including expanded disclosures in its &#8220;About this Ad&#8221; product, too.</p>
<p>Within these new advertiser pages, anyone will be able to click to learn more about the advertiser and access a menu where they can view all the ads a specific advertiser has run over the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Google presents this as a useful tool from a consumer perspective, by noting how a consumer who saw a product for sale, like a coat, could use the tool to learn more about a brand and its other products. But it&#8217;s clearly also useful as a means of identifying possible bad actors in the advertising ecosystem, as it would showcase a history of the advertisers&#8217; ads in one public-facing destination.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207037" style="width: 378px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207037" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2207037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-3.31.14-PM.jpg?w=368" alt="" width="368" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-3.31.14-PM.jpg 746w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-3.31.14-PM.jpg?resize=81,150 81w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-3.31.14-PM.jpg?resize=162,300 162w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-3.31.14-PM.jpg?resize=368,680 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-3.31.14-PM.jpg?resize=27,50 27w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>From here, users will also more easily be able to report an ad for violating Google <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942">policies</a> around things like prohibited or restricted content, such as counterfeit goods, dangerous products, inappropriate content, abuse, violations of interest-based ad policies, ads that deceive the user, noncompliance with local election laws and regulations, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The changes come about at a time when Google&#8217;s approach to online advertising had been shifting. Google hints at its broader strategy today, saying the new ad disclosures &#8220;build on our efforts to create a clear and intuitive experience for users who engage with ads on Google products.&#8221; It also noted that over 30 million users interact with its ads transparency and control menus on a daily basis. For a feature that&#8217;s relatively buried in the product &#8212; you have to click the tiny &#8220;i&#8221; icon to access these menus &#8212; that speaks to Google&#8217;s massive global scale.</p>
<p>To date, Google has also announced a number of significant moves in the ads space, including the addition of <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/how-chromes-ad-filtering-works.html?m=1">integrated ad-blocking in Chrome</a>, new <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/">limits to political ad targeting</a>, and it announced <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/24/22548700/google-cookies-ban-delay-floc-tracking">plans</a> to move away from third-party cookies &#8212; though these have <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/google-grants-a-third-party-cookie-reprieve-delays-deprecation-by-two-years/">since been delayed</a>.</p>
<p>Google notes that <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6014595?hl=en">election</a> ads will continue to be available in its <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/home?hl=en">political transparency report</a>. With these ads, the company also displays the &#8220;paid for by&#8221; disclosure to ensure users understand who paid for the ad. However, alll non-political content will appear in the advertiser pages, it says.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[No one roots for a pandemic, but for companies like Peloton, the timing couldn’t have been better. People on the fence about buying a treadmill or stationary bike went for it as their options shrunk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Unprecedented&#8221; only begins to scratch the surface of this past year-and-a-half. Entire industries have been made and broken as the global population struggled to adapt to the largest pandemic in a century. Connected fitness falls firmly in the category that made it.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that 2020 and 2021 have been transformative for home fitness. Years spent building products that let anyone work out at home paid massive dividends as people struggled to find alternative ways to exercise amid gym closures and a dramatic uptick in sedentary lifestyles.</p>
<p>No one roots for a pandemic, of course, but for companies like <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/">Peloton</a>, the timing couldn’t have been better. Many who were on the fence about purchasing a pricey treadmill or stationary bike were pushed over the edge as their in-person options shrunk. In February, the company said its subscriber count rose to 1.67 million, up 134% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>But the past few years haven’t been all smooth sailing for the company. From increased competition and early supply chain struggles to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">treadmill recall</a> that shook up the industry, there have been several recent roadblocks on the company’s climb.</p>
<p>Peloton CEO John Foley had initially pushed back on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reports, but ultimately agreed to recall its Tread+ in May, following reports of 70 injuries, including the death of a six-year-old.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this week, Foley — joined by Peloton chief content officer Jennifer Cotter — discussed broader safety issues with the category, noting that the unfortunate circumstances behind the recall have forced the company to take a closer look at product safety.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference between International Entrepreneur Parole and the latest proposed startup visa? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the startup visa will become a reality? If so, when?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Financial Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Financial,</p>
<p>Thank you for your questions! As you likely know, U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) recently introduced the <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/lofgren.house.gov/files/7.26.21%20-%20LIKE%20Act%20Full%20Text.pdf">Let Immigrants Kickstart Employment (LIKE) Act</a>, which creates both a startup visa and a startup green card.</p>
<p>Jeff Farrah, general counsel of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), recently discussed the LIKE Act with me on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/089-advocating-for-international-startup-founders-with-jeff-farrah-of-national-venture-capital-association/">podcast</a>. The NVCA is working on building support for the LIKE Act on Capitol Hill. However, Congress is currently focusing on the budget reconciliation and infrastructure bills, which means the LIKE Act is taking a back seat to those bills for now — and the timing of the LIKE Act remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>How to support the LIKE Act</h2>
<p>Farrah says there are things that we can do to support the LIKE Act to become a law and create an official startup visa in the United States. If you live or work in Lofgren’s district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, write her a letter thanking her for introducing the LIKE Act and share your story.</p>
<p>If you live or work in the U.S. outside of Lofgren’s district, write a letter to your congressional representatives, share your story, and let them know why a startup visa and path to a green card for founders is important. (Remember, do not claim to be a U.S. citizen if you aren’t since that could get you permanently barred from the United States!)</p>
<p>You can also ask your friends — immigrants and U.S. citizens alike — to write letters to their representatives in Congress. And if you have friends living abroad who want to come to the U.S. to start their venture, they could write to the congressional representative of the district where they are hoping to create their business and jobs in the U.S.</p>
<p>Now, let’s examine the differences between the proposed LIKE Act and our current new program for startup founders.</p>

<h2>International Entrepreneur Parole versus LIKE Act</h2>
<p>Like a non-immigrant visa, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) allows its holder to stay temporarily in the United States. However, IEP is not a visa, so the process in which it is given and extended is different from visas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of value in waste; just ask metals processing company <a href="https://nthcycle.com/">Nth Cycle</a>, which has developed a technology to help mining and recycling companies recover every bit of critical minerals from their operations.</p>
<p>The company calls its technology “electro-extraction,” and Nth Cycle’s founder and CEO Megan O’Connor likened it to a water filter in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “We found a way to electrify that,” she explained. “We push an electrical current across that filter, and that electricity that we push across is how we can selectively remove the metals of interest.”</p>
<p>Currently, all signs suggest that metal recovery and recycling will be key to electrifying the economy, especially as so many zero-emission technologies rely on critical minerals: lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese, which exist in varying but ultimately finite amounts in the natural environment.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, Nth Cycle has developed an electro-extraction system that stands at less than 1,000 square feet and can process 5 tons of material per day – a key differentiator from big, traditional recyclers that use hydro- and pyrometallurgical techniques that require more capital and generate a greater footprint. The system can accept “black mass,” a powdery waste substance that’s generated from the battery recycling process, and turn that waste into valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt and manganese.</p>
<p>On the mining front, Nth Cycle can work at the front or back end of the mining process, either helping companies extract value out of sites that are low grade, meaning they have relatively low metal content. It could help mine operators to potentially unlock a huge amount of untapped minerals.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re looking at a lot of the untapped resources we have here in North America, because we have all of the materials we need for the energy transition, we just don&#8217;t have a way to mine them sustainably yet.”</p>
<p>Nth Cycle’s modular unit can also process tailings, or waste from mining operations, and can collect up to 30% of metals that were not extracted in the original mining process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once commercialized, Nth Cycle plans to own and operate the units, with its customers owning any of the product that’s recovered.</p>
<p>O’Connor said she sees companies like battery recyclers Redwood Materials and Li-Cycle as partners rather than competitors, because Nth Cycle isn’t in the business of collecting batteries, as well as processing them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201864" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201864" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2201864 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg" alt="Nth Cycle wants to revolutionize metals processing for recyclers and mine operators" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://nthcycle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nth Cycle <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>“We&#8217;re really only innovating on the chemical recycling side of things,” she said. “We&#8217;re really trying to create a much more efficient way to pull these metals out of black mass. We&#8217;re not trying to compete to collect batteries like the other folks in the face. We&#8217;re not on the logistics side.”</p>
<p>The company’s approach is also much lighter on the capital expenditure side. Hydro- and pyrometallurgical facilities can cost millions of dollars to construct, a cost that simply isn’t feasible for a lot of waste collectors. Nor is it always workable for waste collectors and mining companies to ship the waste to recyclers, O’Connor said, especially if it’s low-grade material.</p>
<p>“For the vast majority of distributed waste, it&#8217;s not feasible to ship it to those centralized [recycling] facilities,” she said.</p>
<p>Nth Cycle was founded exactly one day after O’Connor defended her dissertation in environmental engineering at Duke University. “We actually sat at a bar in Boston, had a beer over it, and the next day I signed up online to become an LLC,” she said. “We’ve been working to commercialize ever since.”</p>
<p>Following her PhD, she was an entrepreneurial fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Innovation Crossroads, a two-year program for energy and advanced manufacturing entrepreneurs working on novel technologies. There, she received $500,000 in funding to scale the technology and prepare it for demonstration to private funders.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company will be announcing several deals for full commercial scale units and is aiming to close its Series A over the next few months. Thus far, the company has raised $1.25 million in non-dilutive grants and $3.2 million in seed funding from climate tech VC firm Clean Energy Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pollutants pouring from smokestacks around the world may be bad news for the atmosphere, but if you catch them before they get out there, you could reduce emissions and collect some valuable materials at the same time. That&#8217;s what <a href="https://www.carbixcorp.com/">Carbix</a> aims to do with its carbon-sequestering reactor, which would extract minerals from emissions while staying carbon-negative.</p>
<p>Carbix, which presented today at the Disrupt Startup Battlefield, is capitalizing on the pressure being placed on industries to decarbonize or face fines and high taxes. Cement manufacturing alone accounts for some 8 percent of carbon emissions, and executives are scrambling to go green.</p>
<p>It turns out that minerals needed for cement and many other industries are being literally thrown away — puffed out of flues and allowed to settle wherever they drift. In fact, these minerals are valuable enough that Carbix can afford to pay factories for the privilege of siphoning them off and reselling them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re essentially paying emitters for stock they would normally dump into the wind — they have no incentive not to do this,&#8221; said Carbix founder Quincy Sammy.</p>
<p>The process is an accelerated version of what happens in nature: atmospheric carbon dioxide interacting with certain abundant minerals and slowly forming other ones — like calcium carbonate, limestone. Turning CO2 into stone is the basis of several startups in what we might call the permanent carbon sequestering market; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/heimdal-pulls-co2-and-cement-making-materials-out-of-seawater-using-renewable-energy/">Heimdal</a> does it using seawater and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/44-01-secures-5m-to-turn-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-dioxide-to-stone/">44.01</a> is injecting high-carbon water into fields of reactive minerals. Carbix, of course, is going to artificial sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2199879" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg 3223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=1536,683 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=2048,911 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>It works like this: Carbix goes to a big emitter of CO2 and particulates and analyzes the stream being blown out. From that they can predict what carbonate minerals they can isolate and what they&#8217;ll need to do it. Then the output of the facility will be routed through one of Carbix&#8217;s reactors, in which the various effluvia are combined with raw reactive minerals — gypsum, lime kiln dust, and others sourced from nearby to lower the logistics impact — and out come useful substances like ingredients for making cement, glass, and other things. They cart those off and sell the raw materials that would have otherwise disappeared into the atmosphere (and eventually landed on a glacier somewhere).</p>
<p>The reactor, currently in a scale prototype called X1, is the most obviously defensible IP here, and Sammy said that the bulk of the seed round they&#8217;re putting together will go towards building the production-scale X2, which will have several hundred times the reactor space. Each X2 should be able to handle about 16,000 tons of carbonates per year per reactor, which corresponds to about 8,000 tons of CO2. They can operate in parallel, and Sammy estimated that a good size emitter might use 10 at a single facility.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199877" style="width: 1239px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-Emotor-ISO-View.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199877" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199877 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-Emotor-ISO-View.jpg" alt="Prototype of the X1 reactor.

The X2 will be larger by an order of magnitude at least.</p></div></p>
<p>The simplest arrangement would be for the emitter to pay for the upfront costs of the installation, with the understanding of mutual benefits to come. Carbix would then regularly pay for the materials it extracts — a double benefit since the emitter would normally not earn any money on them but the emissions would count towards caps. Sammy didn&#8217;t rule out profit sharing or other agreements but this would be the preferred setup.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re breaking new ground with these companies, so reciprocity is key,&#8221; Sammy said. And while cement manufacturing is the first vertical they&#8217;re targeting, the Carbix process can be adapted to plenty of other industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be tied to any specific sector — flue gas is flue gas. That&#8217;s why the project is end-to-end; we guide people through it. We&#8217;re demonstrating that we can work in any industry,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>As with any hardware company working at industrial scales, there are a lot of upfront costs. Carbix is working on a seed round to cover the expense of building and certifying the X2 reactor so it can be insured and financed through ordinary channels. After that comes the reciprocal back-scratching arrangements that benefit everyone involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">David Moeller wasn&#8217;t looking to start another company. He had already earned the serial entrepreneur badge with CodeGuard, a website backup startup, and his hardware company Claw Hanging Systems.</p>
<p>But a series of car break-ins prompted Moeller to search for a product that would keep his vehicle safe. What he found was a gap in the market and an opportunity to fill it.</p>
<p>Moeller spent several years researching and developing prototypes and business plans for what would eventually become <a href="https://keep.tech/">Keep Technologies</a>. The Atlanta-based startup, which debuted virtually at the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield, was officially founded in fall 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really looking for a reason not to start this,&#8221; Moeller said, noting that he spent months conducting market research, a patent study, surveying consumers and then eventually building out a prototype. &#8220;I had just sold my company, and at the time I was thinking, I should be focusing on golf and I&#8217;ve got a young daughter. I wanted to find the red flag or a reason not to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moeller didn&#8217;t find that reason. Instead, he developed a suite of smart devices for safety and security in vehicles and an accompanying cloud service and a mobile app. Its flagship product is the Knight, an intrusion and motion detector that locks into the cup holder of a vehicle. And yes, the cup holder can still be used.</p>
<p>Keep&#8217;s technology, of which it has secured five utility patents and another 16 pending, has already attracted several investors. Moeller initially used his own funds to bootstrap Keep. The company has since raised $4 million from several investors, including Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince, Tom Noonan, who is the founding partner of early-stage technology investment firm TechOperators, Bert Ellis of Ellis Capital, Kenzie Lane Innovation CEO Tripp Rackley and Jerry Perullo, who is the chief information security officer of the Intercontinental Exchange.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Keep Technology&#8217;s Knight device connects to the OBD port in a vehicle. The cord can run underneath the floorboard and then up to the center console of the vehicle, where cup holders are typically located. The Knight is placed into the cup holder and becomes activated once the owner twists the device so it is anchored into its location.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Knight cannot be uninstalled by anyone but the user, Moeller told TechCrunch, adding that some of its patents are related to alarm functionality during the installation and the removal of the device. The Knight is equipped with a camera that provides a 180-degree view. It also has cellular bandwidth, as well as passive infrared (PIR) and microwave sensors to detect motion outside and inside the car.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205290" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205290" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205290 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg" alt="Keep Technologies KNIGHT in vehicle" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Keep Technologies</p></div></p>
<p>What this all means is that the Knight can record video of a person breaking into the vehicle, send that data to the cloud and push it to the user&#8217;s mobile device. Keep Technologies also has a monitoring service that can view the video on the car owner&#8217;s behalf and take action and notify the police.</p>
<p>The aim, of course, is to prevent break-ins — not just record the bad actors messing with the vehicle or stealing items from it. The device communicates via Bluetooth either with an accompanying fob or the user&#8217;s mobile app. Either way, once the owner locks and moves out of range of the vehicle, the device automatically arms itself.</p>
<p>If someone approaches the vehicle and looks inside, the device will go into deterrent mode by flashing an LED light and making a loud chirping noise. This isn&#8217;t akin to the loud exterior alarms on the market today. The flash of light and loud chirp only occurs if someone is lingering by the vehicle and stops once they leave. If they choose to open the vehicle, a buzzer that emits a sound of up to 120 decibels — Moeller describes this as 100 screaming babies — goes off and the fisheye lens records and transmits the video.</p>
<p>For the Knight product, Moeller said the company is targeting $299 for the device and $50 a year for the subscription. If the user wants professional monitoring, Keep is aiming for a price that is about $30 a month. The company plans to launch the product in mid-2022.</p>
<h2>The winding road to Keep</h2>
<p>Moeller, who earned his mechanical engineering degree from Georgia Tech, started his professional life in a more traditional manner by taking a job at GE where he worked for four years in the Midwest, China and Dallas. He left for business school at Harvard University intending to make a career switch to investment banking. It was here that the entrepreneurial bug first bit.</p>
<p>On a whim, Moeller and a friend tried out for a reality show called American Inventor, a precursor to Shark Tank that aired on ABC in summer 2007. The pair invented a bicycle rack called The Claw and ended up being one of the six finalists. They would eventually license the product to Whirlpool and more than million units have been sold through Lowe&#8217;s, Home Depot and Amazon.</p>
<p>Moeller had spent half of that summer filming the reality TV show and the other half interning at an investment banking firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the end of the summer, I decided to do entrepreneurship even if I made no money,&#8221; Moeller said. &#8220;That experience really changed my mindset around taking big risks and what can happen when you do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching Claw Hanging Systems led Moeller to his next startup called CodeGuard. The Claw founders had built a website in order to collect pre-orders for the product once the show debuted. The aim, Moeller explained, was to be able to show Whirlpool or another company, that there was demand for the product. But the website crashed the day before American Inventor aired.</p>
<p>A few years later, Moeller co-founded website backup startup CodeGuard with a professor at Georgia Tech. The company launched at TechCrunch Disrupt 2011 and became a finalist in the competition. CodeGuard partnered with Cloudflare shortly after and was acquired in 2018 by Sectigo.</p>
<p>Moeller stayed on at Sectigo for another two years. During this time, he started working on nights and weekends on hardware for neuroscience labs. This would eventually become Neuromatic Devices, a spinout from Georgia Tech and MIT. Moeller ended up selling assets from Neuromatic.</p>
<p>It was around the time that Sectigo acquired CodeGuard that Moeller experienced a series of car break-ins. The last one, which was right after he and his wife had moved to a new neighborhood in Atlanta, pushed him to find any kind of security device or product that could prevent future theft.</p>
<h2>Eye toward future products</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205288 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg" alt="Keep Technologies Product Suite" width="6415" height="3600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg 6415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6415px) 100vw, 6415px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has developed other products, as well — most with a chess theme — including a less expensive version called the Pawn that doesn&#8217;t have a camera and still detects motion and intrusion, as well as a windshield-mounted device that provides 360 degrees of visibility called the Rook.</p>
<p>Moeller said the Knight, Pawn and Rook are just the beginning for the company. The company of 11 people, including Moeller, is also working on other security devices and sensors, including a guard for catalytic converters, which are a favorite of thieves. Other add-ons products coming in the future include a car seat monitoring sensor, a device that monitors the door, trunk and gas cap, in-cup wireless charging and a tag that provides additional GPS tracking.</p>
<p>Keep has also architected a product called Lookout, a small puck that goes on the windshield and can record traffic stops. With this, Moeller isn&#8217;t trying to squeeze into the dashcam industry; instead he believes partnering with some leading providers to integrate into their devices is potentially a better path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dan Cohen was on the hunt for a coating that could keep ice, snow and frost off of solar panels when he discovered a technology that could cut costs and reduce the environmental footprint of a broad section of products from aircrafts and drones to medical devices, pipelines and even sailboats.</p>
<p>And it would prompt Cohen to found his own startup, <a href="https://www.flite.tech/">Flite Material Sciences</a>, which debuted virtually at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>Cohen never found the perfect coating for those panels, one of the projects he had undertaken as CTO of the solar company. The coating would change the color of the panel, need to be applied every year or contain toxic materials. The answer came from a professor at the University of Rochester&#8217;s Institute of Optics, who claimed he could keep ice and rain and snow and frost off the panels and off the structures with no coating at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought, okay, that&#8217;s a little counterintuitive, but let&#8217;s go see what he has,&#8221; Cohen said. The professor introduced Cohen to the field of laser surface functionalization. Instead of a coating, which gives the glass, plastic or metal the ability to repel water, he used a laser to retexture the material allowing it repels water by itself. The process also works to prevent rust, ice and repel oil on a variety of surfaces, including semiconductors and even human bone and teeth.</p>
<p>Cohen was impressed and inquired whether a solar panel manufacturer had already licensed the technology. It turns out, the technology wasn&#8217;t licensed to any company, in any industry.</p>
<p>The University of Rochester agreed to license the technology and Flite Materials Science was born in 2018 to commercialize it. The startup spent the first year learning about the technology, researching the IP and understanding product market fit. It also went through several accelerator programs, including TechStars and <a href="https://centech.co/en/nouvelles/centech-announces-the-companies-chosen-for-its-fall-acceleration-program">Centech</a> in Montreal.</p>
<p>Now, Cohen is aiming to take the technology to a commercial scale and apply it to aerospace, life sciences and other industries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The texturizing process mimics what can be found in nature. Take a lotus leaf, for instance. That leaf can sit in water all day but still seem perfectly dry, Cohen explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at it under a powerful enough microscope, you see that it&#8217;s actually extremely rough, that there are these very sharp spikes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so theories started to emerge about why water can&#8217;t stay on these sharp spiky surfaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early research that tried to create these textures focused on a combination of gases and chemicals. University of Rochester professor Chunlei Guo came up with a novel way of using lasers with a high pulse rate — like a quadrillion pulses per second — to transform the material without building up a lot of heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is putting in lots of energy, but the pulses make it possible to be more of a sculptor,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;It moves material around or redeposits it back on without just burning it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last point is critical. The technique that Flite is licensing and plans to commercialize doesn&#8217;t take away or weaken the surface. It merely reshapes the texture to give the metal or plastic the ability to repel water, oil and ice.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The company is currently &#8220;scrambling&#8221; to conduct as many customer validation projects as possible,&#8221; Cohen said, adding that those projects that prove how this could work on specific products and industries. Flite Material Science has completed a few projects and has more lined up.</p>
<p>About 16 companies have expressed a strong interest to do these tests in the next year and about 150 more are waiting for us to have the capacity to participate, Cohen said.</p>
<p>Flite Material Sciences has fewer than 10 employees, but Cohen hopes to hire more once the company closes a round of funding in the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s research led it to home in on aerospace and defense. The company is also &#8220;doing quite a bit of work&#8221; for oil and gas and semiconductors and sees demand from automotive and packaging, said Cohen, adding that those last two industries will likely have to wait until unit economics have come down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you or your kid have any sort of respiratory issue, figuring out what&#8217;s happening minute-by-minute — and how well treatment is working — is a stressful, frustrating, and anxiety-filled process. I imagine it&#8217;s all of the above and more in the middle of a friggin&#8217; RESPIRATORY DISEASE pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="http://stethome.com">StethoMe</a>, a team competing in this week&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield competition, is looking to help alleviate some of this for children with asthma and their parents. It has built a smart, connected stethoscope that can help parents perform lung examinations at home, sending high-fidelity recordings directly to their kid&#8217;s doctor and using machine-learning to help flag potential concerns.</p>
<p>This is the device:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207001" style="width: 551px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207001" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207001" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?w=541" alt="" width="541" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=119,150 119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=239,300 239w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=768,965 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=541,680 541w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207001" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> StethoMe</p></div></p>
<p>Turn it on, use your phone to tell it what kind of exam you want to perform, and the built-in screen will walk you through the process. It&#8217;ll tell you where on the chest to place the device, whether or not the room you&#8217;re in is quiet enough, and more. After measuring across 6-8 points, it&#8217;ll provide you a report with details like respiratory rate, heart rate, and whether or not it detected any audio abnormalities — including wheezing, rhonci (gurgling sounds caused by fluid), or crackles.</p>
<p>From there, you&#8217;re able to send a link to the report directly to your kid&#8217;s doctor, where they can hear the recorded audio from each point on the chest. A scrubbable spectrogram, meanwhile, provides a visual overview of each recording and flags and labels any abnormalities detected by the system. That report looks like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207053" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207053" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?w=630" alt="" width="630" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png 2524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=278,300 278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=768,829 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=630,680 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=1424,1536 1424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=1898,2048 1898w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207053" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> StethoMe</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This information is meant to help parents and their doctors detect asthma attacks earlier and more accurately, and to help determine how well long-term medications are working — is one medication better than another at alleviating harder-to-detect symptoms? Did bumping up the dosage slightly help?</p>
<p>Co-founder Wojciech Radomski tells me their product is already certified as a medical device in the EU, having obtained a CE mark for both the AI and the device; the FDA approval process in the U.S., meanwhile, is underway.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, the company announced a deal wherein Poland&#8217;s Ministry of Health has purchased 1,000 devices to run a pilot test with over 100 doctors over the next half a year. &#8220;During this last month [alone],&#8221; Radomski tells me, &#8220;they&#8217;ve already made over 70,000 recordings.&#8221;</p>
<p>To maybe straddle the edge of too personal here: I freakin&#8217; love this idea. I had asthma growing up. It dominated my life for a few years; even once the doctors got it under control (thanks science, love yooou), six-year-old me was <em>always</em> convinced I was having or about to have an asthma attack. The fear of being unable to breathe triggered crushing anxiety, which in turn convinced me I couldn&#8217;t breathe. While I can&#8217;t speak to how well this thing works at this point (that&#8217;s the FDA&#8217;s job), I wish I could package this thing up and stick it in a time machine and send it back to lil&#8217; me in 1993 with a note that says &#8220;Use this, breathe easier.&#8221; (and maybe &#8220;p.s. buy bitcoin early&#8221; but I guess we shouldn&#8217;t screw with the timeline <em>too</em> much.)</p>
<p>StethoMe says it has raised a few rounds at this point (a $400K pre-seed, $2M seed, and $2.5M Series A) and received nearly $3M in grants from Poland&#8217;s National Center for Research and Development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buying and selling on marketplace websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace often lead to meeting a stranger somewhere to complete the purchase and pick up the item.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/facebook-marketplace-monthly-active-users-now-at-1-billion-shops-crosses-250-million-mark-zuckerberg-2424412#:~:text=Million%20Mark%3A%20Zuckerberg-,Facebook%20Marketplace%20Monthly%20Active%20Users%20Now%20at%201%20Billion,Crosses%20250%20Million%20Mark%3A%20Zuckerberg">over 1 billion Facebook Marketplace users per month</a>, <a href="https://nymbull.com/">Nymbull</a> founder Jackson Wegelin doesn’t think that’s necessary for peer-to-peer transactions. And he estimates that between interacting with potential buyers and dealing with no-shows, each sale takes about a week to complete.</p>
<p>His company, which participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, aims to eliminate a lot of that hassle and get completed sales down to an average of two to three days through the creation of a patented remote lock and sales website that enables users to list their item on the Nymbull website and share that link on the marketplace of their choice. He refers to it as “lock it, list it, leave it.”</p>
<p>Sellers purchase the lock — similar to a bicycle lock — to lock up items for sale at their location of choice for potential buyers to inspect the item. If the buyer is satisfied, they complete the payment through the Nymbull website to get the unlock code. The company uses Stripe and offers charge-back protection to both parties.</p>
<p>“There has been lots of evolution in marketplaces,” Wegelin said. “We have pizza companies using lockers as do people for dropping keys for Airbnbs, as well as Amazon pick-up lockers. This became more normal as COVID hit and people started social distancing and wanting non-contact transactions.”</p>
<p>The idea for the company came to Wegelin in 2016 when he had a grill that he wanted to sell. He lives on a busy main street in his neighborhood and thought about listing the item and locking it to a tree in the front of his house so people could look at it. While searching for remote locks that would enable him to unlock it after someone bought the grill, he came up short.</p>
<p>An inventor by nature — he holds 70 U.S. patents as an electrical and mechanical engineer — and set out to build one of his own. A year later, he started filing patents for the Nymbull lock and now has four issued patents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wegelin, based in Ohio, now has 500 locks and is experimenting with sales on Nymbull’s website, which he expects to launch soon. He is still working on pricing for the locks and item posting. However, he said it will be a subscription model for sellers, while buyers will pay a few dollars for each transaction.</p>
<p>Sellers will be able to put a free hold on items for a certain number of hours and have flexibility to offer more holding time for the buyer to decide on the purchase. For those needing longer, potential buyers can ask for a day or two hold by paying a few dollars.</p>
<p>As he was testing out the locking system, one of the most common questions he received was how to lock up an item of clothing, like a shirt. He tested out methods of looping the lock through the sleeves and a hanger that he hung on an over-the-door hook. Other sellers have gotten creative with drilling holes in plastic containers that can be locked to a fence, Wegelin said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he wants Nymbull to be the mediator between buyer and seller so that items can be safely purchased and sold without either party having to interact at all if it is not needed, Wegelin said.</p>
<p>“The lock keeps people honest and helps buyers see what they are paying for it,” he added. “There are lots of opportunities where we can take this, such as food pick-up, medication delivery or unattended pick-ups.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, Latin America has been covered heavily in the international news as the COVID-19 pandemic led many to question our endurance in the face of a crisis. But the region’s mega-fundraising rounds and shiny new unicorns have countered with optimism around its budding tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>When we first shared LatAm&#8217;s digital acceleration story in last year’s <a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report">Latin America Digital Transformation Report</a>, we believed we were at the peak of digital growth catalyzed by the pandemic. E-commerce penetration was at an all-time high and the market cap of public technology companies was growing much faster than the region’s GDP. But with 2021 came all the second- and third-order effects of the crisis, further accelerating a continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report-2021">In this year&#8217;s report</a>, we dedicate 200 slides of data-rich analysis, primary research, private company data and case studies to tell the story of this “second wave” of change we are witnessing. Ranging from the rapid adoption of sustainable technologies to the welcoming of a new local creator economy, we detail the surprising changes the pandemic has brought to consumer preferences, workplace dynamics, business models and the geopolitical influence on the fast-changing tech sector.</p>
<p>An initial top-down view paints a clear picture of a region at an inflection point. The Atlantico Digital Transformation Index, which measures tech penetration by tracking the value of public technology companies as a percentage of GDP, rose to 3.4% in 2021 from 2.3% in 2020 for LatAm as of August.</p>

<p>Similarly, based on an internal analysis of private company data, we estimate that the value of regional unicorns reached $105 billion, more than double last year’s figure of $46 billion. Eight new unicorns have already been minted this year, nearly reaching 2020’s rate by midyear.</p>

<p>Much has been written about Latin American fintechs, which last year drew 40% of the region’s venture capital investment. The revolution witnessed over the last five years, which produced the likes of Nubank (the world’s largest digital bank), was sparked by a mix of changing consumer demands, a concentrated banking sector and a pro-innovation regulatory environment. We are now seeing the second-order effects of the fintech boom, as the same set of conditions arise in other soon-to-be disrupted sectors.</p>
<p>In the insurance space, similar changes are giving way to innovative models like <a href="https://www.180s.com.br/">180<sup>o</sup></a> in Brazil and <a href="https://gobetterfly.com/en/">Betterfly</a> in Chile. The former, founded by prior Nubankers, takes embedded insurance to the max, pioneering an insurance-as-a-service model that enables any company to create bespoke insurance products for its customers and seamlessly integrate them into their core experience. In the case of Betterfly, we see the rise of a novel benefits platform that lets companies offer a life insurance product that rewards healthy habits and charitable donations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Canva co-founder Melanie Perkins at Disrupt 2021 to talk about how she has approached fundraising, and how she's managed to grow Canva's free and paid user base at a rapid clip.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design software startup Canva has been making news of late. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">just raised $200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a>, and co-founders Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht gave the vast majority of their equity (around $13 billion) to charity through the Canva Foundation.</p>
<p>We sat down with Perkins at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to talk about how she has approached fundraising, what she&#8217;s looking for in a potential acquisition, how she&#8217;s managed to grow Canva&#8217;s free and paid user base at a rapid clip, and what it actually means to be a &#8220;mission-driven company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation kicked off with Perkins charitable donation. She clarified that her and Obrecht&#8217;s $13 billion-ish give-back was the vast majority of their equity in the company, around 30%. This is a relatively big chunk of equity for growth-stage founders who have raised so many rounds, but Perkins explained how the company has tackled fundraising with a focus on preserving equity.</p>
<blockquote><p>With early-stage startups, it was very common that you had to raise a 20% to 25% round. We&#8217;ve had a very different approach. We&#8217;ve raised in the early stages. We couldn&#8217;t really be that selective about investors. But investors were very selective about who actually believed in our vision. So it worked out well. But in the time since, we&#8217;ve done many rounds. Now, we do a much smaller round at the next value inflection point.</p>
<p>We know, or we hope, that Canva is going to continue to grow rapidly in the right direction. So the valuation today is obviously going to be much smaller than the valuation over the years to come. Rather than taking like a 15% to 25% hit in one single round, which means that you can only do a few rounds over the course of a company&#8217;s lifetime, we&#8217;ve done much smaller incremental rounds. This has meant that, because we knew that we were wanting to build a big company, we didn&#8217;t overcapitalize or overdilute in the early stages. And so we&#8217;ve done many, many rounds, that are much smaller amounts, comparative to the size of the round.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, more than 100,000 people in the United States wait for an organ donation. More than a dozen people will die each day still waiting. Such is the brutal math and the necessary optimism required to work in the organ procurement world.</p>
<p>For the past several decades, a private network of now 57 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) have sprouted up, all broadly affiliated with <a href="https://unos.org">UNOS</a>, the United Network for Organ Sharing, a non-profit whose goal is to match donated organs with potential recipients.</p>
<p>It’s a unique facet of the medical world, and also one that is surprisingly more like a tech startup than might first meet the eye. From early beta products to a much more professional and modern tech stack, the network and its affiliates have strived to improve the speed and reliability of the organ transplantation process.</p>
<p>I wanted to look at some of the organization’s most recent initiatives, including improved logistics and planning infrastructure, while also exploring some of the more science fiction projects: xenotransplantation, drone-delivery systems, and organ viability platforms. So I interviewed a number of folks at both UNOS and two OPOs to hear what’s cutting edge, and what remains a dream for the future.</p>
<h2 id="A guy with a phone number">A guy with a phone number</h2>
<p>Joel Newman, senior communications strategist at UNOS, where he has worked nearly three decades, said that “transplantation has always been unique in the sense that everybody&#8217;s got to collaborate and communicate in real time — not always with people they know.” Perhaps surprisingly given the life-and-death stakes of organ transplantation, “a lot of those arrangements were shockingly informal.”</p>
<p>In fact, they were so informal in the early years, that matching donors to recipients was operated out of a voicemail inbox.</p>
<p>Howard Nathan, the current president of organ procurement organization Gift of Life (and the longest serving president of any OPO, having taken the role in 1984), said that one man, Don Denny, ran much of the collaboration infrastructure in the early years as organ transplantation became more viable in the 1980s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Denny, who moved to Pittsburgh in 1977, created his own status system for patients from one to four, with one indicating the most urgent organ needs (the rating system is the opposite today). “He’d record every day this message” on his voicemail, Nathan described, “and you listened to this recording.” From there, “you’d look at your donor in the ICU where you had permission from the family, and if it’s a match, you’d call.” Nathan says that Denny coordinated 2,700 transplants over 4.5 years, all from his recorded voicemails and phone calls.</p>
<p>UNOS was formed in 1977 and eventually incorporated in 1984. By 1986, it had developed more computerized systems to handle the organ matching process, using the latest communications technology: faxes. Rick Hasz, who is today vice president of clinical services at Gift of Life and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gift-of-life-president-and-ceo-howard-m-nathan-to-step-down-richard-d-hasz-jr-named-as-successor-to-lead-nations-top-organ-procurement-organization-301319585.html">will succeed Nathan as president in 2022</a>, said that the technology wasn’t all that reliable. “When I started we had thermal paper faxes,” he said. “If you didn’t allocate quickly, then that thermal paper dissolved and you’d lose the list.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, UNOS has continued to evolve its technology over time with the needs of organ donors, donor hospitals, organ recipients, and transplantation centers. It relies on a web-based application, and even has a mobile app now.</p>
<p>Amy Putnam, director of IT customer advocacy at UNOS, said that one big breakthrough came with a mobile app to reduce errors. “Back in 2012, we worked on a change called <a href="https://unos.org/technology/transnet/">TransNet</a>, and TransNet is a mobile application, it&#8217;s built on iOS and Android, that allows the OPOs to electronically package and label organs,” she said. “As you can imagine at three in the morning, most people&#8217;s handwriting is not very legible, and you end up with a lot of data entry errors, and that&#8217;s where TransNet really helped.”</p>
<p>The real gain of building the system though was being able to work collaboratively with all of the organization’s OPO affiliates and refine processes based on feedback from all of its users.</p>

<p>Calls and communications are key for coordinating transplantations. Organ donations are typically sudden, can happen almost anywhere, and OPOs have just hours to get the organ from the donor hospital into a recipient patient at a transplant center. Not only that, but which patient waiting on a list has to be determined with extreme speed, with potentially dozens of transplant centers interested in a particular organ. Processing all those requests, in real-time, is the huge emphasis of UNOS’ modern tech stack.</p>
<p>Newman explained some of the intricate work that is involved. “Kidneys can often be transplanted within about 24 hours. Once they are recovered, obviously shorter is better and probably most of them go in 12 hours or less,” he said. “When you&#8217;re looking at livers and pancreas, it&#8217;s probably ideally less than eight hours. Hearts and lungs go down to about four to six hours.” The time that an organ is viable after losing blood supply is known as the ischemic time.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, UNOS has developed much more elaborate tracking systems to understand where organs are. Julie Kemink, chief clinical officer at LifeSource, an OPO, said that “what you see now is similar to what you might see with an Amazon package… you see that it is shipped… but you don’t necessarily know” where precisely it is, she said.</p>
<p>However, new updates to UNOS’ infrastructure are starting to deliver real-time location information for every organ. “Now it’s more like an Uber — you can see where it is physically at all times,” she said.</p>
<p>Adding GPS coordinates for each organ sounds like a simple proposition, but required immense coordination. Since donor hospitals, organ procurement organizations, and transplantation centers are all different entities, defining a universal standard for location was challenging. Furthermore, since organs tend to arrive quite randomly, having the right equipment and trackers on hand in every part of the country proved its own hurdle.</p>
<p>Now with better logistics information, transplant surgeons can get real-time updates on organ arrival times. If an organ is traveling by plane in the cargo hold and the plane arrives at an airport early, doctors can be notified that it’s running ahead of schedule and prep a patient earlier. Similarly, if vehicle traffic is delaying an organ’s arrival, transplant centers can push back a patient’s pre-op procedures.</p>
<p>With more data available, UNOS is now exploring a “travel app” or what Putnam dubbed a kind of “Expedia for organs.” She said, “It allows the OPOs or transplant hospitals to enter in some specific information about the donor hospital [and] the recipient center, and it will give them options, it will show them flight options, it will show them travel time if they&#8217;re going to travel by car.” She said the app, which is entering a pilot phase, could eventually allow organs to be fully ticketed right in the app experience.</p>
<p>That infrastructure is critical, because UNOS has been updating how it defines distance for organs. For decades, the organization and its OPO affiliates used a regional boundary system — organs in, say, Minnesota would be given first to recipients in Minnesota, and then if none could be found, they would be offered to nearby regions and so on.</p>
<p>That was a simple system, but one that could be taken advantage of, particularly by the wealthy. More than a decade ago, a controversy erupted when <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Economy/story?id=7902416&amp;page=1">Steve Jobs received an organ transplant in Tennessee</a>, despite not living in the state. He did so through a process then known as “multiple listing” — for those with the means, a recipient could register on as many regional organ donor waiting lists as possible. If a match was found anywhere nationwide, the recipient could quickly charter a private plane to wherever the organ was and essentially cut the time they waited on a list.</p>
<p>Now, UNOS uses a distance algorithm that’s based on actual radius, and not just arbitrary regional boundaries. That still leads to some incongruities. Kemink of LifeSource, which is the OPO serving the Minneapolis regional area, said that “being in Minnesota — we are in proximity to both coasts… so we do have opportunities to place organs throughout the country.” That’s unlike the options available for the coasts. “In California, getting a heart from New York is basically impossible,” she noted.</p>
<p>In addition to better logistics, UNOS has optimized its platform for integration. “As you could imagine, most people hate having multiple usernames and passwords, they hate multiple solutions. So the biggest thing was integration, give us integration,” Putnam said about recent upgrades.</p>
<p>Part of that integration story was adding more ways to upload patient data and imagery files. Now, doctors can “upload and actually see the coronary angiography to see that [a heart] is the right match for a recipient,” Kemink said. That improves decision times on offers, and ultimately increases the viability of an organ transplant.</p>

<p>As organ transplantations have become more frequent — 39,000 were conducted in the United States <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">according to government data</a> — there are increasingly large datasets available to finely tune the network’s allocation strategy and ultimately improve the number of organs that are successfully transplanted.</p>
<p>“Right now, we&#8217;re working on a project to introduce predictive analytics into the organ offer process, and looking at some analytics related to what is the probability of survival if they were to accept this organ,” Putnam said. If they decline an organ, then “what&#8217;s the probability and the timeframe until they will get a similar or better organ?” UNOS is currently working on a pilot to get feedback from its clients on these changes, and also ensure that the explainability of the algorithm is extremely clear given the highly sensitive nature of organ donations.</p>
<p>The network has also been piloting since last year a feature it dubs “offer filters,” which transplant centers can upload to the network’s platform to automate more decision around potential organ matches. Putnam said, “What we did is we looked at kidney acceptance data, historically, and said, ‘Are there offers that we know there&#8217;s no way a transplant center would ever accept?’”</p>
<p>Newman of UNOS said that “there have always been some screening criteria that centers could put in, but this allows actually a little bit more filtering of, ‘You know it&#8217;s not like I would never accept a donor older than 70 years old, but if it&#8217;s gonna be a donor older than 70 years old <i>and</i> it&#8217;s gonna take more than six hours to get here, I’m not interested.” UNOS expects a national rollout sometime later this year.</p>
<h2 id="The future of organ donations">The future of organ donations</h2>
<p>As critically important as the organ procurement process is, much of the gains the past decade have ultimately been a function of better IT applications and implementations. The big question a lot of startup founders and venture capitalists are interested in is the viability of “moonshot” ideas that can radically change organ availability for patients in need.</p>
<p>One project, using drones to deliver organs, has already been trialed. Nathan of Gift of Life said that “right now, the drone thing has been done — they’ve done one case” and also noted that “there is another group in Maryland that is experimenting with it too.” He’s somewhat skeptical about the technology given the distances organs have to travel (potentially hundreds of miles) and the potential for damage to the organ itself. “You don’t want to put the organ at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Then there are a set of technologies including cryogenics and warm profusion which are designed to increase ischemic time (or eliminate it entirely), giving organ procurement organizations more time to get organs to the patients most in need of them. Several devices and systems are running through FDA trials now, and are expected to arrive and be put into practice over the course of the next decade.</p>
<p>Kemink of LifeSource pointed to blood-type matching and age as two criteria that could improve organ distribution with better organ viability technologies. “AB blood type is the most uncommon blood type, so there aren’t that many patients who are waiting for that blood type,” she said. At any given time, “there might not be a recipient that fits,” and so cryogenics could keep the organ “on ice” until the right patient shows up who needs it. Similarly, donated organs need to match the size required by the recipient. “You can’t take a heart from a 12-year-old and put it in a 70-year-old,” she said, since the sizes wouldn’t match the bodies. “We could preserve it until the person that needs it is there … that would be another tremendous advancement.”</p>
<p>There have also been advances in procuring organs from patients who die from circulatory death, in what are known as DCDs, or donations after circulatory death. Nathan said “there are 2.8 million people who die every year in this country, [and] only about 20,000 of those people are medically suitable to be an organ donor.” That’s one reason there is a huge wait time for organs.</p>
<p>Hasz noted that advances for procuring organs in these contexts have increased the likelihood that viable organs could be found. “Up until the last couple of years, nothing really changed: it was quite limited to liver and kidneys,” he said. But “in the past few years, the opportunity of helping more people with heart and lung transplants” arose, and “200 hearts have been used.” Ultimately with these new technologies, “we think it can expand the donor pool by 30% for DCD hearts.”</p>
<p>Finally, we get to what is known as xenotransplantation, or moving organs from animals to humans. Such experiments have gone on for decades, and progress has been somewhat elusive. Hasz said “10-15 years is always what you hear about xenotransplantation.” That said, he notes that new technologies like CRISPR have allowed for more progress in the space in recent years, potentially opening a pathway for animal organs to solve the shortage of human organs available.</p>
<p>For all the changes and new technologies though, the basic equation of organs in the United States remains the same: people need to check yes in order for lives to be saved. “The biggest thing that we need is more people to say yes to donations,” Kemink said. “Nobody gets a transplant unless people say yes to donation.” Today, roughly half of Americans are organ donors, and solving that isn’t about technology so much as about reminding people of the power of life — and what they can offer others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of vertical farming has seen a massive uptick in interest over the past decade, as the world grapples with concerns over resource use, farmable area and exploding population growth. While promising, there are still plenty of question marks surrounding the technology, including the diversity of crops one can grow indoors at scale.</p>
<p>Newark, New Jersey-based AeroFarms is one of the U.S. leaders in the space, finding its most success in the world of microgreens. It’s a bit of a produce department niche, but it commands high prices and allows for quick turnover in the farming facilities.</p>
<p>Brewer Goose Island’s U.K. division this week announced that it’s collaborating with the startup on a Session IPA called Hail Hydro. The name (apparently Hooked on &#8216;Ponics was taken) is a nod to the use of hydroponics (though, as the company’s name implies, it actually primarily specializes in aeroponics) for growing the beer’s hops. The hops are being grown in AeroFarm’s Newark facility, with a process it claims can yield 390 times greater productivity per year, with as much as 95% less water use.</p>
<p>Is the partnership a bit of a gimmick? Kind of, yeah. More than anything, it’s a nice bit of marketing for both companies and a demonstration that the technology can be used for more than just microgreens. The back of the cans note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Celebrate the super-human efforts of our partner AeroFarms who is fighting climate change by growing hops indoors with no pesticides using their vertical farming for elevated resilience and flavor.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s also a QR code for a virtual “tour” of the AeroFarms facilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor discussed their $28 billion merger, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">announced last December</a>, a deal the Department of Justice signed off on this summer but that shareholders still seem to be second-guessing. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At least, they aren&#8217;t convinced of the value that Slack brings to Salesforce if one uses as a barometer the performance of Salesforce&#8217;s shares — they&#8217;re valued roughly where they were a year ago.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I think Microsoft believes that in order to kill Slack, they&#8217;re going to have to kill Zoom first.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Taylor, perhaps naturally, sounded unconcerned, suggesting that major acquisitions can take time to digest. &#8220;When we do acquisitions, just by the way we finance them, it often takes us a handful of quarters for our shareholders to really understand the strategic rationale [and] see that we can execute on the integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Taylor&#8217;s point, Salesforce has only in the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/"> last month</a> begun to weave Salesforce features into Slack, whose newest feature, Clips, allows users to record themselves or their screens to send as videos to their colleagues. Users can also &#8220;do speech-to-text and create a transcript of these videos that are indexed for search so they&#8217;re findable later,&#8221; said Butterfield, explaining, as did Taylor, that Slack remains very much focused on asynchronous communications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a>, a company developing a platform to automate stem cell production, presented today at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to detail how its system, which combines A.I. technology, machine learning, hardware, software &#8212; and yes, lasers! &#8212; could eventually democratize access to cell therapies. It aims to bring down costs associated with the manufacturing of human cells, while also increasing yields.</p>
<p>Founded by a team whose backgrounds include physics, stem cell biology, and machine learning, Cellino operates in the regenerative medicine industry. This space is currently undergoing a revolution, where new developments in gene and cell therapies could lead to breakthrough cures for a number of leading diseases. For example, the use of personalized human retinal cells <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31854278/">could be transplanted</a> to halt or reverse age-related macular degeneration, which can cause blindness. But today, such cell therapies are out of reach for most people because the process of cell production hasn&#8217;t been automated or made scalable and efficient.</p>
<p>Instead, human cells being used now in these clinical trials are mostly being made by hand by scientists who are looking at cells and evaluating &#8212; using their many years of training and expertise &#8212; which cells are low quality and need to be removed. They then scrape away those unwanted cells with a pipette tip. The process, as you can imagine, is time-consuming and produces only a small yield. In this manual process, you&#8217;d see a yield of about 10% to 20% of cells that would be able to pass the final quality assurance tests required for human transplant.</p>
<p>Cellino is working to improve this process in order to produce more cells of higher quality. Its goal is to push the yield to at least 80% over the next three years.</p>
<p>To do so, Cellino&#8217;s system is automating all the human steps in the production process using machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>To identify which cells are high quality or low quality, the company is collecting large training data sets where it&#8217;s teaching algorithms to make determinations about cell quality based on a variety of factors. This includes the cell morphology &#8212; meaning, the shape, size, and density of cells. Fluorescence-based surface markers can also be used to identify other factors of importance to the line of cells being produced, like the location of proteins on the cell, for example.</p>
<p>By using machine learning and AI to do the identification based on standard and well-accepted biological assays used by the FDA, the system could move away from human annotation and the variability that introduces into the process of human cell production.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Cellino&#8217;s software has identified which low-quality cells need to be removed, it then uses a laser to target them. The laser creates large enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation">cavitation</a> bubbles to kill the cell, but it&#8217;s done in a highly localized way where you&#8217;re not harming the neighboring cells, as thermal heat does not dissipate to the nearby cells. This is also a more precise technique than the manual method. (Cellino&#8217;s system has a 5-micron resolution, while cells are 10-15 microns in size). This results in a throughput of about 5,000 cells per minute, which is highly efficient compared with manual techniques.</p>
<p>Over time, this automation and efficiency could bring the cost down from nearly a million dollars per patient, which is what clinicians have to pay today to run a clinical trial, when outsourcing cell production. Cellino aims to get the cost down into the tens of thousands of dollars over time.</p>
<p>By scaling cell production, personalized cell therapies could also help a broader range of patients compared with other techniques relying on banks of stem cells. These aren&#8217;t always genetically diverse samples, leaving smaller ethnic groups out of the progress being made in this space. Banked cells also require recipients to take immunosuppressants, as the cells aren&#8217;t your own and the body may reject them.</p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16750848],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614b749f8d2a440b0ac212af" post-id="2206929"></div> </span></p>
<p>The use of lasers is an idea developed by Cellino co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabihasaklayen/">Nabiha Saklayen</a>, who patented an invention in cellular laser editing while at Harvard earning her Ph.D. in Physics. She was encouraged to turn the technology into a startup by her collaborators, who <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/combining-physics-and-biology-lasers-and-machine-learning-for-personalized-medicine/">included</a> had leading biologists like George Church and David Scadden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all scientists become entrepreneurs, and I became an entrepreneur because I had an amazing support network around me,&#8221; notes Saklayen, of the push to join the startup space. She immediately recruited <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinna-madrid-phd-64bb2591/">Marina Madrid,</a> an applied physicist she had worked with for years on the co-invention of laser-based intracellular delivery techniques, as her other co-founder. To gain more mentorship about growing a startup, Saklayen turned to the Boston area startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anything about startups. I wanted to work with people who knew how to build companies, how to commercialize technology, how to build instruments &#8212;  and the Boston ecosystem is fantastic in that way. So I started connecting with lots of people in those early weeks &#8212; anybody that was in the biotech realm or Harvard Business School,&#8221; Saklayen explains.</p>
<p>This led her to Cellino co-founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wagnerm/">Mattias Wagner</a>, who had built companies before in the optics and instrumentation space.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how the founding team came together. It was very complimentary because Marina and I were co-inventors of the original technology that inspired the platform and Mattias brought this tremendous background in semiconductors and optical instrumentation,&#8221; says Saklayen.</p>
<p>Since its 2017 founding, Cellino has gone on to raise <a href="https://www.cellinobio.com/news/cellino-closes-16m-seed-financing-led-by-the-engine-and-khosla-ventures/">$16 million in seed funding</a> in a round co-led by The Engine and Khosla Ventures, with participation from Humboldt Fund and 8VC.</p>
<p>The company is now collaborating with the NIH on compatibility studies. Currently, that means Cellino is making stem cells on its system which it&#8217;s then comparing with the ones made at the NIH that are already being tested in humans for personalized cell therapies for retinal diseases. Cellino later hopes to use its system to address areas like Parkison&#8217;s, muscle disorders, and skin grafts, among others.</p>
<p>The company wanted to present at TechCrunch Disrupt to share more about what it&#8217;s building and to source new talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s about talking about this idea around democratization and industrialization of cell therapies. I really want to get that message out because that is the movement we need to drive over the next decade for all of these cell therapies to be accessible to all patients,&#8221; says Saklayen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cellino&#8217;s angle is also very unique in the sense that, because we have this automated system to manufacture human cells, our system could make cells for every human being &#8212; in this country, in the world,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;And there are a lot of cell therapy approaches that are looking to use off-the-shelf cells and off-the-shelf therapies, which will only work for certain parts of the population. As the U.S. becomes more diverse, ethnically, we need personalized solutions for everybody.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Delila Kidanu grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, mobile money platform M-Pesa was the go-to fintech platform for her and most Kenyans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Safaricom-owned product provides basic access to financial services like sending and receiving money and purchasing airtime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, some Kenyans still lack other digital financial services from savings to investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, people in the country saved up to $13 billion, and more than 70% of them used informal saving groups and cooperatives to do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on her experience, Kidanu teamed up with Alexis Roman and Bubunyo Nyavor last year to start <a href="https://www.withkoa.com/">Koa</a> to help Kenyans save and invest their money better</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is the COO of the company, while Roman and Nyavor act as the CEO and CTO, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Koa is one of 20 companies competing for $100,000 and the Disrupt cup in this week&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, Roman said when the team began market research to understand how Kenyans saved, they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were intrigued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to discover that many people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were dissatisfied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the current traditional saving options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from being offline models, savings with microfinance banks, cooperatives and informal saving groups have manual, expensive and opaque processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was shocking that when we spoke to people, and they told us their experience in their cooperatives and savings groups, we wondered why they aren&#8217;t better alternatives,&#8221; Roman said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;People often use access as a keyword when describing the problem behind how financial services are used. But for us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> access is not the problem; it is how easy or efficient it is to access the service. It was this obvious observation that made us start Koa.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some banks offer savings products to Kenyans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Koa still sees an opportunity because banks are generally a less popular savings destination for an average Kenyan evident in the aforementioned stats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders are banking that it will be different with Koa. Its first product is a savings app that allows consumers to deposit, save and earn interest on their money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When users log into the app, they can begin to create savings goals in different pockets, a replica of what exists offline &#8212; where users would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save across different informal savings groups for various reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite this huge opportunity, Koa has had to battle with two challenges. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, infrastructure, which is a necessity for the company so it can take deposits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kenya, a fintech startup would typically need to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partner with a financial institution. But collaboration between banks and fintech in Kenya is quite exasperating and even lags that of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria, a country <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/a-leaked-bill-for-nigerian-startups-reveals-a-theme-of-licenses-fees-fines-and-sentences/">riddled with its own set of regulatory challenges</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second issue Koa faced was trust, an area in which informal savings groups and cooperatives have excelled by relying on word of mouth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Koa has been able to scale past both challenges. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After securing some partnerships and engaging the necessary regulatory bodies to take deposits, Koa makes it easy for Kenyans to make deposits without having them go through the lengthy traditional KYC process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since beta launching in April 2021, the company has onboarded around 5,000 customers who use its savings product. But w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ith savings being the lowest-hanging fruit for fintech apps, Roman says the plan for Koa is to offer more products along the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Roman sees promise in offering embedded finance and banking-as-a-service tools that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would enable other startups to launch fintech products at a faster pace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And given Koa&#8217;s entry point with savings, Roman believes the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the rails of digital financial services in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately the plan is to become a digital banking platform that offers other services like lending and investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we offer direct to consumer savings apps, we can then turn around and go to other companies to help them offer savings or other financial products to their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They wouldn&#8217;t have to go through all the struggles and burdens through regulatory hoops if we can help them achieve that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the long run, we want to become a digital financial institution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16750848],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614b733b8d2a440b0ac20d97" post-id="2206917"></div> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside savings, Koa also provides financial and educational content for users to help with engagement. Users on the platform have now saved more than $40,000 and Roman says the company is heading toward a double-digit growth week-on-week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in both </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">users and deposits. Koa also recently raised an undisclosed pre-seed investment from angel investors across Africa, Europe and the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Koa, Roman </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led strategy at Helium Health, one of Africa&#8217;s well-funded health tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidanu worked with MEST Africa, a pan-African incubator and accelerator, as well as a business lead. Nyavor, on the other hand, is a serial founder and has led engineering teams at various African tech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m bullish on our team. I&#8217;m </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> excited about working with these people who are all very focused on customers and how we can provide the best experience for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s a differentiator for us in the market,&#8221; said the CEO.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once the darlings of Wall Street and venture capital as recently as the beginning of this year, China’s edtech firms are now wondering if they will be able to remain solvent long enough to see the beginning of the next.</p>
<p>In a series of sweeping regulations, the central government has taken a wrecking ball to an education and test-prep industry worth billions, the collective value of both the schedules and wallets of the country’s urban, middle-class families.</p>
<p>The most impactful <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-07/24/content_5627132.htm">policies</a> were introduced in July, and they include a ban on any for-profit tutoring services focused on the country’s core public school curriculum, oriented around the make-or-break high school and university entrance exams. Limits were also set on the times during which students could attend classes, restricting class schedules to no later than 9pm on weekdays, and allowing only extracurricular courses on weekends.</p>
<p>The regulations have been catastrophic for leading Chinese edtech companies. The stock of New Oriental Education and Technology Group (NYSE: EDU) is down 86% on the year, while that of rival TAL Education Group (NYSE: TAL) has seen over 93% of its value wiped out since hitting its all-time peak as recently as February. As much as 50 to 80% of such firms’ revenue came from tutoring — activities that have now been banned. Their executives are faced with the unpleasant task of turning around billion-dollar Titanics before they sink.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1kGLnSDMfU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/embed/#?secret=1kGLnSDMfU" data-secret="1kGLnSDMfU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though July’s ban on for-profit tutoring has rightly received much of the attention, there has been a consistent deluge of policies meant to restructure what it means to receive an education in the world’s most populous nation. English education, once highly prioritized, is now taking a back seat in the state curriculum, and a <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1230903.shtml%23:~:text=VIPKID%25252C%252520a%252520Chinese%252520one%25252Don,which%252520has%252520banned%252520teachers%252520based">ban</a> on hiring online foreign teachers has left some of the country’s most popular edtech firms wondering how they will survive. In case parents and tutors try to circumvent the rules by working with one another directly, regulators have also outlawed private tutoring online, or at unregistered venues such as hotels, cafes, or private homes.</p>
<p>What we are seeing now is widespread scrambling for all involved: parents re-drafting their plans for their children’s educational futures, educators moving underground, and edtech entrepreneurs trying desperately to overhaul their firms’ business models before burning through their limited time and capital. The economic forces of supply and demand around education have changed little. The question now is how regulation is redirecting those forces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of the seemingly infinite number of idiomatic couplets in the Chinese language, there are few that more consistently apply to discussions of political economy than “上有政策，下有对策 (shàng yǒu zhèng cè , xià yǒu duì cè),” loosely translated as “the rulers make the rules, while their subjects find loopholes.” As recent regulations have turned the country’s education industry on its head, the question so many are asking now is how and where the loopholes can be found.</p>
<h2>The competitive crisis for the children of China</h2>
<p>Though crackdowns, repression, and regulatory overhauls are an ongoing theme throughout today’s China, much of the recent education policy can be understood through the lens of the country’s demographic crisis. In May, the release of 2020’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57067180">census data</a> revealed a birth rate slowdown more severe than even many pessimists anticipated, prompting what appears to be a greater sense of urgency from officials to remove burdens on families and encourage a baby boom.</p>
<p>In an intensely competitive system in which not all children can succeed, and yet are expected to support their parents and often two sets of grandparents into old age, many families have grown to feel trapped, obligated to invest ever-increasing time and money just so their children can keep pace. As a Beijing-based mother surnamed Yi explained, “I am one of millions of parents who has spent so much money for extra training for my child, in the hope that it will help them be outstanding. But the result is that if everyone takes this training, it is not different than before, except that the family has greater financial burden, and the child suffers from greater stress … thus, I support the government’s decision to close these schools.”</p>
<p>China’s demographic crunch also presents the country’s leaders with a potential shortage in vocational and technical skilled labor, threatening the long-term viability of the world’s dominant manufacturing superpower. As education policymakers seek to ease pressure on parents and children fighting to get one of the precious few spots at the country’s elite universities, they also aim to increase the appeal of vocational training and careers through <a href="http://en.moe.gov.cn/documents/laws_policies/201902/t20190214_369281.html">greater emphasis</a> and reform of that oft-overlooked part of the education system.</p>
<h2>Picking up the pieces after edtech’s collapse</h2>
<p>With U.S.-listed edtech giants seeing their value evaporate overnight, the U.S. financial media has understandably focused its questions on the industry’s future. Yet the fates of such firms and their remaining employees still looks rosier than those of others.</p>
<p>For smaller players unable to access a liquidity lifeline to keep themselves afloat, bankruptcy has been the only option. That’s the case with China’s subsidiary of <a href="https://thepienews.com/news/staff-students-owed-millions-wall-street-english-shuts/">Wall Street English</a>, the high-end language-training centers which were once mainstays of Beijing and Shanghai’s upscale shopping malls. Rocked by consecutive shockwaves from the COVID-19 outbreak and travel restrictions that have complicated the recruitment and retention of native English speakers, these new regulations have scared off both customers as well as investors who could provide rescue capital. In the aftermath, the company abruptly closed its doors.</p>
<p>Such a sudden closing can be particularly hard on employees, especially if bankruptcy is involved. In China’s white-collar industries, layoffs can actually be tantamount to a small windfall for an exiting employee due to the country’s labor laws. In most situations, an employee will receive a <a href="https://www.lehmanbrown.com/insights-newsletter/china-labour-law-hiring-firing-china/">severance package</a> equal to one month’s salary, plus a month’s salary for each year that the employee worked for the company. It is not uncommon for companies to offer even more generous packages in an attempt to shed staff expeditiously and with minimal conflict.</p>
<p>Yet when companies face sudden demises, both employees and customers alike are often left holding the bag. For one woman who worked in sales for Wall Street English for over a decade explained, “when the ship is sinking slowly, there are many lifeboats available. But sometimes the boat sinks too quickly to even get in a lifeboat.” In her case, she is hoping her tenure at the company may place her towards the front of the line for a modest payout as the company’s bankruptcy proceedings moves forward. However, she says she will consider herself lucky to even receive the back pay she is owed, as one U.S.-listed edtech firm is rumored to be paying out severance packages worth only 2,000RMB (or roughly $300).</p>
<p>For Western-based educators who had been teaching virtually, confusion seems to be a dominant theme. One British teacher (we’ll call him “Ed”) who had worked for Beijing-based online education startup Whales English, the end came in the form of a roughly three-week whirlwind of anxiety. One of a number of firms who hired freelance overseas teachers to deliver remote English classes to children in China, July’s regulations meant its was no longer legally compliant.</p>
<p>According to Ed’s account of events, the company was continuing to expand, advertise, and hire until July 28, when management announced that they would be suspending all hiring of new teachers. By August 7, teachers were informed that Whales English would be cancelling all new courses, yet those which had already begun and been paid for would be allowed to finish. Teachers were also encouraged to free up as much of their schedules as possible, as parents scrambled to use their pre-paid classes while they still could.</p>
<p>Around this time, Ed says, rumors began to circulate that the company had laid off as much as two thirds of its workforce at its Beijing headquarters, and parents and teachers began to organize contingency plans for circumventing Whales’ online platform, against the company’s wishes. On August 18, Ed and the rest of the teaching staff were informed that all classes were to be immediately suspended, in response to what Ed suspects were updated orders from authorities.</p>
<p>Though frustrated with the company’s inconsistent communication, Ed counts his blessings. He reports that he has received full and timely payment for his work, and has already moved on, having accepted a teaching position at a school in Japan.</p>
<p>In the 14,000-plus member Facebook group for teachers of VIPKid, one of China’s most well-known edtech companies, stories like Ed’s are commonplace. Yet for many teachers, the flexibility and regularity offered by Chinese edtech platforms are not easily replaced. As the pandemic has placed additional childcare pressure on parents, many with education and teaching backgrounds have used these platforms to make ends meet while being able to remain at home with their children and limit their exposure to the virus. Equivalent work may prove difficult to find.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean teachers aren’t trying. Loopholes and inconsistent enforcement are creating a grey market for tutoring and other teaching services, not dissimilar to that of the illegal sex trade or undocumented migrant labor. Demand hasn’t changed, but regulations have forced large corporate entities to avoid direct involvement with such business. Due to this, the trade will move underground and thus workers (in this case, teachers) have little option other than to freelance without protection of the law.</p>
<h2>Parents, the state, and the Chinese Dream</h2>
<p>For parents, responses to the education crackdown have been driven along lines of wealth and class. <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/488174519_161795">Reports</a> have already begun to circulate of in-home “nannies” with teaching skills and qualifications, paid as much as 30,000RMB (roughly $4,600) per month, so as to be officially compliant with regulations while still receiving similar after-school tutoring as before. As always, new loopholes are just waiting to be found.</p>
<p>For many of China’s wealthiest and most well-connected families, the new regulations change little of their plans for their children’s education. For several parents spoken to for this article, circumventing the Chinese education system has long been a primary objective. For some, this has been achievable through acceptance into one of China’s many international schools, whose international baccalaureate (IB) curriculum prepares students for attending university overseas while also avoiding the country’s grueling entrance exams.</p>
<p>For others, success and privilege have afforded them the opportunity to send their children to school abroad. In some cases, this has meant moving themselves and their wealth out as well. “For more and more parents, studying overseas seems to be the best, or only option,” explained a retired executive surnamed Gao, who now lives in the U.S., where her daughter also studies.</p>
<p>From the wealthiest elite to the middle class, there appears to be a shared theme: for parents who came of age during China’s historic economic miracle, both social and economic advancement were not just seen as possible, but expected in order to simply keep pace with one’s peers. And if advancement is expected, stagnation is failure. If stagnation is failure, moving backward is disastrous.</p>
<p>As economic growth slows, Chinese president Xi Jinping calls for “common prosperity,” and vocational and industrial training are emphasized over higher education, some parents are finding that their dreams are at odds with the country’s new strategy. “Despite the state’s broader goal, would it be okay with me if my daughter couldn’t receive higher education? I think the answer is no,” a Shanghai mother surnamed Li shared bluntly. &#8220;The mindset change will take time. Maybe it’s a bit selfish, but it’s true. I’m very supportive of education equality, but only if my kid is one of the lucky ones.”</p>
<p>For all the talk of money, what many parents worry about their children missing out on is something less tangible: “<i>suzhi</i> (素质),” a term loosely translated as “human quality,” encompassing ethics, ambition, education, and social class. For a Beijing teacher surnamed Guo, it is this element that he worries about for his daughter. “I know that society needs vocational workers, and that they can even make more money than those who attend university. But even if she makes less money, I will still want her to attend a university.” To him, the education his child receives and the future salary she will earn are secondary in importance to the social circles she develops. “[Vocational school students] have a reputation for being lazy, for smoking and drinking, and misbehaving. The friends she’ll make in school are friends she’ll have her whole life. I want her to have high-quality friends,” he said.</p>
<p>As China’s regulators overhaul not just education but many of the country’s most central institutions in an attempt to address its most daunting challenges, many are finding that the expectations which they once held must now radically change. Yet amidst all the uncertainty, what is unlikely to change is the drive and ingenuity to advance one’s self, family, and ambitions. After all, the authorities will always have their rules, and the people will always find their loopholes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can take a pregnancy test or colon cancer test from your bathroom, or, these days, a COVID-19 test from the comfort of your living room. You might one day be able to get a breast cancer screening at home, too, if you have a urine sample and an artificial nose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the vision behind <a href="https://www.thebluebox.tech/">The Blue Box</a>, a startup competing this week at TechCrunch Disrupt’s Startup Battlefield. The company, founded by Judit Giró Benet while pursuing her Master’s at the University of California Irvine, is developing an at-home handheld device designed to screen urine samples for breast cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded in January of this year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is in the process of scientifically validating The Blue Box – which includes both hardware and artificial intelligence components. The Blue Box has been awarded equity-free prizes from Argal (€2,000), the 2020 James Dyson Prize (£35,000), a grant from the Tarragona region of Catalonia (€4,000), and a prize for winning the <a href="https://pitch.tech/">pitch.tech</a> competition ($10,000). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benet imagines a product where you might be able to slip a urine sample into an $80 box, have your sample analyzed by a machine learning algorithm (that algorithm is being trained right now), and have test results sent to your phone in about 30 minutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You would have a Blue Box at home and the whole family could use it at home with the frequency your doctor tells you [to],” Benet tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benet says the device is modeled after a series of studies showing that dogs are able to pick up distinctly cancerous smells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, </span><a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/60/6/814.short"><span style="font-weight: 400;">early-stage studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that specially trained Labrador Retrievers can accurately identify early-stage colon cancer in both breath and stool samples. Urine, the particular bodily fluid of interest to The Blue Box, also has proved to be useful for cancer sniffing dogs. In </span><a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.juro.2014.09.099"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, German Shepherds were able to identify prostate cancer patients by sniffing out “volatile organic compounds” present in urine samples. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One June </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230505/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 trial </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on 40 breast cancer patients, 142 patients with non-breast malignant disease, and 18 healthy people found that a trained Labrador Retriever could accurately identify the breast cancer patients’ urine samples 40 out of 40 times in double blind-tests. The authors concluded that a screening method based on detecting compounds in urine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">warranted further study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box is designed to help sniff out breast cancer, sans the dog component. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think of The Blue Box itself as a replacement for the dog, and the AI component as a digital brain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key for The Blue Box will be clinically validating both parts of the equation. Benet declined to share the specific cancer biomarkers that The Blue Box will test urine samples for – though she noted that they are pulled from scientific literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Benet says The Blue Box has a minimum viable hardware product that’s “fully functional.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next piece of the puzzle is training the machine learning algorithm to recognize late state breast cancer. So far, the company reports a 95 percent classification rate for their algorithm on metastatic breast cancer (a very late stage) – which means if can accurately categorize 95 percent of those samples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a first step for the company, but the goal is to be able to detect cancer before it reaches that especially dangerous stage. On that front, The Blue Box is still in the throes of clinical validation. The Blue Box, she says, is currently being studied at University Hospital Joan XXII in Tarragona, Catalonia, and University Hospital Sant Joan in Reus, Catalonia, in a study led out of the University of California, Irvine. So far, they&#8217;ve collected more than 40 urine samples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should The Blue Box be able to prove that their technology can accurately detect early-stage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">breast cancer, there’s evidence that at-home cancer screening tests can gain regulatory approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, </span><a href="https://www.cologuard.com/faq/is-cologuard-fda-approved"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FDA granted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> premarket approval to Cologuard, a prescription stool test that is designed to detect colon cancer in average-risk individuals. For many screening tests, the critical measure of success is sensitivity or the ability of the test to accurately detect a disease when it is present  –  the sensitivity of colorguard for the detection of colon cancer was </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1311194"><span style="font-weight: 400;">92.3 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per a study in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England Journal of Medicine. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To follow in those footsteps The Blue Box would also need to have rigorous clinical data to earn pre-market approval and will have to demonstrate high sensitivity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box is also technically a medical device that delivers oncology-related information, which means it will need to work with the FDA to demonstrate its validity before going to market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a medical device so we will need to go through the FDA and the MDR [the European equivalent of the FDA]. We will start this phase by 2023,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many arguments made in favor of at-home cancer testing is that it could help close a screening gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of colon cancer, fear, whether over the procedure itself or the result, have </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531912/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently been</span></a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946825/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified as barriers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to testing in studies, but other barriers &#8212; cost, lack of insurance or transportation, or skepticism about screening guidelines &#8212; also remain powerful. </span></p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16750848],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614b78e18d2a440b0ac2249a" post-id="2206974"></div> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast cancer screenings, argues Bénet, face some of the same barriers that colonoscopies do. There is room for improvement in terms of screening. In 2019, 76.4 percent of women in the US aged 50 and over had gotten a mammogram in the last two years. This number has remained relatively stable since 1998, per the </span><a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/breast_cancer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Cancer Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though the pandemic also resulted in a </span><a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/CCI.20.00068"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in missed screenings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will likely affect more recent statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135000/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on underserved women found that the largest barriers to obtaining mammograms was fear of cost (even if the service was free, the fear persists), mammogram-related pain, and the fear of receiving bad news. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box, perhaps like Cologuard, seems poised to tackle fears of mammogram-related pain (urine samples are painless). Benet has also thought about the process of receiving the bad news her product might deliver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benet says the company is working on incorporating a “virtual doctor” within The Blue Box app that can communicate with a user once they’ve received a diagnosis. “We will try to train this bot so that it can sense the mental state of the patient,” says Benet. “If she&#8217;s processing the news correctly, if she needs help from a medical professional.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That feature, she says, should be unveiled in the next few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At-home testing isn’t a universal salve to the multifaceted reasons people don’t get cancer screenings. But there is evidence that these at-home tests do reach people who might otherwise forgo a screening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At-home screening tests, for instance, have allowed healthcare systems to mail out tests to people who might otherwise miss an appointment. A </span><a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/covid-19-increases-allure-home-colon-cancer-testshttps://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/covid-19-increases-allure-home-colon-cancer-tests"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 review paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that when people received colon cancer tests by mail, colon cancer screenings went up about 22 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box is still in its early validation phase, but if the company can make a similar dent in the breast cancer screening world, Benet hopes it will lead to more people catching breast cancer during early, critical stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that with The Blue Box we will be able to finally create a change that should have happened many, many years ago,” she says. </span></p>
