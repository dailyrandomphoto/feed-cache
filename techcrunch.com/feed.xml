										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of marketing has become a world of marketing tech. But marketers are not necessarily engineers, so working with the terabytes of data their campaigns produce can be a challenge. Today, a Stockholm startup called <a href="https://funnel.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funnel</a>, which has built a no-code platform to help manage that process, is announcing $66 million in funding, a growth round that underscores the demand in the market for such tools. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Funnel is describing this as a &#8220;pre-IPO&#8221; round: it will be its last before it files to go public, likely in his home market, and likely in the next six to 18 months.</span></p>
<p>Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund (AP4) and Stena Sessan are co-leading the round, with previous backers Balderton Capital, Eight Roads, F-Prime, Oxx, and Industrifonden also participating, among others. Fredrik Skantze, the co-founder and CEO, said the company is not disclosing its valuation but he said it was considerably higher than its pre-money valuation in its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/funnel-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-pandemic $47 million Series B in January 2020</a>.</p>
<p>As a measure of Funnel&#8217;s size, the company has about 1,200 large customers, with about half of them in the U.S. They include brands like Home Depot, trivago, Skechers, Samsung, Vodafone, Logitech, Skyscanner, and SAS – Scandinavian Airlines, as well as Havas Media, a division of the French advertising and PR giant, Ogilvy and DAC Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The challenge that Funnel is tackling is that marketing has become a massively digitized business: although outdoor, print, television and other analogue campaigns still account for 40% of marketing spend, that leaves 60% to digital.</p>
<p>That is a proportion that is still very much on the rise, not least because digital marketing provides a more measurable picture of how well a campaign is doing: people engage and respond on social media; they click on links; they share information to other platforms. The growing ubiquity of digital marketing also means that the data sources that a marketer typically uses are also growing.</p>
<p class="p9">&#8220;Four or five years ago, a marketer typically used seven data sources,&#8221; said Skantze. &#8220;Then that grew to 10. Now, our customers might be using 20 to 30 or even 70 or 80 data sources. If you are active in 50 markets that becomes a complex problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that also poses a data problem. When there are fewer platforms and marketing campaigns running, a marketer has typically relied on using spreadsheets to analyse data, or tools specific to a single campaign. However, that becomes untenable as the data sources grow and as the expectations of what marketers want to get out of that information grow along with it. Working with the data that is produced thus usually requires the help of a data scientist to organise it to be reported in a more usable way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s not enough to simply use the raw data,&#8221; Skantze said. &#8220;Facebook alone has 700 metrics, and the data you will get from a campaign just goes to a data warehouse. So you have to make it business-ready, you have to normalize it. That means using something like SQL. And that means marketers themselves cannot work directly with that funnel of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funnel&#8217;s platform is able to &#8220;read&#8221;, organize and create reports for the various datasets coming out of these campaigns, by way of sets of rules that are pre-designed, or a company can customize for itself. It currently handles some 550 different data sources (from social media platforms to search engines and much more: basically any digital platforms that might be used by a marketer to run a campaign). And it is adding more in as and when customers use them, Skantze said. Through drop-down menus, non-technical marketers can do, he said, &#8220;all the things they would have previously asked an IT person to do, to stage the data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key also is that it&#8217;s focused on marketing, which also sets it apart from other competitors providing low-code tools to help organize data for further business intelligence or reporting applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years ago I would have thought that BI tools would solve this, but the problem is is that they are too horizontal, and cover any type of data, whether it is marketing, geographical, financial or so on. So within<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>marketing it might cover only five data sources, while we have 550,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can’t solve the problem of pulling in the data unless you are vertical in some sort of segment. It&#8217;s the same with snowflake: it has 200 connectors but they are in too many areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funnel&#8217;s future growth may seem all but assured: more online activity breeds more marketing activity, and marketers are being expected to report and provide more, not less, insights about what they do and discover about their customers. On the other hand, the market is evolving. People do not want to be tracked; regulations are coming into force that are making it harder to gather marketing data; there is a growing body of technology that is looking for ways of creating &#8220;synthetic&#8221; datasets that could mean less reliance on pulling data out of marketing campaigns, which could mean less business for the Funnels of the world; and platforms are also changing their tune.</p>
<p>&#8220;The restrictions that Apple has placed on tracking on iOS has had a big impact especially for B2C companies,&#8221; Skantze said. &#8220;They are not seeing the same level of performance as before. It&#8217;s something our customers are concerned with but so far that hasn’t affected us. Our role is to pull down data, so that others can understand it. We are a bit like Switzerland here. We are a step away from the mechanics of adtech.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">Regardless of how that develops, this is a good argument for diversifying to cover more than marketing in its platform.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools in the market today that are also creating ways to better order data troves so that they can be used for better business intelligence. They include Collibra and Acryl and many others. The key with Funnel is that it is presented firmly as a tool for non-technical people, and it has been built with marketing in mind, Skantze noted. That being said, the company has plans to extend beyond marketing over time. &#8220;We are already pulling data for sales teams and e-commerce teams,&#8221; he said, and it is also eyeing up a move into providing data reporting tools for the finance sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pre-IPO&#8221; rounds in the context of this latest fundraise is about bringing in institutional investors who will also be a part of the IPO process.</p>
<p>“We are long term investors who look for companies we like and hold them for a long time. We were impressed with the size of the global opportunity and the team’s ambition to build a large software company,&#8221; said Jannis Kitsakis, senior portfolio manager at AP4, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Funnel has shown strong, predictable growth with impressive go to market metrics and a global footprint,&#8221; added Fredrik Konopik, Investment Director at Stena Sessan. &#8220;We feel that the company is well positioned for the public market in Sweden.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://jow.fr">Jow</a> has raised a $20 million funding round led by Eurazeo. Jow wants to make it easier to cook at home by taking care of menu ideas and helping you manage your online orders of groceries. The company has partnered with national food retailers so that your oder is seamlessly processed by your usual grocery store.</p>
<p>In addition to Eurazeo, existing investors Headline, DST and Stride.VC are also participating in today’s funding round. Founded in 2018, Jow has already raised $1.5 million in October 2018 and $7 million in December 2019.</p>
<p>It’s easier to describe Jow by describing what the service isn’t. Jow isn’t a grocery delivery service. Jow isn’t a food delivery company that lets you pick prepared meals either.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215341" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When you sign up to Jow, you first describe what it’s like at home.&nbsp;How many adults and children are living in your home? Are there any food allergy or specific restrictions? Do you have a microwave oven or a blender?</p>
<p>After that, Jow will recommend some meals for the next week. You can review and customize each meal. For instance, you can replace something if you don’t feel like eating that. You can add or remove people for each meal as well.</p>
<p>Jow automatically generates a list of items to buy to prepare those meals. The startup tries to be as efficient as possible, meaning that you won’t end up with three bottles of olive oil if you need olive oil in three different meals. At the end of the shopping journey, you can add household items, drinks and everything that isn’t on the list already.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t process your order directly. Jow transfers your list of items to a major supermarket near you. You can choose where you want to buy your food. The startup has partnered with the six largest grocery brands in France, Carrefour, Auchan, Intermarché, Leclerc, Monoprix and Chronodrive — this represents over 4,000 stores across the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can connect to your favorite retailer using your existing login information from one of those brands. You can also choose between curbside pickup or home delivery.</p>
<p>Online grocery shopping isn’t new. But the experience hasn’t changed much over the past few years. You have to know what you’re looking for. Items are just sorted in various categories and you get a grid of items in each category.</p>
<p>That’s why it still feels difficult to plan in advance and order online. There are three ways to solve this issue — you can be well prepared and plan your week, you can rely on instant grocery shopping services that promise you deliveries in roughly 15 minutes, or you just avoid the issue entirely by ordering food on Deliveroo, Uber Eats and other food delivery services.</p>
<p>Jow thinks improving meal planning can change how you interact with online grocery shopping services. By removing the complexities, you could end up ordering less on food delivery services, saving money and reducing waste. Preparing a meal at home is always the most environmentally-friendly option.</p>
<p>And it’s a capital-efficient strategy as well. The startup only has 35 employees and doesn’t own any food items. It generates revenue from grocerers.</p>
<p>Overall, Jow users have ordered 20 million meals through the app. Nearly 70% of products in a customer’s basket come from the company’s recipes.</p>
<p>Jow closed its funding round earlier this year and is announcing it today. The company plans to expand to new countries starting with the U.S. It’ll face competition from other meal planning startups, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/kitchenful-combines-meal-planning-with-a-grocery-concierge-service/">Kitchenful</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CarDekho, an Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/03/cardekho-raises-110/">search and e-commerce platform for new and used cars</a>, has become the latest startup in the world’s second-largest market to reach the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old startup said on Wednesday it has raised $250 million &#8212; $200 million in equity and $50 million in debt &#8212; in its Series E financing round. The round, which valued the Jaipur-headquartered firm at $1.2 billion, was led by LeapFrog Investments.</p>
<p>Canyon Partners, Mirae Asset, Franklin Templeton, Harbor Spring Capital as well as existing investors Sequoia Capital India and Sunley House also participated in what CarDekho has described as its pre-IPO round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One of the earliest startups in India, CarDekho has expanded to over 100 markets, it says. The startup, which buys cars from customers and then sells them, offers a catalogue of more than 3,000 certified pre-owned cars for online purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cardekho.com">CarDekho</a> also provides customers with financial services &#8212; the ability to pay in installments &#8212; and insurance coverage on cars they purchase from the platform. It said its financial services business is already profitable, while that of insurance has reached the “breakeven&#8221; point. (The startup says it works with over a dozen financial institutions to provide loans to customers and over three dozen insurance firms.)</p>
<p>It works with almost all automobile makers in India, and contributes 30% of their annual sales. It also works with over 3,500 new auto dealers and over 4,000 used car dealers, traders and entrepreneurs. It said the firm exceeded $100 million revenue run-rate in the last month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217245" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217245" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2217245 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="444" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg?resize=768,333 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg?resize=680,295 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/india-automarket.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217245" class="wp-caption-text">Penetration of e-commerce in automobiles is low compared to other categories. Data and <strong>Image:</strong> Bernstein</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Auto e-commerce generally has low penetration globally, with India and U.S., for example, having a 1% penetration, according to analysts at Bernstein. “This is largely because the auto market still requires physical inspections and the target market skews towards used vehicles &#8212; an unorganized market. The total addressable market in India is around $220 billion, which includes used vehicle purchase by consumers, auctions and remarketing, growth potential for the new vehicles market, and financing and advertisements. The total addressable market for only the used car market in US is over $800 billion,” they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>“CarDekho, from being a car research portal, has evolved to become a complete ecosystem for car buying, lifecycle management and selling,” said Amit Jain, co-founder and chief executive of CarDekho. “We are committed to empowering our customers and providing them with a convenient and hassle-free experience.”</p>
<p>He said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand its used car and financial services businesses. “The trust and conviction of our investors will help us to accelerate our growth plans whilst we provide our customers with an experience that will continue to redefine car buying and selling.”</p>
<p>The startup is also working to expand its catalog to over 10,000 cars in the “near future,” it said.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s announcement adds CarDekho to a list of nearly three dozen other Indian startups that have earned that coveted status this year. Several high-profile investors, including Tiger Global, Sequoia, SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital and Temasek, have increased the pace of their investments in India in recent quarters. (For some context, India has about 50 unicorns now.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Russian tech giant Yandex is expanding its mobility footprint in Israel with the acquisition of shared e-scooter company Wind&#8217;s Israeli operations. The two are not sharing the terms of the deal, but Israeli financial newspaper <a href="https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001386835">Globes reported</a> that it is estimated to have cost $40 million to $50 million.</p>
<p>Wind is one of the top e-scooter sharing operators in Israel, alongside competitors like Lime, Leo and Bird. Yandex has already been operating its Yango mobility platform in the country since 2018, starting with ride-hailing and working up to last-mile delivery and food tech. Acquiring Wind will expand this ecosystem by providing a broad variety of last-mile and transportation solutions, according to Yandex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s conceivable that Yango will make use of the extra vehicles on the ground to expand its delivery services. For example, Yandex recently launched Yango Deli, an express grocery delivery service in Tel Aviv, which relies on a network of dark stores around the city. The company started with 14 dark stores and expects that number to double by the end of November.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216491" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Included in the acquisition is Wind&#8217;s fleet of more than 10,000 made-for-sharing scooters, scooter infrastructure and operation system in Israel, as well as R&amp;D around travel route optimization. Wind, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/wind-mobility-new-hardware/">based in Berlin and Barcelona</a>, will still maintain control of its operations across Europe. In total, the company has raised $72 million in funding. It serves tens of thousands of customers throughout 13 cities in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area and has completed about 4 million trips in total, according to the company.</p>
<p>The Wind acquisition also comes just months after Yandex launched its scooter-sharing platform, called Yandex Go, in Russia. The domestic market fleet is only estimated to be about 5,000 scooters, so this merger will more than double Yandex&#8217;s mark. Customers in Russia will now be able to book scooters from the Wind app, as well as order scooters in Israel from the Yango app.</p>
<p>Yandex is also <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/26/how-yandex-is-expanding-its-autonomous-robot-delivery-service/">testing out its autonomous delivery rovers</a> in Israel, Ann Arbor and South Korea, and says it is ready to start robotic deliveries once it receives the relevant permit from local authorities.</p>
<p>The company also says it wants to bring its robotaxis to the Yango platform in the near future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div>&#8220;We’ve been testing our self-driving cars in and around Tel Aviv since early 2019,&#8221; a Yandex spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Israel provides us with conditions and challenges to test our technology, which we lack in other testing locations. These are, for example, all kinds of roundabouts, myriads of two-wheeled and micromobility vehicles and of course Mediterranean heat and high humidity.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Moscow is not traditionally a bike-friendly city due to the cold weather, but during and after lockdown, last-mile delivery skyrocketed and Moscow streets were flooded with couriers on bicycles, according to Yandex.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Good news — our cars already knew how to deal with it,&#8221; said a Yandex spokesperson. &#8220;Tel Aviv experience helped us a lot in Moscow during the COVID period.&#8221;</div>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 12, 2021. So far Q4 is cracking good fun. We’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">got IPO filings aplenty</a> and, as you will see below, more startup news than you can shake a stick at. Heck, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/apple-is-going-unleashed-for-an-october-18-event/">has <em>another</em> event coming</a>. So much for a fourth-quarter slowdown, yeah? – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">Coinbase gets in on the NFT game:</a> </strong>Early crypto-marketplace pioneer Coinbase is following smaller rivals into the non-fungible token (NFT) game. NFTs have seen their popularity rise in recent months as speculation concerning blockchain-specific ownership signatures for digital images has spiked. Folks are hype for JPGs, as they say, and Coinbase, which generates the vast bulk of its revenues from transactions, doesn’t want OpenSea to win the NFT market. Ironically, Coinbase was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">famously backed by a16z</a>, which is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">an investor in OpenSea</a>. That’s spicy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/venture-capital-is-going-to-need-a-record-breaking-run-of-ipos-to-clear-its-own-decks/">The unicorn traffic jam is only getting gnarlier:</a></strong> New data concerning the Q3 venture capital market makes it clear that there’s more capital than ever pouring into global startups. One result of the financial deluge is that more unicorns are being born than ever. And that’s leading to an ever-longer jam of yet-private unicorns in need of eventual exits. TechCrunch dug into what could go wrong.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/memberful-a-patreon-subsidiary-launches-a-newsletter-product-to-challenge-substack/">Soon all blogs will be newsletters:</a> </strong>The success of Substack in creating a better-known paid-newsletter economy continues to attract rivals. This time it’s Memberful, a Patreon product. In contrast to Substack, Memberful will take a smaller cut of writer revenues, which will balance out with a flat-fee structure. For folks with a following, the savings could add up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p><strong>Our leading startup story today is news that Indian neobank </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-and-temasek-back-indian-neobank-open-in-100-million-fundraise/"><strong>Open has raised new capital, partially from Google</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Any large market with rising digital penetration and a population that isn’t fully banked will be fertile ground for neobanking startups. India appears to be one such market, if recent fundraising results from Open are any indicator. It just put away $100 million at a $500 million valuation, per TechCrunch reporting. Temasek led the round, which also included funds from Google and Tiger.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/steve-wozniak-privateer-space-company/"><strong>Privateer wants to locate space trash:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Incidentally, “space trash” is also my favorite genre of novel. Regardless, Privateer wants to help locate and map garbage in orbit around the planet. That there’s too much crap flying around the planet is a known fact. Precisely <em>where</em> that detritus is at any given point, however, is less clear.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/hailo-raises-136m-ai-chips/"><strong>Big bucks for AI chips:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The global silicon market may be a hot mess at the moment, but Hailo is not letting that bum it out. The AI-focused chip company just raised $136 million at a valuation that TechCrunch reports is around the $1 billion mark. Different computing workloads perform better on different chip designs, in case you were curious why Intel isn’t crushing the global AI chip market. Just don’t expect the global chip shortage to be over any time soon.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/atomic-aims-to-give-consumers-more-control-over-their-income-with-payroll-connecting-apis/">Atomic is building payroll APIs:</a> </strong>The banking-as-a-service world is hot, and startups are diving into new areas of the financial market to bring more and more of it into the modern era. Atomic is one such startup. Its product helps consumers link their income streams to different services and verify both their employment and pay data.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/sowork-just-convinced-investors-and-tinder-that-virtual-coworking-is-here-to-stay/"><strong>SoWork is betting that virtual co-working is here to stay:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Tired of working from home, alone? SoWork thinks you might be. The virtual co-working startup just raised $15 million. How you feel about virtual hangs may depend a bit on how comfortable you are on long-form audio calls — gamers are already accustomed to this — but it’s neat to see companies like SoWork raise even as some companies begin a slow march back to offices.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/y-combinator-backed-mentalhappy-app-launches-to-make-mental-health-care-accessible/"><strong>MentalHappy wants to take on mental health with targeted groups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Even if you have insurance, getting a therapist is about as much fun as arguing with your insurance company. Perhaps because it often involves precisely that. MentalHappy is a startup that isn’t setting out to solve the therapist shortage &#8212; or the high cost of therapy. Instead, for a low monthly fee, it offers peer support groups. Frankly, I dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/engflow-raises-3-7-million-seed-to-speed-up-compiling-of-large-code-projects/"><strong>EngFlow wants to speed up application compiling:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Look, this <a href="https://xkcd.com/303/">comic</a> wouldn’t exist if compiling code didn’t take a minute. Sadly, EngFlow wants to delete the engineer equivalent of a smoke break by cutting down on compilation lag. And it just raised a few million bucks for its efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/plume-raises-300m-as-it-passes-1-2b-devices-in-35m-homes-using-its-smart-wifi-service/"><strong>Plume’s mesh Wi-FI service raises $300M:</strong></a> Here’s a company that we should have probably noted before today. Plume is “a communications startup that partners with carriers to provide smart mesh Wi-Fi to improve broadband connectivity in homes, and then offers other smart home services on top of that network,” per TechCrunch. And it is now worth some $2.6 billion. Who knew!</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/canva-is-getting-into-video/"><strong>Canva is getting into video</strong></a>.</li>

<h2>Selling into the enterprise: How Slack and other startups get it wrong</h2>
<p>Going up against large enterprise companies may be daunting for a startup, but Scribe CEO and co-founder Jennifer Smith says you’re never too small to start.</p>
<p>Much to their detriment, many early-stage companies wait too long to spin up strategies for competing with industry leaders, she writes. One example: Twelve years after its founding, Slack exited to Salesforce for $27.2 billion.</p>
<p>“The question is, if Slack had considered selling into the enterprise sooner, could it have survived as an independent public company?”</p>

Apple is appealing one modest ruling, and Google is now demanding financial relief from the Fortnite maker.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsIKep-z2dU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>No matter how much I rationalize the new iPhone, I always feel like I’m not fooling anyone. Do I need it? No. Do I want it? Probably. Do I have a plan for how to justify it to my family without triggering a new round of upgrades? There’s where my sales pitch becomes the script I need to debunk when my filmmaker daughter finally checks in with her iPhone 10 with broken screen and cracked glass back.</p>
<p>It’s a well known fact that the new iPhone feels faster, more powerful, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. For about one day. Then it settles into the rhythm of daily life where soon it feels exactly like the one it replaced. Physically, the notch at the top of the 12 Pro Max shrinks in the 13. That’s pretty much it. There’s a lot going on with the camera that’s new, but the hardware changes are in service of the software, not the other way around.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217185" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even so, the details of the new features do not tell the real story of why I must have this 13 Pro Max or whatever the hell it’s called. Techcrunch editor Matthew Panzarino is the one who opened my eyes and eventually my wallet. Apparently every year he goes down the I5 to Disneyland and tests out the new iPhone as he tours the park. This year he combined an interview with two of the Apple engineers with the results of his camera test. The results are stunning.</p>
<p>On this edition of the Gillmor Gang, we handicap how soon we’ll get the 13. None of this is why we’ll jump. Not the professional rack focus pullers of which there are none. After a year of the pandemic, there’s no real percentage in showing off the new phone in meetings we’re still not having. My fundamental problem is that I am still a few months from reaching the one year mark on my Update program. I pay a monthly charge on a 2-year contract but after 1 year I can restart another 2 year contract with the latest phone. Everyone else is tipping over fast as the Gang drools over the supposed leap of innovation. Even now I’m slipping back into so what mode.</p>
<p>But then there’s Matthew&#8217;s video. As his conversation with Apple proves, this is not just about rack focusing. It’s all about anticipating coming into the frame and taking advantage of overscan, which uses extra pixels around the video to smooth out camera jiggle. It’s about adding a layer of sensor to create a depth map that you can control with software to draw the viewer’s eye toward the dramatic focus of the scene. It’s about inculcating the footage with a sense of the intuitive algorithms filmmakers use in sculpting the flow of the scene into a more pleasurable experience.</p>
<p>That’s the real hook of the new tools. It’s not about the professionals getting cheaper, lightweight, more flexible power tools. It’s about giving us, civilians, the tools to silently and subtly create a product that looks better, slicker, smoother, a more excellent version of reality that we will appreciate as we remember not the event, but the experience recorded and enhanced of the event. Matthew’s camera dollies along the Happiest Streets on Earth, and all he had to do was interact with the streetsmarts of the system. When his daughter turned from looking behind her at the camera, the focus gracefully shifted to the rest of the family in front of her.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I brought this up on a Gang livestream recording session, and all hell broke loose. Basically, the consensus was that these incremental advances of Apple’s roadmap did not add up to an important moment in history or progress or just plain new cool stuff. I thought the impact on professional filmmaking might be less significant than others did. I thought back to my time in film school, first at Brandeis and later at California Institute of the Arts. I had gone to Cal Arts because of the presence of its dean, classic comedy director Alexander (Sandy) Mackendrick of The Man In the White Suit fame. He had worked his way up in the business as a writer, and in his class at Cal Arts produced a set of notes and principles of dramatic writing he later published as a book. But the blend of English filmmaking with its never-a-missed-step precision and the popular comedies of Ealing Studios was catnip for a 21 year old who had just missed the shutdown of Hollywood’s Golden Age.</p>
<p>Cal Arts was a complete cluster of an improvisation, funded by the Disneys but commandeered by the radicals and misfits of the Golden Age of gonzo experimentalism, aka the Sixties. In the first year of its existence, we lounged naked around the pool at the earthquake-damaged campus of Villa Cabrini in downtown LA. 10 blocks away stood the Bradbury Building, where ‘40s detectives rode the gilded-caged elevators in hundreds of films and then television shows.The backlots were further West, in the process of being sold off for real estate development projects. As the Seventies neared, power was shifting to the music business in the wake of the Beatles’ overthrow of production, songwriting, graphic design, and the studio system in general.</p>
<p>In its first official year, Cal Arts relocated to the still under construction campus in Valencia at the upper end of the Valley. A concrete fortress at the top of a hill, the school felt much more like a trade school for burgeoning animators than the dialectic political stew of the students and their professors. In 1968, Jean-Luc Godard filmed the Rolling Stones during recording sessions for their Beggars Banquet album. As Godard’s crew dollies slowly around Olympic Studios, a song begins to take shape as the Stones’ founder Brian Jones disintegrates in the corner behind a baffle. Sympathy for the Devil documents the Stones’ recording process as it occurs, morphing from an acoustic folk song to a rhythmic samba punctuated by overdubs where Jones, Wyman, Watts, and studio denizens chant &#8220;wooo wooo&#8221; as a response to the lyric Who Killed the Kennedys.</p>
<p>Out of chaos comes beauty and power, staring insolently in the face of death, drugs, and dissolution. The pathetic image of Jones slumped over an unmixed acoustic guitar speaks volumes to the way the rock culture eats its young. A film performance of the track a few months later in the Stones’ Rock and Roll Circus reveals Jones playing maracas front and center in the live mix to great effect. His last public performance before his death at the bottom of his swimming pool, the alchemy that manifested itself in the early Stones proved more resilient than the players themselves. Years later, a live performance in St. Louis was the first without Charlie Watts and with session drummer Steve Jordan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vertical farms usually look up. Aerofarms, Plenty, Gotham Greens — these companies are trying to revolutionize agriculture by looking toward the sky, with tall warehouses full of growing equipment extending upward. But Philippe Labrie is looking down. Labrie is the CEO and founder of the pre-seed startup <a href="https://www.greenforges.com/">GreenForges</a>, an underground farming company founded in 2019 looking to take vertical farming technology underneath buildings. Earlier in his career, Labrie thought he, too, would be looking to the sky for farming potential with rooftop greenhouses. But he found that the sky does, in fact, have a limit.</p>
<p>“I stumbled upon a paper that was analyzing how much food production capacity can we do in cities using rooftop greenhouses,” he said. “It&#8217;s a relatively low number; we&#8217;re talking 2 to 5% range for the cities of 2050. No one was asking the question, ‘Can we grow underground?’”</p>
<p>Agriculture has always been a business fueled and restricted by space. When agriculture <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/07/15/485722228/where-did-agriculture-begin-oh-boy-its-complicated">first emerged around 12,000 years ago</a>, farmers had to clear forests for cropland. That destructive process has continued to this<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/02/revealed-amazon-deforestation-driven-global-greed-meat-brazil"> very day</a>. In order for farmers to grow more food and make more money, they need more land. Traditional vertical farming tried to solve this land conversion issue by moving farms to urban environments and stacking the crops on top of each other. But the warehouses still have to sit somewhere. GreenForges is trying to take advantage of space that would otherwise go unused, under our feet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After two years of research and development, the company is planning its first pilot underground farm system north of Montreal in spring 2022 with <a href="https://zoneagtech.ca/en/">Zone Agtech,</a> an incubator for agricultural technologies. The company’s farming system will use existing controlled indoor agriculture technology, including controlled LED lighting, hydroponic growing (growing without soil) and climate controls for humidity and temperature but with a novel approach.</p>
<p>Instead of taking over large warehouses, GreenForges will drill 40-inch-diameter holes into the ground underneath new buildings and lower the equipment into the hole. Maintenance and harvesting will be done by mechanically pulling the crops up to the surface where a human can fix or pick. The pilot program will place the farms 15 meters deep, but GreenForges has plans and models for farms up to 30 meters deep.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216941" style="width: 1347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216941" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2216941 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg" alt="GreenForges shows how its basement vertical farms will be mechanically pulled to the surface so customers can pick the leafy greens easily above ground." width="1337" height="752" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/basement-greenforges3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1337px) 100vw, 1337px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216941" class="wp-caption-text">GreenForges shows how its basement vertical farms will be mechanically pulled to the surface so customers can pick the leafy greens easily above ground. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GreenForges</p></div></p>
<p>According to Labrie, moving the vertical farms from above ground to below comes with a host of other benefits, some directly solving the largest obstacle controlled environment agriculture farming faces — <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/indoor-soilless-farming-phase-i-examining-the-industry-and-impacts-of-controlled-environment-agriculture">energy costs</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“For surface vertical farms, one of their biggest energy loads is constantly having to work that HVAC system because the exterior temperature is changing — hot, cold, wet, dry. They have to work it really hard just to keep the environment [inside] stable,” Labrie said.</p>
<p>Energy costs have made vertical farming more costly in terms of both emissions and dollars in some locations <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/indoor-soilless-farming-phase-i-examining-the-industry-and-impacts-of-controlled-environment-agriculture">when compared </a>to traditional farming. And it’s one of the main reasons many vertical farms stick to leafy greens; it’s just too energy-intensive to make growing anything else profitable. But going underground could immediately eliminate the challenge of maintaining a stable environment inside, while a changing one exists outside.</p>
<p>“The moment you go underground, now you become season-agnostic,” said Jamil Madanat, engineering manager at GreenForges. “This is where the holy grail of energy savings is going to take place.”</p>
<p>Madanat explained that anywhere in the world, no matter the time of year or environment, temperatures stabilize underground. In Malaysia, it stabilizes at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Temperature-variation-of-underground-soil-with-depth-for-typical-days-in-Malaysia-15_fig3_256838899">10 meters deep to 20 degrees Celsius</a>. In Canada, at 5 meters deep, the temperature stabilizes to <a href="https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/ft/?id=386ddf88-fe8d-45dd-aabb-0a55be826f3f">10 degrees Celsius</a> no matter the temperature above ground.</p>
<p>“When it comes to electricity or energy supply, the more steady it is, the better your economics work,” Madanat said. “When you have to consume a high amount of energy at once, and then drop it all at once, that&#8217;s not what the grid likes. The grid likes steady supply.”</p>
<p>Having a steady demand for energy because the temperature outside the underground farm is steady creates the potential for massive energy savings and sustainability. GreenForges is also able to do this with lighting by giving half the crops daylight while the other half gets night and alternating them so the energy needed for lighting is always the same.</p>
<p>Additionally, GreenForges is only looking at regions that get most of their energy from renewable electricity, like solar or hydropower, to avoid adding emissions to the environment through burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“It just doesn&#8217;t make sense to grow food indoors by burning stuff,” Labrie said.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2216866,2216870,2216869,2216946,2216864"]</p>
<p>GreenForges predicts that its underground system will increase energy efficiency by 30-40% compared to traditional vertical farms. Currently, the company is sticking with traditional indoor crops like leafy greens, herbs and berries. The company plans to produce about 2,400 heads of lettuce each month for a 100-foot farm, about 14,000 pounds a year. But Labrie hopes that with GreenForges’ increased efficiency, it will be able to graduate to other crops &#8212; even something as elusive and dramatic as wheat &#8212; in the future.</p>
<p>But of course, growing underground doesn’t come without obstacles. According to Madanat, creating growing equipment to fit in a tunnel about the size of two truck tires poses a design challenge. The company has had to create its own hardware solutions to fit and be able to extract the system in such a small space. Humidity is another enemy underground the company is battling.</p>
<p>Unlike vertical farm leaders, Plenty and Aerofarms, GreenForges doesn’t want to become a grocery produce brand. Instead, Labrie is focusing on appealing to the builders of new high-rise hotels or apartment buildings, creating an extra perk of fresh produce for guests or tenants and a new revenue stream.</p>
<p>“We see a lot of potential with integration in buildings. We have interest from hotel companies and real estate developers,” Labrie said. “Integrating food production in buildings is not as easy as it looks. You have to sacrifice very expensive commercial or condo space. And so our solution enables them to monetize their underground space.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The engineering talent war is real. It has been for some time — but with a pandemic that pushed businesses in all industries to focus on e-commerce and virtual products and services, demand for skilled engineers skyrocketed.</p>
<p>In June, more than 365,000 tech jobs in the U.S. were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-31/employers-bow-down-to-tech-workers-in-hottest-job-market">vacant</a>, with software developers, IT support specialists, systems engineers and architects among the most coveted workers by employers.</p>
<p>Yet, we are hiring 10 to 15 engineers a month, far above the industry average. What’s our secret?</p>
<p>First, it’s important to acknowledge that engineers — and most knowledge workers — have choice and bargaining power in today’s job market. An employer needs to not only respect that but take it as an opportunity to create a more attractive workplace — and remain agile long after the hiring tides change.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			You can’t overlook the elephant in the room — money talks. Today, you can’t just offer the standard “competitive salary” — you must do better. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Overall, we have learned that It is much harder to hire top-tier talent than it is to generate revenue. This is one of our guiding principles, and we remind our team of that all the time. It’s incumbent upon everyone in the company to focus their energies on helping us find — and retain — great people. With this commitment in place, we know the rest will take care of itself.</p>
<p>Granted, we are fortunate that cryptocurrency and blockchain have a certain cachet and come with unique engineering needs that will keep the most ambitious engineers challenged and rewarded in their day-to-day work. However, we still had to make concerted efforts to appeal to today’s in-demand engineers. Here are a few ways we are winning the war for engineering talent.</p>
<h2>Have a strong cash position</h2>
<p>You can’t overlook the elephant in the room — money talks. Today, you can’t just offer the standard “competitive salary” — you must do better. We make sure our offers stand out and are hard to turn down. This approach is driven by our strong cash position (yes, we recognize our good fortune).</p>
<p>Ultimately, innovation is our lifeblood, so everything we do is measured with quality and speed before considering cost.</p>
<h2>Review salaries at least every six months</h2>
<p>We don’t review salaries annually; the industry is too fast-paced and competitive for that antiquated approach. At least every six months, we review salary bands across the organization relative to employee performance and market trends and adjust employee compensation on a more flexible, ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>This helps build a meritocratic and less bureaucratic culture and ensures our team reaps the benefits commensurate with their work product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every popular social media platform has opened up a new type of storytelling to a new generation of users, but TikTok&#8217;s impact has perhaps been the swiftest as the short-form video platform&#8217;s user base has quickly swelled past 1 billion users and transformed how social media stars are made.</p>
<p><a href="https://linktr.ee/FourFrontmedia">FourFront</a> is a media startup that&#8217;s looking to define a new type of storytelling on the platform, aiming to popularize a network of individual actors performing scripted short-form serialized stories that feel native to TikTok. Fictionalized storytelling in vlog form is clearly not a new development for social media, but FourFront is hoping that it can capitalize on the discoverability opened up by TikTok&#8217;s For You Page (FYP) to steadily build new audiences.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch that they&#8217;ve raised $1.5 million in seed funding from Bam Ventures, Slow Ventures, BDMI, Alumni Ventures Group and HustleFund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216984" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has a couple dozen characters on TikTok, with a handful racking up several hundreds of thousands of followers. Not all of the characters have been hits, and FourFront&#8217;s team of writers and social media strategists have settled on nine characters who they&#8217;re looking to create an interconnected &#8220;universe&#8221; around where the actors organically cross paths with each other. While FourFront&#8217;s team plans out the character arcs, it&#8217;s on the actors to shoot the videos themselves.</p>
<p>The scripted content is often pretty soap opera-esque, but follows the format of popular videos on the platform; &#8220;watch us confront my sister&#8217;s cheating fiancé LIVE&#8221; implores one video from FourFront&#8217;s most popular character &#8220;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sydneyplus?">Sydney</a>,&#8221; who has nearly 500,000 followers after debuting in June. In addition to helping catch her sister&#8217;s cheating fiancé, Sydney has also discussed the stresses of her roommate breaking her lease early and the lessons she has learned working in customer support for a dating app.</p>
<p>FourFront co-founder Ilan Benjamin tells TechCrunch that his startup isn&#8217;t trying to mislead anyone into thinking that their network of characters are real, noting that their profile bios highlight the fictional nature of the stories and that each of the videos include the #fictional tag. &#8220;We don’t want to confuse audiences or trick them, we want them to be entertained,&#8221; Benjamin says.</p>

<p>Building content for TikTok means catering to the whims of the FYP, which means plenty of viewers are catching characters like Sydney in the middle of their storylines, something that can create storytelling challenges when it comes to balancing the patience of existing fans while capturing the curiosity of new viewers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plot mechanics might be repetitive,&#8221; Benjamin says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a constant balancing act; every video has to stand on its own, and every single video has to be evergreen.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the company is largely focused on building out its network of stars and their audiences while looking to push boundaries in how audiences interact with characters using tech products like conversational AI chatbots and polls to help direct the stories themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup myth goes something like this: You launch a startup in your dorm room, get into Y Combinator, find product-market fit, experience hockey-stick growth, raise some funding and expand the platform. Somehow your revenue hurtles toward $100 million and the company valuation flies to $1 billion. All&#8217;s right with the world.</p>
<p>In reality, though, it&#8217;s never that smooth. While some startups may achieve those milestones, there are usually bumps and full-blown challenges along the way. Mistakes will be made, some quite harmful, and how you react could determine the success or failure of your business.</p>
<p>One company that experienced all that and more is <a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>, an analytics startup that emerged in 2009 to help product teams understand how customers were using their products. While founder Suhail Doshi was interning at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/google-buys-slide-for-182-million-getting-more-serious-about-social-games/">now defunct Max Levchin startup</a> called Slide, he saw the need for product teams to measure how successful their digital tools were.</p>
<p>Doshi cofounded Mixpanel with Tim Trefren, and between 2009 and 2017 he led a company that eventually reached revenue close to $100 million and a valuation of nearly unicorn stature, but at that point it was experiencing problems. It lacked focus, it was losing customers, and many of the customers it had weren&#8217;t terribly pleased with it.</p>
<p>In 2018, after nearly a decade, Doshi <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/mixpanel-amir-movafaghi-ex-twitter-replaces-suhail-doshi-as-ceo.html">decided to take a step back</a> and had his COO take over as he moved into a chairman of the board role. The new CEO began a process of evaluating and eventually charting a course correction, one that would take it back to its core product.</p>
<p>We spoke to current CEO Amir Movafaghi, VP of people and strategy Amy Hsuan and VP of product and design Neil Rahilly to find out how Mixpanel developed, what caused it to lose its way and why it believes it has righted the ship and got the company back to a stable place. (We also asked for comments from founder Doshi to get his perspective, but the company did not respond to that request in a timely manner.) None of it was easy, and it certainly didn&#8217;t follow that seemingly smooth mythological startup journey.</p>
<h2>The early days</h2>
<p>Like any good startup story, this one started on a college campus at the University of Arizona in 2009 where 20-year-old Doshi was a college student. While interning at Slide, he saw a problem around collecting and analyzing product data, one that big companies had the resources to solve but was out of reach for startups like Slide. That&#8217;s always a sweet spot for a software service startup.</p>
<p>To that point, if a company was using an analytics product, it would likely have been something like Google Analytics or Omniture, which were geared toward understanding how people got to your website and what they did after they got there. People who were in charge of digital products had different needs, though. They wanted to see what features people were using, their path through the product, where they got stuck and when it didn&#8217;t work as designed. While both approaches might have had a usability component, the web analytics tools had a specific purpose that really wasn&#8217;t well suited to product teams.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/"> testing</a> last month, Twitter is rolling out a feature to all web users that will let them remove followers without blocking them. This safety feature can be helpful if you want to avoid the repercussions of blocking someone &#8212; if a blocked user navigates to your profile after you block them, Twitter will tell them that they were blocked. But by removing a follower, users can feel more secure about who sees their tweets without blocking them altogether.</p>
<p>Sure, the blocked user might notice that they no longer follow you, but who knows! Maybe they clicked the unfollow button on accident! There&#8217;s some plausible deniability there that a hard block doesn&#8217;t offer.</p>
<p>For years, Twitter users had manufactured this &#8220;soft block&#8221; by swiftly blocking and unblocking a follower, which removes them from your follower list. But now, Twitter is making this its own feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216989" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">rolling out to everyone on the web today<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Nqhhf2q2fo">https://t.co/Nqhhf2q2fo</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1447630725746987013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435323978734841857">tweet</a> about the test that Twitter posted in September, the images indicated that you have to manually scroll through your follower list and find the person you want to remove before you can take them off your followers list. But now, you can also remove a follower by going to their profile, clicking the three-dot icon, and selecting the &#8220;Remove this follower&#8221; option. For particularly popular Twitter users, that makes the feature far more usable.</p>
<p>Unrelated to follower removals, Twitter also announced a test of a feature that would allow users to swipe on their timeline between two different feeds: one that&#8217;s sorted by Twitter&#8217;s algorithm, and one that&#8217;s chronological.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top Tweets first or latest Tweets first? We’re making it easier to switch between the two timelines and know which one you’re scrolling.</p>
<p>Now testing with some of you on iOS: swipe between &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Latest&quot; on the Home tab to choose which Tweets you see first. <a href="https://t.co/LoyAN4cONu">pic.twitter.com/LoyAN4cONu</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1447971179185295364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter already lets users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/twitter-chronological-timeline/">switch between</a> these two feeds, but the test comes at a time when content algorithms are at attention. When the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">testified before the Senate</a> last week, she said that she believes ranking content chronologically can help limit the spread of toxicity, misinformation and violent content on Facebook, which uses an algorithm that promotes content that&#8217;s more likely to spark a reaction. Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1321456610158370817?lang=en">voiced support</a> for users&#8217; ability to choose from multiple algorithms to organize the content they see.</p>
<p>Twitter has been testing and implementing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/twitter-intense-tweet-warning-prompt/">baffling amount</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/twitter-spaces-spark-creator-program/">new features</a> lately. Not everything Twitter tests becomes a permanent fixture, but it used to be a good indication of where the company&#8217;s interests stand. But more recently, Twitter explained its strategy would include far more experimentation than in the past. That means it&#8217;s more ready to shut down projects and features that don&#8217;t work &#8212; something <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">it already did</a> with its Stories feature, called Fleets.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won’t see us stay tied to the things that aren’t working,&#8221; Twitter Head of Consumer Product Kayvon Beykpour <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">said last month</a>, when announcing another large round of new additions. &#8220;We believe that if we’re not winding things down every once in a while, then we’re not taking big enough bets,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waze <a href="https://medium.com/waze/welcome-a-new-era-of-happier-driving-with-headspace-90f539103d09?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">announced</a> today it&#8217;s partnering with meditation app Headspace to roll out a new &#8220;Drive with Headspace&#8221; experience aimed at making commutes less stressful. The navigation app maker says the new integration is meant to help drivers learn how to “find more joy and meaning on the road.” The Headspace experience allows users to choose from five moods, including aware, bright, hopeful, joyful and open.</p>
<p>Drivers will also be able to listen to a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5kzu984CXB3iTmshDvj8He">custom Spotify playlist</a> with music and content from Headspace, which is available through the Waze audio player. Users can also choose to swap out the in-app car icon for a “serene ride in a hot air balloon.” Additionally, the experience offers custom navigation prompts from Headspace’s director of meditation, Eve Lewis Prieto.</p>
<p>“Traffic is the worst. The longer you’re in it, the worse your blood pressure, sleep, back pain, and risk of depression. As more and more people get back into the rhythm of having to commute to school or work, many are finding themselves stuck in traffic again,” Waze said in a <a href="https://medium.com/waze/welcome-a-new-era-of-happier-driving-with-headspace-90f539103d09?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">blog post.</a> “To find a way to help combat the negative effects of traffic and encourage drivers to enjoy their drives, on the heels of World Mental Health Day, we turned to our friends at Headspace.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216957" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Headspace experience is available starting today for a limited time in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Users can activate the experience by tapping “My Waze” to find the new “Drive with Headspace” banner.</p>
<p>Waze has been rolling out numerous driving experiences over the past few years to make its users’ commutes more entertaining. For instance, the company recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waze-with-paw-patrol-voices-sounds-like-a-chill-car-ride/">Paw Patrol</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/waze/drive-your-cares-away-with-fraggle-rock-4637dfa5b36b?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">Fraggle Rock</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/waze/boy-george-is-here-to-guide-your-ride-with-pride-9da03213c3b5?source=collection_home---4------8-----------------------">Pride-themed</a> experiences over the summer. It has also integrated with a number of subscription services, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waze-audible-102500904.html">Audible</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/waze-and-spotify-integration-arrives-on-ios/">Spotify</a>, Pandora, YouTube Music and iHeartRadio to make it easier to navigate while using your favorite apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>, the company behind <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> and <a href="https://twist.com">Twist</a>, has revamped its internal communication product Twist. When I first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/twist-is-slack-without-the-annoying-distractions/">covered</a> Twist, I said it was like Slack without the annoying distractions. With today’s <a href="https://blog.doist.com/twist-async-team-messaging/">redesign</a>, the company is doubling down on that idea. The result is an opinionated tool for internal conversations that should help you focus and keep the team on track.</p>
<p>While Doist started working on Twist way before the coronavirus pandemic, it feels like Twist is more relevant than ever. Over the past couple of years, many teams started working remotely for the first time. Some companies that had a Microsoft 365 subscription started using Microsoft Teams, other companies spent <em>a lot</em> of time in Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>Doist founder Amir Salihefendic thinks those tools don’t work well. He has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/doist-founder-amir-salihefendic-explains-why-his-remote-team-doesnt-try-to-do-everything-in-real-time/">promoting asynchronous communication</a> for years. Slack or Microsoft Teams interrupt you all the time with notifications and chat messages. It’s hard to keep up, especially if you don’t work in the same time zone as the rest of the team. And it’s impossible to have two conversations at the same time in the same channel.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216952" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Twist’s strongest differentiating point with Slack is still there. In Twist, every conversation is a thread. If you want to start a conversation, you click on a channel, such as #design, #ios or #support, and then you start a thread with a title and some body text. After you post a new thread, other users can add comments, react with emojis and you can tag people.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216967" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216967" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216967" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg 2732w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=2048,1256 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Twist-Desktop-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216967" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twist</p></div></p>
<p>If you want to send quick feedback, ask a question to someone specifically or have a private conversation, Twist also lets you send direct messages to other users. But it&#8217;s the equivalent of sending a text message as those conversations are not meant to hold important work conversations.</p>
<p>The interface has been completely redesigned. The product has a cleaner look that helps you focus on what you’re looking at right now. Instead of a three-column layout with channels on the left, a list of threads in the center and the current open thread on the right, Doist has opted for a two-column layout that lets you focus on the current thread.</p>
<p>When you open a thread, it fills up most of the interface so that you can follow conversations better. You don’t get distracted with new comments in other threads as you can’t see the list of other threads.</p>

<p>The inbox view has been redesigned to help you see what you missed when you weren’t looking at Twist. From this view, you can see new content in the threads that you’re following. You can read those threads, add comments and more. Once you think you’re done interacting with a thread, you can mark it as done. Twist moves the thread from your inbox to the &#8220;Done&#8221; view.</p>
<p>Other new features in today’s release include new keyboard shortcuts to help you move from one thread to another and a better search feature. The product costs $5 per user per month if you sign up to a yearly plan. There’s a free option to try out the product, but you can only see one month of comments and messages.</p>

<p>On paper, there’s never been a better time to work out at home. But are these subscriptions actually any good? For example, what’s the experience of Apple Fitness+ actually like?</p>
<p>That’s what I’ve been working on this month: Reviewing Apple Fitness and demonstrating where the experience fails to reach its stride.</p>
<p>This TechCrunch+ exclusive is a more detailed conversation around <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/using-apple-fitness">this article</a>, which you can read on Built for Mars.</p>
<h2>1. The &#8220;jump in&#8221; fallacy</h2>
<p>“It&#8217;s wrong to assume that showing &#8216;options&#8217; quickly is always good UX — this is often under the guise that it&#8217;s allowing the user to &#8216;jump right in.&#8217; There&#8217;s a nuance that&#8217;s seldom considered: Can the user actually engage with all of this content or not? If they wanted to, could they actually use all of these options (or results)?”</p>
<p>This is something I see all the time, and it’s hugely misunderstood. Imagine if you went on Rightmove (or Zillow) and the homepage just showed you a selection of houses all over the world — it’d be useless. It’s rare that someone is looking to relocate anywhere, so instead, their first action is to apply a filter. It’d be wrong for Rightmove to think: &#8220;Well, we’ve shown houses immediately, so it only takes one click to find your dream home.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is essentially what happens with Apple Fitness+ — they show you workouts on the homepage, despite many (if not most) being unsuitable for you, and then don’t provide any obvious means to filter the options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is deepening its investment in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Spaces</a>, the Clubhouse-like audio rooms the social network launched this year.</p>
<p>The company announced the launch of a<a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/verticals/creators/twitter-spaces-spark-program"> new creator program for Spaces on Tuesday</a>. The Spark program is a three-month accelerator that aims to &#8220;discover and reward great Spaces on Twitter with financial, technical, and marketing support.&#8221; Twitter says it&#8217;s open to established Spaces audio shows and untested experiments for the program, inviting creators interested in audio to apply.</p>

<p>today we’re opening the application process for the Twitter Spaces Spark Program</p>
<p>what’s that? it’s an initiative for creators who are excited about the future of social audio <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/4zay8uvao8">pic.twitter.com/4zay8uvao8</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447956725924077583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Since launching Spaces, Twitter has signaled that its audio product isn&#8217;t likely to be just another<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/"> test feature destined for an early retirement</a>. The company expanded ticketed Spaces last month, inviting hosts to monetize audio rooms by selling access to their hosted audio chats. This week, the company added a way for hosts to invite listeners via DM when firing up a Space. It also <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447647870006579204">rolled out a dedicated Spaces tab to more iOS users</a>, with plans to expand further to non-English languages and Android in the works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">we’re working on making it easier to find and join Spaces you love. today starts the rollout of the Spaces Tab to more people in English and iOS first, with other languages and Android coming in the future!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Anyone who gets accepted into the <a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/verticals/creators/twitter-spaces-spark-program">Spark program</a> is expected to run an audio room two times a week for the three-month period. They&#8217;ll be compensated $2,500 a month — a flat rate not dictated by the Space&#8217;s performance — and granted monthly ad credits to boost their show. Anyone who signs on to the program will have the added benefit of getting promoted by Twitter&#8217;s accounts in tweets and discovery features.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize the hard work it takes to create audio content that’s compelling, engaging, and keeps people coming back,&#8221; the company wrote in the Spark program announcement. &#8220;And above all else, we believe in the potential of people’s ideas and the potential of live social audio, and we see an opportunity to help audio content Creators — like you — take off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter users interested in building out a bi-weekly Twitter-backed audio project can apply with the company by October 22. Accepted applicants will get notified by in early November.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most of the people who poured into California during the Gold Rush have been long forgotten.</p>
<p>We remember Levi Strauss, however: Before he and Jacob Davis patented those denim jeans, he sold shovels and other supplies to fortune-seekers.</p>
<p>Today’s banking-as-a-service startups are similarly placed — instead of digging for treasure in the crowded consumer financial services marketplace, BaaS companies offer fintech companies access to APIs, compliance tools and other software needed to move money around.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216880" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In recent weeks, Ryan Lawler has been mapping the landscape of BaaS companies. For his latest report, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/">he studied three different strategies</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey banking as a service</li>
<li>Playing matchmaker between banks and fintechs</li>
<li>Buying a bank to get into BaaS</li>
</ul>
<p>“If you’re looking to spin up a new fintech app or want to add banking, debit cards or other financial services to your existing business, knowing how each of these competitors is positioned to work with customers and bank partners is key,” he writes.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, note-sharing network StuDocu raised a $50 million Series B, but Marnix Broer, the company’s CEO, says he didn’t initially intend to co-found an edtech startup.</p>
<p>“It was more of a project to create a tool that we could use while studying in school,” he writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post that explains how the company scaled up from storing notes on a USB thumb drive to serving more than 15 million users.</p>

<p>Going up against large enterprise companies may be daunting for a startup, but Scribe CEO and co-founder Jennifer Smith says you’re never too small to start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much to their detriment, many early-stage companies wait too long to spin up strategies for competing with industry leaders, she writes. One example: 12 years after its founding, Slack exited to Salesforce for $27.2 billion.</p>
<p>“The question is, if Slack had considered selling into the enterprise sooner, could it have survived as an independent public company?”</p>

<p>In his analysis for The Exchange, he looked at how well NerdWallet has fared during the pandemic, its profitability, growing revenue, “and how the company manages to stay trustworthy, a question that we’ll address through the lens of editorial independence.”</p>

<p>Dave Mullen, a fintech-focused investor with SVB Capital, takes a look at how well leading fintech firms are allocating their mountains of cash.</p>
<p>“There are now a slew of fintech startups approaching or far surpassing $10 billion in value … so we can glean some insight into their capital allocation strategies by considering how they have spent to achieve their position in the ecosystem,” he writes.</p>
<p>In a guest column, he unpacks data from Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Chime, Marqeta and others, offering suggestions to founders in the fintech space.</p>
<p>“Dollars may buy growth, but they can’t guarantee a good business.”</p>

<p>Good news: Businesses of all stripes are digitizing their operations faster than ever before, creating huge advantages for companies that start the work now.</p>
<p>Bad news: Many technical workers are already looking for new jobs, and companies must compete to find the right people who can build robust, secure IT environments.</p>
<p>Managed services providers (MSPs) are filling the gap, and private equity firms are paying attention.</p>
<p>“MSPs have all the ingredients that private equity loves,” write Mike McGill and Kevin Jolley of Cowen and Company, LLC.</p>
<p>“A strong demand trend, low risk of obsolescence, a ‘sticky’ service that attracts long-term customers and high recurring revenues, strong cash flow margins and a relatively ‘asset-light’ business.”</p>

<p>We don’t run many articles that call out mistakes or describe dysfunctional processes; most of us have a fairly good handle on what’s going wrong at any given moment, so we focus on solutions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, growth marketer Jonathan Martinez shared a guest post with strategies for tackling these endemic issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low testing velocity</li>
<li>Reliance on incorrect measurements</li>
<li>Focusing only on top-of-funnel traffic</li>
<li>Lack of incrementality</li>
<li>Insufficient product-growth integration</li>

<p>Global venture capital is flowing so freely, there are unicorn herds in more regions than ever before.</p>
<p>“Which, in turn, boosts the scale of unexited private-market value that will eventually need to exit,” writes Alex Wilhelm in this morning’s The Exchange.</p>
<p>“And with some U.S. tech giants limiting acquisitions as a way of playing defense against antitrust concerns, there is an implicit expectation that the IPO market will eventually have to make room for a stampede of unicorn debuts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce">readying the launch</a> of an NFT marketplace that will compete with existing major players in the space, like OpenSea, debuting a user <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce">waitlist</a> for the desktop product that it hopes to launch by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Coinbase has limited details to share on its upcoming platform, but notes in a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72">blog</a> post that they hope to more deeply integrate social features into the platform. &#8220;<span class="il">Coinbase</span> NFT will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. We’re making NFTs more accessible by building intuitive interfaces that put the complexity behind the scenes. We’re adding social features that open new avenues for conversation &amp; discovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as Bitcoin inches closer to the all-time high it was flirting with when the Coinbase direct listing occurred, Coinbase&#8217;s stock has still failed to keep pace with the rebounding growth of some of the most popular coins in the space, now down some 27% since its direct listing in April. The exchange simultaneously has regulators breathing down their neck, with the SEC recently threatening to sue the company over their Lend yields product, of which they later canceled the launch. Coinbase is also dealing with a crowded competitive landscape stateside for buying and selling crypto as exchanges like Robinhood build out deeper support for crypto.<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216908" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="633" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png 5216w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=1536,950 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=2048,1267 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinbasenft3.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216849" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CoinbaseCoinbase NFT could open up a major revenue source to the now-public company, assuming that NFTs continue to court investor interest from those looking for high-priced digital collectibles and art. After spiking earlier this year and again in August, the NFT market is showing more resiliency than many expected but is still seeing even much broader swings than already volatile cryptocurrency prices. OpenSea saw a record $3.4 billion in transaction volume in August.</p>
<p>The company is launching with support for the Ethereum blockchain, which isn&#8217;t a very surprising place to start an NFT rollout, but Coinbase notably won&#8217;t be integrating with any Layer-2 scaling networks at launch, meaning Coinbase NFT users will still potentially be paying hefty gas fees and dealing with many of the scalability issues of mainnet Ethereum at launch. Coinbase says in a blog post that it will eventually offer &#8220;multi-chain&#8221; support on Coinbase NFT, but is launching with support for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Ethereum standards. Competitor OpenSea recently launched support for significantly lower-priced transactions leveraging the Polygon network.</p>
<p>OpenSea is the dominant power in the space, but is far from the only player that Coinbase will have to compete with. Rivals like Binance and FTX have also announced recent entries into the NFT marketplace ecosystem. While many crypto investors see NFTs as just scratching the surface of their potential, Coinbase is launching much later than some of its soon-to-be competitors. Nevertheless, given Coinbase&#8217;s name recognition in the consumer crypto world, this is likely going to be a big launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://airbyte.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbyte</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-funded</a> open source data integration startup, always made it easy for data teams to set up their ELT (extract, load and transform) pipelines, but until now, that meant self-hosting and managing the service, with all the complications that come with that. Today, the company announced the official launch of Airbyte Cloud, a hosted service that takes all of the features of the open source version and adds hosting and management, on top of a number of additional support options and enterprise features like access management for teams (though single sign-on support is currently still listed as &#8220;coming soon&#8221;).</p>
<p>Currently, more than 6,000 companies use Airbyte in some form or another. That&#8217;s up from only 250 at the end of January. Over the course of the year, the company has also taken on a seed and Series A round, for a total of just over $31 million in funding. The fact that there were only two months between the seed and Series A round is a pretty good indication of how hot this space is.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216843" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216843" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216843" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png" alt="" width="1024" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png 1230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airbyte-ui-for-your-integration-pipelines.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbyte</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And talking about money, Airbyte also decided to mix up its pricing model a bit with Airbyte Cloud. Instead of volume-based pricing, which used to be somewhat of the norm of these kinds of services, the team decided to opt for charging for the compute time these jobs take.</p>
<p>Ideally, this takes away at least some of the friction that is often associated with these kinds of workloads. Traditionally, the Airbyte team argues, enterprises use multiple systems like Fivetran to connect to the most common API sources and internally developed scripts the data engineering teams build for their one-off use cases &#8212; and then a system for database replication on top of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to really commoditize and solve the data integration problem,&#8221; Airbyte COO and co-founder John Lafleur told me when I asked about the pricing model. &#8220;The only way to do that is really through an infrastructure-type pricing model, like Snowflake: buy credits, consume these credits based on the hours of compute. At that point, because your database replication throughput is very high, it makes it possible. That&#8217;s why we went with compute.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Airbyte CEO and co-founder Michel Tricot added, this also means that businesses can now think about pricing for virtually all of their data services in the same compute-centric way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, Airbyte features about <a href="https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations">130 connectors</a> to services that range from consumer products like Instagram to BI systems like Google&#8217;s Looker and virtually every major database system. As the team noted, a lot of customers also use Airbyte&#8217;s open source code to build their own custom connectors. In addition, there are now also vendors who build connectors for their own customers and the team is looking at how it can incentivize its community to maintain connectors over time through the use of some form of revenue share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup Astra provided more details into its rather remarkable mission failure in August, during which the small launch vehicle hovered and drifted in the air before managing a brief vertical ascension. Even as it recounted the debacle, the company is ready to try again, opening the launch window for its next attempt on October 27.</p>
<p>This will be the fifth launch attempt for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">which recently went public</a> via a SPAC merger that injected it with around $500 million in cash. The rocket, dubbed “LV0007,” will carry a test payload for the U.S. Space Force.</p>
<p>This most recent flight on August 28 failed due to a propellant leakage, which caused the shutdown of one of the rocket’s engines, <a href="https://astra.com/news/launch-and-learn-lv0006/">Astra chief Engineer Benjamin Lyon explained in a blog post</a>. The rocket did manage to ascend as high as around 30 miles before the launch was terminated around 148 seconds after take-off. The company, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, conducted an investigation into the cause of the failure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ROg7X99f85"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">Astra&#8217;s first commercial launch fails to reach orbit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Astra&#8217;s first commercial launch fails to reach orbit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/embed/#?secret=ROg7X99f85" data-secret="ROg7X99f85" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The issue we encountered was something we hadn’t seen before,” Lyon said. After it leaked, it seems that the first stage propellant distribution system became trapped between the rocket and the launcher. Exhaust from the other engines caused that trapped propellant to ignite, severing the electronic connections to the fuel pump and shutting down the engine less than one second after takeoff.</p>
<p>Lyon says the company has taken steps to ensure these issues do not recur on the next test flight, including tweaking the rocket-to-launcher design to ensure that even if leaks do occur, the two propellants will not mix. Astra also modified the propellant supply mechanism and improved other verification processes, he said. “Together, we believe these changes significantly reduce the likelihood of seeing a similar event in the future.”</p>
<p>LV0007 will take off from the company’s launch site in Kodiak, Alaska, with the launch window opening on October 27 through October 31. There is an additional backup window from November 5 to November 12.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Data from the two-and-a-half-minute flight provided valuable insights that we have incorporated into LV0007 and future launch vehicles,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp said. “Our team is looking forward to returning to flight and learning more about our launch system – consistent with our launch and learn philosophy.”</p>
