										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">hours-long outage on Monday</a> may have hurt the company, its founder, shareholders, and many businesses that rely on the social juggernaut&#8217;s services. But for its instant messaging rivals, it was a very good day.</p>
<p>Telegram founder and chief executive Pavel Durov said on Tuesday that his instant messaging app added a staggering 70 million users on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud of how our team handled the unprecedented growth because Telegram continued to work flawlessly for the vast majority of our users,&#8221; <a href="https://t.me/durov/170">wrote</a> Durov on his Telegram channel. But the day wasn&#8217;t so flawless.</p>
<p>&#8220;That said, some users in the Americas may have experienced slower speed than usual as millions of users from these continents rushed to sign up for Telegram at the same time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Telegram, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/telegram-tops-1-billion-downloads/">recently topped 1 billion downloads</a>, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/telegram-to-launch-an-ad-platform-as-it-approaches-500-million-users/">500 million monthly active users</a> as of early this year.</p>
<p>Signal, which competes with both Telegram and WhatsApp, also added new users. It said yesterday in a tweet that &#8220;millions of new users&#8221; had joined the app.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Telegram and Signal have gained at the expense of their chief rival. The two added millions of users earlier this year as well when WhatsApp was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/whatsapp-is-doing-fine-despite-months-long-backlash-over-policy-update/">struggling to explain</a> exactly what its new privacy policy entailed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes,” said Brian Acton, the executive chairman of Signal&#8217;s holding company, of WhatsApp&#8217;s debacle earlier this year, in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">interview with TechCrunch</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is rolling out <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-resources-for-elementary-school-coding-and-inclusive-app-design/">several new resources</a> for elementary school students, including a new ‘Everyone Can Code Early Learners’ activity guide. The new guide extends Apple&#8217;s curriculum resources from kindergarten to college. This latest rollout is part of the tech giant’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/apple-expands-and-updates-its-everyone-can-code-program/">Everyone Can Code</a> initiative, which aims to help educators and families introduce coding to students early on.</p>
<p>“Coding and app design are essential literacies — these skills help students think critically and creatively, regardless of whether they go on to be app developers,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of education and enterprise marketing, in a statement. “Apple now offers coding resources for learners from kindergarten to college and challenges them to design amazing apps that are inclusive and accessible to users.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Everyone Can Code Early Learners guide will allow students in kindergarten through third grade to build a foundation in core coding concepts through several subjects including music, art, science and physical education. For instance, Apple notes that students will learn about coding commands through dance moves. Another exercise will ask students to discuss calming techniques to allow for social-emotional learning.</p>
<p>Apple is also encouraging educators to try its new one-hour inclusive ‘App Design’ activity session. The new lesson aims to help teachers guide their students to remember the importance of inclusion and accessibility when it comes to designing apps. The session essentially helps students think critically about how to build apps. The lesson will help students identify problems they’re passionate about and then plan solutions.</p>
<p>Apple is also adding support for a survey tool called &#8216;exit tickets&#8217; within its Schoolwork app. The tech giant notes that exit tickets are a way for educators to check in with students during or after class through questions aimed at gauging reactions and engagement. Teachers now also have the ability to create Schoolwork accounts for students more easily.</p>
<p>The Everyone Can Code Early Learners guide is available within the Swift Playgrounds app. The guide is launching in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish and Spanish, with support for more languages to come. Apple has been expanding its Everyone Can Code program over the years and making it available for more ages. In 2019, Apple launched a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/apple-expands-and-updates-its-everyone-can-code-program/"> program called Everyone Can Code Puzzles</a>, which aims to help students experiment with concepts. Last year, the tech giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/apple-expands-its-free-coding-courses-and-materials-for-educators/"> launched Everyone Can Code Adventures,</a> a new program with more advanced activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Space Agency will be sending a probe to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with the aim of ultimately landing on an asteroid in the early 2030s, in a mission that will surely be a major boost for the country’s private sector space companies.</p>
<p>The mission will launch in 2028. From there the spacecraft will have a long and winding journey: It will travel 3.6 billion kilometers over five years, boomeranging around both Venus and Earth to build enough velocity to eventually arrive at the asteroid belt beyond Mars in 2030. The UAE aims to land the spacecraft on an asteroid in 2033 &#8212; an ambitious target for a country that only founded its space agency in 2014.</p>
<p>If successful, the UAE Space Agency would join a very small group &#8212; including NASA, the European Space Agency and Japan’s space agency JAXA &#8212; in landing a vehicle on a planetoid. The exact scientific goals of the mission will be announced next year, but any data the spacecraft collects could help deepen our understanding of the origins of the universe. That’s because asteroids are thought by some scientists to be celestial leftovers from when the solar system was formed.</p>
<p>This is the latest, and most ambitious, effort from the UAE, which has been aiming to boost its domestic space sector. Crucially, the UAE will give priority access to contracts and procurement to Emirari companies, which stand to benefit from the project.</p>
<p>Last year, the country launched the Emirates Mars Mission Hope probe, which went into orbit around Mars in February of this year. That probe will spend one Martian year (687 days) orbiting the red planet and collecting data about its atmosphere.</p>

<p>The UAE will also be sending a 22-pound lunar rover, dubbed Rashid, to the moon in 2022. That payload, which also includes tech from three private Canadian companies, will be delivered aboard Japanese space startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/japanese-space-company-ispace-aims-to-send-landers-to-the-moon/">ispace’s Hakuto-R lander</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sarah Al Amiri, chair of the UAE Space Agency, said this newest mission will be “in the order of five times more complex” than the mission to Mars. Among the new challenges will be “spacecraft design and engineering, interplanetary navigation and complex systems integration,” as well as higher performance requirements from the spacecraft’s communications, power and propulsion systems, the UAE said in a statement.</p>

Chop Dawg describes itself as an app development agency, but these days that can mean helping startups build and scale software over many years. Founded in 2009 by Joshua Davidson when he was 16 years old, the Philadelphia-based company has worked on the launch of over 350 digital products to date. Clients range from big companies like Six Flags Great Adventure, to startups like SLAY, a fitness app by Mari Llewellyn, and nonprofits like Village Pledge, which is working to eliminate student-loan debt.</p>
<p>We sat down with Joshua to learn more about the company, why it does more than just software consulting, and how startups can best work with it, as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/who-are-the-best-software-development-consultants-for-startups/">our new series profiling great startup software consultants</a>. The answers aren&#8217;t as straightforward as you might think they would be, but Joshua walked us through a few different scenarios where it would make sense to reach out to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is <a href="https://chopdawg.com/">Chop Dawg</a> and how did you get started?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been around since August of 2009. So, in dog years we&#8217;re pretty old. On paper, we are an app development agency, but we actually consider ourselves to be a technology-based company because we&#8217;ve really transcended beyond just traditional mobile apps and web apps. We call ourselves a technology company because we like to look at it, we are very agnostic anywhere that software could be, we try to build and cater for; which is really exciting and fun for us. In our case, we deal with really two types of audiences. So a huge segment of who we work with for are early-stage brand new startups and companies, and we help them bring their ideas to life and we do that all under one roof, but then we also work with existing companies that are typically not on a technical nature or missing a piece that requires a technical branch. In essence what we try to do is be like a Swiss Army knife so everything from, if you need everything from us we have that capability to if you just need us for design or if you just need us for programming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Chop Dawg does more than just building programming — you do marketing and fundraising, you&#8217;ll help with and attract media attention. What led you to be more than just programming? </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like a civic duty. I think that&#8217;s the only way I can articulate it. For every technical entrepreneur trying to build a tech product in this day and age, there are 10 non-technical individuals trying to do the same thing. Except for lack of technical insight, there&#8217;s usually folks who are seasoned entrepreneurs or know what technology can do and how it can solve for your industry. Their expertise is missing. For example, right now we are working with a music producer who&#8217;s trying to solve a huge problem in his industry. He produces for some of the biggest artists on the planet. He can&#8217;t build an app, but he knows exactly what type of technology to use and how it could [be used] to disrupt an industry. So it was more than realizing, oh my goodness, there&#8217;s this huge segment that&#8217;s just not getting help. And if you put yourself in their shoes, well they&#8217;re going to reach out to the app agencies. Most organizations are focusing on expertise and knowledge, or just, &#8220;OK here&#8217;s a bill for what you want to do,&#8221; and we wanted to make sure when we started a company like this is our craft. We want to build things that are going to be successful for the long haul. If we can help you with every aspect of this, we&#8217;re going to increase your probability of success, and if we can make you more knowledgeable, we can increase your probability for success, and if we can act more as kind of like your outsourced CTO and technical team, we can take away an area that&#8217;s already a conceived liability for you.</p>
<p>For us it was like, this makes more sense of this approach. You know I&#8217;m not naive. We aren&#8217;t cheap because of the service we provide, we pay real people&#8217;s salaries, we have everything under one roof, but our job is to produce ROI. Make an asset that we scale for the long term and do it where someone is going to invest money, time and resources into it. You&#8217;re going to have the highest probability of success. It just came down to that kind of context. So I like to look at it like it just feels like our ethical or fiducial obligation. In the industry, there&#8217;s so much saturation, there&#8217;s so much competitiveness, and being around as long as we have, we have seen so many companies come and go. I think the reason we&#8217;ve had that longevity is just because we&#8217;ve always come in with a partnership first approach — but to be frank, we do that even when it&#8217;s not startups and early-stage companies, I just think there&#8217;s a huge knowledge gap and we have a lot of things we&#8217;ve learned — what to do, what not to do, and we can use that as an area of expertise to help folks we work with.</p>
<p><strong>What makes Chop Dawg unique?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest thing at this point is our track record itself. We&#8217;ve been around since the early days, and we have maintained relevancy. If you asked one of our partners, that’s what we call our clients, I think what they&#8217;re going to tell you is that longevity allows us to tell people not just what to do, but that we know why to do it that way, and how to be more pragmatic — save time, save energy, but also know what not to do. From being around so long, we&#8217;ve probably made every mistake you can possibly think of. Which is an advantage. Once you know that lesson, we can also help folks avoid that mistake. I think the third piece and this is more my personal bias that says this, more than anything, but I genuinely do believe it. We are industry agnostic, we&#8217;ve worked in almost every industry you can literally think of. I mean professional cuddling is really in our portfolio at this point. We&#8217;ve done it all. What&#8217;s cool is you start learning that there are trends and playbooks that work in different industries that can be brought to an industry not done before. It&#8217;s such a saturated market a lot of folks really are focusing on, and I just don&#8217;t think they focus with the right intention. For us, like I think most people on our team if they could work for free to do it for free would, but you know, the reality of living in a capitalist society. We come in with that, have a background like this is the craft level we do and we get to build things we&#8217;re proud of and work with people we really love working with.</p>
<p><strong>What trends are you seeing right now in the industry?</strong></p>
<p>I think the first thing is using AI. I think, as a user, we expect our products to just do things intuitively for us more than ever before. Social is in almost everything at this point. It&#8217;s crazy to think that we&#8217;re building social base functionality in even internal apps for organizations. There is not a single app I can think of that we&#8217;re building right now that doesn&#8217;t have some form of social element involved, which makes perfect sense to me as being social beings, making technology being an extension of ourselves and just more industry niche-based products at this point. One more trend of notice is that there&#8217;s a cliche in business called &#8220;riches in the niches,&#8221; but I think you&#8217;re really starting to see this now in the app world, where instead of one app eats the entire world, so to speak, there&#8217;s a lot more companies that are focusing on just owning a niche and being absolutely best at it and then having minimal competition — no competitors, things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Has the pandemic affected the trends that you&#8217;re seeing?</strong></p>
<p>The thing it has impacted is a lot of folks, who I feel like probably would have been a little bit more hesitant to go build apps and software, are now going in. I think it&#8217;s just jump=started the industry, like &#8220;Oh snap, we might never have a full office again,” our customer base or user base is less probable to come out, or they have a different type of learned behavior now because of a year living through Zoom and not leaving your home. So there is no direct trend as far as like, here&#8217;s these type of apps and software coming. I think the trend is more you&#8217;re seeing organizations and companies and ideas come out that maybe would have taken a couple more years to make that jump. While I can’t share who they are because of an NDA, I talked to a nonprofit yesterday, who, if it wasn&#8217;t for the pandemic, they would have never been entertaining, &#8220;we need to build an app that does X, Y and Z.” It’s a nonprofit. For them to talk about an app and saying we&#8217;re gonna invest 1,000s of dollars is pretty staggering. But I think that&#8217;s the pandemic, in a nutshell. Where it’s forcing folks to have a whole new playbook or approach that didn&#8217;t exist before.</p>
<p><strong>Have you seen a lot more companies, outsourcing their tech and getting more comfortable working with you since remote work has increased?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a plethora of Fortune 500 companies who reached out to us. I&#8217;ve noticed some are companies who I think cut back at costs or were like, we&#8217;re gonna let go of our development department for this segment, let&#8217;s say it was React Native, but we still have React Native needs so we&#8217;ll begin offshoring it, or outsourcing it or finding a team for hire for a specific engagement. I think that&#8217;s definitely become a big thing.</p>
<p>Then I think what you&#8217;re seeing too is a lot of folks are realizing what a benefit agencies are. You know, there&#8217;s one thing I talk to partners all the time about and it’s there is merit to when you want to hire internally and grow a team in-house, but there are also times where having an agency — having a partner like that makes perfect sense too. For a lot of our partners, where it makes sense is that it&#8217;s pay as you go. If you don&#8217;t need us for a year, you&#8217;re not on the hook for multiple developer salaries, a project manager salary, a UI, UX designer salary, a QA salary. You can control your coffin. The liability is more on our shoulders at this point than it is on them; there&#8217;s always risk in business, to build a successful business, but if you made the wrong hires and you&#8217;re building a new company, or running a company — that is completely on you versus you hire an agency that falters, they&#8217;re legally liable to provide what is contracted and we&#8217;ve been obligated to do it right. So there&#8217;s also that perspective.</p>
<p>I think the third thing is you&#8217;re also seeing, more than ever, folks trying to get things done as quickly as possible. Where a benefit comes into more established agencies is when you have a methodology they&#8217;ll actually be quicker to move because you can jive and you have the resources, you have the process nailed down, you know what you&#8217;re doing versus when you&#8217;re building a team, rebuilding a team doing it internally, you still have to figure these things out too and figure out how to work well together. But again, there&#8217;s no such thing as absolutes. No way. When we talk to people, it comes down to what aligns with your business goals, objectives and, you know, like, I feel like agencies short term can be more expensive but long term saves you so much more money, and that comes from our position but, it comes down to what they&#8217;re trying to do and trying to accomplish.</p>

<p><script src="//embed.typeform.com/next/embed.js"></script></p>
<p><strong>At what point do you think is the best time for a startup to come and work with an agency?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s different dynamics for it to make sense. I&#8217;ll give you a couple different examples because I don&#8217;t know if there is just one smoking gun to work with agencies.</p>
<p>There would be a situation like, I have very limited funds, funds to the point where I can&#8217;t go and even build a team internally or hire a major agency to build my own product, and I&#8217;m trying to get enough of proof of concept because I want to possibly fundraise with it, or I possibly want to go in front of potential users and get preorders or get interest, or I want to hedge my risk before I even build it. Well then maybe doing a non-functioning prototype where you design the app with an agency, start to finish. We don&#8217;t touch a line of code, we use a tool like Figma to create the illusion of a working app that can make a lot of sense because one, let&#8217;s say, God forbid you find out people are not interested or you can&#8217;t raise money off of it. It&#8217;s significantly better to find that out, spending the least amount of money than it is to go all in and go do something.</p>
<p>Then we also get folks all the time who will reach out to us and they&#8217;ll say, I&#8217;m interested in doing an MVP, minimum viable product, and working with an agency can actually make a lot of sense in that regard if that&#8217;s the context they have.</p>
<p>But I will say, I’ve turned down quite a few folks who reach out to us, even if they have the financials. One of the reasons is folks who might have the money, but you can clearly tell they haven&#8217;t put any effort into market research, understanding ideas and maturing the vision. The first thing I like to tell folks is you need to know that you are committing yourself to this thing; you&#8217;re building a business. This isn&#8217;t a hobby that you&#8217;re willing to make just the next five years of your life.</p>
<p>Then there are folks that reach out to you or they have an idea, but you can tell the idea is still not fully fleshed out. It&#8217;s almost like they came up with a key feature, but they haven&#8217;t fully well rounded it yet. So one of the things I encourage like, do you understand your market? Do you understand your competitors? Do you understand the logistics of running an app? Because even when you&#8217;re done with the agency [it] doesn&#8217;t mean your app cost is gone. There are servers, there are APIs, there&#8217;s a third party you may have to pay for marketing, customer support, legal insurance, like just all the logistics. Have you put proper follow through to understand it?</p>
<p>There are different contexts when people reach out to figure out what&#8217;s a good fit and it&#8217;s going to be, yes, you&#8217;re ready to make this investment versus again, I look at like like a fiduciary duty like, I get to do that; you might have the money but you&#8217;re gonna end up with an expensive toy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like &#8220;Field of Dreams,&#8221; &#8216;if you build it they will come,'&#8221; that&#8217;s not how it works. I think if you&#8217;re looking at the sign to work with agencies you have, I don&#8217;t want to say a business plan because frankly I never had a business plan, but you understand the industry you&#8217;re getting in, you understand a clear vision of what you&#8217;re doing, you understand the pragmatic approach of how you&#8217;re going to roll it out. You know who your customer base is going to be, how you&#8217;re going to get to them. You have an idea of what your cost is going to be to operate it, and you have an idea of projections on what it&#8217;s going to take to break even, become profitable, to scale for the big picture. And if not that, at least have an idea enough like, I want to go to fundraise, or I want to get preorders so I can fund it, like a strategy or even a non-functioning prototype can make sense to hedge your risk.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a mixture of those things and this, if in a given day I talked to five, six companies that reach out to us. I&#8217;d say three to four fall in the bucket of that they need to go back to the drawing board and really take more time and careful consideration. It kind of comes into going back to a question you asked earlier like &#8220;what makes us different?&#8221; I think because we&#8217;ve done this for so long, I learned a lesson early in my career. What happened when you try to fit a square peg in a round hole, like how disastrous that is even if everyone has the right intention. So it&#8217;s like finding the right fit. And to be frank, there&#8217;s even another question that comes out of this and what is the right agency partner for people too.</p>
<p>One thing I tell folks all the time is that we&#8217;re a remarkably collaborative company … our partners are meeting with us every single week. We are having Slack or real-time conversations during the week. They&#8217;re going to be putting in several hours a week to work with us, on top of what we&#8217;re doing, and they have to be ready for that and to be involved and be able to pay attention and be able to context switch. There&#8217;s a lot of things that happen, we even do orientation week before we start our project where we literally spend a week before the project begins training the partner on how to be the best partner possible, how to pay attention to understand everything. That&#8217;s definitely a big component in that regard. Companies reach out to us, or individuals, like I just need someone for the next three months to build this and come back and say, &#8220;Here you go.&#8221; That just doesn&#8217;t fit in our DNA. It&#8217;s not how we&#8217;re going to be successful. Or the approach we take from design and development QA might not align with the type of approach that they&#8217;re looking for. So, it doesn&#8217;t even mean these people are bad or it doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t have great ideas but this is part of even finding a good cultural fit from like a methodology perspective. Us as an organization, we&#8217;re a salary-based agency, so we don&#8217;t bill by our week or month, we really take the time to figure out in advance what we are doing. I&#8217;m a big believer in you should know exactly what it&#8217;s going to cost and take in time, and what&#8217;s needed for expectations setting to get that goal. I just think it&#8217;s a really big thing, ethically for us to do the right way. But again, these are all pieces, there&#8217;s not one solution out there that fits for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What else should we know about Chop Dawg?</strong></p>
<p>I think the set rate is a big thing for our partners, just because everyone&#8217;s been in a situation, doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re in this business or not, where you&#8217;re halfway through your budget and you find out you&#8217;re not even a third of the way through the project. It&#8217;s kind of one of the worst things in the world. I personally never liked the weekly or monthly billing model because I feel like it incentivizes the service provider to take as long as possible, versus everyone having the same incentives; the same goal. Accountability was always a big thing to me as we created a culture and the DNA as an organization; everyone should be in the same alignment with the same goals, and then have the same transparency and goals and alignment within that.</p>
<p>As a company, we purposely are constantly just trying to be better and better at what we do. Even today, with my CEO hat on, I’m constantly like, &#8220;How can our process improve? What new technologies can we adapt? What do new design trends, technology trends can we be leveraging?&#8221; I think that&#8217;s probably one of the things I&#8217;m most proud of. The fact that we just have an amazing team that I know is like genuinely bought into helping people and it&#8217;s cool to see where once upon a time we started just need like, 50 plus people and you see them, build a career here, have families, have kids, buy a home, like have the company create something bigger than itself. I think the third thing is this constant quest. We always feel like although we&#8217;re great at what we do, there&#8217;s so much room for improvement. And how do you have that lens to constantly just reevaluate nonstop, how to be better, because I feel like that&#8217;s our, again, our fiduciary and ethical duty for who we work with and who we work for, to constantly push the envelope to just improve.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If we only valued Udemy on its business revenues, at its final private-market valuation, it would be worth 4.5x its Q2 2021 ARR. That's incredibly cheap.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After digging into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway IPO filing</a> this morning, we&#8217;re turning to Udemy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001607939/000119312521291460/d163445ds1.htm">Udemy offering</a> comes in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/duolingo-boosts-ipo-price-target-in-boon-to-edtech-startups/">successful Duolingo IPO earlier this year</a>. And the company&#8217;s debut may prove to be the final major edtech IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-valued-at-18-billion-in-new-funding/">ahead of Byju&#8217;s eventual debut</a> &#8212; how well Udemy performs in its public offering could impact others in its market, including some incredibly wealthy education technology players.</p>

<p>So, how does the company&#8217;s growth profile appear after the pandemic-powered wave of demand for edtech has passed?</p>
<p>In the case of Udemy, we&#8217;re looking at an online learning service that raised north of $300 million while private. A $50 million Series F raised in late 2020 valued the company at a touch over $3.2 billion, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/udemy-series-f--dafd7d75">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>For Lightbank, Insight Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Mindrock Capital and Tencent, the company&#8217;s IPO is a material liquidity event; there&#8217;s lots of capital riding on its success.</p>

To understand how healthy Udemy is, we&#8217;ll have to dig into each half of its business model &#8212; we&#8217;ll also want to know what&#8217;s happening to the company&#8217;s aggregate revenue mix and which direction it&#8217;s leaning in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Sound like fun? I&#8217;m super stoked to get into this one. So, let&#8217;s.</p>
<h2>Udemy&#8217;s business through the pandemic</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2020, Udemy grew from $276.3 million in revenue to $429.9 million, or 55.6%. That&#8217;s quite a lot for a company that has already reached material scale, or revenues of $100 million and above. More recently, in the first half of 2021, Udemy posted $250.6 million in total revenues, up 24.5% compared to H1 2020.</p>
<p>But we expected Udemy to grow more slowly after its pandemic bump, frankly, so to see the company&#8217;s revenue growth decline into 2021 is not a huge shock. How investors value a slower-growing &#8212; but larger and more profitable &#8212; edtech company will be interesting to watch.</p>
<p>Not that Udemy actually makes money. It does not. But it is losing less money over time:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212565" style="width: 923px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212565" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2212565 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png" alt="" width="913" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png 913w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png?resize=768,331 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png?resize=680,293 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-9.46.42-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Udemy S-1</p></div></p>
<p>If you want to get a net income number excluding the cost of share-based compensation, you can deduct $20.6 million from its H1 2020 number and $16.5 million from its H1 2021 figure. The latter calculation will get you down to less than $13 million in losses during the first half of 2021 at Udemy. That&#8217;s far closer to profitability than the company has managed in prior periods, indicating that Udemy enjoyed some operating leverage during the pandemic, cutting losses while its revenues expanded.</p>
<h2>Revenue mix</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re going to break our general rule of not including marketing-friendly charts in our S-1 teardowns for the following exception:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups are more likely to face an uphill climb than their white, male counterparts, but their challenges stretch well beyond systemic bias and a general lack of access to capital.</p>
<p>Women, transgender and Black startup founders must navigate myriad issues for which there is no playbook: People of color may question how much of their authentic selves they can bring to the workplace, CEO moms are more likely to shoulder the majority of their family’s childcare responsibilities, and many workers have never been led by someone who’s gone through gender transitioning.</p>
<p>In a TechCrunch Disrupt Extra Crunch Stage panel titled &#8220;The Path for Underrepresented Founders,&#8221; I spoke with Hana Mohan, a transgender woman who is the CEO and co-founder of MagicBell, a notification platform for product teams; Leslie Feinzaig, a Latina entrepreneur who started the Female Founders Alliance; and Stephen Bailey, a Black man who is the founder and CEO of Exec Online, an online leadership development platform.</p>
<p>We went slightly over our allotted time; the conversation was a blend of frank talk about their lived experiences and practical discussion about some of the strategies that help them keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Despite their varied backgrounds, each panelist agreed that it’s important for founders who aren’t from privilege or wealth to understand and accept that systemic bias is real. And because Silicon Valley touts itself as a meritocracy, the gap between expectation and reality can create cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>When Feinzaig was fundraising in 2017, &#8220;I expected that it would be hard. But I also expected that it would be fair,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And in reality, it was just kind of a gaslit experience. I felt like I was in this really dark room. And nobody would tell me how to turn on the lights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mohan, whose company graduated Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 cohort, said pattern-recognition bias doesn’t just influence who investors decide to work with; it also informs how founders present themselves and their companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;White cis men, they tend to have a bravado about how they talk, this kind of exuberant, &#8216;we are going to crush the competition,'&#8221; she said. &#8220;I definitely felt that when I would sprinkle my pitch with some of those words, it definitely resonated more, like you have to communicate that excitement is naturally amply balanced.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Co-streaming is rolling out to all users on Facebook&#8217;s game-streaming platform Facebook Gaming. The feature will allow users to team up and stream with one another, while enabling viewers to navigate between co-streams and choose which perspective they&#8217;d like to see the action from.</p>
<p>The feature had previously only been available to streamers in the service&#8217;s partner program but is now seeing a wider release. The feature is currently limited to four co-streamers at one time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With co-streaming, we aim to increase discoverability for creators, encourage collaboration between creators and elevate the overall viewing experience for everyone,&#8221; a company blog post reads.</p>
<p>Facebook Gaming has been slowly bulking up its capabilities as it aims to grab a bigger slice of the game streaming duopoly currently dominated by Alphabet&#8217;s YouTube Gaming and Amazon&#8217;s Twitch. It&#8217;s been doing a pretty solid job eating away at YouTube Gaming&#8217;s growth but Twitch still looms large in both hours streamed and hours watched. A big part of Facebook Gaming&#8217;s strategy for chipping away at that lead has been building out a substantial partner program of streamers with a close relationship to the company that are there to test and give feedback on new programs like co-streaming.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is reportedly aiming to bring some of the tech it uses at cashierless <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20go" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Amazon Go</a> stores to your kitchen. According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-building-smart-fridge-that-monitors-your-buying-patterns-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Insider</em></a>, the company has been working on a smart fridge that can monitor items and help you order replacements if you&#8217;re running low on something.</p>
<p>The team behind the Amazon Go systems is said to be heading the charge on the project, which has been in the works for at least two years. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Just Walk Out tech</a> used at Go stores tracks what shoppers put in their carts and automatically charges them when they leave. Members of the Amazon Fresh and Lab126 hardware teams are reportedly involved with the fridge project too.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The fridge would monitor the items inside and keep tabs on your purchasing habits, according to the report. If you run low on something you buy frequently, the fridge would notify you and make it easier to order more from Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh, which could give the company&#8217;s grocery division a boost. The fridge could offer recipe suggestions too, which may prove useful if you forget about an item that&#8217;s about to expire.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Amazon wouldn&#8217;t make the fridges itself, <em>Insider</em>&#8216;s sources said. It&#8217;s looking to team up with an appliance manufacturer. There&#8217;s a possibility that Alexa voice control could be included. That&#8217;s said to not be a major concern, but given Amazon&#8217;s propensity for stuffing Alexa into nearly every other type of product, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">home robots</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">its own TVs</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if the fridge has voice assistant support.</p>
<p>The company has reportedly spent upwards of $50 million per year on the project so far. Even so, there&#8217;s no guarantee that the fridge will come to market as it&#8217;s possible Amazon will shelve the plans. If the fridge does come to market, it likely won&#8217;t come cheap. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget the company doesn&#8217;t comment “on rumors or speculation.”</p>
<p>The concept isn&#8217;t entirely new. In 2016, Samsung <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-04-samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">revealed a fridge</a> that can help you keep track of what&#8217;s inside without having to open the door. You can even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-08-samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-hands-on.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">order groceries</a> using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-samsung-updates-family-hub-smart-fridge-new-ui.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">the built-in touchscreen</a>. Amazon&#8217;s fridge would take the idea a little further, though, since it would flag items that you&#8217;re about to run out of and help you order more through the company&#8217;s own grocery ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s that time again! Today is the 28th Demo Day for <a href="https://www.alchemistaccelerator.com/">Alchemist</a>, an accelerator that primarily focuses on enterprise companies — or those that sell to other companies, primarily, rather than directly to consumers.</p>
<p>This latest cohort comes in at 23 companies. Like the last few Alchemist batches, this one was entirely virtual — a move that Alchemist director Ravi Belani tells me has proven to work well, noting that attendance of their virtual demo day is &#8220;up 100%&#8221; over its in-person equivalent.</p>
<p>I hopped on a call with Belani, who gave me a rundown of what each company is working on and shared some updates on the accelerator itself. <strong>Some of those updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alchemist has raised another $4 million in funds to invest, backed by NEC, Johnson Controls and Nornickel.</li>
<li>The accelerator (via its AlchemistX arm) is starting to build out regional programs, working with government organizations to help them figure out how to nurture local startups. The first programs will be launched in Canada, Japan and Korea. In Canada, for example, it&#8217;s working with Innovate Edmonton on an accelerator program <a href="https://innovateedmonton.com/community-safety-and-wellness-accelerator/">focused on community safety</a>.</li>
<li>Alchemist companies have now raised more than $1.7 billion in funding, collectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alchemist&#8217;s Demo Day <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZoYHPX1qCs">will be streamed live later today</a> beginning at 10:30 AM Pacific.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ouster, a lidar company that went public this year via a SPAC merger, said it would acquire solid-state lidar startup Sense Photonics in an all-stock deal that was valued at around $68 million at close of markets on Monday.</p>
<p>Once the acquisition is complete, Ouster said it would establish a new business arm, Ouster Automotive, which will be headed by Sense CEO Shauna McIntyre. That business will integrate Sense’s 200-meter range solid-state lidar into a new lidar suite. San Francisco-based Sense’s claim to fame is also its improved field of view, as TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/sense-photonics-flashes-onto-the-lidar-scene-with-a-new-approach-and-26m/">Devin Coldewey explained</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KHWmkrlRDM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/sense-photonics-flashes-onto-the-lidar-scene-with-a-new-approach-and-26m/">Sense Photonics flashes onto the lidar scene with a new approach and $26M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sense Photonics flashes onto the lidar scene with a new approach and $26M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/sense-photonics-flashes-onto-the-lidar-scene-with-a-new-approach-and-26m/embed/#?secret=KHWmkrlRDM" data-secret="KHWmkrlRDM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to a news statement, Ouster Automotive will also aim to advance negotiations with five automotive OEMs, though additional details about these potential deals were not provided. Should they turn into something solid, production would begin in 2025 or 2026.</p>
<p>Lidar is a key sensor in most autonomous driving stacks. The sensor, whose name is a shortened form of “light detection and ranging,” measures distance using lasers to generate a 3D map of the world. Along with radar, cameras and software, lidar is a critical part of the AV systems of some of the leading developers today, including companies like Waymo and Argo AI.</p>
<p>In February, Ouster CEO Angus Pacala said on the podcast “Shift” that the future of the lidar industry would be marked by consolidation. “There’s going to be three to five lidar companies within the next five years,” he said. This new acquisition is a mark that Ouster will be at the forefront of turning this prediction into a reality.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ouster completed a merger with a blank-check firm in a deal valued at $1.9 billion. It joined rival lidar companies Luminar, Innoviz and Velodyne in taking the SPAC route to the public market. Ouster’s stock hit a year-to-date trading high of $15.39 in February; today, it’s trading for $7.41.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Update: A spokesperson for Ouster confirmed to TechCrunch that the company expects the majority of Sense&#8217;s 80 employees to join McIntyre in joining Ouster.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added, &#8220;Ouster&#8217;s perspective has always been that auto OEMs want a multi-sensor suite of solid-state lidar, long to short-range, that can be manufactured at scale and integrated into the body of the vehicle for the low hundreds of dollars. That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re planning to offer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>, which provides open source software that helps companies quickly build internal applications, announced an $8 million Series A round of funding this morning.</p>
<p>Unlike some upstart tech companies that we have seen in the internal application market, Appsmith doesn&#8217;t sport a no- or low-code approach. Instead, Appsmith targets traditional developers with its service, which provides user-interface components that can be connected to business data sources. Those data-infused interface modules can be combined to build calendars, dashboards and other apps.</p>
<p>Before its Series A round of funding, Appsmith had raised $2.5 million. Canaan led the funding event. Accel and Bessemer participated, among other investors.</p>
<p>Asked why the startup selected that particular lead investor, co-founder and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisheknayak/?originalSubdomain=in">CEO Abhishek Nayak</a> told TechCrunch that his company had been in touch with Canaan&#8217;s Joydeep Bhattacharyya since its early days and that the investor had experience with internal apps at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Why did Appsmith decide to raise capital now? Per Nayak, rising usage of its service and a desire to build out its platform to support more use cases &#8212; things like mobile &#8212; were the impetus.</p>
<p>Appsmith doesn&#8217;t offer a paid product today. But as it currently offers a hosted version of its open source code, it isn&#8217;t hard to see where it could turn on monetization. Enterprise-specific features would be another obvious method of generating revenue in time.</p>
<h2>Why open source?</h2>
<p>There has been a trend of startups that build open source technologies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">raising capital in recent quarters</a>. Appsmith fits neatly into the group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the <em>why</em> is more interesting. The company told TechCrunch that its co-founders (Nayak and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-nandagopal-05534241/">Nikhil Nandagopal</a>) want Appsmith tech to become part of their customers&#8217; technology stack, and that open source code is the way to achieve the goal. The logic there is simple: Open source code is at once less at-risk to the vicissitudes of startup viability and also easy to dig into. Good luck getting similar visibility into proprietary code.</p>
<p>Today, Appsmith&#8217;s open source project has over 100 external contributors.</p>
<p>The Appsmith team stressed to TechCrunch that feedback from the open source community is useful to making development decisions. And the startup said that by offering a version of its service for free through open source channels, it can provide a service to public-good companies like nonprofits, which might not eventually become paying customers.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, who are the company&#8217;s future customers?</p>
<h2>Who is Appsmith for?</h2>
<p>In the startup&#8217;s view, its open source software is a good fit for smaller companies and developers. Its paid products will fit more neatly into midsize and larger companies once they are rolled out.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have eyes on how Appsmith tackles monetization and customer segmentation, two areas of open source business model formation that we find fascinating. Not only because it&#8217;s an interesting academic question in the case of the startup itself, but also because we want to better understand how the next generation of open source upstarts decides how to make money. Their choices will set the standard for the next cohort of companies building code in an open manner.</p>
<p>Appsmith has lots of competition in the market, with each rival company taking a different tack to the internal application issue. In brief, companies of every shape and size need internal software, and building it is at once tedious, often thankless and unexciting. So, methods that can short-circuit the process of building internal tooling are in demand.</p>
<p>Stacker, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">wants to help non-developers build apps from spreadsheets</a>. Unqork wants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps/">to help enterprise customers build no-code internal apps</a>. UiFlow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/y-combinator-backed-uiflow-wants-to-accelerate-no-code-enterprise-app-creation/">as well</a>. The list goes on.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back in with Appsmith when it turns on paid products, an event that it anticipates will occur before the end of Q1 2022. For now, the startup is flush and working in a growing market. Let&#8217;s see what it can get done with its new capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past couple of years, <a href="http://streamlit.io">Streamlit</a>, a startup founded by machine learning veterans, has been working on an open source project to help data scientists build web apps to explore the data in machine learning models. Today the company announced the project has reached version 1.0.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago we came out [with the initial version of Streamlit]. So we&#8217;re putting a stamp on it and saying this is ready to go. We are super, super proud of it, and in fact, there&#8217;s a great roadmap ahead of other things that we&#8217;re building for the community as our reach grows,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Adrien Treuille told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said that when they started they had a sense based on their own experience that there was a need for a tool that let data scientists take the data they were working on and share it with the rest of the organization, and over that time as thousands of people have downloaded the product, they have found that idea validated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The open source product is freely available and all the source code can be seen. It&#8217;s backed by a huge community of people who are finding bugs, making suggestions and even contributing to the code,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Amanda Kelly, who is co-founder and COO at the company, says they have gone from an early user base of a handful of customers to a huge community of users, partly driven by the popularity of Python.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you know the core thing is that if you understand Python, which tens of millions of people do now, even just a little bit of Python, you really can get started with Streamlit, so anybody who&#8217;s like looking to go from some type of data, some type of API&#8217;s where they&#8217;re all coming together, you can use Streamlit to really quickly get an answer,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company reports that over half of the Fortune 50 is using the open source product, and a data scientist Facebook, Tyler Richards, completely independent of the company, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781800565500/">wrote a book on how to use Streamlit</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which scored<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/streamlit-nabs-35m-series-b-to-continue-building-machine-learning-platform/"> a $35 million Series B</a> in April, has also been working on a commercial cloud service in addition to the open source project, which should be ready before the end of the year. The commercial product is currently in private beta at over 700 companies, which means they should hit the ground running when it is eventuall available.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and has raised $62 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">Senate hearings</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">leaked documents</a> galore, teen mental health on social media is a hot topic right now. But Gen Z founders Georgia Messinger and Ari Sokolov have been trying to create healthier online spaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/22/trill-project-aims-to-be-a-safe-community-for-people-to-express-their-true-selves/">since they were in high school</a>, when they started the anonymous virtual support app <a href="https://www.trillproject.com/">Trill</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;People ask us sometimes, &#8216;How did you guys decide you wanted to be entrepreneurs while being students?'&#8221; Messinger, now a Harvard undergraduate, told TechCrunch. &#8220;It was never that we set out to start a business, per se, it&#8217;s just that when we were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>seniors in high school, we set out to just solve a problem for our friend. One of our friends was bisexual and was really struggling with coming out, and we wanted to create an antidote to traditional social networks, which later has been coined &#8217;emotional media,&#8217; and it was just a passion project that grew bigger than we ever imagined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trill has amassed over 100,000 downloads through organic marketing alone, facilitating anonymous support groups around identity, mental health and relationships. With about $100,000 in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/22/trill-project-aims-to-be-a-safe-community-for-people-to-express-their-true-selves/">seed funding</a> from sources like the Founders Bootcamp and Target Incubator programs, the app grew a team of thirty part-time staff (mostly high school and college students), as well as over 100 volunteer moderators. But the college student founders started to look into opportunities to be acquired during the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to be able to keep ourselves open to explore other interests, enjoy our time at school and take care of our own mental health &#8212; not doing this full-time job while juggling all of life&#8217;s other priorities,&#8221; Messinger explained. &#8220;But as you can see, it&#8217;s now October 2021, so we weren&#8217;t rushing into anything.”</p>
<p>Since a large community of young people use their app as a reprieve, Messinger and Sokolov wanted to make sure that if they were acquired, it would be by a company that shared their fundamental mission to develop supportive communities for young people online. Meanwhile, Greta McAnany was looking for opportunities to reach more Gen Z users on <a href="https://your.blue/39adFi6">Blue Fever,</a> an anonymous social network encouraging authenticity and community support. With McAnany as CEO and co-founder, Blue Fever has secured $4.2 million in <a href="https://board.fastcompany.com/blog/fast-company-executive-board-will-give-greta-mcanany-connections">venture backing</a> from investors like Amazon Alexa Fund, Bumble Fund, and Serena Williams.</p>
<p>McAnany wasn&#8217;t necessarily looking for an acquisition, but she told TechCrunch that when she met the founders of Trill, she was so impressed with them that she wanted to find a way to collaborate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=768,709 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=680,628 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211375" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Fever</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget when I met Georgia in person, and she was like, &#8216;Here&#8217;s how I see the future of emotional media,&#8217; which is what we call ourselves instead of social media,&#8221; McAnany said. &#8220;I was floored. I was like, &#8216;Okay, we need to bring you on the team as part of leadership,&#8217; and also, bring in the incredible community and user base that they built.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue Fever isn&#8217;t disclosing the terms of the acquisition, but with today&#8217;s announcement, Trill will begin incentivizing its users to move over to Blue Fever. By the end of October, Trill will no longer be functional. In the transition, Messinger and Sokolov will join Blue Fever as advisors on product development and audience strategy. They will also lead a Junior Advisory Board in collaboration with hundreds of beta testers who will provide input on the app&#8217;s features.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve worked closely with Blue Fever’s head of product, and I think we’re very aligned on the future of the product in creating the same experience with slightly different features,&#8221; said Ari Sokolov, now a student in the University of Southern California&#8217;s Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it&#8217;s not the same core user experience, it&#8217;s the same core essence behind it,&#8221; Messinger added. Blue Fever and Trill are both anonymous apps, but Blue Fever works by inviting users to post pages, which are essentially iPhone notes where users can share their insecurities, victories, worries and thoughts. Pages are posted to journals, which are themed collections of pages about topics like college, relationships, gender identity, magic moments and loneliness. To discourage negative commenting or the disclosure of personal information, Blue Fever currently only allows users to respond with a &#8220;hug&#8221; or a gif. But McAnany says the app will test commenting. The app also uses an AI called Blue, which McAnany says is like a &#8220;big sibling,&#8221; helping users find content on the platform that might help them &#8212; and if someone posts content indicating that they might be in danger, the AI provides resources for them to seek help.</p>
<p>Blue Fever also has human moderators who help keep the platform safe. Still, as more Gen Z-ers flock to Blue Fever from Trill, it will become even more important that Blue Fever&#8217;s combination of human and AI moderation can scale.</p>

<p>Mental health-focused apps like Blue Fever and Trill aren&#8217;t intended to be a substitute for seeking professional help, and they&#8217;re not trying to compete with giants like TikTok, Snapchat, or Instagram<strong>. </strong>While these platforms aim to comfort Gen Z users who are disillusioned with traditional social apps, anonymous platforms have a troubling track record online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ari and I have been very open since day one that our solution might not be perfect, and there could be better solutions or iterations on the ideas we have,&#8221; said Messinger. &#8220;We&#8217;re not attached to our solution per se &#8212; we love Trill and we obviously think it&#8217;s a great solution &#8212; but we&#8217;re more attached to the problem we&#8217;re solving than to the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous social apps like Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-05-11/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk">Yolo and LMK</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/in-wake-of-teen-suicides-ask-fm-faces-a-myspace-problem/">Ask.fm</a> have been linked to teen suicides, while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/10/secret-sharing-app-whisper-left-users-locations-fetishes-exposed-web/">Whisper</a> accidentally exposed anonymous posters&#8217; data. Blue Fever and Trill are different from these platforms, since they&#8217;re built with mental health considerations at their core, but as Blue Fever considers rolling out commenting and absorbs the Trill userbase, the platform&#8217;s ability to keep users safe will be tested. McAnany said that Blue Fever doesn&#8217;t store personal identifiable information (PII) alongside user-generated content, and that the app doesn&#8217;t maintain a publicly-accessible API, which was how data from apps like Whisper was leaked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love technology. We&#8217;re coders, we&#8217;re computer scientists, and we don&#8217;t dislike our phones. I love social media. I like to make TikToks,&#8221; Messinger said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just about setting healthy boundaries and continuing to ask the question of how our new spaces are going to intervene to help Gen Z and especially marginalized communities within that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/?hl=en">recently</a> said was &#8220;no longer a photo-sharing app,&#8221; noting the company was prioritizing a shift into video amid significant competition from TikTok and YouTube. Today, Instagram is taking another step towards its larger goal of making video a more central part of the Instagram experience with news that it will now combine IGTV&#8217;s long-form video and Instagram Feed videos into a new format called simply &#8220;Instagram Video.&#8221;</p>
<p>These videos, both longer and shorter, will be found on users&#8217; profiles in a new &#8220;Video&#8221; tab.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when people encounter videos on Instagram, they&#8217;ll be able to tap anywhere on the video to enter into a fullscreen viewing mode. After watching, they can then choose to keep scrolling to discover more video content from creators or tap the back button to exit.</p>
<p>None of these changes will impact what Instagram is doing with Reels, though. The company&#8217;s short-form video platform and TikTok rival will continue to remain separate, we&#8217;re told. They won&#8217;t be mixed into this feed of videos, if users choose to scroll.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212603" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212603" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2212603" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/244367723_884783532474523_6124902347763306887_n.webp?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212603" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>IGTV was already losing ground as a standalone product and brand ahead of this change. In early 2020, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/igtv-button-gone/">dropped the orange IGTV button</a> from Instagram&#8217;s home page due to lack of traction. The move came at a time when, at most, just 7 million of Instagram&#8217;s 1-billion plus users had downloaded the standalone IGTV app, TechCrunch previously reported, citing <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a> research. As of August 31, 2021, the firm estimates the app saw 18 million installs globally across the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>Instagram had explained its decision to pull out the button by saying that most Instagram users were finding IGTV content through the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/instagram-thinks-you-want-igtv-previews-in-your-home-feed/">previews</a> shared to the Feed and in Explore. But the reality was that IGTV as a standalone product was largely leading to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-igtv-videos-in-feed">clutter</a> and confusion in the flagship app, critics and creators argued, while failing to drive a large number of downloads to the standalone IGTV app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The IGTV app, however, isn&#8217;t going away. Instagram tells us it will now be rebranded as &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; and will host the &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; formatted content, along with Instagram Live videos. But it will not host Reels videos.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s update, users will still be able to upload their non-Reels videos in the same way as before &#8212; by clicking on the plus sign (+) in the top-right corner of the Instagram home page and selecting &#8220;Post.&#8221; Videos can be up to 60 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Instagram is also adding new features like trimming, filters, and people and location tagging as part of the updated upload experience.</p>

<p>Longer videos, which would have previously been identified as IGTV videos, will show 60-second previews in the Feed, as they did before. However, if the video is eligible for ads, the preview will still be 15-seconds, also as before.</p>
<p>Obviously, &#8220;IGTV Ads&#8221; will no longer be called this, with today&#8217;s changes. Instead, they&#8217;ll be called &#8220;In-Stream video ads.&#8221; Creators can continue to monetize their long-form videos and brands can use the format, as well. And the videos will still be a part of Instagram&#8217;s revenue-sharing tests with creators &#8212; again, as before. (But if businesses want to boost their videos to reach more people, they&#8217;ll need to be no longer than 60 seconds long, Instagram notes.)</p>
<p>Creators will also continue to be able to cross-post their videos through Stories and share through Direct Messages, says Instagram.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s goal with these changes will be a more streamlined video experience. However, by keeping Reels separate, the app will still differentiate videos by length. But this is similar to how YouTube is addressing the TikTok threat. Its TikTok competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">known as YouTube Shorts</a>, has its own dedicated button in the YouTube app, just like Instagram Reels does.</p>
<p>Instagram says the changes are rolling out globally starting today across both iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-former-tesla-cio-just-raised-150-million-more-to-pull-car-dealers-into-the-21st-century/">told you</a> about the opportunity that former Tesla CIO Jay Vijayan was chasing. His plan? To pull car dealers into the 21st century with a snazzy end-to-end automotive SaaS platform like the one he helped develop inside Tesla. Customers could use it to order a car to their precise specifications; dealers could use it to see in real time to understand their inventory and seamlessly check in customers for service appointment; OEMs could use it to see exactly which of their parts were where, relative to said dealerships.</p>
<p>The list of ways the software would produce savings and improve efficiencies for both dealers and OEMs went on and on, as Vijayan explained it. Apparently, his Pleasanton, Calif., company, Tekion, is gaining meaningful traction, too.</p>
<p>According to Vijayan, the company&#8217;s revenue has grown threefold over the last year; the number of states where dealers are using Tekion&#8217;s software has grown to 39 from 28; and the company just began working with its first dealership in Canada as part of a plan to become an international outfit.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the company is today announcing $250 million in Series D financing that bumps its valuation a year ago from $1 billion to $3.5 billion today, and its total funding from $185 million to $435 million. Alkeon Capital and Durable Capital co-led the round. Other investors include Hyundai Motor Company, several dealer groups across the U.S., and earlier backers Advent International, Index Ventures and FM Capital.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the global chip shortage and other parts-supply disruptions that drove down new vehicles sales down a whopping 26% last month, is only having a positive impact on Tekion, and a <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2021/10/05/some-car-dealerships-benefitting-from-semiconductor-chip-shortage">recent piece</a> in Morning Brew suggests why.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pyLrqu2O3h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-former-tesla-cio-just-raised-150-million-more-to-pull-car-dealers-into-the-21st-century/">This former Tesla CIO just raised $150 million more to pull car dealers into the 21st century</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This former Tesla CIO just raised $150 million more to pull car dealers into the 21st century&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-former-tesla-cio-just-raised-150-million-more-to-pull-car-dealers-into-the-21st-century/embed/#?secret=pyLrqu2O3h" data-secret="pyLrqu2O3h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When the outlet talked with the president of an automotive group in Columbus, Ohio, he said that because inventory is scarce, a sale that would have taken four hours to make before the chip shortage now closes in 52 minutes. That scarcity is also driving profits through the roof, with buyers paying more for both new and used inventory, and auto retailers benefiting from lower operating costs with less inventory. (A dealership in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., tells Morning Brew that its profits jumped 197% in Q1 2021 compared to Q1 2020.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Courtesy of tech from Tekion and some of its legacy competitors, retailers are presumably also able to operate faster when it comes to servicing the consumers who are waiting out the shortage and hoping to make their cars last longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The supply is less but the demand is strong, so everyone is making a lot of money,&#8221; Vijayan tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The dealers, the OEMs &#8212; they&#8217;re making a good amount of margin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tekion, Vijayan adds, has been &#8220;very strong through that growth,&#8221; but he anticipates that next year will be even better when he foresees that inventory will begin to catch up to demand.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9L0uquEfd6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-expects-semiconductor-rebound-new-vehicle-demand-to-increase-2021-profits/">Ford expects semiconductor rebound, new vehicle demand to increase 2021 profits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford expects semiconductor rebound, new vehicle demand to increase 2021 profits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-expects-semiconductor-rebound-new-vehicle-demand-to-increase-2021-profits/embed/#?secret=9L0uquEfd6" data-secret="9L0uquEfd6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I believe sometime next year there will be some level of correction in the market and that our technology platform will help both dealers and OEMs navigate the correction much more smoothly because it will continue to learn and evolve to provide insights on where they should focus their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the growth of Tekion &#8212; whose operations are split between California and Bangalore, India &#8212;  appears to largely organic. Though the automotive world is known for spending lavishly on marketing and for aggressive sales tactics, just 17 of Tekion&#8217;s employees now 1,350 employees work in sales. &#8220;We don&#8217;t spend any money in marketing, or it&#8217;s very negligible. [We&#8217;re growing through] word of mouth,&#8221; Vijayan says.</p>
<p>A deal struck back in March with General Motors &#8212; which is an early investor in Tekion, as is BMW and the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Alliance &#8212; is also surely helping. Though it&#8217;s up to each franchise to opt in or out, GM dealers broadly are beginning to use Tekion&#8217;s white-labeled dealer management software to make it easier for customers to purchase an Chevy, Cadillac, Buick or GMC brand electric vehicle.</p>
<p>The platform reportedly operates similar to  GM’s existing <a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/11/market-scan-solutions-help-enhance-general-motors-shop-click-drive-program/">Shop. Click. Drive. program</a>, which allows users to search for certain GM vehicles at dealerships near them and complete a portion of the transaction online. It&#8217;s a lot better, though. So said one Chevrolet VP in conversation earlier this year with <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/gm-launch-ev-digital-retail-tool-powered-tekion">Automotive News</a>, who described Tekion&#8217;s software as akin to GM&#8217;s internal program &#8220;on steroids.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rent the Runway has a truly epic selection of items, and shopping for designer items at rental prices is good fun. But is it a good business? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Good news, everyone: The Q4 IPO cycle is now well and truly underway.</p>
<p>For those of us who prefer to read IPO filings to funding announcements, new S-1 documents from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001607939/000119312521291460/d163445ds1.htm">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001468327/000119312521291103/d194411ds1.htm">Rent the Runway</a> and others just touched down. But we care the most about those two, as they are listings from venture-backed companies that we&#8217;ve covered here at TechCrunch over the years.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>

<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going to dig into the core business results of each company, discussing how they make money and the state of their recent results. This entry will dive into Rent the Runway; afterward, we&#8217;ll dig into Udemy. Today is a rare two-Exchange day. You are welcome.</p>
<p>Off the top, I&#8217;m incredibly curious what impact the pandemic had on Rent the Runway&#8217;s numbers &#8212; after all, no one needed a loaner gown for months and months &#8212; and how strong its gross margins have proved over time. I also want to understand how expensive it is to buy all the clothing items that the company needs to operate, and how those costs are accounted for in its reporting.</p>

<p>You are likely familiar with the Rent the Runway model: It buys expensive clothing aimed at women, renting the pieces out to subscribers and customers for a fraction of their retail price. The idea is that customers want a more varied wardrobe and want to wear items that they would not be able to afford on their own. Customers can subscribe to the company&#8217;s service or rent individual items piecemeal.</p>
<p>By lucky happenstance, your servant got his first real tour of the Rent the Runway product a few days ago, so I am moderately read-up on how it works in practice. Rent the Runway has a truly epic selection of items, and frankly shopping for designer items at rental prices is good fun.</p>
<p>But is it a good business? It&#8217;s a little hard to say, but I am not leaning toward yes.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was not kind to Rent the Runway. This makes sense. Clothes are for wearing places, and the pandemic kept most of us at home. Naturally, then, revenues at the company declined during its fiscal 2020, a 12-month period that ended January 31, 2021:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the dot-com bubble popped 20 years ago <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/CSCapacity/CSCapacity-History2000s.html">a lot of people</a> thought that software development was going to get broadly outsourced. Instead, Silicon Valley evolved a new ethos around technical, product-focused founders and strong, central engineering teams.</p>
<p>And yet, software development outsourcing is a thing once again.</p>
<p>Which is why we’re looking to profile great software development shops that work with startups. Founders, just leave <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">a recommendation in the survey below</a> and we’ll use your feedback to pick our next interview subjects for TechCrunch.</p>
<p>So why, you may ask, is software development outsourcing becoming more of a trend these days? Plenty of reasons, most of which you are probably familiar with. The overall growth of the tech sector, especially over the past decade, has pushed engineering salaries up across Silicon Valley and other startup hubs, while also putting more pressure on other costs of living. The number of skilled engineers for hire has correspondingly shrunk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, improving internet connections and globalized education programs have allowed more people to develop in-demand software skills and make themselves available for hire.</p>
<p>The pandemic made distributed work more normal for most people, too, which helped break down remaining divides between a central engineering team and remote contributors.</p>
<p>While you can still find plenty of startups of all sizes that want to maintain one big engineering group at a physical office, most companies we talk to have bought in to remote work in some form.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of these factors make outsourcing software development a far more normal move for many startups than you would have encountered 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
<p>So, tell us which great software consultants to profile below! If you&#8217;re a software consultant, share this <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">survey</a> with your clients.</p>
<p>This is part of our ongoing Experts series, where we profile the service providers who startup founders love to work with (based on founder recommendations). Software is our second service vertical after growth marketing, which we’re continuing as well — and we have more planned in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Both Anchor and Descript have made their names as being among the most significant Podcast creation platforms of recent times, but hoving into the rear-view mirror recently has been <a href="https://podcastle.ai/">Podcastle</a>, an all-in-one platform that can cover off recording, production and publishing, all on the one platform.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $7 million in an early-stage funding round co-led by RTP Global and Point Nine Capital. S16 VC and the company&#8217;s previous investors Sierra Ventures and AI Fund also participated.</p>
<p><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/">Podcastle</a> is tapping into the booming creator economy, valued by one report at around $104.2 billion, with there being at least 2 million podcasts out there these days.</p>
<p>Podcastle says it has around 150,000 creators so far, but says it’s adding to that number quickly with easy-to-use tools for podcast creators such as enabling studio-quality remote interviews using consumer-grade mics, multitrack recording and editing, and the ability to isolate the speech in the podcasts and improve it. It can also convert text to speech and vice-versa, allowing creators to edit their audio like text documents.</p>
<p>Artavazd Yeritsyan, founder and CEO of Podcastle and former VP of Engineering at Picsart, said: “In 2022, the average time spent listening should rise to 1 hour and 37 minutes per day, meaning the industry becomes one of the most influential categories in storytelling. We at Podcastle strive to remove all technical barriers and allow creators to focus on the thing that really matters — producing and delivering content they’d like to share with others”.</p>
<p>He says that while Descript is an editing tool, Podcastle is closer to a &#8220;creation&#8221; platform where creators can start with the remote interviews and continue editing without leaving the platform. “It’s like comparing Microsoft doc with Google Docs. Or Sketch versus Figma. In those cases, we are Google Docs and Figma,” he told me.</p>
<p>Alexander Pavlov, managing partner at RTP Global said: “The podcasting market reached $11.46 billion in 2020, and Podcastle offers a unified solution to satisfy aspiring hosts and creators. We see the huge potential behind the platform and are happy to further support Podcastle on its way to success”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Louis Coppey, partner at Point Nine Capital said: &#8220;At Point Nine, we’ve invested in several creative software over the past few years such as PlayPlay in Paris, GravitySketch in London or Shapr3D in Budapest. These three businesses are radically simplifying the creation of videos and designs in VR or 3D. Podcastle is paving the way for the democratization of audio content production.&#8221;</p>
<p>Podcastle offers four pricing plans and its base features are available for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Eric Tarczynski was first building Contrary Capital, he noticed there was an absence of venture capital firms focused on entrepreneurs within universities. So, he launched a $2.2 million debut fund to exclusively back the world&#8217;s top talent, or the student entrepreneurs that are spinning ambitious ideas out of their universities.</p>
<p>Years later, every investor wants to back founders earlier than their friends and foes. Contrary believes it has kept its competitive edge in backing early founders thanks to its secret: The firm has a community of 350 entrepreneurial students at colleges across the country that help it with deal flow. About 45% of the cohort identifies as female, and 65% identifies as non-white. It gives the firm the ability to learn about talented individuals before they even associate themselves with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of funds out there where most of what they do is basically swap deal flow,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve ever backed a company through any other way other than simply finding it and discovering it ourselves or through our community.”</p>
<p>Sixty-five investments later, Contrary Capital announced today that it has raised its second fund, a $20 million investment vehicle that will cut checks between $100,000 to $2 million to pre-seed founders. While the check size is bigger than Tarczynski initially estimated, the total fund is less than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/part-fund-part-accelerator-contrary-capital-invests-in-student-entrepreneurs/ ">Contrary’s original target of $35 million</a>, a move he said was done in a “deliberate, intentional, and methodical way” to grow the portfolio in a “slow and steady” way.</p>
<p>But, does slow and steady work in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">world of $500 million seed funds? </a></p>
<p>“We really don&#8217;t find ourselves competing,” he said. “Prices have definitely gone up in aggregate, for sure, but we&#8217;re not going toe to toe with those kinds of groups because we&#8217;re just swimming in a different pool.” Some could argue that reality is an argument for community-centric, community-first firms.</p>

<p>Tarczynski’s ability to attract notable investors for his firm may show that he’s not alone in his vision. Investors in Contrary Capital include DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram, Facebook CPO Chris Cox, GitHub COO Erica Brescia, a16z GP Vineeta Agarwala and Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal.</p>
<p>The firm targets between 5% to 10% ownership in each deal it makes. Its track record of investments include Lightyear, Brightland, Aryeo, Chums, Anduril and Ramp.</p>
<p>“Contrary is our secret hiring weapon. They’ve built a remarkably unique firm, and are easily one of our most helpful partners,” said Karim Atiyeh, co-founder and CTO at Ramp, a fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">company recently valued at $3.9 billion.</a></p>
<h2>The next tech mafia</h2>
<p>Last year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/contrary-capital-wants-to-invest-the-next-big-tech-mafia/"> Contrary announced Contrary Talent</a>, a new arm within the fund that will invest and support early-career folks and students to grow their tech ambitions. Contrary Talent, which now has hundreds of members, sources the top engineers, designers and managers at top tech companies and pairs them with top operators in tech for mentorship and job consultancy. It’s giving startup employees access to great minds before they have a pitch deck, or even know how to make one.</p>
<p>“As time went on and we spent more time on the ground at tech campuses, we realized not only were the number of young founders going up, but so were the number of top engineers, designers and product heads who were interested in working in tech,” Tarczynski said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/contrary-capital-wants-to-invest-the-next-big-tech-mafia/">when announcing Talent. </a></p>
<p>The arm will be a larger and larger part of Contrary Capital as time goes on, making it more of a venture franchise than a single vertical focus.</p>
<p>Even if the star employees don&#8217;t start their own funds, Talent is acquiring a database of some useful potential hires for their portfolio companies to poach. Tarczynski estimates that five out of the first 50 employees and interns at Ramp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">one of its unicorn portfolio companies</a>, had an affiliation with Contrary Capital.</p>
<p>One bit that has changed for Contrary is that it is no longer doing Demo Days for founders that go through its summer accelerator program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that specifically in this environment, doing things in a programmatic and an annual fashion, is not the move,&#8221; the investor said. &#8220;I think the idea of telling founders that &#8216;oh, now is the time that you should raise for your company&#8217; when their timelines can be totally different, didn&#8217;t make much sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrary&#8217;s second close and expansion so far is clearly adding confidence to the eight-person team. SEC filings show that <a href="https://formds.com/issuers/contrary-capital-iii-l-p">Contrary Capital is already raising its third fund.</a></p>
