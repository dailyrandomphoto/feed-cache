<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan and Aria Alamalhodaei were a bit ambitious this week, which means I dialed back some of the other parts. <em>Let&#8217;s go!</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But before we dive in, I wanted to give a nod to the inaugural effort of the<a href="https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/"> Indy Autonomous Challenge</a>, which was held Saturday. The IAC brought together students from 21 universities from 9 countries, who were charged with programming driverless racecars to compete in a  high-speed autonomous race. The winning team, which received the $1 million grand prize, was the Technical University of Munich. I did not attend, but was told by a few folks who were there that it was a small, yet fun event and solid foundation had been established for this to continue in future years.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start the week with a new-ish company and this week&#8217;s unsung hero of micromobility: <strong>Zoba. </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoba, a Boston-based startup that runs fleet optimization for many major micromobility companies, including <strong>Spin</strong>, just announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/zoba-wants-to-help-micromobility-companies-get-more-rides-increase-profitability/https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/zoba-wants-to-help-micromobility-companies-get-more-rides-increase-profitability/"> $12 million Series A raise.</a></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s AI runs behind the operator&#8217;s fleet management software. Zoba&#8217;s software takes into account shifting local regulations and basically helps micromobility companies get as many customers on vehicles as possible, while being as efficient as possible and helping to adhere to a company&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of bottom lines, <strong>Lime</strong> said CEO <strong>Wayne Ting</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/lime-announces-second-ebitda-profitable-quarter-in-company-history/">said the third quarter of 2021</a> would be the company&#8217;s second profitable quarter, adjusted for EBITDA, of course. While Lime wasn&#8217;t able to generate more sales or revenue to increase top line growth, it seems it was able to increase efficiency in a way that quite possibly has led to profitability. But we&#8217;ll have to take their word for it. Nothing can be certain until the company goes public and dishes up those earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Bolt Mobility</strong> is launching both an in-app navigation system for its e-scooters, called &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/bolt-mobility-launches-in-app-navigation-for-shared-e-scooters/">MobilityOS</a>,&#8221; as well as a new scooter with a built-in smartphone holder that also uses the scooter&#8217;s battery to charge the phone! Let&#8217;s see how that one goes. Is it safer to just listen to audio directions and occasionally try to check your phone while riding, or is it safer to take a cheeky peek down at the screen every now and again?</p>
<p><strong>Helbiz</strong> has partnered with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020005551/en/Helbiz-Partners-with-Fantasmo-to-Integrate-Innovative-E-Scooter-Parking-Technology">mapping company Fantasmo</a> to integrate its parking tech into Helbiz&#8217;s e-scooter app. Fantasmo&#8217;s camera-positioning tech detects the exact location of e-scooters and validates parking within eight inches or less via a rider&#8217;s phone camera. The integration will roll out in Miami first.</p>
<p><strong>Voi</strong> is making a Copenhagen comeback as the city aims to become the world&#8217;s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. Voi, based in neighboring country Sweden, is bringing 800 e-scooters to the Danish metropolis for the next year; the service could be extended another two years if all goes well.</p>
<p><strong>Niu Technologies</strong>, a Chinese electric motor scooter manufacturer, announced it would <a href="https://www.bike-eu.com/products-innovations/nieuws/2021/10/niu-technologies-expands-into-e-bikes-to-grow-international-market-presence-10141497">start making e-bikes</a> in order to help grow its international presence. The e-bike series includes a 15 mph and a 28 mph version. The bikes are pretty heavy at nearly 100 pounds, due to large aluminum frames and oversized dual suspension.</p>
<p>Japanese motorcycle manufacturer <strong>Kawasaki</strong> says it&#8217;s going all-electric in developed countries by 2035, which really gives it plenty of time to get its model together and keep selling gas-powered motorcycles in the meantime.</p>
<p>To compete with <strong>Ola&#8217;s</strong> amazing success selling electric scooters (the big ones, not the kick ones), <strong>Honda</strong> announced it would be selling the same in India. Honda Motorcycle &amp; Scooter India <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/honda-motorcycle-scooter-india-set-to-enter-electric-two-wheeler-segment-in-the-next-fy/articleshow/86946969.cms">told the Economic Times</a> it would have a product within the next financial year.</p>
<p>Finally, at the <strong>Micromobility America</strong> conference last month, micromobility legend Horace Dediu presented the 10 commandments of micromobility, which I now present to you. I do think you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBoG6hH-Z8o&amp;list=PL8xVg_NZwODQT3QPQy2p0ng8dhnEdnHaQ&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=MicromobilityIndustries">watch the video</a>, as well.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Nobody invented micromobility. &#8220;Micromobility is the confluence of thousands of ideas and the work of thousands of people.&#8221; A range of enabling technologies, like lithium ion batteries becoming cheaper, led to this micro outcome.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Most trips are short, which means short trips are more important. 50% of trips are from 0 to 5 miles. That number could actually increase if people have more access to a vehicle that&#8217;s designed for shorter trips.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Cars are a bundle. You can substitute the short trips with smaller vehicles, and you can substitute the bigger trips with bigger vehicles that are shared, like planes, trains and buses.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The smaller it gets, the bigger it gets. And by this he means volumes. For example, Android and iPhone sales far surpass those of PCs and other revolutionary computers, even though they came to market much later. In terms of vehicles, Dediu expects micromobility vehicles to grow much faster than electric vehicles in the future.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> You can&#8217;t get there from here. There are more cars than ever in all of our cities and countries, and based on adoption curves, that number will only increase exponentially. Even if you tried to electrify all cars, emissions would still rise beyond legal limits. But with micromobility, we could have twice the number of drivers with half the amount of emissions.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Don&#8217;t dig where there&#8217;s no treasure. All infrastructure is a sunk cost. All the arguments we have about not changing infrastructure are based on the massive costs associated with infrastructure builds, but those are fallacies. We&#8217;ve destroyed infrastructures in the past. Inner-city highways can be demolished, too.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> They promised flying taxis. We got bike lanes. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent on big moonshots like autonomous vehicles and flying cars, but the simple bike lane is far better and more revolutionary than &#8220;any of this crap.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> You sell miles, but customers buy smiles. The transition to micromobility will happen because people are happy with the vehicles and like riding them.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Micromobility is a mind for the bicycle. Micromobility absorbs data, software, intelligence and sensing. It&#8217;s cheaper and builds on the shoulders of giants, and it&#8217;s increasingly the smartest machine on the road. &#8220;The power of software allows us to invest in solutions to overcome most of our machines&#8217; shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Cities always win. Micromobility is urban freedom. Cities have gone through much worse than coronavirus, and they all came back stronger than ever. Cities are antifragile, the more you stress them, the stronger they become.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Welp &#8230; I&#8217;m not ready to call peak urban air mobility quite yet, but we might be getting close.</p>
<p><strong>HT Aero,</strong> an urban air mobility company that&#8217;s an affiliate of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng, raised an eyebrow-raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/">$500 million in a Series A round</a>. The company said it will use the funds to acquire top-tier talent, advance R&amp;D and &#8220;continue to gain airworthiness provision and certification&#8221; as it advances toward the next generation of its vehicles, according to Deli Zhao, founder and president of the company.</p>
<p>The company recently revealed its fifth-generation flying vehicle, the Xpeng X2, which can handle autonomous flight take-off and landing for certain city scenarios, back-end scheduling, charging and flight control. The company says it wants to provide UAM solutions for individual consumers, rather than businesses, which would certainly be in line with Xpeng&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AirGarage</strong>, a startup that works with parking real estate owners and offers a full-stack software and management service for their lot or garage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/airgarage-a-full-stack-parking-operator-raises-12-5m-in-round-led-by-a16z/">closed a $12.5 million</a> Series A round led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Floodgate, Founders Fund and Abstract Ventures. AirGarage has more than 200 locations across 30 states under its management.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska Airlines</strong> launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/alaska-airlines-launches-new-venture-arm-with-first-investment-in-up-partners-230m-fund/">new venture capital arm</a>, dubbed Alaska Star Ventures. The aim is to find and invest in emerging technologies to help decarbonize air travel. Its first investment was to put $15 million into the Los Angeles-based UP.Partners&#8217; inaugural venture fund. UP.Partners&#8217; $230 million early-stage fund is focused on mobility technologies. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota Motor&#8217;s Woven Planet Group, Standard Industries, Hillwood and OSM Maritime have also invested in the UP.Partners fund.</p>
<p><strong>Ally Financial</strong>, the automotive finance giant, plans to acquire credit card company Fair Square Financial for $750 million, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/finance-insurance/ally-invest-big-credit-cards-750-million-fair-square-deal?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">reported Automotive News</a>.</p>
<p><strong>BMW i Ventures</strong> invested an undisclosed amount into Our Next Energy Inc., a Michigan-based energy storage solutions company working to develop longer range, lower cost batteries for electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>FlixMobility</strong>, the $3 billion-German transportation startup, showed it&#8217;s pretty darned interested in the U.S. market. The company agreed to acquire Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from U.K.-based owner FirstGroup. The deal, which includes a vehicle fleet, trademarks and related assets and liabilities, has an enterprise value on a debt-free/cash-free basis of $46 million, with an unconditional deferred consideration of $32 million with an interest rate of 5% per annum alongside that.* (Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/germanys-flixmobility-acquires-greyhound-lines-the-iconic-u-s-bus-company-in-78m-deal/">Ingrid Lunden&#8217;s article</a> to get deeper into the details, including what that * is all about)</p>
<p><strong>Flock Freight</strong>, the trucking logistics company, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/">$215 million Series D round</a> led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, making it the industry&#8217;s most recent unicorn at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Gatik</strong>, the autonomous vehicle startup, reached a strategic lease and vehicle maintenance agreement with Ryder System, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ryder-invests-in-gatik-partners-on-building-nationwide-autonomous-delivery">Freightwaves reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>River,</strong> an Indian startup focused on the electric two-wheeler market, came out of stealth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/river/">with $2 million</a> in backing from Maniv Mobility and TrucksVC.</p>
<p><strong>Yummy</strong>, the Venezuelan delivery super app founded in 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/yummy-bags-18m-as-its-expands-delivery-app-across-latin-america/">raised $18 million</a> in a Series A round aimed at accelerating the company&#8217;s proposed expansion throughout Latin America. Anthos Capital led the latest round, with additional participation from JAM Fund, whose founder Justin Mateen was an investor in the startup&#8217;s $4 million seed round.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>The big news this week is the appointment of <strong>Missy Cummings</strong>, former Navy fighter pilot and engineering professor at Duke University, to a senior safety advisory role at the nation&#8217;s top vehicle safety regulator.</p>
<p>This kind of appointment might not typically get much notice from the general public. But Tesla fans sure did (side note from transportation editor and The Station creator Kirsten Korosec: the AV industry absolutely took notice; they just didn&#8217;t comment publicly). The reaction from a community of Tesla owners and shareholders was loud — a torrent of concern and vitriol that frothed forth on Twitter and that at times devolved into attacks on Cummings gender and character.</p>
<p>Cummings has been a vocal critic of Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system, and more recently, its rollout of the &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; beta program to thousands of drivers across the United States. On the <strong>McKinsey Global Institute</strong> podcast last month, she called attention to what she referred to as &#8220;mode confusion,&#8221; or when the driver doesn&#8217;t have sufficient understanding of the capabilities (and limitations) of a system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known about this for a long time in aviation, but this is new learning for the automotive world,&#8221; she said on the podcast. &#8220;We see this when people think that Autopilot and Full Self-Driving actually mean those things, and people climb in the backseat or take their hands off the steering wheel and don&#8217;t realize the trouble they&#8217;re in, and the car crashes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as news of the appointment was circulating, Tesla CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> tweeted &#8220;Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.&#8221; That tweet fanned the growing flames of dissent from Tesla fans, many of whom are also shareholders. A petition has even been circulated on Change.org requesting her removal.</p>
<p>Supporters of Tesla have also called attention to Cummings&#8217; service on the board of Veoneer, a Tier 1 company that supplies automakers with advanced driver assistance software and the accompanying hardware such as radars, lidars, thermal night vision cameras and other vision systems. It&#8217;s the lidar — a sensor that most in the industry with the exception of Tesla believe is required to offer fully automated driving — that triggered Tesla fans. <strong>Qualcomm</strong> recently reached an agreement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/">acquire Veoneer</a>.</p>
<p>Her critics suggest that the <strong>National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration</strong> may take a more conservative stance on ADAS and Tesla in the future. (It should be noted that NHTSA has in the past has generally taken rather laissez faire approach with Tesla; anything beyond that will seem as if the regulatory gates have come crashing down on the automaker.) It is unclear whether she will take an advisory role in the investigation into Autopilot currently underway at NHTSA, which was opened following 12 incidents of Teslas crashing into parked emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Kirsten here with a side note on this issue: Missy Cummings first protected and then ended up deleting her Twitter account because she was not just trolled; she received death threats, which are being investigated, according to my sources.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> FSD <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/elon-musk-rolls-back-newest-full-self-driving-beta-due-to-software-issues/">software beta was rolled back</a> Sunday. Musk tweeted Sunday &#8220;Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The other piece of news that caught my eye this week  &#8230;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> have been lobbying the government to include provisions to boost electric vehicle adoption in the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in Congress.</p>
<p>The two ride-hailing giants have made sweeping, ambitious pledges that all rides booked on their platforms will be taken in an electric vehicle by 2030 &#8212; a goal that each company is unlikely to reach without hefty government support.</p>
<p>Both companies consider cost and lack of charging infrastructure to be two key obstacles to larger EV uptake, according to reporting from E&amp;E News. And it&#8217;s true that for many, electric vehicles remain prohibitively expensive, especially compared to the plethora of used internal combustion engine vehicles available&#8230; well, basically anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our population of drivers who use our app, they are coming from lower-income communities, and they&#8217;re serving mobility in urban areas,&#8221; Adam Gromis, a sustainability policy manager with Uber, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/uber-lyft-lobby-for-ev-reconciliation-provisions/">told E&amp;E News</a>. &#8220;So for us, we want to see slow charging in underserved neighborhoods and multiunit dwellings, and we want to see fast charging in urban areas and areas of high mobility demand.</p>
<p>According to the spending transparency platform OpenSecrets, Uber and Lyft have each spent close to $1 million so far in the first half of the year on lobbying efforts, though each employed fewer lobbyists overall. Data on third quarter lobbying spending is not yet available.</p>

<p>Keeping this short — and a bit of a mishmash — this week.</p>
<p><strong>Elon Musk&#8217;s</strong> Boring Company received initial approval to build a transportation system that would shuttle passengers in Tesla vehicles via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-loop-expand-strip/">network of tunnels under Las Vegas</a>. The special use permit and franchise agreement would allow the Boring Company to expand its Vegas Loop system beyond its current 1.7-mile footprint that connects the Las Vegas Convention Center campus to a 29-mile route with 51 stations that would include stops at casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, the city&#8217;s football stadium and UNLV. It would eventually reach the McCarran International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> released its first and long overdue <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf">safety report</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, the universal rewards app that lets users earn miles for every mile traveled, has launched in Japan. The expansion aims to build off of Miles&#8217; marketplace, which now offers users 500 personalized rewards from 350 brands, including Garmin, Hulu, Japan Airlines, Red Bull and Under Armour.</p>
<p><strong> Motional</strong>, the autonomous vehicle joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, is partnering with Transport for New South Wales too help the Australian state better understand the technology and possibilities that come with a driverless ride-hail service.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, self-driving truck technology developer, said it plans to expand into Europe. The company has hired Bosch veteran Sun-Mi &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Choi as senior director of business development to accelerate that European expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong>, which filed to go public, said in a recent regulatory filing that it expects to <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/rivian-expects-q3-net-loss-about-12-billion-higher-ev-production-costs?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">record a quarterly net loss</a> of up to $1.28 billion due to costs associated with the start of production of its debut truck. The net loss for the period ended Sept. 30 will range from $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion, according to the preliminary results.</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis</strong>, the automaker formed through a merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/stellantis-lg-energy-to-build-u-s-battery-factory-in-new-joint-venture/">reached a preliminary deal</a> with <strong>LG Energy Solution</strong> to produce battery cells and modules in North America.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> continued its profitability streak, reporting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/">net income of $1.62 billion</a> in the third quarter. That&#8217;s a nearly fivefold increase from the $331 million it earned in the same period last year. The record-setting profit came thanks to record sales and despite a global chip shortage and supply chain constraints that have affected the industry. Notably, Tesla was able to earn that record net income (on a GAAP basis) even as the vast majority of its sales came from its cheaper Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Wolfe Research</strong> went out and rode in an Argo AI autonomous test vehicle. The tl;dr is that they saw great progress and the vehicle was able to navigate an environment packed with cars, double parked trucks, street-cleaners, e-bikes, aggressively driven scooters, and pedestrians. &#8220;For the most part the vehicle performed complex decisions (yielding or not yielding to pedestrians, unprotected left turns, adjusting to construction),&#8221; the report said. Their takeaway: &#8220;We tested an Argo&#8217;s AV. And it reinforced our view that this technology is coming sooner, with potential for greater disruption than investors currently appreciate.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Zoox</strong>, the autonomous vehicle startup acquired last year by <strong>Amazon</strong>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/amazons-zoox-is-expanding-autonomous-vehicle-operations-testing-to-seattle/">expanding to Seattle</a>. The company plans to open in 2022 an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing. The company, which today employs more than 1,300 people, tests its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City, California, near its headquarters. The company started testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads in Las Vegas in 2019.</p>
<p>I spoke to co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson and he said Zoox has been eyeing Seattle as a test site for years. The company even completed a small pilot in the city in late 2019. The frequency of rain in the area is one of the primary reasons Zoox picked Seattle, Levinson said.</p>
<p>Zoox has developed some advanced weather proofing, including what Levinson described as &#8220;active rain mitigation&#8221; for its sensors. &#8220;We&#8217;re very excited about that and we want to test it and validate it in the rain; Seattle is a great place for that,&#8221; Levinson said.</p>
<p>While Zoox is setting up operations in the city where Amazon is based, Levinson emphasized that the two companies still operate separately. The Zoox office and operations hub will not be housed on the Amazon campus, for instance. Zoox will take advantage of its proximity to Amazon to work with the company on various collaborations in the future, Levinson said, describing that as an &#8220;extra bonus.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based e-scooter rentals company Tier Mobility has announced a $200 million raise which it says is the &#8220;first close&#8221; of its Series D, as investors continue to plough money into urban micromobility.</p>
<p>The startup confirmed to TechCrunch it will be raising a larger amount before the Series D is closed out (and the full round will also be a mix of debt and equity; although this first tranche is equity only).</p>
<p>However it declined to specify how much it&#8217;s targeting for the full Series D raise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223190" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As part of the Series D round we just did our first close and seek to increase the equity round plus raise a new debt facility,&#8221; said a Tier spokesman.</p>
<p>Tier&#8217;s PR also describes today&#8217;s first close as &#8220;part of a broader equity and debt raise&#8221;.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <a href="https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/press-releases/story/TIER_raises_200mln_Series_D_funding_round_to_fulfil_its_mission_to_Change_Mobility_For_Good-ZAWYA20211025061342/">announcement</a> follows a $60M debt raise this summer, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">$250M Series C last November</a> (led by SoftBank).</p>
<p>Micromobility startups typically have high capex costs, especially as they expand their fleets during periods of expansion, so debt raises are fairly common.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Alex Gayer, chief financial officer at Tier Mobility, said: &#8220;This equity funding provides further firepower to scale our multimodal market presence globally, and pursue strategic investments &amp; acquisitions. Our vehicle capex needs will be serviced with the debt capacity unlocked. Our goal is to build Tier into the European micro-mobility powerhouse, building on our current position as the number one player in the shared electric scooters market.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tier banks $60 million in debt from Goldman Sachs to expand scooter fleet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/embed/#?secret=73ZOamfwGm" data-secret="73ZOamfwGm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Existing investor SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is co-leading the Series D with the UAE-based Mubadala Capital, which also backed Tier&#8217;s Series C last year, while other existing investors RTP Global, Novator, White Star Capital, Northzone, and Speedinvest also participating.</p>
<p>Mubadala&#8217;s increased backing for Tier follows it jumping into the UAE&#8217;s market last year &#8212; after it was selected by the local Roads &amp; Transport Authority, following a lengthy trial of scooter rentals.</p>
<p>The funding also includes sees new investors joining &#8212; including the green impact fund M&amp;G Investments and Mountain Partners, a diversified global investment holding.</p>
<p>Tier said its micromobility business is now valued at $2BN (which is up around double from the value <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d21036-96ef-499c-80e5-653d4aea3e52">being reported</a> around the time of its Series C last year) &#8212; saying it&#8217;s raised a total of $660M in equity and debt funding to date.</p>
<p>The 2018 launched e-scooter, e-bike and e-moped startup competes in a highly competitive space with a myriad of players, including the likes of Bird, Dott, Lime, Voi and Wind (to name a few) &#8212; although authorities in cities around the world have sought to bring a little structure to the fast-developing micromobility market by setting limits on the number of operators allowed per city. That means that winning a slot as a city provider can help leapfrog competitors at a local level.</p>
<p>In the press release, Tier, for example, trumpets its recent win of a tender to provide e-scooters for rent in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/">a trial in London</a> (alongside Dott and Lime). Other new cities it touts are both in the Middle East: Manama (Bahrain) and Doha (Qatar).</p>
<p>It also operates in Paris &#8212; where city authorities have been making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">big push to shift the urban transport mix away from cars</a> to alternatives like bikes and public transport. So it can claim some major wins.</p>
<p>To-date, Tier says it&#8217;s deployed 135,000 e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds across 150 cities in 16 countries &#8212; claiming to have established itself as &#8220;the European market leader through unrivalled capital efficiency and operational excellence&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based startup&#8217;s plan for the new funding is for &#8220;acquisitions and strategic investments&#8221;, as well as for further international expansion &#8212; with Tier saying it will be targeting coverage across strategic growth markets, in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>So it sounds like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">more consolidation</a> is headed for the fast-paced e-scooter market as fresh dollars pour in. (And one way to circumvent city-imposed limits on the number of operators &#8212; to grab further scale &#8212; would be to buy up rivals that have won tenders in cities you haven&#8217;t&#8230; )</p>
<p>Tier also says it will be directing some of the investment into continuing to roll out its network of battery charging stations hosted by local businesses, aka the Tier Energy Network.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the launch of e-bikes in several European countries, Tier is expanding its growing range of multimodal options, making it the first European micro-mobility provider to offer users three different types of vehicles in one app,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lawrence Leuschner, CEO and co-founder, said: “The funding provides Tier with additional resources to fulfil our mission to Change Mobility For Good. Clocking more than 80 million trips, replacing over 13 million car rides, in such a short amount of time exemplifies that cities around the world look for ways to make their transport networks safer and move towards a zero-emission future.”</p>
<p>“Lawrence, Matthias and Alex&#8217;s passion for change can be felt across the organisation &#8212; from Tier&#8217;s hub in Dubai to their HQ in Berlin,&#8221; added Amer Alaily, director at Mubadala Capital Ventures, Europe, in another supporting statement. &#8220;They have quickly emerged as not only a leader in the European micro-mobility space, but one whose commitment to sustainability sets them apart from their competitors. We are proud to have been part of their journey and look forward to remaining a partner to Lawrence and his team for years to come.”</p>
<p><em>This report was updated after Tier confirmed to us that this $200M raise is a first all-equity tranche of what it intends will be a larger Series D &#8212; which will be a mix of debt and equity once closed</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.routine.co">Routine</a>, a new startup working on a productivity tool that should help you manage your work day more efficiently. It’s a brand new take on to-do lists as it combines both tasks, non-actionable notes and a daily planner.</p>
<p>The two co-founders of Routine are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienquintard">Julien Quintard</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentin-hocquet-27a3224">Quentin Hocquet</a>, two French entrepreneurs who previously created Infinit, a startup I covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/infinit/">several times</a>. Docker acquired Infinit back in <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-acquires-infinit/">2016</a>.</p>
<p>They are teaming up once again to create Routine. Right now, Routine is an app for macOS and iOS that works with your Google account. After setting up your account, Routine helps you figure out “what am I supposed to do right now?” at any point in time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One of the most opinionated feature of Routine is the dashboard. Whatever you’re doing on your computer, you can pull up the Routine dashboard with a simple keyboard shortcut. By default, that shortcut is Ctrl-Space.</p>
<p>The Routine app adds an overlay on top of your screen with a few widgets. It looks a bit like the now-defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(macOS)">Dashboard</a> on macOS. On that dashboard, you’ll find a handful of things. On the left, you can see the tasks you have to complete today.</p>
<p>On the right, you can see how much time you have left before your next meeting and some information about that event. The date is pulled directly from your Google Calendar account.</p>
<p>In the center of the screen, Routine displays a big input field called the Console. You can type text and then press enter to create a new task from there. It works a bit like the ‘Quick Add’ feature in <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222475" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222475" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2222475" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-dashboard.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222475" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Routine</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that you can add a task without wasting time opening your to-do app, moving to the right project, clicking the add task button and entering text into several fields. With Routine, you can press Ctrl-Space, type some text, press enter and you’re done.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also use the Console to schedule task directly using natural language. For instance, you can type ‘Take out trash every Wednesday at 7pm’ and Routine will create a new item every Wednesday.</p>
<p>Once your tasks are in Routine, you can manage them from the Routine app. In addition to the regular to-do app actions, such as rescheduling a task or marking it as complete, you can allocate some time for bigger tasks. From the Today interface, you can move a task from the task list to your calendar. It automatically creates a calendar event with that task.</p>

<p>The app is a much a to-do app as a note-taking app. Each task represents a page. From that page, you get a Notion-like editor. You can write text, add headings, dividers and photos, create bulleted lists and more.</p>
<p>And if you create a task within a task, it automatically becomes a full-fledged Routine task. You can schedule it, insert it in your calendar and more. This works a bit like Evernote’s recent update with its <a href="https://evernote.com/features/tasks">new take on tasks</a>. Essentially, tasks remain in context.</p>
<p>As Routine integrates directly with your calendar, you can also open each event in your calendar and take notes from there. Essentially, each event is also a note by itself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222478" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222478" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png" alt="" width="1024" height="664" class="size-full wp-image-2222478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png 1985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Routine-screen-meeting-notes.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222478" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Routine</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Routine lets you create Pages. Each Page is a document that can hold tasks or notes. You can use it to create various lists, such as grocery lists, packing lists and watch lists. You can also use it to store evergreen information, such as recipes or restaurants you like.</p>
<p>Routine is currently in closed beta. The startup has participated in Y Combinator’s W21 batch and raised a $2.7 million pre-seed round from BoxGroup and TargetGlobal. Several business angels also participated, such as Matt Robinson, Clément Delangue and Ian Hogarth.</p>
<p>I played around with the app and it’s an interesting take on both to-do lists and note-taking. Some people rely heavily on a to-do app, but they can’t store notes in there that easily. Other people store everything in a note-taking app. But they can’t easily view all their tasks at once. Routine aims to bridge that gap, so it’s going to be interesting to see whether the company manages to create a loyal community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://vendease.com/">Vendease</a>, an online marketplace that allows restaurants and other food businesses to buy supplies straight from manufacturers and farms, has raised a seed round of $3.2 million, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news is coming seven months after TechCrunch announced that the company, founded in January 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/backed-by-yc-vendease-is-building-amazon-prime-for-restaurants-in-africa/">took part in Y Combinator’s winter batch</a> that included nine other African startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture capital firm Global Founders Capital led the seed round. Y Combinator, Hustle Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Hack VC and Soma Capital participated, including individual local investors and early backers such as Paga CEO Tayo Oviosu, Remita CEO John Obaro and Magic Fund. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease tries to solve the challenges and inefficiencies in Africa’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fragmented food sector, starting with Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company found a sweet spot in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decentralized marketplace play connecting suppliers and farms on one side with restaurants and food businesses on another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a restaurant or food business places an order, the system generates all the possible suppliers that can fulfill it, looks at the best pricing versus quality and assigns that order to the supplier. According to the company, delivery </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within 24 hours, either by itself or third-party logistics providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company recognized that these businesses needed more quality and operational help. While some complained of delivery times and quality of food supplies, others did not have sophisticated operations to handle them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tunde-kara-a0345121">Tunde Kara</a> tells TechCrunch that this led to Vendease building a series of stacks &#8212;  logistics, storage, payments, inventory management, embedded finance &#8212; to control the movement of food supplies from one point of production to the endpoint of consumption.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So when we say we’re building the operating system for food supply, this is what we mean,” said Kara, who founded the company with <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-fayankin-3a450339">Olumide Fayankin</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/gatumialiyu">Gatumi Aliyu</a>, and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/waleoyepeju">Wale Oyepeju</a> Olumide Fayankin, Gatumi Aliyu and Wale Oyepeju.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease says it has also employed extensive quality control measures for the food supplies on its platform at the point of delivery or acceptance into its warehouse. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform also has an option that allows food businesses to receive free supplies for any order that turns out unsatisfactory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223078" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223078" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223078 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?w=680" alt="Vendease" width="680" height="371" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg 6240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=1536,838 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=2048,1118 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vendease-FoundAnts-5.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223078" class="wp-caption-text">Vendease founders (Wale Oyepeju, Gatumi Aliyu, Olumide Fayankin, and Tunde Kara)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the time Vendease launched until now, one thing has remained constant in the industry it plays in: the fluctuation of food prices in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With one of the highest inflation rates in the world, the country saw prices of food items such as beans <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226123/percentage-change-in-prices-of-selected-food-products-in-nigeria/">grow by over 70%</a> from July 2020 to July 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/nigeria/food-inflation">report</a> says the cost of food in the country has increased 19.57% in September 2021 compared to the same month last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some of the unforeseen but combat-ready issues agritech and food tech startups have to deal with to scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Vendease’s case, Kara says the company has created a predictive analysis and storage system to help businesses predict future food prices, store food in advance, and peg their prices for any duration depending on the food category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process, according to the CEO, has saved businesses on the platform a ton of money and human capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we compare market prices to what users buy on our platform, we’ve approximately saved them about $480,000 in the last nine months, cutting a lot of unnecessary expenses from their general costs &#8212; savings that can go into other things </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expansion and growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara says the company hopes to 10x this number in the next 12 to 18 months. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in our small way, we are helping to grow the GDP for the food businesses both on the farmers and vendor side of the marketplace,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> human capital, Kara states the businesses on Vendease have saved approximately about 5,000 person-hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Vendease has moved 100,000 metric tonnes of food, Kara added. For a startup that is a little over eighteen months old, moving that amount of food is a noteworthy feat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving this quantity, coupled with Vendease’s technology stack, has allowed the company to analyze what its customers want before making their orders, which is why the company now has its warehouses and logistics service.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Backed by YC, Vendease is building Amazon Prime for restaurants in Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/backed-by-yc-vendease-is-building-amazon-prime-for-restaurants-in-africa/embed/#?secret=ncucus7tVQ" data-secret="ncucus7tVQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the YC-backed company hit an annualized transaction volume of $12.9 million and $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kara did not share revenue numbers, he said Vendease’s revenue has grown 17x since last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform’s financing side, over 1,000 businesses have accessed more than $3 million in supply chain finance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so far</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms digitizing the food supply chain for restaurants and food businesses across the continent have been scarce in Africa since Twiga launched in Kenya seven years ago (however, with a slightly different model).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Vendease is in the fray, it wants to establish itself as the leader amongst an upcoming pack with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newer players such as Kenya’s Kibanda TopUp. A requisite to that, according to Kara, is Vendease’s execution and operational knowledge of the market and data on food businesses; he believes they will give the company an edge over other platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But then we don’t see competition as a winner take all situation. We see it as validation for the work that we’re doing,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendease currently operates in three Nigerian cities &#8212; Lagos, Abuja and Ibadan, with some of the biggest food brands in the country such as Hard Rock, Krispy Kreme and Shiro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara says the company will use the funding to expand into other cities and countries before the end of Q1 next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the funding allows Vendease to continue to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build out its technology stack, secure partnerships with some payment platforms and banks to deepen its financial products, especially buy now, pay later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the managing partner at Global Founders Capital said, “As a backer of one of Africa’s very first unicorns, Jumia, we’ve seen a great deal of talent in the market &#8211; and Tunde &amp; the Vendease team are best in class both in EMEA and globally. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their laser focus and rapid growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unprecedented</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and there’s a massive opportunity ahead.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.hera.so">Hera</a>, a new calendar app that wants to turn the calendar into the main work interface. Hera helps you schedule meetings more easily with natural language processing and lets you share availabilities in an email or any messaging app. The startup is also going to build integrations with your other work tools so that you can surface important information before a meeting and extract information after a meeting.</p>
<p>So far, Hera has raised a $465,000 (€400,000) pre-seed round led by Eurazeo (under the Idinvest brand at the time) and several business angels. It has then joined Y Combinator’s S21 batch and raised a $1.7 million seed round led by Eurazeo.</p>
<p>Business angels who invested in the company include Alexis Bonillo, Thibaud Elzière, Kyle Parrish, Calvin French-Owen, John Gabaix and Karthik Puvvada. Notion Capital and Kima Ventures also invested.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222584" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hera first started as a calendar app focused on note-taking during meetings. Since attending Y Combinator, the product has evolved quite a lot. It is now focused on managing the entire lifecycle of an event for busy people who manage a lot of (virtual) meetings.</p>
<p>First, Hera can help you schedule a meeting and get ready for a meeting. In just a few clicks, you can select multiple slots. Hera then generates a friendly text that you can copy and paste in an email thread, in a WhatsApp conversation or wherever you’re talking about your next meeting.</p>
<p>This is a much friendlier interface for the person receiving the message compared to traditional meeting scheduling tools. You don’t have to generate a link, and the person on the other end doesn’t have to click on a link to find out when this meeting could take place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222585" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2222585" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png 3016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=1536,961 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=2048,1281 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Availabilities.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hera</p></div></p>
<p>Second, Hera is going to pull context about your upcoming meetings. Chances are you already have a ton of info about people you’re meeting with. You send and receive emails, you may use a CRM and you may be meeting several times a year.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to become a project management platform, we’re going to integrate with tools that you already use,” co-founder and CEO Bruno Vegreville told me.</p>
<p>Hera lets you take some notes before the meeting so that you don’t forget about something. During the meeting, you can add more notes and then export this data to your favorite note-taking app, such as Notion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222586" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222586" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" class="size-full wp-image-2222586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png 3104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NoteTaking.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hera</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, Hera works best for users who want to take Google Calendar to the next level. Up next, the company wants to add some multiplayer components. For instance, you can imagine better scheduling if both people are currently using Hera. You could also imagine mentioning other Hera users directly in your calendar to get feedback on a meeting.</p>
<p>Hera has been in private beta for the past few months. The startup’s vision is quite clear. Some productivity tools, such as <a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a>, have made people more efficient when it comes to sorting threads and acting on incoming emails. If you consider meetings as threads, Hera could become the Superhuman of calendars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As scores of Indian startups populate their catalogs with live and recorded courses to reach and serve students in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, a handful of new-age firms are beginning to explore different approaches to tackle the challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teachmint.com">Teachmint</a>, one such startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/indian-edtech-teachmint-raises-20-million-to-expand-to-new-categories-and-geographies/">helping teachers and institutes create their own virtual classrooms</a> with a few taps on their smartphones and build direct relationship with students, has raised $78 million in its Series B financing round, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed.</p>
<p>Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital co-led the new round, the startup said on Monday. The new round values the 16-month-old Indian edtech firm at $500 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. (Teachmint has raised over $115 million to date.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, confirmed the size of the new funding round in a text message, but declined to comment on the valuation. Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital as well as existing investors Learn Capital, CM Ventures, Lightspeed India and Better Capital also participated in the round, he said.</p>
<p>The new investment comes months after the startup was approached by one of the two Indian edtech giants that offered Teachmint a $400 million acquisition price, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Teachmint declined the offer. Gupta declined to comment.</p>
<p>The startup, which began its journey just weeks after the pandemic broke, is building what it calls the &#8220;ed-infra&#8221; for teachers in India to help them take online classes, engage with students virtually, assign them tasks, conduct attendance and also collect fees.</p>
<p>This approach is different from edtech giants such as Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, and Vedantu, where teachers don&#8217;t have a direct relationship with their students.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And Teachmint&#8217;s model is working. The startup has amassed over 10 million users in the country, it said. It also offers its ed-infra service to institutes and said over 4,000 such institutions in India and overseas are using it.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s online education market with over 200 million school-going children. The market is estimated to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2025 (up from about $1 billion last year), according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since inception, we have been laser-focused on addressing the big technology-infrastructure gap that exists in education. Over the past 16 months, we have been humbled by the experience of powering the teaching and learning infrastructure for millions of teachers and students across India,&#8221; said Gupta.</p>
<p>&#8220;From supporting individual teachers to powering K-12 schools, coaching institutes, colleges, universities and even EdTechs, we are disrupting technology penetration in education at an unprecedented pace. We are thrilled to welcome onboard Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital along with Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital. We are also grateful to have the continuous support of our existing investors as we execute our vision at the global stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to hire talent across product, technology, and design roles and will soon offer its employees its biggest stock buyback option.</p>
<p>“Teachmint has addressed a latent technology problem in the education sector and are well positioned to scale their offering globally. Strong leadership combined with the passion and conviction to solve this, makes us a strong believer. We are glad to be on this rocket-ship,&#8221; said Madhu Shalini Iyer, Partner at Rocketship.vc, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Buy now, pay later services like Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/scalapay-raises-155m-at-a-700m-valuation-as-buy-now-pay-later-services-continue-to-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uks-zilch-raises-80m-at-a-500m-valuation-for-its-direct-to-consumer-buy-now-pay-later-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a> have seen their businesses grow in huge leaps, as consumers buying goods increasingly turned to alternatives to credit to delay paying for them in full. Now a Berlin-based startup called <a href="https://www.billie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billie</a> that has built a similar service &#8212; but specifically targeting B2B transactions &#8212; is seeing a lift of its own boat from that rising tide. </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The company has raised $100 million in a Series C round of funding, money that it will be using to continue building out the range of BNPL-type services that it provides to organizations buying goods to run their businesses, both in Europe and further afield after passing 100,000 customers earlier this year.</p>
<p>The round is a mark of just how popular BNPL has become as a concept in the payments stack, but also how much investors are looking to get in on the act: the funding is coming in at a $640 million valuation, the company has confirmed, growing nearly 4x since its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/billie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 million (€30 million) Series B in 2019</a>. Billie says that this is the largest round yet in the B2B BNPL space &#8212; which itself is also getting pretty crowded: competitors in this category including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resolve</a>, a spinout of Affirm; and <a href="https://shifter.no/nyheter/mytisk-vc-fond-gjor-sin-forste-norske-investering/214140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tillit</a>, which is backed by Sequoia (which also backs Klarna).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223160" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What is also notable about Billie&#8217;s round is that it has a very interesting mix of financial and strategic investors. London&#8217;s D<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">awn Capital, a specialist in B2B startups, led the round, with internet giant Tencent and Klarna also participating; previous backers Creandum, Speedinvest, Picus and GFC are also in the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Klarna&#8217;s investment comes on the back of a <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/press/billie-and-klarna-launch-a-global-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major strategic deal</a> between it and Billie. As Matthias Knecht, co-founder and co-CEO of Billie, told TechCrunch, the two are integrating their services, and it will mean that in cases where Billie has a stronger payments relationship, but a consumer transaction arises, Klarna will handle the sale; and in cases where Klarna is present but Billie is not, and a business is doing the buying, Billie&#8217;s services will kick in. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3">Related to that, the company is also announcing hefty debt refinancing of $200 million <em>per month</em> (money to run the BNPL financing), coming from a consortium of German banks led by VVRB (Vereinigte Volksbank Raiffeisenbank eG), with Raisin Bank and Varengold Bank also participating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Billie has been around since 2016 and has actually been working in the concept of &#8220;BNPL&#8221; targeting businesses long before that became an established concept and term, as part of a bigger suite of products to service businesses and their incoming and outgoing payments needs. Its ambition was simple: since B2B transactions make up more than twice the volume of B2C transactions, there should be more tools for businesses &#8212; especially SMBs &#8212; to make those transactions as easy to handle as B2C ones. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its other main product, in addition to the financing point-of-sale tool, is an invoicing service to help businesses collect money from others. (Indeed, it&#8217;s also the basis of its name, with Billie being a reference to &#8216;billing.&#8217;) Invoicing, Knecht tells me, is still a big part of its business with paying on invoice still a huge part (95% prefer it, he said) of how businesses want to pay for things. However, the bigger growth opportunity right now is BNPL, so for the moment it is doubling down on that with this investment. </span></p>
<p>A logical question might be why B2C giants in the BNPL space are not doing more B2B business directly. Knecht tells me that it comes down to very different data points and market dynamics when it comes to businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason the B2C players do not do B2B is because they see themselves as strong consumer brands,&#8221; Knecht said, pointing out how Klarna and others are increasingly raising their profile through their own apps a window for shoppers to discover and buy goods. &#8220;They are going away from solely being a payment method and towards a shopping experience for consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he added, there are other reasons, too: business purchases are more complex than consumer ones, and ticket sizes are often 10 times more than the typical consumer transactions. He said the latter range from €60 to €100. (Note: Billie did not disclose updated figures how much it has financed to date, or customer numbers, but it notes <a href="https://www.billie.io/ueber-uns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its site</a> that as of February 2021, it had worked with 100,000 businesses and financed €750 million in purchases by May 2021.)</p>
<p>And on top of this, the concept of &#8220;business&#8221; is also more complex: it can include a sole trader, a limited company, a school, a fire department, and so much more. This means completely different financing considerations at the BNPL end, and lots of different identity and other checks that need to be run.</p>
<p>While consumer services tend to get a lot more of the spotlight when it comes to e-commerce, B2B is not a small part of the bigger business opportunity. One <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273104/us-b2b-e-commerce-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimate</a> puts the percentage of B2B as between 14 percent (2020) and 17 percent (2023) of all e-commerce in the U.S., but that will work out to $1.7 trillion by the later date. Another estimate &#8212; the figures shift depending on what you are including in the category of B2B e-commerce, among other differences in calculation methodology &#8212; says that <a href="https://www.growglobal.com/global-e-commerce-b2b-e-commerce-5-times-bigger-than-b2c-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as of 2020 B2B was already five times as big as B2C</a>, working out to over $21 trillion in sales globally.</p>
<p>Over time, of course, you could see how consolidation is bound to come to the space. That makes a company like Billie a strong target for those payments giants &#8212; BNPL or otherwise &#8212; that might want to build out bigger platforms that integrate this function more tightly.</p>
<p><span class="s3">“As a specialist B2B investor with a deep fintech focus, we’ve been closely following Billie and the evolution of the B2B BNPL market. Over the last few years, we’ve built a trusted relationship with Matthias, Christian and Aiga, impressed by the clarity of their vision, rapid growth and deep experience not only in B2B payments but in the wider risk and regulatory landscape too. We are confident they are well on the way to revolutionising the B2B payments market and excited to join them on the journey ahead.” says Josh Bell, General Partner at Dawn Capital, in a statement. </span><span class="s4"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Knecht declined to comment on M&amp;A but described Klarna as a &#8220;close relationship.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://wefight.co">Wefight</a>, a French startup that has developed more than a dozen apps to help people suffering from chronic illness. Using a basic chatbot interface, people can ask questions and get answers about their illness.</p>
<p>The startup recently raised a $11.6 million (€10 million) funding round from Digital Health Ventures, Impact Partners, as well as existing investors Investir&amp;+ and BADGE’s business angels.</p>
<p>Wefight has developed a different app for each chronic illness. They’re all based on the same virtual assistant called Vik. There are currently more than a dozen apps about depression, asthma, multiple cancers, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Essentially, Vik acts as an interface between the patient and Wefight’s content. The company has developed everything in-house, from natural-language processing technology to the framework that Wefight leverages to create new apps.</p>
<p>Every time a patient asks a question, the service tries to understand the meaning of the question and finds relevant information in the knowledge database.</p>
<p>It can then relay and serve content to the patient. Content has been written by professional pharmacists and tries to be as informative and neutral as possible. This way, you don’t necessarily have to wait for your next doctor’s appointment to go through your list of questions.</p>
<p>“Vik isn’t going to replace someone in the care pathway. It’s there to fill a gap,” co-founder and CEO Benoit Brouard told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it seems like there’s a gap indeed. More than 400,000 people have tried the service so far. Vik has delivered 5 million answers. There are 70 people working for Wefight right now. Wefight tries to find new users by talking with patient organizations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the business model, Wefight works with pharmaceutical companies to finance new apps. Turning a treatment into a commercial success involves making sure that patients can identify the chronic illness they’re suffering from. And Vik acts as a top-of-the-funnel content provider.</p>
<p>“We reduce clinical inertia. When a lab decides to finance Vik Asthma, the lab doesn’t have any influence on the content that we create,” Brouard said. “Laboratories want patients who suffer from asthma to go and see a pulmonologist,” he added.</p>
<p>This way, the pool of patients who could potentially end up buying a specific drug is bigger. It’s a convoluted sales strategy for pharmaceutical companies. But something like Vik could improve the quality of life of patients.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to other countries with a new office in Berlin. Every time Wefight launches an app in a new market, the company hires local health professionals and contact local patient organizations. It’s a long process, but that’s how Wefight can get it right for patients all around the world.</p>

SoftBank’s Latin American Fund and GGV participated as new investors, in addition to existing backers Kaszek, BigBets, Nubank CEO David Velez [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.justos.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a startup that says it will be the first insurance company in Brazil to use data when determining rates, has raised a $35.8 million Series A round of funding led by Ribbit Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank’s Latin American Fund and GGV participated as new investors, in addition to existing backers Kaszek, BigBets, Nubank CEO David Velez and Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia Ottati</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Justos had announced a $2.8 million seed raise that included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kaszek, one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America, and the CEOs of several unicorns including Assaf Wand, CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; Sergio Furio, founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist, founder of iFood and Fritz Lanman, CEO of ClassPass. Senior executives from Robinhood, Stripe, Wise, Carta and Capital One had also put money in the round.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222765" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha, Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio Molins co-founded Justos, having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass, Netflix and Airbnb. The trio, ironically none of whom are Brazilian, ​​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">met while playing soccer on an amateur team in San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Justos has yet to officially launch its product and has already attracted such a large group of high-profile investors is notable. According to CEO Chadha, its launch is “imminent,” and the company already has 12,000 “leads” on its waitlist. So far, it has launched a driving test and quoting app and in advance of its formal launch, it has been collecting data from the driving test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to get insurance in the country, by any accounts, is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy. Insurers also take their time in resolving claims related to car damages and loss due to accidents, the entrepreneurs say. They also charge that pricing is often not fair or transparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos aims to improve the whole auto insurance process in Brazil by measuring the way people drive to help price their insurance policies. Similar to Root here in the U.S., Justos intends to collect users’ data through their mobile phones so that it can “more accurately and assertively price different types of risk.” This way, the startup claims it can offer plans that are up to 30% cheaper than traditional plans, and grant discounts each month, according to the driving patterns of the previous month of each customer. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We measure how safely people drive using the sensors on their cell phones,” Chadha told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “This allows us to offer cheaper insurance to users who drive well, thereby reducing biases that are inherent in the pricing models used by traditional insurance companies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos also plans to use artificial intelligence and computerized vision to analyze and process claims more quickly and machine learning for image analysis and to create bots that help accelerate claims processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has a social good component. The startup has agreed to support five nonprofit organizations in its first year: Instituto Ayrton Senna (education), AACD (disability), Gerando Falcões (economic opportunity), Casa 1 (LGBTQ) and Conexsus (sustainable development in the Amazon). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It intends to cap its profit so part of the amount that is not used to pay claims is donated to those institutions in its first year of operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says the company: “The partnerships reinforce the insurtech&#8217;s disruptive vision, which, as its name suggests, aims to build a more transparent relationship with its customers and effectively contribute to improving society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurtech plans to use its new capital to continue to hire, and expand its area of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">operations, as well as toward launching other lines of insurance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The startup has a team of 30 with the goal of having 50 employees by year&#8217;s end and 200 by the end of 2022.</span></p>
<p>Nick Shalek, general partner at Ribbit Capital, said his firm invested in Justos<span class="s1"> &#8220;because of the huge market opportunity and the caliber and technical prowess of the team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;With over 20 years of experience in Silicon Valley as entrepreneurs and at Netflix, Airbnb and ClassPass, we believe that the Justos team is well positioned to reinvent insurance in Latin America by focusing on creating customer value, lowering prices and expanding the market,&#8221; he wrote via e-mail.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company has temporarily pulled back the latest version of the company&#8217;s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software less than a day after its release.</p>

It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA (quality assurance), hence public beta.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">This news comes as Tesla is under fire from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">regulators questioning the safety</a> of its advanced driver assistance system that is branded &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; after several vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles while the system was engaged. Autopilot comes standard on Tesla vehicles. The so-called FSD software is an additional $10,000 and offers more automated driving features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. It is still an advanced driver assistance system, and drivers need to be fully attentive even when FSD is engaged. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/?tpcc=ECTW2020">recent MIT study</a> found drivers tend to be less attentive which can lead to safety risks.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2">Version 10.3 was meant to be released to some Tesla owners on Friday, and on Saturday Musk said they would need to wait another day.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-4">&#8220;Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in 10.3&#8221; he tweeted on Saturday. &#8220;Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Videos posted by beta users of the 10.3 software show multiple Forward Collision Warnings despite there being no immediate danger, and some vehicles even auto-braked without reason. Drivers also took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qeu10x/known_fsd_beta_103_taccautosteer_bug/">social media</a> to post issues including a disappearing Autosteer option, problems with traffic aware cruise control and Autopilot panic. Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452330803015335939">tweeted that the company is working on the issues with Autopilot and cruise control</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Groww has tripled its valuation to $3 billion in just six months as the Indian fintech startup looks to broaden its offerings and help more millennials start their investment journey in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Iconiq Growth led the Bangalore-based startup’s $251 million Series E financing round. Alkeon, Lone Pine Capital and Steadfast as well as existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, YC Continuity, Tiger Global, and Propel Venture Partners “significantly” participated in the new round.</p>
<p><a href="http://groww.in">Groww</a>, which has now raised over $390 million to date, was valued at $250 million in September last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">$1 billion in April this year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reported last month that Groww was in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/indias-groww-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-a-3-billion-valuation/">finalize a $250 million round at a $3 billion valuation</a>. The startup had multiple termsheets, the report added.</p>
<p>Groww helps millennials invest in mutual funds, futures, derivatives, stocks, and initial public offerings. Lalit Keshre, co-founder and chief executive of Groww, told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup is working to introduce several more asset classes for its users to invest. &#8220;We plan to offer them all asset classes eventually,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making a difference in the lives of millions of Indians by democratizing access. And it seems the journey has just begun with such a huge opportunity ahead of us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Groww is tapping into a huge market. More than 200 million people in India transact money digitally, but fewer than 30 million currently invest in mutual funds and stocks. The startup had over 15 million registered users earlier this year, two-thirds of whom are first-time investors. Additionally, more than 60% of Groww users are in smaller cities and towns of India. (Groww had 12 million monthly active users last month, according to data from research firm App Annie.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup didn&#8217;t update its user base figure today, but Keshre said Groww has grown significantly in the past 18 months as more Indians begin to explore investments.</p>
<p>“The financial services market in India is already large, growing rapidly, and ripe for disruption. During the last couple of years, Groww has demonstrated that they are ready to seize that opportunity through strong accelerating momentum predicated on strength of technology,” said Yoonkee Sull, partner at ICONIQ Growth, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Driven by an exceptional product-oriented team, Groww is already amongst the leading investment platforms in India, showcasing strong unit economics and customer cohorts. We are excited to participate in the company’s vision to be the primary financial platform for Indian consumers.”</p>
<p>Keshre said the startup will deploy the fresh capital for its long-term growth and educating the first time investors.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported earlier that Groww, like a handful of other India startups, is studying cryptocurrency. Keshre said the startup won&#8217;t offer such investment opportunity to users until the Indian regulator clears it. The Indian startup is currently on track to clock about $35 million in ARR, the publication reported.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stripe has made its second investment in India, just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/stripe-acquires-recko-its-first-acquisition-in-india-to-add-reconciliation-to-its-payment-services-stack/">disclosing the first</a>. One of the world’s most valuable startups has backed Bangalore-based SaaS fintech firm Clear, the two said Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old Indian startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/indias-cleartax-raises-12m-to-expand-into-new-financial-services/">formerly known as ClearTax</a>, said it has raised $75 million in its Series C funding. The round was led by Kora Capital. Stripe, as well as Alua Capital, Think Investments and several other existing investors participated in the round, which brings the startup’s all-time raise to over $140 million. The new round values the Indian startup at over $700 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://cleartax.in">Clear</a> &#8212; which counts Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital India, Founders Fund, and Elevation Capital among its earliest investors &#8212; helps individuals and businesses file their tax returns. It also provides wealth management advice to individuals, and helps businesses with e-invoicing and credit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222977" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup says over 6 million individuals, and more than 1 million small and medium-sized businesses and over 30,000 enterprises use its platform.</p>
<p>In the past 18 months, said Archit Gupta, Clear founder and chief executive in an interview with TechCrunch, the startup’s SaaS platform has grown five times. Clear said it processes over 10%, up from 3% in 2016, of India’s business invoices with a GMV of $400 billion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2222980" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg?resize=300,284 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stripe-cleartax-tweet.jpg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Clear’s marquee offering, ClearTax, started at a time when e-filing was not as popular in India. But the startup found itself in a good spot thanks to government regulations in the following years. (The government made e-filing mandatory in the country five years ago, for instance.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the number of people in India, home to 1.4 billion people, who pay taxes is still fairly low. (Only about 60 million individuals pay taxes in India.) That has been one of the reasons why Clear has expanded its offerings to serve businesses and also broadened to services such as credit and wealth management.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Clear as they innovate at scale in the Indian SaaS ecosystem, enabling enterprises and SMEs to automate their workflows around taxation, invoicing and several other adjacencies,” said Nitin Saigal, Kora’s founder and CIO, in a statement.</p>
<p>Gupta said the startup will deploy the fresh funds to broaden its offerings and is also beginning to expand overseas. Clear, which is already serving businesses in the Middle East, plans to expand to cater to similar businesses in Europe soon, he said.</p>
<p>“We welcome Kora, Stripe and our other incoming investors. Kora has strong experience in technology players in emerging markets and Stripe is a global technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet &#8211; we are excited to learn from both of them,” he said.</p>
<p>“India is on a massive digitisation journey and we are fortunate to be in the perfect storm of electronic invoicing, GST, UPI, cheap mobile internet and rapid adoption of technology due to Covid-19. We are doubling down on our SaaS platform to help businesses with collateral free debt and payments. This funding also gives us fuel for our international expansion.”</p>
<p>Stripe has yet to enter the Southeast Asia and India markets in a meaningful way. The firm has teams at both the regions, but has yet to make inroads in either. If it chose to expand to the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, it would compete with YC and Sequoia Capital India-backed Razorpay, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/salesforce-backs-indian-payments-startup-razorpay/">received funds from Salesforce</a> and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">last valued at $3 billion</a>. Like Clear and Razorpay, Stripe is also backed by Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Stripe has already backed at least one more Indian startup, according to sources.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As social-audio apps like Clubhouse, Beams, Pludo, Racket and Quest have gained popularity in the last year, more marketers, product teams and up-and-coming competitors are beginning to explore the strategies that are making and breaking the user experience in this space.</p>
<p>On one side, these products were fairly straightforward when they first hit the market because content creators could simply sign up, create audio rooms or short-form podcasts, and then set a time for a broadcast. But as more and more negative user feedback bubbles to the top of internet forums, now is a good stopping point to consider just how “social” social audio should be.</p>
<p>We know social audio isn’t meant to imitate YouTube, Twitter or Facebook, whose user experiences are largely built around one-way communication. But if we exclude them, who should social-audio companies consider while developing their strategy?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Given my background in television and marketing, it should come as no surprise that I believe social audio needs to leverage the same strategies used by major news organizations.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, here are five of the easiest ways social-audio app teams can do it.</p>
<h2>Organize for inclusion</h2>
<p>When we think about the design of apps, the things that typically come to mind are the placement of the hamburger stack, the font types and the ease of the ability of the user to get in and out of their account.</p>
<p>But what we rarely think about is how the design supports or doesn’t support disabled users. A notable &#8212; and reasonable &#8212; concern that emerged last year as social audio took off was the lack of accessibility features for people with impaired sight or hearing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Small text makes it harder for people with impaired vision to navigate the apps, and the lack of captioning makes it difficult for those who are deaf to enjoy the conversations.</p>
<p>If you think about it, restaurants and movie theaters typically have a way for patrons to use a different menu in Braille or larger print, or they offer captioning for audience members who need an additional layer of support to enjoy the show. Social audio app teams and designers should include accessibility checkpoints in the workflow to address these concerns early in the development road map.</p>
<h2>In the first year, leverage journalists and hosts</h2>
<p>Marketing social-audio apps to content creators is a great way to pull in early adopters, but it could be better to identify experienced hosts and journalists that are willing to work with your brand in its beta stage as well.</p>
<p>Why? Because when you’re building an app that will eventually take up a portion of the media market, credibility is king.</p>
<p>Content creation and credibility aren’t mutually exclusive. And vetting by experienced journalists and hosts who have experience producing live shows and moderating public feedback can improve the audience’s experience.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you start with a lineup of talent that knows the ropes, you can buy yourself time on the user education offerings. By having credible figureheads lead your conversations, they will also set the tone for how creators who are onboarded after them should use the platform effectively.</p>
<h2>Mimic big media</h2>
<p>What do Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, ABC, NBC, CBS and the BBC all have in common? Programming.</p>
<p>If someone wants to know what’s coming on at 8 o’clock tonight on ABC, it’s easy for them to find out and set aside time to watch a show. With Netflix, audiences know about changes in the lineup weeks if not months in advance.</p>
<p>Consider having a lineup of rooms or shows that are produced by in-house talent. This way, the user audience has a reason to be on the platform even if their favorite creators are on hiatus.</p>
<p>Yes, some content creators are savvy enough to let their audience know when they will be back, but not all have the support of a producer or experienced team to make sure they can maintain a presence.</p>
<p>At first glance, this doesn’t seem like a big issue to the app teams, because you’re betting on the content creator to come back and bring their audience. But this is where the apps are actually losing engagement: If the creators aren’t consistent and the audience doesn’t know when to expect them back, and the user doesn’t receive suggestions to similar audio rooms or shows quickly, they lose interest and stop returning.</p>
<p>And later, when they are asked why they stopped using the platforms, their review is typically negative because they didn’t see the continued value.</p>
<h2>When creators receive complaints, educate immediately</h2>
<p>When entertainers mess up, all it takes is a few groups of people to air their concerns, and before you know it, their career takes a huge hit. Sometimes this happens because the content creator has acted maliciously, but other times it’s due to honest mistakes or sheer ignorance.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: If you’re swift to remove the creator, not only does it tarnish their career, but it strips others in the community of the education needed about what to do in a similar circumstance &#8212; and how to reconcile the initial concerns privately and publicly.</p>
<p>Given the live nature of these platforms, these snafus are guaranteed to pop up, and for that reason, it’s a good idea to figure out how to address issues in a way that’s supportive to all involved.</p>
<p>The suggestion here is to either create a training program that the content creator would have to complete before they are allowed to return to the platform, or your company can partner with online or in-person training courses to educate people on topics relating to things like race, culture or social issues.</p>
<p>I liken it to getting a ticket for a moving violation and being required to attend traffic school. These app teams should think of a similar solution that allows creators to navigate being in the public eye and learning as they go. Not all content creators are trained as journalists. If they are targeted in the marketing, there should be a strategy to retain them as active participants on the platform, even after mistakes come up.</p>
<h2>Launch a content council</h2>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the moment your company goes into beta testing, it would be wise to create a content council to address any areas of sensitivity that may come up on your platform.</p>
<p>In the same way that startups have advisory boards, consider forming a content council with industry experts in diversity, equity and inclusion, disabilities, global affairs, politics, LGBTQIA advocacy, race, healthcare and social justice, just to name a few. This takes the pressure off of the internal employees to know how to tackle tough topics on the platform. It also provides the company with someone who is engaged with the business internally. These experts could be helpful if the platform faces any controversy around hot-button topics.</p>
<p>As the social-audio space continues to expand, so will the ways creators and audiences engage with the platforms. But whether that growth continues to spike through the rest of 2021, one thing is for sure, the social-audio space may be bigger than what it’s currently portraying itself to be, and as a content creator and end user, I can’t wait to see what opportunities will open up in this space.</p>

<p>Now, I turn to the question of Chinese character output—monitors, printers, and related peripherals—where still more challenges confronted engineers seeking to render Western-manufactured personal computers and computer peripherals compatible with Chinese character text.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While we call them “peripherals,” suggesting a sort of supporting role, they are in fact at the very center of computing in Chinese, from the extreme limitations that Chinese computing faced in the 1970s and 80s to the immense strides and successes it has experienced from the 1990s onward.</p>
<p>During the early rise of consumer PCs in the 1980s, no Western-manufactured personal computer, printer, monitor, operating system, or other peripheral was capable of handling Chinese character input or output—not “out of the box,” at least. To the contrary, all of these devices exhibited the same kind of English-language and Latin alphabetic bias found in, for example, the early history of telegraphic codes and mechanical typewriters, as <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chinese-typewriter">I’ve explored in my other research</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, what ensued in China and the Chinese-speaking world was a period of intense hacking and modding. Element by element, engineers in China and elsewhere rendered Western-manufactured computing hardware and software compatible with Chinese. It was a messy, decentralized, and often brilliant period of experimentation and innovation.</p>
<p>When we turn our attention to this broader ecology of computing—on printers, monitors, and all of the other “stuff” needed to make computing work—part two of this series on Chinese computing spotlights two conclusions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, the dominance of alphabet-based computing—“alphabetic order,” as I call it—went far beyond the question of keyboards and computer memory. Like the typewriter before them, computing devices, languages, and protocols were by and large invented first in English-language contexts, and only later “extended” to other languages and to writing systems other than the Latin alphabet. To achieve even basic functionality, Chinese engineers needed to constantly push against the boundaries of off-the-shelf computing peripherals, hardware, and software.</p>
<p>Second, I’ll dismantle the oversimplified idea of Chinese “copycatting” and “piracy” that has dominated, then as now, Western accounts of Chinese computing during this pivotal period in the late 1970s and 1980s. When encountering programs such as “Chinese DOS,” the knee-jerk reaction in the Western world has been to treat them as just more &#8220;Chinese knock-offs.&#8221; What this simplistic narrative fails to understand is that without the kinds of “forgeries” we will examine in this article, none of these Western-designed software suites would have worked <i>at all </i>in the context of Chinese character computing.</p>
<h2>Dot-matrix printing and the metallurgical depths of alphabetic order</h2>
<p>The first peripheral we need to examine is the printer—specifically, dot-matrix printers. From the standpoint of Chinese computing, the politics of dot-matrix printing began with the then-dominant configurations of industry standard printer heads—the 9-pin printer heads found in practically all mass-manufactured dot-matrix printers during the 1970s.</p>
<p>These commercial dot-matrix printers were able to produce low-resolution Latin alphabet bitmaps with just one pass of the printer head. This was not by accident, of course. Rather, the choice of nine pins was “tuned” to the needs of low-resolution Latin alphabetic printing.</p>
<p>The same printer heads, however, were incapable of printing low-resolution Chinese character bitmaps in anything less than two full passes of the printer head. Two-pass printing dramatically increased the time needed to print Chinese as compared to English and also introduced graphical inaccuracies, whether due to inconsistencies in the advancement of the platen, uneven ink registration, paper jams, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, two-pass printing could also result in characters with differing ink densities on their upper versus their lower halves. Worse, in the absence of any mod, all Chinese characters would be at least twice the height of English words, no matter the font size being used. This created comically distorted printouts in which English words appeared austere and economical, while Chinese characters appeared grotesquely oversized. Such print-outs also wasted large amounts of paper, with every document looking something like a large-print children’s book.</p>
<p><em>An example illustration of how these printer heads work is provided in this video, courtesy of the author:</em></p>
<p><div style="width: 1920px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->

<p>Latin alphabet-centrism ran deeper than one might initially expect, moreover, as illustrated in the work of early Chinese computing pioneer Chan Yeh. Setting out to digitize Chinese characters and basing his system on a bitmap grid of 18-by-22, Yeh’s initial idea was an obvious one: to reduce the diameter of the pins so as to fit more of them on the printer head. As he discovered, however, the solution would not be so simple.</p>

<p>The Latin alphabetic bias of impact printing, he found, was encoded within the very metallurgical properties of printer components. Simply put, the metal alloys used to fabricate printer pins were themselves calibrated to 9-pin Latin alphabetic printing, such that reducing their diameters to the sizes needed for Chinese would result in pin deformation or breakage.</p>
<p>To compensate, engineers tricked Western-built printers into fitting as many as 18 dots in roughly the same amount of vertical space as nine normally spaced dots.</p>
<p>Their technique was ingenious and simple. Following standard, two-pass printing, an initial array of dots was laid down during the first pass of the printing head. Rather than laying down this second array of dots beneath the first, however, they tricked the printer into registering them <i>in between</i> the first set of nine dots, almost like the teeth of a zipper fastening together.</p>
<p>To achieve this effect, engineers rewrote printer drivers to hack the printer’s paper advance mechanism, refining it so that it rotated at an extremely small interval (as small as 1/216<sup>th</sup> of an inch).</p>
<p>Pin configurations weren’t the only challenge. Commercially produced dot-matrix printers were also tuned to the ASCII character encoding system, and thus unable to handle Chinese text <i>as text</i>. In English-language word processing, printing was not an act of transmitting a raster image to the printer. Rather, English-language text could be directly delivered via the printer driver as ASCII-encoded text, which resulted in much faster printer speeds.</p>
<p>In order for Western-built dot-matrix printers to print Chinese characters, however, there was no way to use these printers’ “text” mode. Instead, the printers once again had to be tricked, this time in order to print Chinese characters using the graphics mode typically reserved for printing raster images.</p>
<p>For students of the Chinese language, the irony here will be apparent: in order for Chinese characters to function on early Western-built dot-matrix printers, Chinese characters had to treated as <i>pictures </i>or <i>pictographs. </i>Pictographs were something that Westerners had long assumed Chinese characters to be, even though they are not (with few exceptions). But in the context of dot-matrix printing, “pictographs” were indeed what they had no choice but to become.</p>
<p>Eventually, a new family of impact printers began to be released on the commercial market: 24-pin dot-matrix printers, featuring pin diameters of 0.2 mm (as compared to 0.34mm on 9-pin printers). Unsurprisingly, the leading manufacturers of these new printers were largely Japanese companies such as Panasonic, NEC, Toshiba, Okidata, and more. Given the need to print characters required by the Japanese language, Japanese engineers needed to solve similar challenges as their Chinese counterparts.</p>
<h2>Pop-up modernity: Chinese character monitors</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2222795" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222795" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2222795" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg 1648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=768,588 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=1536,1176 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222795" class="wp-caption-text">Patent document image demonstrating the conversion of Chinese characters into bitmap rasters. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University</p></div></p>
<p>Yet another domain within the ecology of Chinese computing was that of mass-manufactured computer monitors. In certain respects, the politics of monitors were similar to those of printers, particularly with regards to the issue of character distortion. Unavoidably, even the lowest-resolution Chinese character bitmaps occupied upwards of twice the vertical and horizontal space of Latin alphabetic letters, making the Chinese in bilingual texts appear comically oversized (such as can be seen in this story&#8217;s featured image).</p>
<p>Standard, Western-manufactured computer monitors could also fit a far smaller number of Chinese characters on screen than Latin letters, both in terms of line length (the number of characters per line) and depth (the number of lines per screen). Chinese language users could thus see only small portions of their texts at any one time.</p>
<p>Then there were challenges unique to Chinese character display: the pop-up menu. Because of the inherently iterative process of Chinese input, in which users are constantly being presented with Chinese characters that fulfill the criteria provided by their keystrokes, an essential feature of Chinese computing is a “window”—whether software-based or hardware-based—that enables the user to review these Chinese character candidates.</p>
<p>Although the pop-up menu is a ubiquitous feature of Chinese computing from the 1980s onward, this feedback technique dates back to the 1940s. In a 1947 experimental Chinese typewriter designed by Lin Yutang, there was a key component of the machine the inventor called his “Magic Eye”: in effect, the first “pop-up menu” in history, albeit a mechanical one.</p>
<p>With the advent of personal computers, mechanical windows such as those found on the MingKwai, Sinotype, Sinowriter, or otherwise, were integrated into the computer’s main display. It became a software-governed “window” (or bar) on the screen, rather than a separate, physical device.</p>
<p>This pop-up menu placed further constraints on the already precious real estate of the computer monitor, however. What we might term “pop-up menu design” became a critically important area of research and innovation within Chinese personal computing from its inception. Companies experimented with different menu styles, formats, and behaviors, attempting to strike a balance between the requirements of input, screen size, and the preferences of users.</p>
<p>There were trade-offs to each option. Menus that displayed a larger number of character candidates at once increased the likelihood of more rapidly finding one’s desired graph, but came at the cost of screen space. Smaller windows, while less intrusive, required the user to scroll through “pages” of character candidates, if the user’s desired graph was not found amongst the top recommendations.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these strict limitations, Chinese engineers and firms were constantly seeking next-generation monitors. While this was perhaps true for the global market at large—since higher resolution monitors represent something of an “inherent good” for consumers—nevertheless, the motivating reasons for this hunger for high-resolution was dramatically different for the Chinese-language market.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: No ESC</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2222793" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222793" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2222793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?w=497" alt="" width="497" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg 1288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=219,300 219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=768,1052 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=497,680 497w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=1122,1536 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chinese-Computing-1.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222793" class="wp-caption-text">Inaugural issue of the magazine &#8220;Chinese Computing&#8221;. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University</p></div></p>
<p>As brilliant as each of these mods might have been, at the end of the day they remained just that: <i>modifications</i>. The autonomy and authority to create original systems—that is, the systems that subsequently needed to be modified—was ultimately where power was concentrated.</p>
<p>While the practice of modding tended to lead to a wide array of systems, it often came at the expense of interoperability. Modding required constant vigilance, moreover—no one-time “set it and forget it” solution was possible.</p>
<p>With every new computer program released on the market—and every new version of every computer program—programmers in China had to “debug” them line by line, insofar as programs themselves contained code which could set, or reset, parameters for the computer monitor, for example.</p>
<p>For most English-language word processing programs, for example, the baseline assumption baked into such programs was a 25-by-80 character display format (<i>zifu fangshi xianshi</i>). Since this format was incompatible with Chinese character display, engineers had to manually change every place in the program code where this 25-by-80 format was set. They did so, tellingly enough, using standard-issue “DEBUG” software. Through accumulated experience, engineers steadily learned their way around the assembly code bowels of leading programs.</p>
<p>Once modded, moreover, underlying operating systems and programs could always change. Shortly after the development of CCDOS and other systems, for example, IBM announced its move to a new operating system: the PS/2. “China and Chinese-language have been thrown into turmoil,” one article from 1987 wrote, noting that no existing Chinese-language systems—whether in Taiwan or on the mainland—had yet to be adapted to it. “The race is on for developers to come up with the best match for IBM’s MS/DOS platform.”</p>
<p>From an historical perspective, modders are vulnerable to misrecognition and erasure. In their time and place, their work was often misrecognized as mere theft or piracy, rather than as necessary acts of re-engineering to render incompatible machines compatible with the Chinese language. In a January 1987 issue of <i>PC Magazine</i>, for example, one cartoonist lampooned Sinicized operating systems. “It Runs on MSG-DOS,” the cartoon’s caption read.</p>
<p>As Western manufacturers slowly incorporated many of these Chinese mods into the core architectures of their systems (as well as Japanese and other non-Western ones), it is all too easy to forget that such changes were inspired by the work of engineers in China and the non-Western world. In sum, it is all too easy to retroactively imagine that the Western-built computer has always been language-agnostic, neutral, and welcoming.</p>
<p>This critical period of computing history has gone completely unwritten, and for a very simple reason. In the United States, and the Western world more broadly, none of these mods have been understood in terms of “experimentation,” let alone “innovation.” Instead, another set of words was—and continues to be—reserved for them: “copycatting,” “mimickry,” “piracy.” As Chinese engineers reverse-engineered Western-built dot-matrix printers, enabling them to print Chinese characters; or retrofitted Western-designed operating systems to make possible the use of Chinese input method editors, all that most Western observers could see was “theft.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese smart electric vehicle startup Xpeng has announced a series of innovations that it says will help it craft  the mobility ecosystem of the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our exploration of more efficient, safer, carbon-neutral mobility solutions goes far beyond just smart EVs, and is the cornerstone of our long-term competitive advantages,” said He Xiaopeng, chairman and CEO of XPeng, at the startup’s 2021 Tech Day in Beijing on Sunday. “We strive to implement cutting-edge mobility technologies in mass-production models for the benefit of our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiaopeng went into detail on the company’s latest versions of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/">advanced driver assistance system</a> (ADAS), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its supercharger network, a next-generation flying car </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/xpeng-backed-urban-air-mobility-company-ht-aero-raises-500m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built with HT Aero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robotic unicorn for kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h3><b>Xpilot 3.5 will be designed for city driving</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2223023" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223023" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223023" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg" alt="XPILOT 3.5 and City NGP - Xpeng" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg 2364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XPILOT-3.5-and-City-NGP.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223023" class="wp-caption-text">XPILOT 3.5 and City NGP</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng is planning to roll out the next generation of its ADAS, called Xpilot, to drivers in select cities during the first half of 2022. Xpilot 3.5 will feature &#8220;City Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP)&#8221; and will only be available to drivers of Xpeng&#8217;s P5 family sedan, which can be built with lidar, millimeter-wave radar and a 3D visual perception network that can recognize, classify and position multiple targets – all of which is essential for city-level NGP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The last Xpilot version, 3.0, which was available to drivers of Xpeng&#8217;s P7 sedan, handled highway-level NGP, through which Xpeng was able to gather nearly 12 million kilometers, or 7.5 million miles, of data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpilot 3.5 will have a strategic planning module with advanced prediction capabilities that uses a combination of rule-driven and data-driven AI to handle city scenarios, like avoiding static objects and vulnerable road users, as well as lane changing at any speed, according to Xpeng. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng’s approach to reaching full autonomy is similar to Tesla’s, in that it aims to go through Level 2 autonomy, or ADAS systems, on its way to reaching Level 5. (<a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles">SAE International</a> describes Level 2 autonomy as a system that mainly has support features, like adaptive cruise control and brake support. It describes Level 5 autonomy a system that can drive anywhere under all conditions.) Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-station-tesla-rolls-out-its-fsd-beta-button-delivery-deals-heat-up-micromobility-evolves/">Tesla released a software update</a> that allows customers to request access to its Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software. FSD includes capabilities like automatic lane change, moving into and out of parking spots and autosteering, which is currently not yet available for city streets. Tesla has given no date as to when it will bring this capability to cities, but it will be powered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tesla-backs-vision-only-approach-to-autonomy-using-powerful-supercomputer/">using </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only vision and neural network processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Human-machine co-pilot functions will remain critical for the foreseeable future,” said XinZhou Wu, VP of autonomous driving at Xpeng, during the event. “Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mission is to progressively transition from advanced driver assistance to full autonomous driving, with a clear roadmap to first completely connect all driving scenarios. Our closed-loop data operation, software iteration and mass production capability – all created in-house – put us in pole position to significantly improve safety and resolve the industry’s long-tail issues.”</span></p>
<p>Just as Tesla charges for its FSD software, so does Xpeng for its Xpilot. Xpeng didn&#8217;t say how much version 3.5 would cost, but version 3.0 currently costs about $3,200 (RMB 20,000), which can be purchased outright or paid for via annual subscription, an Xpeng spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<h3><b>Xpilot 4.0 to provide full-scenario point-to-point ADAS</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng’s Xpilot 4.0, which is planned for a roll out in the first half of 2023, would give the startup an edge on its race to full autonomy. The plan is to be the first to deliver full-scenario assisted smart driving experiences, from turning the vehicle on to parking it and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This version of Xpilot will require a lot of compute power, so Xpeng is building a hardware upgrade for version 4.0, “with 508 TOPS ECU compute power supported by two Orin-X autonomous driving System-on-the-Chip (SOC) units, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">8-million-pixel front-view binocular camera and 2.9-million-pixel side-view cameras (covering front, rear, left and right view), and a highly integrated and expandable domain controller,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>A spokesperson for Xpeng told TechCrunch Xpilot 4.0 will not go into any of the automaker&#8217;s existing vehicles, but rather will end up in an as yet unannounced vehicle. It&#8217;s likely that this new model will be an SUV, says the spokesperson, but Xpeng hasn&#8217;t released any information about it so far.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of next year, as Xpeng prepares to bring Xpilot 4.0 to market, the automaker aims to have 75 million miles of highway NGP driven and 22 million miles of city NGP driven, as well as a 90% penetration rate of its memory parking function, Valet Parking Assist (VPA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng also stressed the importance of safety when churning out all of this ADAS, and smart driving is only one aspect of that. The startup announced an upgrade to its user interface and operating system. The Xmart OS 4.0 promises a detailed display complete with a 3D rendering of the environment surrounding the vehicle. The OS will roll out next year in new vehicle models, said Xiaopeng. Xpeng is also rolling out version 2.0 of its voice assistant, which it says can listen, process and execute at the same time, to help make rides smoother for drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-third-quarter-earnings-safety-score/">Tesla has released a safety score for drivers</a> looking to test its FSD Beta software, and also get heaps of data for its budding insurance line, Xpeng is unleashing a safety test to help drivers understand the boundaries of the Xpilot before activating it. Drivers will receive a smart driving score before they are able to use Xpilot, and if the driver monitoring system finds them to be driving irresponsibly down the line, it will deduct points from their overall score and possibly revoke Xpilot access. </span></p>
<h3><b>Superchargers that give up to 125 miles range in five minutes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Xpeng wants to create the smart mobility ecosystem of the future, it needs to power it. The startup already has 1,648 free charging stations in its network and 439 branded supercharging stations throughout China, but during its Tech Day, Xpeng revealed plans to produce its next generation “X-Power” superchargers based on a 800V high-voltage mass-production Silicon Carbide charging platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The X-Power chargers will be able to give EVs enough juice to go up to 200 kilometers, or 125 miles, in just five minutes, and an average of 30 vehicles can be charged on one supercharger at a time, says Xpeng. The startup is also planning to roll out lightweight 480 kW high-voltage supercharging piles, which come with Xpeng vehicles so owners can charge their cars, for the first time. In order to support this supercharging network, Xpeng says it will launch power storage facilities in both piles and mobile vehicles. </span></p>
<p>Xpeng did not share when this new charging tech will make it to market.</p>
<h3><b>A flying car that also drives</b></h3>
<p>[gallery ids="2222954,2222955,2222957,2222945"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the event, Xpeng revealed its new goal to become the world&#8217;s top low-altitude manned flying vehicle manufacturer, in large part fueled by its mission to create its </span>sixth generation flying car. But this is not just any flying car. This one will also be able to drive on the road.</p>
<p>A video presented during the event showed a rendering of a very sexy looking car, even sexier than the <a href="https://en.xiaopeng.com/p7.html">Xpeng P7</a>, that converts from a normal car to a flying car through a foldable rotor mechanism. Xpeng says the low-altitude flying vehicle will be 50% the weight of the P7 and be about 18 feet in length at first with plans to make it shorter eventually. It&#8217;ll have both a steering wheel for road operations as well as a single lever for flight modes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The new flying car will also feature an advanced environmental perception system that can fully evaluate the surrounding environment and weather conditions to conduct safety assessments before take-off, says the company. The system will evaluate the data it picks up against driving objectives to ensure a safe take-off and landing, and during the flight the advanced perception and flight control algorithm will be used to avoid obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xpeng is planning to begin mass production for this contraption, which is being developed by Xpeng affiliate urban air mobility (UAM) company HT Aero, as soon as 2024. The final design, which Xiaopeng said would be more understated than the current renderings, is to be decided sometime next year. The CEO also said Xpeng is aiming for the cost to be lower than $157,000 (RMB 1 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Xpeng led HT Aero&#8217;s $500 million Series A raise, and HT Aero has produced other UAM vehicles for Xpeng, most recently the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210923006034/en/XPeng-Backed-HT-Aero-Unveils-Flying-Vehicle-City-Usage-Scenarios">Xpeng X2, which is Xpeng&#8217;s fifth gen flying car that can seat two people</a>. A spokesperson from Xpeng told TechCrunch the sixth gen flying car will be built for similar city use cases, like going from the office to the airport, or other similar trips under 30 minutes of flight time. Xpeng&#8217;s philosophy is to sell direct to consumer, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how low-altitude air regulations shift to handle a rather fast go-to-market strategy. Xiaopeng said he hopes to work with regulators to get to a place where Xpeng can legally mass-produce flying cars for private use by 2024, but didn&#8217;t go into more detail.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Riding the path to smart mobility on a robotic pony</strong></h3>
<p>Last month, Xpeng teased a pony-style robot that kids could ride and interact with. The quadruped would ideally be so perceptive that it would be able to detect human emotions. During its Tech Day, Xpeng went into further detail about how it foresees smart robots like this pony becoming an intelligent platform for an integrated smart mobility system that can address far more complex autonomy challenges than vehicles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223022" style="width: 1656px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223022" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223022 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png" alt="Woman in office loads Xpeng robotic pony with treats to be delivered" width="1646" height="930" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png 1646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-4.38.56-pm-e1635109697716.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1646px) 100vw, 1646px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223022" class="wp-caption-text">Woman in office loads Xpeng robotic pony with treats to be delivered in a video presented during Xpeng&#8217;s 2021 Tech Day.</p></div></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just for kids. During the presentation, Xpeng played a video demonstrating how the cute robotic pony could be used to deliver snacks and other parcels in an office setting – a nod to the horse&#8217;s historic role in mobility history to transport objects. (In that same video, Xpeng possibly teased another robotic animal that was also hanging out in the fictional office, and this one looked a bit like<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618043/xiaomi-cyberdog-robot-dog-quadruped-specs-price"> Xiaomi&#8217;s creepy robot dog</a>.)</p>
<p>Xiaopeng said Xpeng is leaning towards creating a quadruped like a pony rather than a bipedal robot because four legs are more stable than two. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">During Tesla&#8217;s AI Day</a>, the company announced its plans to create a bipedal humanoid robot to handle human tasks like grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The robot will be trained to perceive a diverse environment and multiple targets with 3D route planning, and it&#8217;ll be able to recognize users through facial, body and voiceprint, says Xpeng. It is also experimenting with technologies like dynamic acoustic mapping, bionic hearing, a bionic sense of smell and even a bionic tactile experience through plantar and fingerprint touch and skin sensing. Xpeng&#8217;s robots will have a 360-degree camera module and lidar sensing system, as well as object recognition and sound field sensory technology so that it can get the most precise model of the environment to interact with.</p>
<p>During the event, Xiaopeng mentioned that by next year, two major iterations to the robotic pony would make it look completely different than the renderings Xpeng has displayed today. A spokesperson for Xpeng told TechCrunch that there&#8217;s no timeline on a path to market for the robotic pony, as of yet, but there is a prototype that&#8217;s still in the development stage. Given the immense AI and hardware challenge for Xpeng to create a fully autonomous robot and the price tag associated with that challenge, it&#8217;s safe to assume the company is many years out from commercializing this tech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the adoption of greater target recognition and precise interaction, 3D route planning that enables more complex terrain mobility and enhanced bionic senses, XPeng will bring greater application scenarios to support wider mobility, greater autonomous planning, and stronger human-machine interaction for the future of smart mobility,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>On Equity this week, we discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/nerdwallet-gen-z-and-the-value-of-the-written-word/">the value of the written word.</a> You can imagine that the resulting argument is inherently biased, considering we are three journalists who have bet our livelihoods on ink; but, I promise, there’s more nuance here beyond how important a lede is.</p>
<p>We recently published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">a recent deep dive on Automattic</a>, the commercial media company behind the WordPress publishing platform. Founded in 2005, Automattic is one of the few companies that has been able to evolve and expand its way through a graveyard of media sites. Valued at $7.5 billion, it has also convinced investors of the financial promise of its vision.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: Origin story “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">How doing everything wrong turned Automattic into a multibillion dollar media powerhouse</a>” (3,850 words/15 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 2: Open source development “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-developers/">There’s nothing Automattic about balancing commercial growth with an open source developer community</a>” (2,500 words/10 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 3: Acquisitions and future strategy “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a>” (2,350 words/9 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 4: Remote work culture “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-remote/">The future of remote work is text</a>” (2,000 words/8 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was most struck by how text has shaped Automattic’s hiring process: The company offers a purely written interview, where potential new hires never need to reveal their face or voice to anyone through the recruitment funnel. It takes away the inherent bias that comes with a Zoom interview, which, at its core, is just a digital version of a face-to-face interview. Monica Ohara, chief marketing officer of WordPress.com, explained more about her thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You normally think you’ve got to talk to them; see them on video. With text only, you remove all this bias and focus on the content of what they’re saying, and also test for a style of communication that’s really important in a distributed team.</p>
<p>“In Silicon Valley, everyone is competing for the same people that would add diversity to your pool. Which is great for those people, but what about all the others who don’t have those opportunities because of where they were born or live? For me, I was born in the Philippines and if I hadn’t had the luck to move here, I’d be living a different life.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rethinking the value of text, the same way we rethink <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/">how many synchronous meetings</a> should be on our calendar, feels like the natural next step for companies figuring out how to scale distributed work. Even in a world seemingly ruled by short-form video, words — and sound — seem to matter in a way that other formats never will.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about PayPal’s reported new friend, the Chinese venture capital market and not at all about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">Facebook’s impending new rebrand. </a></p>
<h2>PayPal picks Pinterest</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2221010" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221010" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2221010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pay-pal-pinterest.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221010" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>We rushed to Twitter Spaces this week after rumors came out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/paypal-said-to-be-exploring-potential-acquisition-of-pinterest/">PayPal may be buying Pinterest for a reported $45 billion.</a> The fintech giant has been on an acquisition spree of sorts, but scooping up a social, photo-sharing platform may signal its hungry to own the content — not just the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>This feels nostalgic. PayPal potentially joining forces with a more content-focused e-commerce business comes more than a half-decade after it divorced from eBay. But, as Finix Chief Growth Officer Jareau Wadé pointed out, Pinterest is not a shopping destination like eBay — it’s a place where shopping begins for nearly 450 million users.</p>
<p>In a Substack post, Wadé makes the following argument to describe why <a href="https://jareau.substack.com/p/why-is-paypal-buying-pinterest?r=iydo&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=">PayPal may buy Pinterest:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Pinterest is more like Google than eBay. It’s a search engine that conducts over 5 billion searches per month for fuzzy, hard-to-describe ideas where pictures, rather than words, are often the best place to start. It also has a growing ads business that produced $613 million last quarter, up 125% YoY. With Pinterest, PayPal would be buying the top of the funnel — the awareness and interest stages — for millions of websites on the internet. PayPal would provide Pinterest with the bottom of the funnel, allowing them to see the purchases that result from shopping that began on Pinterest.</p>
<p>Imagine if PayPal could use their core product and the commerce assets they’ve acquired over the past five years to build a deconstructed sales funnel, not just for one website, but for the whole internet.</p></blockquote>

<p>Data from CB Insights shows us that, aside from a single outsized 2018 round, China’s third quarter of 2021 was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/">the best three-month period for Chinese startups ever</a> — both in deal value and deal count.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Google lowers its Play Store commissions. </strong>In a significant move, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">announced</a> it would lower commissions on subscription-based apps to 15% from day one, instead of 30% for the first year, which then drops to 15% in year two and beyond (like Apple offers). It also announced that apps participating in its new <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/mediaprogram/">Play Media Experience Program</a> could see their commissions adjusted to as low as 10%. This program includes apps where the content costs account for the majority of sales, including video streaming, music and e-books apps. Google also competes in some of these areas with its own services and is under increased threat of regulation globally, as well as engaged in lawsuits over app store fees, including one in the U.S. with Epic Games. The new fees will kick in on January 1, 2022 and follow Google&#8217;s previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">announced</a> reduction of commissions from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million of developer earnings. Google says 99% of developers will qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. Sensor Tower data indicates Google Play saw $38.8 billion in overall consumer spending in 2020, earning it $11.6 billion in in-app purchases.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Apple introduced a new set of App Store Guidelines which include three key changes, including those to anti-steering rules.</strong> One of the changes is the result of a previously announced settlement agreement with a class of U.S. app developers. It clarifies that developers are allowed to communicate with their customers about other payment methods available outside their app. Related to this, another new guideline explains that apps may request customer information like name and email, but the request must be optional for the user and shouldn&#8217;t prevent them from using the app. The third guideline is unrelated to legal action, and simply details how developers can use a new App Store feature, called in-app events, which rolls out next week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Trump announced his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-launching-social-media-platform-truth-social/story?id=80697031">plans</a> to launch a new social networking app,</strong> which of course he&#8217;s calling Truth Social. The former president was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/twitter-trump-banned-forever/">banned</a> from major social platforms following the January 6 attack on the Capitol, for using his account to incite violence. According to a press release this week, Trump Media and Technology Group will merge with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger">SPAC</a> called Digital World Acquisition Group to launch Truth. But before you go thinking Trump has built his own Twitter, it turns out the new network is actually just a fork of the open-source Mastodon codebase. Mastodon is released under the AGPLv3 license, which requires the code and its modifications to be made public. Truth has not done so, even though screenshots and investigations <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump">clearly reference</a> Mastodon. Instead, the Truth website falsely claims all its source code is proprietary. This means <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump">Truth is in violation</a> of the Mastodon licensing agreement, and the organization is <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/nice-start-trumps-truth-app-may-violate-terms-of-open-source-code-its-built-on">now seeking legal counsel</a>. Ironically, <em>Truth is starting off with a lie. Who would have guessed it!</em></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Android apps arrive on Windows 11.</strong> Microsoft this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/microsoft-starts-testing-android-apps-on-windows-11/">began testing Android apps on Windows</a>. The company brought around 50 Android apps to the Windows 11 Insider Program, allowing users to try apps including the Amazon Kindle app, The Washington Post app, Clash of Kings, Coin Master and Lego Duplo World, among others. The apps will run on both AMD and Intel devices with the apps running on the Windows Subsystem for Android (powered by Intel Bridge Technology). PCs will need to have virtualization enabled, run Windows 11 and you&#8217;ll need an Amazon account to access the Amazon Appstore. Now that the apps can run, next comes the real question:<em> will anyone care to use them?</em></p>

The feature will give app makers a better way to showcase things like game competitions, movie premieres and livestreamed experiences. The events will begin to appear starting on October 27.</li>

If the other person accepts, both accounts will appear in the post or the Reels header and content will be shared to both sets of followers. It also added new effects called Superbeat and Dynamic Lyrics. The former intelligently applies special effects to music to the beat of the user’s song and the latter displays 3D lyrics.</li>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Messenger added new AR experiences for group video calls.</strong> Unlike traditional AR effects, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/facebook-messenger-is-adding-new-ar-experiences-for-group-video-calls/">the new &#8220;Group Effects&#8221;</a> apply to everyone in the call at the same time.

Spatial audio was first introduced in 2019, but had not yet been available through mobile on headphones. The feature is offered to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers only.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/spotify-opens-up-access-to-video-podcast-publishing-to-anchor-creators/"> opened up</a> access to a new tool for creators that will allow them to begin publishing their video podcasts to its service.</strong> The tool will be provided by the company’s podcast creation platform Anchor, and expands on the global launch of video podcasts last year, which encompassed only a select group of creators.

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s Stadia game-streaming service is going white label.</strong> The company had earlier said it would offer its services to partners, and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/20/batman-arkham-knight-white-label-stadia-att/">now AT&amp;T Wireless customers will be able to stream</a> &#8220;Batman: Arkham Knight&#8221; from their browser&#8230;but on their desktop, not phone (oddly). This is the first in-the-wild example of Stadia&#8217;s white-labeling, however. More are likely to come.</li>
<li><strong>App Annie <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-gaming/app-annie-game-iq-just-got-smarter/">updates</a> its Game IQ market intelligence tool</strong> with enhancements including Feature Tagging, Genre Summary and Tag Trends.</li>

<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Yahoo Finance iOS app <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/21/yahoo-finance-app-pulled-from-chinese-app-store">was removed</a> from China&#8217;s App Store.</strong> Neither Apple nor Yahoo commented on the matter, but it&#8217;s possible the app was pulled because it was being used as a way to read news stories from media outlets that are typically blocked by the Chinese government.</li>
<li><strong>Apple also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/apple-removes-a-popular-quran-app-in-china-after-request-from-local-regulators/">removed</a> a popular Quran app in China after a request from local regulators.</strong> The app allowed users to read the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok and Snap<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/tiktok-snapchat-are-testifying-first-time-their-peers-are-double-digits/"> will testify before Congress</a> for the first time</strong> next week as part of lawmakers&#8217; investigation into how Big Tech platforms are impacting kids&#8217; safety.

</ul>
<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tencent says it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-22/google-bing-can-now-search-wechat-content-as-tencent-opens-up">fixed a vulnerability</a> that made some WeChat content available to Google and Bing</strong>, both of which are blocked in China. Ahead of the news, there was speculation that Beijing regulators had won a victory in their push to stop tech firms from building walled gardens which blocked rivals from accessing data in each others&#8217; services.</li>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s Play Protect service is <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-splits-play-protect-into-a-dedicated-app-but-its-not-yet-clear-whats-in-store-for-it-/">split off</a> into its own app with Android 12.</strong> The safety service scans for malware on your device, and could be now easier to update as a standalone application.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Team! Happy Saturday. It’s Friday afternoon as I write this to you, so I hope you are not at your desk. We’re having fun today, so please read this from the couch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7040-a-good-friend-will-always-stab-you-in-the-front">well-known Wildeism</a> goes that friends stab you in the front, which is true enough to make the quip worth remembering. It came to mind over the last week or two as I pondered the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/">decision by Coinbase to get into the NFT game</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222691" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A few facts will help detail why the Wilde reference fits the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>a16z co-founder ​​Marc Andreessen sits on <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx">the board of Coinbase</a>, a company that his firm backed before it went public.</li>
<li>a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/03/18/investing-in-opensea/"><em>led</em> OpenSea’s Series A</a>, a $23 million transaction that gave the NFT marketplace quite a lot of cash and cachet.</li>
<li>Coinbase Ventures <a href="https://ventures.coinbase.com/">also invested in OpeanSea</a>, one of a great many investments that the corporate venture capital firm has made.</li>
<li>And then Coinbase announced that it was getting into NFTs, driving a huge number of signups for its waitlist.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces">crypto-watching group DappRadar</a>, OpenSea is the biggest NFT marketplace today. Coinbase may swamp it if the users that have signaled interest in its competing solution wind up actually buying and selling NFTs on the well-known crypto-investing platform.</p>
<p>Which would put OpenSea in something of a pickle.</p>
<p>It’s fine for VCs to stay on corporate boards after they go public if they so choose and their portfolio companies retain them. Some VCs make a habit out of public board membership. Marc Andreessen is on Facebook’s board, for example, which <a href="https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/default.aspx">notes in its blurb on the man</a> that he previously held board seats at eBay and HP. Cool.</p>
<p>But it gets a little sticky when the investor in question stays on the board of a portfolio company after it goes public and decides to directly take on portcos of that same investor’s firm. Where that investor still works. If I was OpenSea and saw Marc on the Coinbase board at the same time as his venture firm was on my cap table, while Coinbase decided to attack my market, I’d be pissed.</p>
<p>Friends stab you in the front?</p>
<p>Also recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-scales-back-its-crypto-ambitions-once-again/">Facebook’s latest crypto push</a> is in partnership with, you guessed it, Coinbase!</p>
<p>There have been other ironies lately involving Facebook board members. For example, Peter Thiel is <a href="https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/default.aspx">on Facebook’s board</a>. And he’s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/billionaire-peter-thiel-donates-dollar10-million-to-hillbilly-elegy-author-jd-vances-potential-senate-run/ar-BB1eBZLJ">backing J.D. Vance, an aspiring politician</a>. Notably, J.D. Vance <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/21/j-d-vance-blake-masters-we-must-stop-facebook-election-meddling/">is attacking Facebook while running for office</a>. While the OpenSea saga is a bit irksome to watch as big companies working to sink smaller concerns is not really my favorite thing, watching Facebook money circulate back to biting Facebook in the ass <em>is</em> hilarious because no small fries were harmed in the process.</p>
<p>Still, though, you have to wonder if we shouldn’t spread the board seats around a little bit. Else a16z is going to keep finding itself working to undercut the very founders it backs.</p>
<h2>Volvo and other IPOs</h2>
<p>I meant to find time this week to dig into the Volvo offering, but failed. You can take a look at the <a href="https://investors.volvocars.com/~/media/Files/V/Volvo-Cars-IR/documents/prospectus-summary-volvo-car-ab-publ-18-october-2021.pdf">company’s notes on itself here</a>. Recall that Volvo has split from Polestar, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">going public via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>And as this week came to a close, Braze filed to go public. More on that company and its S-1 first thing on Monday.</p>
<p>More to come, including a look into the high-stakes startup race to build the best corporate gifting platform (no joke),</p>

		Anamarie Huerta Franc is managing director of <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/labs.html">SAP Labs</a> in the U.S., responsible for leading cross-company collaboration, location strategy, communications and employee engagement for development employees across the country.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Why do we go to the office?</p>
<p>This is not a rhetorical question. Do we go to be around other people and work collaboratively? Do we go because it’s a dedicated location that allows us to focus on our work in a unique way? Do we go because we believe it’s necessary to be “seen”? Do we go because we’re just <em>supposed to</em>, because it’s what we’ve always done?</p>
<p>At SAP, it’s important not only that we find answers to these questions, but that our employees play a role in answering them — and in building the hybrid workplace of the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Just this summer, we rolled out a brand-new, hybrid work pilot program at our offices in Palo Alto. For months, we’ve been testing different floor plans and setups, a variety of work schedules, the most productive uses of space and the ideal structure and composition of meetings. We’ve also been providing manager and leadership training, enablement and more that’s suited for this new world.</p>
<p>So, what have we learned? And how can you apply some of the lessons to your business?</p>
<h2>Getting to work: What our employees had to say</h2>
<p>Early employee feedback — from before and during the early stages of the pilot program — showed that demand existed for a high-utilization, high-energy workspace. We just had to find a way to build it so that people could use it not just when they needed to, but when they wanted to. So, what factors would make people want to come into the office?</p>
<p>Our research found four main factors:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Peer-to-peer learning<em> — </em></strong>Our employees are passionate about building out their network, and many cited peer-to-peer learning as an opportunity to quickly advance their careers and learn how SAP builds and innovates on its products.</p>
<p>While the majority of our onboarding, training and learning opportunities are still held virtually, we are now exploring hybrid options to give employees the opportunity to meet with each other in-person if they prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration<em> — </em></strong>If COVID permits, many people crave in-person interaction, according to our research. Video calls may be functional, but nothing matches the ability to sit across the table and brainstorm, learn and grow together.</p>
<p>Collaboration has been a major driving force for the employees participating in the hybrid work pilot program. We see a wide variety of our employees whiteboarding and sharing screens to solve complex problems together. The key is ensuring that they’re in a space equipped with high-quality video and audio equipment so that team members who are physically present and remote can be equally engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Community building<em> — </em></strong>All-hands meetings, Q&amp;A sessions and other team-building events just hit differently when you’re all in the same physical space. Many employees we surveyed mentioned semiregular get-togethers as clear benefits of being in the office.</p>
<p>We’ve only just started experimenting with hosting employee events in our physical offices again, and they look much different than they did before — smaller, outdoors and with COVID precautions in place. Before our first event, we asked ourselves: Will employees want to come? The answer was, overwhelmingly, yes.</p>
<p>We opened a sign-up for an employee meeting and within minutes, registration was full, with double the amount on a waiting list. The energy the day of the meeting was palpable, and the feedback from employees was very positive — they were thrilled to be together again.</p>
<p><strong>Intention<em> — </em></strong>Many people told us that they simply miss their office routine. For some, having the ability to get dressed in the morning, drive to work and sit at a desk with team members offers an unmatched productivity and focus boost.</p>
<p>Not all employees come to the office for teamwork and community. Some simply prefer to separate their personal and professional spaces and are looking for individual quiet areas where they find themselves most productive. Open collaboration spaces are essential in the office, but so too are quiet zones and phone booths.</p>
<p>One way we’ve tried to put these attributes into action is via scrum neighborhoods in our physical offices. The environments are designed with 15 to 20 available desks, set in beautiful and creatively liberating office spaces built to empower collaboration and teamwork. We’ve even built a mobile app to help achieve high utilization of the space. Teams can use the app to coordinate when they come to the office together, and book spaces and phone rooms.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we’ve worked with our leaders to better enable them to manage in our new reality, avoiding bias and molding the traditional manager-employee relationship into a more human and empathetic one.</p>
<h2>Early lessons from the pilot program</h2>
<p>This is only the beginning. Though the pilot program itself is well underway, we will not stop studying and testing the best ways to promote and optimize hybrid work for our employees going into the future.</p>
<p>We found that 80% of our employees want a mix of home and office work in the future. We also discovered that 80% intend to live in relatively close proximity to an office.</p>
<p>Still, many are uncomfortable returning at this particular moment. For those who have come into the office during the pilot program, though, many have specifically cited the peace and tranquility of an office working environment, the productivity of in-person meetings and amenities (like free coffee, snacks and lunch) as notable benefits. In addition, our leaders and managers feel better prepared to lead and manage in this environment, based on the communities of practice we have fostered with them.</p>
<p>With “normal” likely never to fully return, we must remain committed to continuous experimentation and introspection to determine what works and what doesn’t. Because the hybrid work model can’t just be successful in theory; it has to be successful in practice.</p>
<p>For instance, we’ve realized that many employees grew accustomed to being able to dramatically shift their working hours in the last year — whether working early in the morning or late at night to accommodate home and family life — and that eliminating a commute and an office has been a great adjustment for some on our team. Conversely, there are some previously in-person initiatives that still need to be rethought in order to improve overall execution and reach — and to make the employee experience more inclusive, regardless of location.</p>
<p>The questions we must ask ourselves are clear. Now, we just have to find our way to the answers.</p>
<h2>What’s next? Using the &#8220;why&#8221; to find the &#8220;how&#8221;</h2>
<p>At the same time, 2020 managed to hit pause and fast-forward on our work realities, a contradiction many of us are still learning to manage and operate within. We hope the lessons of our hybrid work pilot program can help inform the future of the office and productivity in this context, along with enabling our employees and leaders to navigate these changes. Moving into 2022, our pilot program findings will help inform our global flex work policies, giving regions around the world a baseline to determine what works best for them.</p>
<p>There is no better time to think through the answers than right now. So join us. Turn your “why” into a “how” and empower your employees to build the workplace of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As wave after wave of regulatory crackdowns have dominated China tech news in 2021, one can be excused for losing track of what is being regulated, who is doing the regulating, and what exactly the regulations are. From <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/strategist-on-chinas-regulation-of-its-tech-giants-fintech.html">fintech</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-coming-data-laws-leave-firms-with-more-questions-than-answers-2021-08-27/">data management</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-casualties-of-chinas-education-crackdown/">education</a>, the rules of the game are being re-written by a range of agencies, often at a rate faster than all but the keenest observers can follow.</p>
<p>For antitrust, a newly-empowered bureaucratic entity appears to be sending the signal that we are only at the beginning of a large-scale reorganization of how Chinese internet firms interact with consumers, vendors, and the state. Formed only three years ago as a merger of already-existing agencies, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) has quickly become a force to be reckoned with, reshaping how companies view risk and opportunity in the market with the world’s most internet users.</p>
<p>Having already levied hefty <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/china-tech-stocks-rise-after-meituan-hit-with-antitrust-fine.html%23:~:text=The%252520fine%252520equated%252520to%2525203,of%252520an%252520anti%25252Dmonopoly%252520investigation.">fines</a> on the likes of Alibaba and Meituan, recent developments suggest that SAMR is only getting started. On October 13, <i>Reuters</i> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-readies-plan-elevate-status-antitrust-unit-sources-2021-10-13/">reported</a> that China is considering upgrading the antitrust bureau within SAMR to deputy-ministerial status, under the name of the National Antimonopoly Bureau.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222826" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The elevated ranking would reportedly help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions and would also help to strengthen SAMR&#8217;s in-house capability to conduct research that it has previously had to outsource. This would be aligned with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-chinas-antitrust-regulator-bulking-up-crackdown-behemoths-widens-2021-04-11/">previous reporting</a> that the agency had been planning to considerably expand its workforce.</p>
<p>That portends further choppy waters for China’s tech giants and others competing for market share. It’s also rapidly changing the investor calculus of how to value some of the fastest-growing companies in the world.</p>
<h2>Trusts and the antitrust blowback</h2>
<p>This sort of regulatory blowback is hardly unprecedented. Known for its opulence and extreme inequality, the “Gilded Age” of the decades that followed the American Civil War saw the rise of the U.S. as an industrial and economic superpower. The period was marked by a weak central government and the rise of the country’s hyper-wealthy corporate interests and industrialists with names like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan, whose monopolies dominated economics, politics, and society.</p>
<p>While a time of great innovation and dynamism, its excesses also brought about the corrective measures of Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Era at the turn of the century, in which regulatory measures were taken to conserve natural resources, protect consumers and break up corporate monopolies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As several <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/chinas-gilded-age-paradox-economic-boom-and-vast-corruption">observers</a> have noted, present-day China has more than a few parallels with America as it transitioned from the Gilded to the Progressive Era: with a country stricken by social inequality, environmental degradation and behemoth corporate interests, Xi Jinping has consolidated control over the reins of the state and is attempting to curb the excesses that have resulted from decades of transformative growth.</p>
<p>Like Roosevelt, Xi appears to view his country’s most valuable corporations as oversized giants whose dominance threatens the long-term health of its economy and society. Yet while Roosevelt busted oil and railroad monopolies, Xi seems to have his sights set squarely on China’s world-leading internet companies.</p>
<h2>Redefining “monopoly” for the platform economy</h2>
<p>As China’s leaders seek to turn the page on the country’s Gilded Age through digital-era trust-busting, it is also looking to re-examine how monopolies are defined. For China and the rest of the world alike, this means crafting regulations that address the unique characteristics of market power in the digital economy. “As many of the large internet platforms are two-sided marketplaces, regulation needs to consider both consumer and merchant protections,” explains Michael Norris, a Shanghai-based analyst for market research firm AgencyChina. “Effective regulation needs to walk a tightrope between consumer protections, merchant interests, and platform economics.”</p>
<p>This stands in contrast to the longstanding established norm in the U.S. of the <a href="https://laweconcenter.org/resource/tldr-consumer-welfare-standard/">Consumer Welfare Standard</a>, which directs courts and regulators to focus on the effects that challenged business practices have on consumers, rather than on alleged harms to specific competitors. For a digital economy in which the largest players such as Alibaba or Amazon function largely as intermediaries between vendors and consumers, and which use their massive scale to outmatch their competition, increasing numbers of policymakers have argued that the Consumer Welfare Standard is insufficiently comprehensive.</p>
<p>SAMR appears to be taking that position as well, given the targets of its investigations and the penalties it has levied thus far. <a href="https://qz.com/1994879/what-is-erxuanyi-which-led-to-alibabas-2-8-billion-fine/">Alibaba</a> and <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202110/t20211008_335364.html">Meituan</a> have each been slapped with fines of 3-4 percent of annual revenue for their longstanding “choose one from two (er xuan yi 二选一)” practices, in which merchants were pressured to use the platform exclusively. While this practice was at times explicit, it often was exercised through more subtle or deceptive means, exploiting the data and recommendation algorithms that play such a prominent role in determining a merchant’s success. Some such tactics were listed in the recent SAMR announcement as it concluded its Meituan investigation.</p>
<p>Along such lines of forced exclusivity, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has also directed internet firms to tear down their “<a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008506/chinese-tech-companies-vow-to-tear-down-their-walled-garden-">walled gardens</a>,” and cease their formerly common practice of blocking competitors’ links on their platforms. Though adding complications for some firms, the banning of such behavior seems to be welcomed among Chinese consumers, as the inability to share Alibaba’s links on Tencent’s WeChat platform was a common annoyance.</p>
<p>SAMR has also ordered Tencent Music Entertainment to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-regulator-bars-tencent-exclusive-rights-online-music-2021-07-24/">cease</a> its exclusive deals with record labels, levying a minor fine of 500,000RMB (roughly $77,000), but also calling into question the business models of other content platforms whose business models rely heavily on exclusive deals with sought-after content producers.</p>
<h2>A challenging time for investors</h2>
<p>For investment firms, a greater concern may be in the heightened scrutiny over mergers and acquisitions. In July, a $5.3 billion merger between China’s leading game-streaming platforms Huya and Douyu was <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3141283/beijings-decision-block-tencents-douyu-huya-merger-deal-marks-end">terminated</a> two days after a SAMR decision to prohibit it, the first “adverse” merger control decision adopted by SAMR and its predecessor against a transaction without foreign participation.</p>
<p>Indeed, China’s antitrust push, coupled with its broader wave of regulations, have investors rethinking their strategy in the country. One anonymous employee of a prominent VC firm complained of greatly increased complications in gaining approval for a recent merger proposal, citing a far more invasive screening from SAMR than was previously expected, with questions ranging from business models and practices to issues of national security. In the end, the firm decided not to move forward with the deal.</p>
<p>Questions also loom large for the superstar firms that once headlined equity investors’ China portfolios. For many large, platform-based firms, consistent profitability has remained elusive. The prospect of continued growth and the profits that can be extracted from future market dominance was central to their once-soaring share prices and valuations. The e-commerce and food delivery fields in which Alibaba and Meituan operate, for example, are famously high volume/low margin areas. The fines, which amounted to 3-4% of top-line sales volume, do serious damage to already thin bottom lines.</p>
<p>Perhaps most worrisome to investors are the limited windows when they can achieve exits for their China-based investments. In addition to increased deal scrutiny that make mergers and acquisitions more difficult, regulatory roadblocks to IPOs are popping up where they have not been seen before. Though the dramatic eleventh-hour halting of Ant Group’s late-2020 listing sent shockwaves through the financial community, it was also seen as an anomaly: had it gone through, it would have been the biggest public offering in history. The intervention to block it was also conducted by China’s powerful central bank, and reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556">ordered</a> by Xi Jinping himself.</p>
<p>What we are now seeing is a growing number of regulatory agencies further down the bureaucratic hierarchy who have both the power and the mandate to interfere with IPOs if they deem it necessary.</p>
<p>There is, of course, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China’s counterpart to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has announced a new cross-agency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-market-regulations/china-forms-cross-agency-team-to-crack-down-on-securities-misbehaviour-idUSKBN2GC12C">task force</a> to crack down on illegal activities in the country’s capital markets as a number of the regulator’s former leaders are charged with <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-10-06/another-former-china-securities-official-under-investigation-101783541.html">corruption</a>.</p>
<p>After ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-suggested-didi-delay-its-u-s-ipo-11625510600">ignored</a> warnings not to go through with their U.S. offering until after conducting a thorough examination of its network security, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the country’s chief cybersecurity watchdog) appears to be dedicated to making an example out of the company, removing it from app stores and placing the future of both the firm and its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-didi-co-founder-liu-told-associates-she-plans-leave-sources-2021-09-20/">leaders</a> in question.</p>
<p>Finally, as SAMR is given elevated status, it is highly likely that it will also have the power to determine if and how a company is allowed to go public.</p>
<p>For investors hoping for IPOs, the road to their exit is lined with a growing number of checkpoints whose standards seem to be getting progressively tighter.</p>
<h2>How far will China’s antitrust mandate go?</h2>
<p>With an elevated regulator coupled to a sweeping mandate, China’s antitrust campaign can now potentially reach areas where very little precedent has been set. Compounded with the authoritarian nature of China’s political system, there is very little that firms can do to fight back. In many cases, the best they can try for is to comply, and maintain a positive working relationship with authorities, as the alternative is far worse.</p>
<p>“Chinese authorities are very adept at using reputational sanctions,” explained University of Hong Kong law professor Angela Huyue Zhang while appearing on <a href="https://technode.com/2021/03/19/china-tech-investor-chinese-antritrust-exceptionalism-with-angela-huyue-zhang/">my podcast</a> to discuss her book <i>Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism</i>. “They are very adept at leaking information to (state media) and there are different ways that they can announce an investigation, leading to different levels of media publicity.” Zhang went on to cite Alibaba’s $90 billion drop in market capitalization after the mere announcement of an antitrust investigation on Christmas Eve of 2020. As Didi is also now experiencing, the reputational taint of being outside of Beijing’s good graces can be as damaging as any formal punishment.</p>
<p>With investigations into Alibaba and Meituan now concluded, it may be the case that the scrutiny into “choose one from two” practices are wrapping up. However, fear and speculation outweighs the certainty at the moment, as a newly-empowered and staffed-up SAMR likely has plenty on its to-do list.</p>
<p>One popular theory is that the beefed-up SAMR will spend more of its muscle targeting subsidized group-buying practices that helped propel the rise of social e-commerce firms like Pinduoduo, but which also can place strong downward pressure on prices, hurting small vendors. In March, SAMR <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202103/t20210303_326448.html">slapped</a> minor fines on five firms for illegal behavior around group-buying practices. As such practices have been known to be quite common among China’s internet platforms, there could be considerably more to be found if regulators continue to dig, as well as harsher penalties, perhaps, to follow.</p>
<p>“Previous SAMR-issued fines and commentary show they take a harsh view of subsidies used to sell goods and services below cost,” says Norris. “A stronger penalty regime is what SAMR needs if it&#8217;s to create an effective deterrent to subsidy-driven growth.”</p>
<p>What is also worth noting is the extraterritorial nature with which antitrust can be used, particularly as a countermeasure to U.S. sanctions. “In 2018, there was an onslaught of sanctions on Huawei and ZTE and other Chinese tech companies, and this was really a wakeup call for the Chinese government, which realized that the U.S. has such strong extraterritorial sanctioning power,” said Zhang. “One of the tools that [the Chinese government] came up with was antitrust, as it allows them to exert extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign business.”</p>
<p>This came into play significantly in mid-2018, when Qualcomm <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm/qualcomm-ends-44-billion-nxp-bid-after-failing-to-win-china-approval-idUSKBN1KF193">abandoned</a> a proposed $44 billion acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors after struggling to get SAMR approval for the deal. Though U.S.-China relations appear to be somewhat brought back from the brink of the Trump years, it is clear that China considers extraterritorial antitrust measures to be an arrow in its quiver.</p>
<p>What we do know is that for both foreign and domestic firms alike, the free-wheeling days of China’s Gilded Age are quickly becoming a thing of the past, and that antitrust is a powerful tool in forcing that transition to happen.</p>
