										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Epic Games dares Apple to let Fortnite for iOS back in the App Store</h3>

<p>Following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/"> judge&#8217;s ruling</a> in the Epic-Apple antitrust lawsuit, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fortnite-likely-isnt-coming-back-to-the-app-store-anytime-soon/"> asked Apple to reinstate Epic&#8217;s developer account</a>. But as Epic said, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">aims to appeal the court&#8217;s ruling</a>, Apple informed the company that it won&#8217;t be reinstating Epic&#8217;s account until the appeals have been resolved. In effect, that means Fortnite may not return to iOS for years, if Epic is forced to wait for the appeal&#8217;s decision to be made final.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sweeney made the request public by <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690">tweeting</a> out a letter he sent to Apple making the request and the company&#8217;s response. The letter promises Apple that Fortnite would play by the rules &#8212; something that it didn&#8217;t do before, when it breached its contract with Apple by implementing its own payments to force the lawsuit. The letter also noted it had already disabled Epic payments server-side since it can&#8217;t update the app on users&#8217; devices. And it said it paid Apple the $6 million in fees ordered by the court, which had been gained as a result of routing around Apple&#8217;s in-app purchases with its own system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208071" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1440771699679498246"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208071" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2208071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?w=560" alt="" width="560" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=123,150 123w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=247,300 247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=768,933 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=560,680 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-24-at-11.42.24-AM.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1440771699679498246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Sweeney on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>But what makes the letter interesting is that it&#8217;s not just Epic asking for re-entry. It&#8217;s daring Apple to follow the current court order.</p>
<p>The judge&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">decision</a> deemed Apple &#8220;not a monopoly,&#8221; which Apple then jubilantly celebrated, saying it&#8217;s something &#8220;we&#8217;ve known all along,&#8221; quoting the judge&#8217;s statement that Apple&#8217;s success was &#8220;not illegal.&#8221; However, the one part of the case where Epic won was where the judge declared Apple&#8217;s current in-app purchase (IAP) system anticompetitive. The court&#8217;s decision was that Apple would now have to accommodate developers by giving them the choice to include buttons or links to other places where users could pay for their in-app purchases outside the App Store, in addition to Apple&#8217;s IAP option.</p>
<p>Sweeney&#8217;s letter tells Apple Fortnite will play by the rules if Apple will. That is, if Apple follows the court&#8217;s guidelines to allow buttons and external links to other purchasing mechanisms, then Epic would resubmit the Fortnite app. In other words, Epic is ready to take advantage of the now legal option to route around Apple&#8217;s IAP system.</p>
<p>Apple, though, wasn&#8217;t having it. Apple&#8217;s legal team called Epic&#8217;s behavior in the past &#8220;duplicitous&#8221; when it breached its contract, and Apple saw no reason to reinstate the account until the court&#8217;s decision is made final. And of course, Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690">tweeted</a> that too, noting that appeals may take up to five years. (So bad news, Fortnite players.)</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decline may help to signal to other developers not to try to break its rules, but for Epic it sets the stage for the next battle &#8212; one where it&#8217;s not just daring Apple to let it back in based on the new terms, but one where it&#8217;s also daring Congress to act, too. After all, Epic&#8217;s position seems to be, if Apple can boot out a multibillion-dollar company that made amends for breaking rules it believed to be illegal, then what hope would smaller developers have to ever fight back against the tech giant? And once kicked out, there is no other path to iOS. This seems to try to position Apple as the monopolist that the court said it wasn&#8217;t &#8212; which is what the appeal is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Apps to have a record Q3, with $34B in consumer spending </strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>A new forecast from (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">recently busted</a>) App Annie indicates the third quarter will be another good one for the app economy. Consumers worldwide will spend $34 billion on apps and games in Q3, a 20% year-over-year increase in spending. The jump indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on consumer habits and behavior is having a lasting effect when it comes to how people are now using apps for entertainment, shopping, work and education. Consumer spending on iOS apps grew 15% year over year to $22 billion, and 15% year-over-year on Google Play, to reach around $12 billion. Most of this revenue is generated by gaming apps, which account for 66% of the spend across both app stores. In terms of non-gaming apps, iOS commands 76% of consumer spending</p>
<p>Downloads in Q3 will also grow by 10% year-over-year to reach a record high of 36 billion, driven by Google Play and particularly downloads in emerging markets like India and Brazil, and others.</p>

<li><strong>Apple also <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/358512/ios-15-1-features-shareplay-release-date-how-to-install.html">released</a> to developers iOS 15.1, beta 1.</strong> The new beta adds SharePlay, the co-viewing feature for FaceTime, which did not make it in time for the public release of iOS 15. It also allows users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">store their vaccination records</a> in the Health app by taking a photo. (Or, if your health provider syncs your medical records, it may be in there already.)</li>
<li><strong>But! New data from <a href="https://mixpanel.com/trends/#report/ios_15">Mixpanel</a> indicates users are taking longer to upgrade to iOS 15 compared with iOS 14 at launch</strong>. In its first two days, iOS 14 had been adopted by 14.5% of users, compared with 8.5% for iOS 15.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1mmydqta">rolled out StoreKit 2</a> and new in-app purchase capabilities</strong>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apples-storekit-2-simplifies-app-store-subscriptions-and-refunds-by-making-them-accessible-inside-apps/">StoreKit 2 adds</a> new Swift-based APIs that allow developers to determine product entitlements and eligibility for offers, get a user’s history of in-app purchases, find out the latest status of a subscription, provide a way to request refunds and manage subscriptions from within an app, and more. An App Store Server API is also in production for getting users&#8217; IAP history and subscription status. App Store server notifications, which provide real-time updates on IAPs to enable developers to create customized experiences, are coming soon.</li>
<li><strong>iOS 15 brings a major ASO update to the App Store.</strong> Now, the store will hide the screenshots for the apps you already have installed on your phone, which allows other apps and games to gain more visibility. This will be particularly important for those that appear in searches for major brands.</li>

<li><strong>Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-go-app-checking-shoppers-will-use-companys-main-mobile-app-high-tech-stores">is shutting down</a> its Amazon Go app.</strong> The app allowed shoppers to go checkout-free at Amazon&#8217;s high-tech convenience stores where cameras and shelf sensors track what you buy.

<li><strong>Uber Eats <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uber-eats-adds-map-feature-so-users-can-find-nearest-restaurants-for-pickup/">added a new map feature</a> that allows users to search for food nearby by typing in either words or an emoji.</strong> That is, you could type in an emoji of a hamburger <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f354.png" alt="🍔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, and the map would display the exact distance from your location. The company said the change was introduced because a majority of users would switch to other map apps to find nearby food. Users will also be able to see delivery and pickup options within Uber Eats and the Uber app itself.</li>

<li><strong>Twitter continued to accelerate its product releases with this week&#8217;s introduction of even more features, including those in the crypto space.</strong> The company added support for <strong>Bitcoin tipping</strong> in its recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">“Tip Jar” feature</a>, which allows users to receive one-time payments through third-party services.

<p>Lounge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/lounges-new-app-aims-to-reimagine-the-office-for-the-remote-work-era/">launched a remote work app</a> into open beta which creates a more social environment for smaller, fully remote teams. The app introduces the concept of virtualized &#8220;desks&#8221; showing the time of day for that individual. It also offers &#8220;rooms&#8221; that can be organized by the company&#8217;s org chart or projects, or the rooms can be virtual representations of physical spaces &#8212; like a meeting room for gatherings or company cafeteria, where employees could hang out virtually. Desks and rooms can be locked and made private or they can be unlocked and open. Lounge also adopts features from consumer social apps like photo-sharing and drop-in audio for virtual &#8220;desk visits,&#8221; and displays employee&#8217;s participation in company-wide events, like steps or meditation challenges. Lounge is entering a public beta, which means you&#8217;ll have to <a href="https://lounge.place/">request access</a> for entry. <em>(Read the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/lounges-new-app-aims-to-reimagine-the-office-for-the-remote-work-era/">details</a> on TechCrunch)</em></p>

<p>With iOS 15, there are a number of new and improved Safari extensions now available. But one worth checking out is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696">Amplosion</a>, created by Christian Selig, also the developer of popular Reddit client app Apollo. The extension allows you to easily redirect from Google AMP pages to their normal, non-AMP counterparts. If, however, you prefer the AMP versions of some websites, you can add them to an in-app Allowlist. The extension will show you how many pages it&#8217;s blocked via an in-app counter and home screen widgets. There&#8217;s even an Easter egg in the form of a digital dog named Lord Waffles that lives in the app who has his own widget too. The extension is also fully open source for transparency. The app is a $2.99 download on the App Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here. </em></a></p>
<p>And just like that, TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 has come to an end. I’m exhausted, but it’s hard not to feel optimistic for the future after spending three days hearing vulnerable thoughts from some of the brightest minds in tech, from Canva CEO Melanie Perkins to comic-turned-creator Alexis Gay.</p>
<p>If I had to distill a singular takeaway from the hours of programming, demo floor and Startup Battlefield, it would be this: Disruption needs direction. We’re in the middle of unprecedented times, and while that’s been good news for some entrepreneurs (and bad news for very many), focus may be what leads us out of it.</p>
<p>The theme kept popping up in the panels that I hosted or tuned into. For example, when I bugged BBG Ventures’ Nisha Dua about how to best spend first-check capital, she kept homing in on the need for entrepreneurs to invest their north star, aka the most defensible and innovative part of their business, over flashier alternatives. When I bugged Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn about where his now-public company is going next, he drew a line that stopped right before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/duolingo-doesnt-want-to-disrupt-the-college-degree/">disrupting the college degree.</a> And of course, when I asked Reid Hoffman about how early-stage founders can better attract capital, he outlined why it’s important to have an opinion and stick by it — controversy preferred. Even Nth Cycle, the runner up of TC Battlefield, wants to revolutionize metals processing by complementing existing processes, not ignoring them altogether.</p>
<p>It was refreshing to hear grounded yet inventive perspectives throughout the week. For those who missed it, we’ll be publishing recaps of all panels over the next week. Here are some of my favorite panels so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2021-is-cellino/">And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2021 is… Cellino</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/warnermedias-andy-forssell-discusses-a-fascinating-first-year-for-hbo-max/">WarnerMedia’s Andy Forssell discusses a fascinating first year for HBO Max</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/built-by-a-refugee-enlights-edtech-tool-bets-it-can-help-students-hope-harder/">Built by a refugee, Enlight’s edtech tool bets it can help students hope harder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/sec-regional-director-erin-schneider-talks-spacs-coinbase-and-what-startups-could-do-better/">SEC Regional Director Erin Schneider talks SPACs, Coinbase and what startups could do better</a></li>

<p>Thanks to all of you that came out to learn, listen and support. As always, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_.</a> In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into bootstrapping and a crypto crackdown that you should probably be paying attention to.</p>

<p>Mailchimp’s sale sparked a conversation about bootstrapping, so my colleagues Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm dug into what it means to skip capital and grow off of revenues (imagine!). In their latest collab, the duo explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/">what bootstrapping is like today</a> — in a world of infinite APIs, well-trained techies and ample demand for better software services.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>They argue that the money is reaching farther than it ever has in the past.</p>
<blockquote><p>But startups that don’t need — or perhaps simply do not want — to raise expensive equity capital while scaling have more tools within arm’s reach than ever before. Revenue-based financing is now an established concept. Some companies are taking it even further. Pipe has built a marketplace where companies can sell revenue — or perhaps we should describe it as a marketplace where revenue can be traded. A more active market for the buying and selling of revenue should help with price discovery, perhaps resulting in more attractive prices for founders and a more liquid market for their future receipts; the more capital that founders can access by selling top line instead of shares, the more viable bootstrapping may prove.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Here’s what to know, according to Singh: “</strong>Regulators in China have been weighing a ban on crypto mining for several years. But in recent quarters, several local firms have started to embrace crypto. Chinese app maker Meitu bought Bitcoin and Ether worth $40 million in March.” It’s unclear if this ban will be different from other tensions, or if the home of the largest crypto mining services will soon be chilled.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello everyone! Disrupt was this week, which meant that I spent more time than usual with my feet up, watching panels and startup pitches. It was good fun, but also meant that I had fewer calls than I might in a more regular week. So, what follows is an abbreviated newsletter that is a touch more observational than reported, if you follow. Let’s have some fun!</p>
<h2>Observation one: NFT speculation is good fun</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-nft-on-ramp-is-still-too-steep/">recently dipped a single toe into the world of NFTs</a>. After covering the space, it was time to participate in a very minor fashion as you can learn a lot more by doing than merely reading. Of course I try to avoid any and all possible ethical quandaries, but I don’t think that my owning two-figures&#8217; worth of crypto so that I could attempt to purchase a low-cost JPEG will really upset the apple cart.</p>
<p>It all went to hell, but an NFT that a kind Twitter user sent me is racking up bids. While I have not derived much pleasure from the particular image that I now own the digital signature to on a particular blockchain more than, say, most other online images, it has been sporting to watch folks try to buy it off me.</p>
<p>Several bids worth hundreds of dollars have cropped up (the latest sitting at $382.94), which made me sit back and wonder who really wants my image. I presume that I’m seeing speculation over value collection in the offers, but I do now better understand why NFT fans are stoked by their cottage industry. After all, who doesn’t want to magically generate real-world value from an image that, until recently, would have had essentially zero value? It feels like cheating. (To be clear, I am not selling my NFT as I don’t want to bother with the taxes, and it <em>does</em> seem like selling it for profit would generate some sort of ethics issue. So I guess I will hodl? Forever?)</p>
<h2>Observation two: This is a great moment for fintech IPOs</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/it-turns-out-fintech-is-worth-as-much-as-saas/">scalding public-market reception for Boston-based fintech unicorn Toast</a> this week showed the world that it is possible to get software-like valuations for payments revenues, provided a sufficiently quick growth rate. Our read was that the warmth with which Toast was welcomed to the stock market indicated that it’s a great time for fintech unicorns to get off their collective duffs and go public.</p>
<p>I stand by that. But what I had perhaps missed was just how much value is sitting by the sidelines. Not in terms of valuation &#8212; we already know those numbers &#8212; but in terms of user numbers. Observe the following tweet:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Neobank landscape by customer size &amp; valuation. h/t Jefferies report. Will add a few more graphics/insights to this thread: </p>
<p>cc. <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryCap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JerryCap</a> <a href="https://t.co/vly99RyBV7">pic.twitter.com/vly99RyBV7</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Luis V. Sanchez (@LuisVSanchez777) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuisVSanchez777/status/1441478881668644869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>I wouldn’t have guessed that Chime was in fifth place, but those figures imply simply huge payment flows which, as we have recently seen, are currently valued like rivers of gold. So NuBank and Chime and Dave and others, let’s do this thing? Please?</p>
<h2>Observation three: Chinese tech is increasingly toxic</h2>
<p>News this week broke that <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/zooms-mega-merger-five9-hitting-135739068.html">the Zoom-Five9 deal could be in for regulatory issues</a> over the acquiring company’s Chinese roots. If Zoom having R&amp;D operations in China means that it’s megabuy of Five9 goes poof, it would be an indicator not only of increasing distance between the two globally leading economies, but also a door-closing moment on a possible source of tech liquidity.</p>
<p>Also this week Lithuania warned that hardware from Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi is able to detect and block certain terms that China’s government likes to censor. Now, maybe that’s just how Xiaomi makes all its phones, but it’s not a <em>great</em> look. The country has “told its civil servants to jettison their Chinese-made smartphones after experts found they contained automatic censorship software and other security flaws,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lithuania-orders-civil-servants-to-hang-up-chinese-smartphones-over-spyware-fears-30vm86xnw">The Times reported</a>.</p>
<p>Again, toxic.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If saving the environment is merely a lifestyle choice, the automakers and their latest electric vehicles have got us covered. Tesla’s Plaid touts performance. Leafs, Priuses and Volts preach humility. And Ford is flexing its muscle with launches of electric Mustangs and F-150s.</p>
<p>But if consumers’ choices are going to contribute to a greener future &#8212; if they’re going to opt for energy efficiency over flash &#8212; they need the ability to make smart purchasing decisions. To enable that, an old-fashioned measuring stick from the gasoline era could come in handy: the concept of miles per gallon.</p>
<p>In the electric vehicle (EV) era, car shopping is no longer a simple matter of finding a high-MPG car and a cheap gallon of gas. Electricity costs are confusing. Price and efficiency information is hard to find and harder to understand. And ultimately, you have to do the math.</p>
<p>That means getting to know electric energy’s unit of choice: the kilowatt-hour, or kWh &#8212; a string of characters better suited to an engineering textbook. To determine their costs and carbon footprints, drivers must solve the brain teasers that turn kWh into dollars and miles.</p>
<p>If you don’t do that, you’re trusting the automakers to do the right thing for you and the environment.</p>
<p>The government can lead on this problem. In fact, it has, and it does. Gas pumps have long been required to list the price of a gallon, gallons pumped and total fill-up cost. A vehicle’s EPA-mandated miles-per-gallon rating &#8212; displayed on dashboards and on every new car’s MPG sticker &#8212; ties it all together.</p>
<p>So maybe we already have a common denominator for the EV age. A familiar, tangible energy unit that gives us an apples-to-apples way to think about cost, efficiency and pollution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fellow Americans, say hello &#8212; again &#8212; to the gallon. Even as we leave the gas-powered car behind, we can keep its energy unit. It’s tangible, and if it works for the energy contained in gas, we can make it work for electricity.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/gvg/learn-more-fuels.htm">a gallon of unleaded gas contains about 34 kWh of energy</a>. Knowing that, you can easily deduce how much your energy purchase costs and how far it can take you. The gallon can even help you better understand your other electricity usage, putting your home energy costs on an apples-to-apples basis with your automobile’s energy costs.</p>
<p>When I gallon-ized my energy bills for the month of August, I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>My house used 56 gallons (1,888 kWh) worth of electricity.</li>
<li>My average home electricity cost was $6.34 per gallon.</li>
<li>At a Tesla supercharger, I paid $8.43 per gallon (25 cents per kWh).</li>
</ul>
<p>The government already publishes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/fuel-economy-and-environment-label-examples">an MPG equivalent for electric and hybrid vehicles</a>. Using MPG, it becomes clear that electric vehicles make up for a lot of that high cost-per-gallon in efficiency, often with ratings over 100 MPG.</p>
<p>MPG is already good for more than car shopping. <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123364_nyc-taxi-mpg-requirements-also-cut-pollution-study-confirms">New York City’s MPG mandates have doubled taxis’ fuel efficiency since 2009</a>. (The city also reserves a portion of taxi licenses &#8212; medallions &#8212; for hybrids.) Uber and Lyft have announced green initiatives, but their lightly regulated status has let them avoid MPG standards.</p>
<p>Smart energy shopping alone will not solve climate change. Energy watchdogs also need to monitor the industry’s carbon impact from both electricity generation and EV-related hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>All else equal, though, using less energy means less pollution. And common units can steer us toward smart choices that encompass far more than our cars. Should I buy batteries so I can stock up on electricity when it’s cheapest? Do solar panels make sense? What about better insulation or more efficient appliances?</p>
<p>A high-MPG vehicle and a home that also goes a long way on a gallon? Together, that would be a solid lifestyle choice.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 24, 2021. Hanging in there, everyone? It was more than a busy week, but the TechCrunch team is still ticking along, covering the startup world just for you. If you need to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-is/">catch up on who won Battlefield this year</a>, the Equity podcast crew has you covered. And with that, let’s begin! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/"><strong>China bans crypto (again):</strong></a> If you have paid any attention to the larger world of cryptocurrencies, you’re familiar with bad news from China. Over the past few years, the country has put an increasingly wet blanket on its place in the international crypto economy. More of the same from China today was enough to ding the value of major cryptos &#8212; not a great note to end the week on if you were Coinbase or Robinhood.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/latin-america-finds-a-champion-in-softbank-international-group-ceo-marcelo-claure/"><strong>SoftBank triples down on Latin America:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The battle to build the next great tech company is a global scrap, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/?tpcc=ECTW2020">few regions are as hot as Latin America</a>. One reason that LatAm has done so well in recent quarters has been a huge influx of capital from SoftBank. And as we learned this week, the Japanese telco and startup mega-investor has billions more earmarked for Latin American startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/"><strong>It’s a good time to bootstrap:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Looking back at a few Disrupt panels on alternative fundraising, going public and more, TechCrunch took a look at today’s bootstrapping economy. With more ways for startups to rake in capital than ever, the need to raise venture capital could be in decline for certain startup types &#8212; even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">as global venture capital totals shoot higher</a>.</li>

<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/hungryroot-co-founders-new-venture-noops-a-plant-based-pudding-startup-raises-another-2m/"><strong>Will consumes say “nope” to Noops?</strong></a> Well, the plant-based pudding company Noops certainly hopes not. It just raised $2 million after raising $2 million just a few months ago. The market for alt-milks is big. Perhaps oat milk puddings will become the next oat milk? Lerer Hippeau provided the new capital.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/operations-observability-platform-avenue-launches-with-4m/"><strong>Say hello to OpsObs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Avenue thinks that “operations observability” is going to be a hot ticket, and after launching its product last week, the startup announced that it has raised $4 million. Per TechCrunch reporting, the goal of Avenue is “give operations their own tools to monitor teams” via a “command center” of sorts. As someone who has never seen a chart in a UI I didn’t want to read, I presume that this will quickly become a trillion-dollar business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/as-remote-work-becomes-normal-ukio-raises-9m-for-premium-long-term-rentals/"><strong>Ukio raises $9M for longer-stay rentals:</strong></a><strong> </strong>One thing that Airbnb noticed during the pandemic was that while short stays were taking a whacking, longer-term rentals rose in popularity. Ukio is a startup-sized bet on the observation, offering units with rental schemes with terms of a month or longer. So, do you want to go work in Spain for a month? Ukio might have just the spot for you.</li>

<h2>How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing</h2>
<p>Most people know Ryan Reynolds from his movies, but he also owns a majority stake in Mint Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, which has grown more than 50,000% in the past three years. He also invested in Aviation Gin before selling it for a staggering $600 million last year.</p>
<p>He’s also a founder of Maximum Effort, the marketing firm that promotes the “Deadpool” franchise, Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile and that viral Match.com <a href="https://youtu.be/qmb5ENInqVk">ad featuring Satan and the year 2020</a> as a match made in hell.</p>
<p>He spoke to Jordan Crook about how startups can adapt his concept of “fast-vertising” to use real-time cultural moments as a springboard for building their own brand buzz, among other things.</p>
<p>“When we lead with creative and we have an idea or are inspired by something, we get quite aggressive with our excitement and try to make something infectious around it,” said Reynolds.</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/fcc-showers-schools-across-the-u-s-with-1-2b-from-emergency-connectivity-fund/"><strong>U.S. doles out $1.2B for underserved internet connectivity:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Tired of all the bad news in the world? We are too. In <em>good</em> news, the U.S. regulatory body responsible for domestic internet connectivity is rolling out big funds to help school districts get more kids online. It’s hard to do homework or participate in remote school without a connection, and not every kid has one. There’s more money coming as well, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/uks-ai-strategy-is-ambitious-but-needs-funding-to-match-says-facultys-marc-warner/"><strong>Will the U.K. fund its ambitious AI strategy?</strong></a><strong> </strong>The U.K. government wants the island nation to be a world leader in AI. Fair enough. But questions remain about just how much that will cost and if the same government is going to put up the required duckets. To be a leader in the global AI race, one merely has to beat out China, the United States and the EU for supremacy. Let’s see what Boris has planned.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/amazon-assembles-video-streaming-apps-to-fight-with-netflix-and-disney-in-india/"><strong>Amazon brings Prime Video Channels to India:</strong></a> Indian Amazon customers can now subscribe to eight different digital channels in their country, including “Discovery+ [for] $4 per year, Mubi $27, Hoichoi $8.2, DocuBay $6.8, ErosNow $4, Lionsgate Play $9.5, manoramaMax $9.5 and ShortsTV $4,” TechCrunch reports. Amazon’s digital media ambitions appear undaunted, so expect more on this theme in coming quarters from both the Indian market and others.</li>

<p>And to close us out, Chris Pratt is apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">taking on the voice role for famous digital character Mario</a> in an upcoming movie. We don’t get it either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If that headline sounded judgmental, I apologize.</p>
<p>We just wrapped up a three-day virtual event that included discussions and interviews with some of the most notable people in technology, media, government and venture capital.</p>
<p>Even in person, there’s no way to absorb Disrupt in its entirety.</p>

<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn has appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt before, but this year was his first time representing a public company.</p>
<p>A few months ago, reporter Natasha Mascarenhas described Duolingo’s debut as the “bellwether edtech IPO of the year,” so she was well-equipped with questions about the company’s plans for boosting revenue. For example, is premium content in the cards?</p>
<p>“If we wanted to make more money in the short-term, we could probably start paywalling things, but I think that would stifle our growth,” von Ahn says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If we start charging for some aspects of language learning, eventually we’re just gonna charge for everything.”</p>
<p>Here’s a recap, along with a video that captures the entire interview.</p>

<p>The amount of plastic pouring into our oceans is set to triple by 2040, and most un-recycled plastic in the world is generated by consumer packaged goods.</p>
<p>As people look to minimize the waste they produce, startups are coming up with novel solutions to help people and companies meet sustainability goals.</p>

<p>Connie Loizos asked Erin Schneider, regional director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s San Francisco office, about crypto lending and the potential for new regulations covering SPAC companies and NFTs, but Schneider was clear from the outset that she was limited in what she could say.</p>
<p>“She did, however, share insight into her personal thinking about a range of these issues, which, given her position, seems very much worth knowing,” writes Connie.</p>

<p>The U.S. healthcare system is a contentious topic, an uncomfortable truth that became evident when Darrell Etherington moderated a conversation with Cityblock Health president and co-founder Toyin Ajayi, Forward CEO and founder Adrian Aoun, and Carbon Health‘s Eren Bali.</p>
<p>“We keep saying that these companies are kind of consumer-centric,” Aoun says.</p>
<p>“But in many ways I think one of the things that you realize is that when you get in bed with the insurance companies, which, whether it’s a Carbon or a Cityblock, at the end of the day, [if] you get in bed with the insurance companies, unfortunately, your incentive is basically not to go build a good consumer product.”</p>
<p>Said Darrell: “Let’s just say this conversation got heated — fast.”</p>

<p>Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck told Senior Editor Devin Coldewey that his own ambition to explore and learn from space goes back to his youth.</p>
<p>“I always felt that, if I could have the opportunity to go out into those stars and explore and perhaps ask or answer, one of the biggest questions in mankind’s history — ‘Are we the only life in the universe or not?’ — I would take that chance,” Beck says.</p>

<p>Where will today’s technologies lead us over the next 20 years, and what will an AI-infused world look like across the globe?</p>
<p>Sinovation founder and AI thought leader Kai-Fu Lee and breakout sci-fi author Chen Qiufan (aka Stanley Chen) make an educated guess in “AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future,” a set of stories and essays that explore AI’s potential and pitfalls.</p>
<p>After reading the book, Senior Editor Devin Coldewey talked with Lee and Chen about how the collaboration came about, how their points of view coincided and differed, and why they think the future will be how they describe it.</p>

<p>Peloton CEO John Foley discussed broader safety issues with the category, noting that the unfortunate circumstances behind a recent recall forced the company to take a closer look at product safety, as well as whether the company will maintain its pandemic-boosted growth as cities reopen.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a lot more people get excited about Peloton and say, ‘I’m not going back to the gym, the gym was a failed model. It was a failed contract between the member and the business, and actually, I didn’t go to the gym. It wasn’t convenient, I didn’t want to go drive somewhere and shower outside my home and take that extra time away from my family,’” the CEO says.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm has spilled much ink about the Toast IPO in recent weeks, but he kept at it Thursday, comparing the debut of the Boston-based software-and-payments company to Remitly’s Wednesday evening flotation.</p>
<p>Seattle-based fintech Remitly, like Toast, priced above its proposed range.</p>
<p>“At $43 per share, Remitly is valued less like a fintech company with gross margins in the 50% to 60% range and more like a middle-tier public SaaS firm, flush with recurring revenues and net-dollar retention north of 100%,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“The lesson from today’s public markets appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks.”</p>

<p>“When we first shared LatAm’s digital acceleration story in last year’s Latin America Digital Transformation Report, we believed we were at the peak of digital growth catalyzed by the pandemic,” Julio Vasconcellos, the managing partner of Latin America-focused VC fund Atlantico, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“But with 2021 came all the second- and third-order effects of the crisis, further accelerating a continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.”</p>
<p>Vasconcellos breaks down the details from this year’s report. Just one eye-popping stat: Eight new unicorns have already been minted in the region this year, nearly hitting the 2020 rate by midyear.</p>

<p>Design software startup Canva has experienced “staggering growth,” Managing Editor Jordan Crook writes in a recap of her conversation with Canva CEO Melanie Perkins.</p>
<p>With a fresh $200 million and a $40 billion valuation, could Canva utilize acquisitions to continue that explosive growth?</p>
<p>“As a company with huge goals — to empower anyone in the world to design, and as a result of that, to become one of the most valuable companies in the world — anyone who helps Canva ‘leapfrog’ toward those goals is particularly interesting as an acquisition target,” Jordan wrote of her chat with the CEO.</p>

<p>Ingrid Lunden began with a simple question when she sat down with Calendly founder and CEO Tope Awotona: If the product works well, how do you take it to the next level — and frankly, why should you?</p>
<p>Calendly raised $350 million at a $3 billion valuation earlier this year, but little has changed despite the infusion of cash.</p>
<p>“The question I had at the time [of that funding round] was, will the company take it as a distraction and become enamored with the publicity that comes with that? Or will we stay focused and continue to work really hard for our customers and partners and ourselves?” Awotona says.</p>
<p>“Nine months later, it’s very clear that we’ve done the latter. Our culture and values have more or less remained the same.”</p>

<p>Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor discussed their $28 billion merger, how they’re integrating the two companies, and the ongoing competition it faces from Microsoft Teams, which has grown faster than Slack, and which Butterfield once said was “unhealthily obsessed with killing Slack.”</p>
<p>“Over the last year, maybe even 18 months, I think Microsoft’s preoccupation with Slack has shifted somewhat to a preoccupation with killing Zoom, because Teams turns out to not really [be] so much of a direct competitor,” Butterfield says.</p>

<p>When is the right time to hire someone to oversee a company’s security efforts?</p>
<p>In an interview with Security Editor Zack Whittaker, Twitter CISO Rinki Sethi talked about the modern role of a chief information security officer and how the next generation of CISOs can stay ahead.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be the security idealist and say you need to invest in security before the product or business features, but I think there’s a really strong balance,” Sethi says. “If you think about building security right from the beginning, I think you do have a really strong competitive advantage.”</p>

<p>It took a global pandemic for BioNTech to become a household name: The technology it had been plugging away at meant it “happened to be positioned extremely well to use its mRNA technology to address the novel coronavirus, in part because it already had a partnership in place with Pfizer to develop a flu inoculation.”</p>
<p>BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin spoke with News Editor Darrell Etherington about the company’s start and its “broader vision,” which extends beyond the use of mRNA.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, BioNTech’s mission is to make treatments that are optimized not only to specific patient needs, but also to time and place,” Etherington writes in a recap for Extra Crunch. “All the treatments in the company’s pipeline are about refining the approach to addressing disease, making the process much more like a metaphorical scalpel than a bludgeon.”</p>
<p>“We can develop classical pharmaceuticals like a vaccine [in the case of COVID], but on the other side, also really continue to follow our vision,” Şahin says.</p>

<p>Many celebrities have turned their personal interests into thriving commercial concerns: Ryan Reynolds owns Aviation Gin, Jessica Alba founded nontoxic goods startup The Honest Company, and George Clooney will earn as much as $1 billion for selling his tequila company.</p>
<p>This year, actor Seth Rogen co-founded Houseplant, which sells pottery, cannabis and related accessories.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold house goods in all 50 states at this point,” Rogen explained. “That’s us, developing a relationship and trust with customers in places where weed is not legal yet.”</p>
<p>In a conversation with Managing Editor Matt Burns, Rogen, CEO Mike Mohr and chief commercial officer Haneen Davies discussed some of the challenges of brand-building within the confines of a strict regulatory environment.</p>
<p>“I think the merger of house and plant is what’s going to help us establish a brand name that goes beyond the limiting restrictions you have to abide by to communicate cannabis,” Davies says.</p>

<p>No one roots for a global pandemic, but WarnerMedia launched HBO Max just as cities and states across the U.S. restricted in-person gatherings as COVID-19 spread.</p>
<p>In many ways, the service seemed well-positioned, even in a crowded sector. HBO Max brought decades of critically acclaimed series, coupled with pricey acquisitions like the “Friends” and “South Park” back catalogs.</p>
<p>COO Andy Forssell joined TechCrunch Disrupt to discuss the fascinating 17.5 months of the service’s life so far:</p>
<p>“The early impacts were all negative, though, I think we, along with everyone in the industry, learned to roll with them,” he says. “Everybody had to work from home. That was tough, though I think we made the transition better than everyone thought. We were at launch mode at that point.”</p>

<p>Most people know Ryan Reynolds from his movies, but he also owns a majority stake in Mint Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, which has grown more than 50,000% in the past three years. And he also invested in Aviation Gin before selling it for a staggering $600 million last year.</p>
<p>He’s also a founder of Maximum Effort, the marketing firm that promotes the “Deadpool” franchise, Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile, and that viral Match.com ad featuring Satan and the year 2020 as a match made in hell.</p>
<p>He spoke to Jordan Crook about how startups can adapt his concept of “fast-vertising” to use real-time cultural moments as a springboard for building their own brand buzz, among other things.</p>
<p>“When we lead with creative and we have an idea or are inspired by something, we get quite aggressive with our excitement and try to make something infectious around it,” Reynolds says.</p>

<p>Since first announcing it was planting a stake in the ground in the region in early 2019, SoftBank has plugged more than $5 billion into Latin America and expects that number to top $8 billion by year’s end.</p>
<p>Its capital contributions are meaningful. In 2019, startups across Latin America raised $5.3 billion in funding, according to CB Insights. In 2020, they raised roughly the same amount.</p>
<p>This year, the pace of dealmaking has shifted into overdrive, with $9.3 billion being invested in Latin American startups in the first six months of the year. SoftBank Group CEO Marcelo Claure believes that by 2023, close to $30 billion will be invested in the region annually.</p>
<p>“Finally, the world has realized that Latin America has size,” Claure, a native of Bolivia, said this week at TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim have spent a lot of time unpacking this year’s staggering venture capital numbers, but they ended the week with a look at the value of startups eschewing VC.</p>
<p>“After all, not all successful startups are in a good position to IPO, and we are facing an IPO traffic jam that even SPACs are failing to solve,” they write.</p>
<p>“But funded unicorns can’t escape it: They need to provide liquidity to their investors, and it’s too late for them to pursue a different route. Their bootstrapped counterparts, in contrast, have options.”</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanka-srinivas-tlgc/">Priyanka Srinivas</a> is the co-founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.thelivegreenco.com/"> Live Green Co</a>, a Chilean food tech startup that uses artificial intelligence to suggest plant-based alternatives for meat and artificial additives in food. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to gender equality in the business world, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1191968-but-knowing-that-things-could-be-worse-should-not-stop">hit the nail on the head</a>: “Knowing that things could be worse should not stop us from trying to make them better.”</p>
<p>While access to opportunities, funding and support has improved for women in the startup space over the last couple of decades, there is still a long way to go. In fact, women early-stage entrepreneurs receive an average of<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet"> $1 million</a> less in funding than men do, despite performing better on average. Leaders across the board openly advocate for female-founded businesses receiving more venture capital and entrepreneurship support, but few are taking decisive actions to close this glaring gender gap.</p>
<p>The problem lies not in the fact that women don’t want to build million-dollar businesses, but in the disconnect between our dreams and the industry support we receive — or lack thereof. As the world embraces a new way of working and strategizes for a post-pandemic world, it’s vital to investigate new ways of supporting women’s entrepreneurship. Here are the key questions that we need to ask — and how we can go about resolving them.</p>
<h2>What are the systemic difficulties that women face today?</h2>
<p>Few business leaders will openly state that they have little interest in a more gender-equal world. However, the gap between intention and outcome illustrates that nowhere near enough decisive action has been taken to make this the case.</p>
<p>Women founders face obstacles across the board. Even in my industry of environmentally and socially conscious brands, women leaders are worse off than their male counterparts: <a href="https://veganwomensummit.com/founder-survey">This 2020 Vegan Women Summit founder survey</a> found that 45% of respondents have faced bias while fundraising and 75% say they have dealt with gender bias specifically. Women have historically been <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">asked different questions by VCs</a> than their male counterparts, and, as a result, are seen as less ambitious and less focused on potential gains.</p>
<p>Even before decision-makers have met women job applicants, their subconscious bias is already coming into play. In <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/research-to-reduce-gender-bias-anonymize-job-applications">this study</a>, acceptance rates of women candidates rose from 18% to 30% by obscuring the gender in the application.</p>
<p>Women working in technology often face assumptions and questions about their family life, marital status and children, which leaders and VCs may consider to be obstacles to their progress within a company or a limit to their potential as a founder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Combating these inequities requires a concerted effort from VCs and company leaders to invite more women into decision-making positions.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to apply for <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B Corporation certification</a>, making it essential for the company to work toward reducing inequality in its workforce. Another would be to introduce diversity quotas for women in leadership positions — an approach that has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-29/california-diversity-law-shows-quotas-work?sref=VLsP8x9g">seen success</a> since its legal implementation in California.</p>
<h2>How can we better support women to grow their companies?</h2>
<p>Women are consistently losing out when it comes to accelerator backing and VC support. In Chile, where I founded my company, 77% of women entrepreneurs use their own savings as financing, while only <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6817977057054642176/">14%</a> have obtained co-financing from state or private programs.</p>
<p>In my experience, while many groups attempt to improve the inclusion and representation of women, the majority of them fail to move beyond conversation and superficial resolutions.</p>
<p>For example, a commonly cited solution for more women founders in tech is to encourage more women to study STEM subjects. This is a start, but it seems that the issue requires more than simply adding women to the funnel. Instead, we need to better understand what’s holding women back from growing their businesses to their full potential.</p>
<p>Women lose out time and time again when it comes to startup funding. We need to better support women through the entire startup lifecycle, from seed to IPO, especially when it comes to raising external capital.</p>
<p>One initiative that’s doing important work in this area is Start-Up Chile’s <a href="https://www.startupchile.org/attention-female-entrepreneurs-start-up-chile-is-opening-the-application-process-for-the-s-factory/">The S Factory</a>, a pre-acceleration program specifically for female entrepreneurs that provides selected startups with mentoring, pitch training and workshops, along with a cash injection of $15,000. These types of initiatives should be expanded from seed to provide support for Series A, B and C rounds through IPO.</p>
<p>Given that women often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90277129/the-hidden-networking-gap-between-men-and-women">lack access</a> to the same networking and mentoring opportunities that men are privy to in the tech world, organizations like <a href="https://thenextwomen.com/">TheNextWomen</a>, a global network of women-founded companies and female investors, are essential. TheNextWomen helps female founders benefit from a community of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors through knowledge-driven programs and inspirational events. <a href="https://womentechfounders.com/">Women Tech Founders</a> also champions the value of female-only networks, aiming to connect, inspire and advance women in tech through events and online resources.</p>
<p>These communities can be fundamental for women entrepreneurs and other women tech leaders seeking to build a support system around them and gain the skills necessary to grow their businesses.</p>
<h2>How do we fix funding?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=2a2411db185d">lack of diversity</a> at VC funds is stark and remains an overwhelmingly contributing factor to the disproportionately <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/Q1_2020_PitchBook_NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf">low amount of VC funding</a> that women receive — a number that is <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-female-founders-drops-low">not improving</a>. In fact, in the U.S., only <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jh572x5wd4r0/7qRourAWPj0U9R7MN5nWgy/711a6d8344bcd4fbe0f1a6dcf766a3c0/WVC_Report_-_The_Untapped_Potential_of_Women-Led_Funds.pdf">4.9%</a> of VC partners are female, and in Europe, the picture isn’t much better: <a href="https://www.diversity.vc/diversity-in-vc-report/">83%</a> of U.K. firms have no women on their investment committees. It’s no surprise then that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34bdff48-f6cb-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c">93%</a> of tech investment in Europe goes to companies with no female founders.</p>
<p>To fix funding, we need investors with a gender-neutral lens, evidenced by metrics that measure their progress on diversity and inclusion. On average, startups founded or co-founded by women generate 10% more in cumulative revenue over five years — yet they receive <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet">less than half</a> the average investment of men. These statistics will be key in demonstrating that investing in women is not taking a risk — in fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>What’s more, female-focused investors are emerging as a way to lift women-founded companies and level the playing field. For example, the Female Founders Fund <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio-chafkin/female-founders-fund-anu-duggal-melinda-french-gates.html">recently closed its third fund valued at $57 million</a>, making it the biggest seed fund for women in the world.</p>
<p>In Asia, many investors are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/wealthy-families-lead-charge-into-gender-lens-investing-in-asia?srnd=premium-asia">seeing the value in backing women-led companies</a> — and reaping the rewards. Over 90% of SoGal Ventures’ portfolio companies have female co-founders, and the fund has generated an internal rate of return of over 80% over the last four years. Initiatives like these can help level the playing field for women and provide them with the opportunities to fulfill their potential.</p>
<p>When it comes to fixing the gender divide in the startup world, there’s no silver bullet. Closing the gap requires a concerted effort from all sides of the industry, from founders to investors.</p>
<p>Only by leaving behind inclusivity lip service and taking decisive actions to bring women into funds and encourage them as founders will we start to achieve gender equity in the startup world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to online calendars and calendar apps, services like Google Calendar and Outlook from Microsoft rule the roost with hundreds of millions of users globally. Now another company is hoping to ruffle some feathers with its own move into the space. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Yahoo is working <a href="https://day.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day</a>, a new standalone calendar app. Sources tell us the company has recruited Jeremy Le Van &#8212; who co-founded another calendaring app, Sunrise, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/microsoft-sunrise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually sold it to Microsoft for over $100 million</a> to make it the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/microsoft-updates-outlook-for-ios-with-sunrise-inspired-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backbone</a> of Microsoft&#8217;s own very popular calendar platform in Outlook &#8212; to help design it.</p>
<p>Many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/sunrise-was-the-best-calendar-app-ever-and-now-i-feel-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lamented</a> the sunset of Sunrise; now it looks like they might have a shot at getting Sunrise 2.0, so to speak.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: Yahoo happens to be owned by the same company as TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are exploring different ways to better serve consumers and that includes new ideas around mobile-first time management, calendar and events,&#8221; a Yahoo spokesperson said in response to our question.</p>
<p>The service is currently in an invite-only closed alpha as it gears up for a bigger launch (you can also sign up on the site).</p>
<p>Calendars serve as the backbone for how many of us organize our days, whether it&#8217;s for work or leisure. And arguably, the more our activities, and the planning of them, move to digital platforms, the more powerful calendars can become, too.</p>
<p>This means that for platforms, having a calendar feature or app as part of a bigger service is a good way of keeping users engaged on the wider platform, and it&#8217;s a way for the platform to glean more knowledge about user behavior. Google&#8217;s Calendar, for example, is very tightly, and often automatically, integrated with its wider suite of productivity and information services, giving the company one more spoke in its wheel to keep users sticking around.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it&#8217;s not only Yahoo that might be interested in doing more here. Facebook <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/26/17615946/facebook-acquisition-redkix-workplace-email-messaging-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Redkix</a> in 2018 allegedly to bring more calendar and other productivity tools to Workplace. In the end, Workplace integrates with existing offerings from third parties, and so it doesn&#8217;t have its own standalone calendar app. Facebook also doesn&#8217;t have a standalone calendar feature in the main consumer app, either. But with people planning so much else on Facebook&#8217;s properties (not just through Events on Facebook, but across Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger), it seems that it&#8217;s an area it could feasibly still expand into at some point.</p>
<p>Yahoo itself, in fact, already has a pared-down <a href="https://calendar.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi55YWhvby5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHE7T5C_0tisZ4OSdCAyCAuBBAuyLNRCM8lQlhSuyRFcsFDxqxcIdIWMTwepdDz9_A_FfWV8L7gkyCPeRrY8RygnEcR2I_eTprXTijTRGkPLlNmrw1TZX-KFjSki8vL8DJb8FsAChWqmDOU9Zx0h6sfYQwcawPwSGpEXMdmFmTzR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calendar widget</a> that you can access through Yahoo Mail. It&#8217;s not clear how popular it is, especially since it&#8217;s very easy these days to integrate one&#8217;s email to most other calendar apps.</p>
<p>The question, then, will be how Day might hope to differentiate itself, and how it will hope to compete.</p>
<p>From what we understand, in contrast to how Google, Microsoft or even Yahoo itself currently integrate calendar features into their wider productivity suites, this isn&#8217;t the approach that Yahoo is taking with Day.</p>
<p>The app is being built by people in its Mail team, but it&#8217;s being treated &#8220;like a startup&#8221; in the operation, we&#8217;ve heard, and has been given license to develop it independently: it has no special Yahoo branding, nor with any Yahoo integrations whatsoever. The plan is to keep it separate, not unlike the many calendar apps &#8212; like Sunrise once was &#8212; that exist in app stores, and make it something that can integrate with whatever other email or other tools that a person users. Over time there also may be efforts to use Mail &#8212; which still has around 200 million users &#8212; to help market Day.</p>
<p>The move underscores how Yahoo &#8212; which has effectively lost out to Google in areas like search, email, video and advertising &#8212; believes that with the right approach, there is still room for more innovation in this crowded market, even as it has a number of misses in its history of trying to do just that in other areas, <a href="https://www.uctoday.com/collaboration/rip-yahoo-together-chat-tool-gone-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like messaging</a>.</p>
<p>But as we noted in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/how-calendly-is-building-a-platform-by-turning-scheduling-into-a-center-stage-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent story about Calendly</a> &#8212; a $3 billion startup that&#8217;s proven to be a big hit with people who need to schedule meetings &#8212; calendar apps can be challenging for another reason. They are well-used, yes, but also somewhat under the radar: calendars are never the destination for a person, just a place to mark when, how and with whom you will get there. Can there be more ways of enhancing that basic functionality?</p>
<p>Yahoo seems to believe there are, and that people will want to use an app that does so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year has been one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with companies like Astra and Firefly Aerospace actually getting rockets up and running (if not flying as designed quite yet), and with landmark human spaceflight missions from Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data Gold Rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren’t available before.</p>
<p>Joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> happening December 14-15 is <strong>Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners</strong>, who focuses largely on frontier technology and specifically on the commercialization of space, drones, autonomous vehicles and the future of agriculture and food technology.</p>
<p>Hatch brings a lot of expertise to the table. She studied aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan before earning her Master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from Stanford. She then continued on to Boeing, then SpaceX, where she worked with the government on integrating its payloads with the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to hear from her at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. Grab your tickets to join us and save $100!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-commits-over-12b-first-emergency-connectivity-funding-wave">sent out the first checks from its Emergency Connectivity Fund</a>, an effort to help close the &#8220;homework gap&#8221; at schools by covering the cost of computers and internet services. Thousands of school districts, in every state plus D.C., Guam and Puerto Rico, will split this first $1.2 billion distribution, and there&#8217;s still <em>lots</em> more to come.</p>
<p>The problem they are looking to mitigate is the large number of students who, in an age when studying, homework and now even classes are all done online, lack a device or adequate internet connection to participate. This exacerbates an existing inequality, for these students often lack access to other resources and end up falling behind through no fault of their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/fcc-begins-rollout-of-10b-in-connectivity-aid-through-emergency-funds/">The ECF was conceived to combat this</a>, and funded earlier this year as part of the big pandemic recovery bill. It&#8217;s a $7 billion program in total, but the money is being distributed over time as schools and libraries make their formal requests, saying they need to cover the cost of this many tablets, or wireless hotspots, or broadband connections. The FCC seems to be picking up the bill as long as the request is reasonable and the paperwork is in order.</p>
<p>&#8220;From small rural libraries like the Sesser Public Library in Sesser, Illinois, to large school districts like Baltimore City Public Schools, this first wave of funding will provide more than 3 million connected devices for remote learning and will make a major dent in closing one of the cruelest parts of the digital divide,&#8221; said acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel in the news release.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not evenly divided, but distributed according to the applications received. The biggest state recipient is New York with $243 million ($192 million of which goes to NYC), followed by Texas with $97 million, and California with $71 million. Several states got far less (Wyoming and South Dakota took in less than $100,000 each), but this could very easily be a question of those districts just choosing to get their paperwork in for the second fund disbursement.</p>
<p>To that end, September 28 marks a new application period, for equipment and services used from this last July to next June — though the FCC noted it is still processing applications from the first batch, so if your district hasn&#8217;t heard back on that, don&#8217;t worry. And if they haven&#8217;t applied yet, best get started!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Starting in 2030, California will require all light-duty autonomous vehicles that operate in the state to emit zero emissions. Signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-23-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>SB 500</ins></a> represents the latest effort by the state to limit the sale of new internal combustion vehicles with an eye towards reducing greenhouse emissions. In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that effectively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>banned the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered</ins></a> vehicles by 2035. That same year, the state’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>Air Resources Board</ins></a> mandated that all new trucks sold in California emit zero emissions by 2045.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement to Engadget. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero-emissions fleet from the start.” Cruise backed SB 500 through its involvement with the <a href="https://www.emissionzero.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>Emission Zero Coalition</ins></a>, a group that also includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuro-california-dmv-deployment-permit-214528906.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>autonomous delivery startup Nuro</ins></a>.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>Environmental Protection Agency</ins></a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse emissions in the US since 2019, with light-duty vehicles accounting for more than half of that output. However, autonomous cars currently represent only a tiny fraction of the nearly 15 million vehicles on California roads. Moreover, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><ins>Cruise</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-san-francisco-trusted-tester-170602490.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>Waymo</ins></a>, two of the most prominent companies testing fully autonomous taxi services in the state, utilize fleets made almost exclusively of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-gm-ev-only-assembly-plant-detroit.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><ins>electric</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-19-google-waymo-chrysler-self-driving-minivan.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1"><ins>hybrid</ins></a> vehicles. This latest move from California then is about preventing autonomous vehicles from becoming major polluters in the future, particularly if driverless taxi services become popular among commuters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is it just us or has everyone’s calendar hit warp factor 9? We can’t believe there are only 34 days left before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=1weeklefttosave&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weeklefttosave&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> kicks into high gear on October 27. If you don’t have your pass yet, the clock on early-bird savings is winding down fast. Time to bump that quick task to the top of your to-do list, folks.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=1weeklefttosave&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=1weeklefttosave&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your early-bird pass</a> to TC Sessions SaaS 2021 — and save yourself $100 — before the price <strong>expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>

<p>Data is the lifeblood of, well, just about everything but especially SaaS. You’ll find plenty of discussions on how to use, wrangle and share an exponential deluge of information — without getting mired. Take a peek at these three data-driven panels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data, Data Everywhere:</strong> As companies struggle to manage and share increasingly large amounts of data, it’s no wonder that Databricks, whose primary product is a data lake, was valued at a whopping $28 billion for its most recent funding round. We’re going to talk to CEO Ali Ghodsi about why his startup is so hot and what comes next.</li>
<li><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack:</strong> The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Chandra Gangireddy (Allbirds), Ben Gotfredson (Snowflake), Adam Gross (formerly of Heroku) and Soumyadeb Mitra (RudderStack) will discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like.</li>
<li><strong>How Startups are Turning Data into Software Gold:</strong> The era of big data is behind us. Today’s leading SaaS startups are working with data, instead of merely fighting to help customers collect information. We’ll talk with leaders from three data-focused startups: Jenn Knight (AgentSync), Barr Moses (Monte Carlo) and Dan Wright (DataRobot). They’ll discuss how they’re forging new markets to get insight on the way today’s SaaS companies leverage data to build new companies, attack new problems and, of course, scale like mad.</li>
</ul>

It reportedly comes with two separate cameras, including a 20-megapixel, 24mm f/2.8-f/11 primary camera with a Four Thirds sensor, along with a 12-megapixel, 1/2-inch sensor secondary camera with a 160mm-equivalent telephoto lens.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A Four Thirds sensor would be a huge boon for aerial shooters, allowing for extra detail and a more cinematic look in general.

</div>
</div>
<p>It will also offer direct USB-C charging so you don&#8217;t need to remove the battery. All of that will boost the weight a bit, up from 907g on the Mavic 2 Pro to 920g for the Mavic 3 Pro. Despite that bump from the extra camera and other new features, the Mavic 3 will be able to fly for 46 minutes, way up from the 31 minutes available on the Mavic 2.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 will apparently come in two flavors, a Pro and a Cine model, with the latter offering a built-in SSD and a &#8220;1Gbps Lightspeed Data Cable&#8221; option for faster transfers. It will also offer a new version of DJI&#8217;s display-equipped Smart Controller allowing for video transmission over 15km, up from 10km on the Mavic 2 Pro.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 Pro will cost $1,600, both sources say, which is the same price as the current Mavic 2 Pro. Prices for the Cine model are less clear, but could run around $1,000 more — still a relative deal for such a high tech camera drone. Both are expected to arrive on November 15th.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">boom in venture capital fundraising</a> that the technology startup market has enjoyed since the back half of 2020 has been eye-popping. Record sums have been disbursed around the world as more firms entered the fray to invest in startups, and the late-stage capital flowed like water.</p>
<p>But while the venture capital game seemed to turbocharge in recent quarters, there’s noise coming from the other side of the spectrum: bootstrapping.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Mailchimp’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">$12 billion exit to Intuit</a>, announced mere weeks ago, helped set a high-water mark for bootstrapping, proving that it is possible to build large, valuable technology companies both without huge venture capital investment and in locations outside traditional startup hubs. Mailchimp, based in Atlanta, is just one of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/atlantas-sundry-startups-join-in-global-vc-funding-boom/">host of startup companies building in the city</a>, The Exchange recently reported.</p>
<p>Today’s startups have more fundraising options than ever, providing a number of pathways to scale. These include services like Pipe, which allows startups to sell future revenues in a competitive marketplace, and the myriad venture-debt players that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/as-venture-capital-rebounds-whats-going-on-with-venture-debt/">TechCrunch has covered extensively</a>.</p>
<p>For startups busy funding their growth with revenue, there’s even more good news. Earlier this year, Calendly, another Atlanta-based company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">raised its first material external capital</a> &#8212; at a valuation of just over $3 billion, showing that bootstrapping early doesn’t mean that equity capital sources are closed forever. A number of other companies have followed suit in recent months.</p>
<p>We’re curious if a changing capital landscape, and a startup market made more viable for bootstrapping thanks to business concepts like product-led growth, will shake up the demographics of startup founders, perhaps making their ranks a bit more diverse. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping today</h2>
<p>Go back in time to the dot-com boom, and it was normal for startups to spend early capital on physical hardware. Servers weren’t something you could just call up Amazon and rent by the minute, which meant buying your own and paying co-location fees. That took capital.</p>
<p>And, as has been discussed ad nauseam, it was harder to build digital companies a few decades back. There weren’t infinite APIs for companies to hook into to solve complex technical issues, and there were both fewer folks trained to build new tools and fewer potential customers.</p>
<p>In today’s startup market, much technical risk has been settled, often lowering building costs for startups at the same time. The well-worn riff that it’s easier than ever to start a company today could be wed to the concept that it’s perhaps cheaper, too. That should bode well for bootstrapping.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has warned it may take action over Russia&#8217;s involvement in &#8220;malicious cyber activities&#8221; against several EU member states.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Ghostwriter&#8221; campaign targeted “numerous members of Parliaments, government officials, politicians, and members of the press and civil society in the EU”, according to <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/09/24/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-respect-for-the-eu-s-democratic-processes/">a press release from the European Council</a> on Friday, and was carried out &#8220;by accessing computer systems and personal accounts and stealing data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement by the European executive, comprised of the bloc&#8217;s heads of state, said the EU was considering &#8220;taking further steps,&#8221; but did not elaborate what actions it would take.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s declaration is about strongly denouncing malicious cyber activities, designated as Ghostwriter that some member states have observed and associated with the Russian state,&#8221; Nabila Massrali, a spokesperson for the European Council, told TechCrunch. &#8220;These activities are unacceptable and all involved must put them to an end immediately. Such activities seek to threaten our integrity and security, democratic values and principles and attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and processes. We urge the Russian Federation to adhere to the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.&#8221;</p>
<p>No specific incidents were mentioned in the press release. But the spokesperson added that the warning comes in light of the upcoming German elections on September 26.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Germany said the Russia-linked Ghostwriter campaign had been “combining conventional cyberattacks with disinformation and influence operations” in an attempt to spread disinformation before the upcoming election. At the time, the German government said it had &#8220;reliable information&#8221; that recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a> — which involved hackers use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> emails in an attempt to get hold of personal login details of federal and state lawmakers — could be attributed to actors in Russia, &#8220;specifically to the Russian military intelligence service GRU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ghostwriter has been ongoing since 2017, according to a 2020 report by FireEye, and has been involved in anti-NATO disinformation campaigns, cyber espionage and politically damaging hack-and-leak operations throughout Europe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a follow-up report released in April this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fireeye/">FireEye</a> linked the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151, a threat actor that is believed to be backed by the Kremlin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Since, Prevailion, a cybersecurity startup that specializes in compromise breach monitoring and cyber adversary intelligence, found that the infrastructure associated with UNC1151 is three-times larger than was was previously documented, and its malicious cyber activities are broader and more aggressive than was originally suspected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Karim Hijazi, chief executive of Prevailion, said earlier this month that UNC1151 is &#8220;positioned for a much wider operation, both in Europe and potentially beyond.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As developers unlock new AI tools, the risk for perpetuating harmful biases becomes increasingly high — especially on the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/ai-is-struggling-to-adjust-to-2020/">year like 2020</a>, which reimagined many of our social and cultural norms upon which AI algorithms have long been trained.</p>
<p>A handful of foundational models are emerging that rely upon a magnitude of training data that makes them inherently powerful, but it’s not without risk of harmful biases — and we need to collectively acknowledge that fact.</p>
<p>Recognition in itself is easy. Understanding is much harder, as is mitigation against future risks. Which is to say that we must first take steps to ensure that we understand the roots of these biases in an effort to better understand the risks involved with developing AI models.</p>
<h2>The sneaky origins of bias</h2>
<p>Today’s AI models are often pre-trained and open source, which allows researchers and companies alike to implement AI quickly and tailor it to their specific needs.</p>
<p>While this approach makes AI more commercially available, there’s a real downside — namely, that a handful of models now underpin the majority of AI applications across industries and continents. These systems are burdened by undetected or unknown biases, meaning developers who adapt them for their applications are working from a fragile foundation.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> by Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models, any biases within these foundational models or the data upon which they’re built are inherited by those using them, creating potential for amplification.</p>
<p>For example, YFCC100M is a publicly available data set from Flickr that is commonly used to train models. When you examine the images of people within this data set, you’ll see that the distribution of images around the world is <a href="http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/browse?q=person&amp;adj=&amp;m=b">heavily skewed toward the U.S.</a>, meaning there’s a lack of representation of people from other regions and cultures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These types of skews in training data result in AI models that have under- or overrepresentation biases in their output — i.e., an output that is more dominant for white or Western cultures. When multiple data sets are combined to create large sets of training data, there is a lack of transparency, and it can become increasingly difficult to know if you have a balanced mix of people, regions and cultures. It’s no surprise that the resulting AI models are published with egregious biases contained therein.</p>
<p>Further, when foundational AI models are published, there is typically little to no information provided around their limitations. Uncovering potential issues is left to the end user to test — a step that is often overlooked. Without transparency and a complete understanding of a particular data set, it’s challenging to detect the limitations of an AI model, such as lower performance for women, children or developing nations.</p>
<p>At Getty Images, we evaluate whether bias is present in our computer vision models with a series of tests that include images of real, lived experiences, including people with varying levels of abilities, gender fluidity and health conditions. While we can’t catch all biases, we recognize the importance of visualizing an inclusive world and feel it’s important to understand the ones that may exist and confront them when we can.</p>
<h2>Leveraging metadata to mitigate biases</h2>
<p>So, how do we do this? When working with AI at Getty Images, we start by reviewing the breakdown of people across a training data set, including age, gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re able to do this because we require a model release for the creative content that we license. This allows us to include self-identified information in our metadata (i.e., a set of data that describes other data), which enables our AI team to automatically search across millions of images and quickly identify skews in the data. Open source data sets are often limited by a lack of metadata, a problem that is exacerbated when combining data sets from multiple sources to create a larger pool.</p>
<p>But let’s be realistic: Not all AI teams have access to expansive metadata, and ours isn’t perfect either. An inherent tradeoff exists &#8212; larger training data that leads to more powerful models at the expense of understanding skews and biases in that data.</p>
<p>As an AI industry, it’s crucial that we find a way to overcome this tradeoff given that industries and people globally depend upon it. The key is increasing our focus on data-centric AI models, <a href="https://eval.how/dcai2021/index.html">a movement beginning to take stronger hold</a>.</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Confronting biases in AI is no small feat and will take collaboration across the tech industry in the coming years. However, there are precautionary steps that practitioners can take now to make small but notable changes.</p>
<p>For example, when foundational models are published, we could release the corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf">data sheet</a> describing the underlying training data, providing descriptive statistics of what is in the data set. Doing so would provide subsequent users with a sense of a model’s strengths and limitations, empowering them to make informed decisions. The impact could be huge.</p>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf">study</a> on foundational models poses the question, “What is the right set of statistics over the data to provide adequate documentation, without being too costly or difficult to obtain?” For visual data specifically, researchers would ideally provide the distributions of age, gender, race, religion, region, abilities, sexual orientation, health conditions and more. But, this metadata is costly and difficult to obtain on large data sets from multiple sources.</p>
<p>A complementary approach would be for AI developers to have access to a running list of known biases and common limitations for foundational models. This could include developing a database of easily accessible tests for biases that AI researchers could regularly contribute to, especially given how people use these models.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter recently facilitated a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-bug-bounties-help-find-biased-algorithms-this-competition-put-the-idea-to-the-test/">competition</a> that challenged AI experts to expose biases in their algorithms (Remember when I said that recognition and awareness are key toward mitigation?). We need more of this, everywhere. Practicing crowdsourcing like this on a regular basis could help reduce the burden on individual practitioners.</p>
<p>We don’t have all of the answers yet, but as an industry, we need to take a hard look at the data we are using as the solution to more powerful models. Doing so comes at a cost –- amplifying biases — and we need to accept the role we play within the solution. We need to look for ways to more deeply understand the training data we are using, especially when AI systems are used to represent or interact with real people.</p>
<p>This shift in thinking will help companies of all types and sizes quickly spot skews and counteract them in the development stage, dampening the biases.</p>

But there is a question [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. published its first-ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">national AI strategy</a> this week. The decade-long commitment by the government to levelling up domestic artificial intelligence capabilities &#8212; by directing resource and attention toward skills, talent, compute power and data access &#8212; has been broadly welcomed by the country&#8217;s tech ecosystem, as you&#8217;d expect.</p>
<p>But there is a question mark over how serious government is about turning the U.K. into a &#8220;global AI superpower&#8221; given the lack of a funding announcement to accompany the publication.</p>
<p>A better hint is likely to come shortly, with the spending review tabled for October 27 &#8212; which will set out public spending plans for the next three years.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, TechCrunch spoke to Marc Warner, CEO of U.K. AI startup Faculty, who said government needs to show it&#8217;s serious about providing long-term support to develop the U.K.&#8217;s capabilities and global competitiveness with an appropriate level of funding &#8212; while welcoming the &#8220;genuine ambition&#8221; he believes the government is showing to support AI.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bXaPc09RiS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">UK announces a national strategy to &#8216;level up&#8217; AI</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK announces a national strategy to &#8216;level up&#8217; AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/embed/#?secret=bXaPc09RiS" data-secret="bXaPc09RiS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Warner&#8217;s startup, which closed a $42 million growth round of funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/flush-with-42m-hot-ai-startup-faculty-plans-to-hoover-up-more-phds-and-steer-clear-of-politics/">earlier this year</a>, has started its own internal education program to attract PhDs into the company and turn out future data scientists. While Warner himself is also a member of the U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ai-council">AI Council</a>, an expert advisory group that provides advice to government and which was consulted on the strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a really pretty good strategy,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a genuine ambition in it which is relatively rare for government and they recognize some of the most important things that we need to fix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The problem &#8212; and it&#8217;s a huge problem &#8212; is that there are currently no numbers attached to this.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while in principle there&#8217;s lots of great stuff in there, in practice it&#8217;s totally critical that it&#8217;s actually backed by the funding that it needs &#8212; and has the commitment of the wider gov to the high-quality execution that doing some of these things are going to require.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner warned of the risk of the promising potential of a &#8220;pretty serious strategy&#8221; fading away if it&#8217;s not matched with an appropriate &#8212; dare we say it, &#8220;world beating&#8221; &#8212; level of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question for the spending review but it seems to me very easy now that having done &#8212; what looks like a really pretty serious strategy &#8212; then&#8230; it fades into a much more generic strategy off the back of not really willing to make the funding commitments, not really willing to push through on the execution side and actually make these things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked what level of funding he&#8217;d like to see government putting behind the strategy to deliver on its long-term ambitions, Warner said the U.K. needs to aim high &#8212; and do so on a global stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can look around the world and look at the commitments that other countries are making to their AI strategies which are in the hundred of millions to low billions,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;And if we are serious about being globally competitive &#8212; which the strategy is, and I think we should be &#8212; then we&#8217;re talking at least matching the funding of other countries, if not exceeding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately it comes down to where does this rank in their priority list and if they want to deliver on an ambitious strategy it&#8217;s got to be high,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Access to talent</h2>
<p>Discussing the broad detail of what the strategy says is needed for the U.K. to up its AI game, Warner highlighted talent as a key component.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a technical field like AI talent is a huge deal. There&#8217;s a global competition for that talent. And it seems like the government is taking that seriously and hopefully going to take actions to make sure the U.K. has all the talent it needs for this kind of stuff &#8212; from a skills perspective and training up people but also from a visa perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From our perspective it&#8217;s just wonderful to be able to access some of the most talented people from across the world to come and work on important problems and so the easier that it can be made for those people &#8212; or for organizations, whether it&#8217;s universities or charities or companies like us or even government departments to start to be able to hire those people it&#8217;s just a massive step forward,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice that they&#8217;re taking computing and data seriously,&#8221; he went on, discussing other elements of the strategy. &#8220;Obviously those are the two fuels for the set of techniques of machine learning that are sort of the foundation of modern AI. And having the government think about how we can make that more accessible is clearly a great thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the fact that they&#8217;re thinking about the long-term risks of AI is novel and basically important,&#8221; he also said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think they&#8217;re relatively honest that our adoption is weaker than we&#8217;d like, as a country, as a set of businesses. And hopefully recognizing that and thinking seriously about how we might go about fixing it &#8212; so, all in all, from a strategy perspective it&#8217;s actually very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strategy also talks about the need to establish “clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment” for AI. But the U.K. is already lagging on that front &#8212; with the European Union proposing an AI Regulation earlier this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=QAtzLkmb6h" data-secret="QAtzLkmb6h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Asked for his views on AI regulation Warner advocated for domain-specific rules.</p>
<h2>Domain specific AI rules</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it would be a big mistake to regulate at the level of just artificial intelligence. Because that&#8217;s sort of equivalent to regulating steel where you don&#8217;t know whether the steel is going to be used in girders or in a knife or a gun,&#8221; he suggested. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Either you pick the kind of legislation that we have around girders and it becomes incredibly lax around the people who are using the steel to make guns or you pick the kind of legislation that we have around guns and it becomes almost impossible to make the girders.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while it&#8217;s totally critical that we regulate AI effectively that is almost certainly done in a domain-specific fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave the example of AIs used in health contexts, such as for diagnosis, as a domain that would naturally require tighter regulation &#8212; whereas a use-case like e-commerce would likely not need such guardrails, he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the government recognizes this in the strategy,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It does talk about making sure the regulation is really thoughtfully attuned to the domain. And that just seems very sensible to me.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think it&#8217;s extremely important that AI is done well and safely and for the benefit of society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s proposed risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI does have a focus on certain domains and use cases &#8212; which are classified as higher or lower risk, with regulatory requirements varying accordingly. But <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Warner said he hasn&#8217;t yet studied the EU proposal in enough detail to have a view on their approach.  </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the Faculty CEO for his views on the U.K. government&#8217;s simultaneous push to &#8220;reform&#8221; the current data protection framework &#8212; which includes consulting on changes that could weaken protections for people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>Critics of the reform plan suggest it risks a race to the bottom on privacy standards.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My view would be that it&#8217;s absolutely critical that uses of AI are both legal and legitimate,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;As in, if people knew what was being done with their data they would be completely comfortable with what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Data legitimacy</h2>
<p>Faculty&#8217;s AI business was in existence (albeit under a different name) before the U.K.&#8217;s version of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was transposed into national law &#8212; although the prior regime was broadly similar. So existing rules don&#8217;t appear to have harmed its prospects as a high value and growing U.K. AI business.</p>
<p>Given that, might the government&#8217;s appetite to reduce the level of data protection that U.K. citizens enjoy &#8212; with the claim that doing so would somehow be &#8220;good for innovation&#8221; &#8212; actually be rather counterproductive for AI businesses which need the trust of users to flourish? (Plus, of course, if any U.K. AI businesses want to do business in the European Union they would need to comply with the GDPR.)</p>
<p>&#8220;GDPR is not perfect,&#8221; argued Warner. &#8220;If you speak to anyone I think that&#8217;s widely recognized &#8212; so I don&#8217;t think that the way it&#8217;s being framed as a choice between one or other, I think we can do better than both and I think that&#8217;s what we should aim for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are lots of ways that we can &#8212; over time &#8212; be better at regulating these things. So that we maintain the absolute best in class for legitimacy around the use of these technologies which is obviously totally critical for companies like us that want to do business in a way that&#8217;s widely accepted and even encouraged in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically I don&#8217;t think we should compromise but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a choice between just following GDPR or not. It&#8217;s more complicated than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting there have been a number of high-profile data scandals emanating from the U.K. in recent years.</p>
<p>And Faculty &#8212; in its pre-rebranding guise as <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/were-there-any-links-between-cambridge-analytica-russia-and-brexit-">ASI Data Science</a> &#8212; was intimately involved in controversial use of data for targeting ads at voters during the U.K.&#8217;s Brexit vote, for example.</p>
<p>Although it has since said it will never do political work again.</p>
<h2>Political campaigning</h2>
<p>ASI Data Science&#8217;s corporate rebranding followed revelations around the data-mining activities of the now defunct and disgraced data company, Cambridge Analytica &#8212; which broke into a global scandal in 2018, and led to parliamentarians around the world asking awkward questions about the role of data and predictive modelling to try to sway voters.</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s information commissioner even called for an &#8220;ethical pause&#8221; on the use of data and AI tools for political add targeting, warning that trust in democracy was being undermined by big data techniques opaquely targeting voters with custom political messaging.</p>
<p>During the Brexit referendum, Warner worked with the U.K. government&#8217;s former special advisor, Dominic Cummings, who was a director for the Vote Leave campaign. And Cummings has written extensively that data scientists played a crucial role in winning the Brexit vote &#8212; writing, for instance, in a <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/2016/10/29/on-the-referendum-20-the-campaign-physics-and-data-science-vote-leaves-voter-intention-collection-system-vics-now-available-for-all/">2016 blog post</a> on how data science and AI was used in the referendum, that:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of our central ideas was that the campaign had to do things in the field of data that have never been done before. This included a) integrating data from social media, online advertising, websites, apps, canvassing, direct mail, polls, online fundraising, activist feedback, and some new things we tried such as a new way to do polling&#8230; and b) having experts in physics and machine learning do proper data science in the way only they can – i.e. far beyond the normal skills applied in political campaigns. We were the first campaign in the UK to put almost all our money into digital communication then have it partly controlled by people whose normal work was subjects like quantum information (combined with political input from Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete, and digital specialists AIQ). We could only do this properly if we had proper canvassing software. We built it partly in-house and partly using an external engineer who we sat in our office for months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this infamous episode in his company&#8217;s history, we asked Warner if he would be supportive of AI rules that limit how the technology can be used for political campaigning?</p>
<p>The U.K. government has not made such a proposal but it is eyeing changing in election law &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/uk-eyeing-disclosure-labels-for-online-political-campaigning/">disclosure labels</a> for online political campaigning.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Faculty as an organization is not interested in politics anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;re thinking about,&#8221; was Warner&#8217;s response on this. </span></p>
<p>Pushed again on whether he would support limits on AI in the political campaigning domain, he added: &#8220;From Faculty&#8217;s perspective we don&#8217;t do politics anymore. I think it&#8217;s up to the government what they think it&#8217;s best around that area.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Noops is going after the $50 billion snack foods market and plans to take on yogurt next.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after securing <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noops-is-flippin-snacks-with-brand-launch-and-closes-on-a-2-million-pre-seed-investment-round-301095789.html">$2 million in pre-seed funding</a>, plant-based pudding startup <a href="https://eatnoops.com/">Noops</a> is announcing an additional $2 million round led by Lerer Hippeau.</p>
<p>The Long Island-based company was founded in 2019 by Hungryroot co-founder Gregory Harry Struck after he adopted a plant-based diet while battling cancer.</p>
<p>“It was born out of a need when a lot of things were eliminated for me,” Struck told TechCrunch. “During this period of change, I thought about consumption and how it affects our well-being and health system.”</p>
<p>Struck recalls a time in the grocery store looking in the dairy case for yogurt, catching a glimpse of pudding and wondering why this product had never been reimagined, nutrition-wise. He went home, turned his house into a commercial kitchen and began experimenting with recipes, sometimes using his three young children as taste-testers.</p>
<p>When Struck found a recipe that worked, he started handing the pudding out to friends and family and ultimately started Noops. The company’s first product is an oat milk-based line that is organic, free of dairy and gluten, contains prebiotics, plant protein and fiber, and has no added sugar. The pudding comes in traditional flavors like chocolate, caramel, mocha and vanilla.</p>

<p>Joining Lerer Hippeau in the investment are Siddhi Capital, Idea Farm Ventures, Simple Food Ventures, Animal Capital and American Pie executive Alan Mitzner. The latest round gives the company a total of $5 million raised to date, Struck said.</p>
<p>“This, for us, is very significant in terms of having a partner like Lerer Hippeau believe in us that we can be the next-generation,” he added. “And for us, we know exactly where we are going and can see the future and be a part of it.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment Larry Appel, former CEO of The Fresh Market, and Benjamin McKean, CEO of Hungryroot, will join the company’s advisory board.</p>
<p>Andrea Hippeau, partner at Lerer Hippeau, agreed, saying that it was Struck himself, and his background, that led to the firm’s belief that he could make an impact on the plant-based food category and build a strong company. The plant-based foods market was valued at $29.4 billion in 2020, <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/plant-based-market-skyrocket/">according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report</a>, and is poised to <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/plant-based-food-market-worth-74-billion-by-2027/">grow to $74 billion by 2027</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As investors in the space, Hippeau said the firm is looking at this category as “the next generation of consumables that will be hitting every category.” And, while the food type has reached a number of categories, like meat and seafood, there is not much in the space of pudding, nor have incumbents come out with better-for-you options, Hippeau said.</p>
<p>In fact, of the $348 billion in annual sales generated by the top 25 food and beverage incumbents in the U.S., some $50 billion of the sales can be attributable to snack brands, like Jell-O, which contain animal byproducts and have remained unchanged since launching in 1897, Struck said.</p>
<p>“Grocers are looking for the plant-based alternatives,” Hippeau said. “Noops is making a pudding with the same flavors people like and nutritional to take yogurt on head-on. Gregory and his team understood this and had those connections already established when they came to us.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will go to grow Noops’ distribution channels and network as it services retailers and direct-to-consumers, develop additional partnerships, make some key hires in finance and sales, bring on a second manufacturing partner as it aims to triple production and create more flavors and products, including a breakfast line that will develop a yogurt alternative.</p>
<p>Noops officially launched in Q1 of 2021 and is now available in more than 750 locations of retailers, including Sprouts Farmers Market and Wegmans Foods Markets. In addition, since its pre-launch in 2020, the company has doubled its projected numbers. It intends to launch in Fresh Thyme this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is working on a number of new devices including an Echo with a 15-inch wall-mounted display, a soundbar, new Echo Auto technology and wearables. Some may appear fairly soon at the company&#8217;s September 28th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fall-hardware-event-september-28-181440028.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">hardware event</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.</p>
<p>The splashiest-looking product would be an Alexa-enabled Echo with a display size around 15-inches. Codenamed Hoya, it could not only be placed on a stand like a regular Echo device, but mounted on a wall as well. It would serve as a smart-home center to control lights, cameras, locks and other devices, while showing weather, timers, appointments, photos and more. It&#8217;s specifically designed to work in the kitchen, displaying recipes and YouTube cooking videos, while letting you stream Netflix and other apps.</p>
<p>The company may also announce its own soundbar, codenamed Harmony, to accompany a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">rumored lineup</a> of Amazon-branded TVs. Unlike third-party Alexa-enabled soundbars, it would have a front-facing camera and support video calls from TVs, much like Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Portal TV</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s reportedly developing a new version of Echo Auto (codenamed Marion). The updated version will supposedly have a new design and allow for device charging via inductive technology. Amazon currently has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-alexa-built-in-120032156.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">partnership with Ford</a> to put Alexa in 700,000 vehicles, but it&#8217;s apparently looking to team up with other automakers, too.</p>
<p>Other items in the works include new Echo speakers for 2022 and wearables for kids and seniors (the latter with fall detection). It&#8217;s also reportedly building dedicated processors to improve artificial intelligence along with new technology to help its Fire TV, Echo and other devices work better together.</p>
<p>The company has some other, somewhat more unusual products in the works as well, according to the report. It has been working on a home robot codenamed Vesta that would use the Alexa interface and also an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone — though team working on that project was reportedly disbanded.</p>
