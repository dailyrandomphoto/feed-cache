</div><p id="speakable-summary">Customers have been &#8220;experiencing&#8221; business since the ancient Romans browsed the Forum for produce, pottery and leather goods. But digitization has radically recalibrated the buyer-seller dynamic, fueling the rise of one of the most talked-about industry acronyms: CX (customer experience).</p>
<p>Part paradigm, part category <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/customer-experience-management.asp">and part multibillion-dollar market</a>, CX is a broad term used across a myriad of contexts. But <em>great </em>CX boils down to delighting every customer on an emotional level, anytime and anywhere a business interaction takes place.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Great CX boils down to delighting every customer on an emotional level, anytime and anywhere a business interaction takes place.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Optimizing CX requires a sophisticated tool stack. Customer behavior should be tracked, their needs must be understood, and opportunities to engage proactively must be identified. Wall Street, for one, is taking note: Qualtrics, the creator of &#8220;XM&#8221; (experience management) as a category, was spun-out from SAP and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/01/28/qualtrics-goes-public-two-years-after-8-billion-sap-acquisition/?sh=19339a3b1f27">IPO&#8217;d in January</a>, and Sprinklr, a social media listening solution that has expanded into a &#8220;Digital CXM&#8221; platform, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/customer-experience-startup-sprinklr-files-confidential-s-1-with-sec/">filed</a> to go public.</p>
<p>Thinking critically about customer experience is hardly a new concept, but a few factors are spurring an inflection point in investment by enterprises and VCs.</p>
<p>Firstly, brands are now expected to create a consistent, cohesive experience across multiple channels, both online and offline, with an ever-increasing focus on the former. Customer experience and the <em>digital </em>customer experience are rapidly becoming synonymous.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of customer data has also reached new heights. As a McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/prediction-the-future-of-cx">report</a> put it, &#8220;Today, companies can regularly, lawfully, and seamlessly collect smartphone and interaction data from across their customer, financial, and operations systems, yielding deep insights about their customers … These companies can better understand their interactions with customers and even preempt problems in customer journeys. Their customers are reaping benefits: Think quick compensation for a flight delay, or outreach from an insurance company when a patient is having trouble resolving a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moreover, the app economy continues to raise the bar on user experience, and end users have less patience than ever before. Each time Netflix displays just the right movie, Instagram recommends just the right shoes, or TikTok plays just the right dog video, people are being trained to demand just a bit more magic.</p>

We&#8217;re thrilled to have Venrock&#8217;s Camille Samuels join us as one of our esteemed Battlefield judges at our second <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">virtual Startup Battlefield.</a></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Samuels is a partner at Venrock, building out the team&#8217;s investments in the healthcare world, focusing specifically on plays in biotech, medical devices and consumer health. Some recent bets include Unity Biotechnology, Iris Medicine and Biolux. Samuels joined Venrock in 2014 after 12 years at healthcare-centric firm Versant Ventures. Before the start of her 20+ year career in venture, Samuels worked in business development at drug discovery company Tularik and had stints in corporate development at Genzyme and Millennium Predictive Medicine.</p>
<p>When we spoke with Samuels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/veteran-healthcare-vc-camille-samuels-explains-why-trying-to-cure-infectious-disease-is-a-lousy-business/">early last year</a> she talked about her interests in technology that could keep people healthier for longer. &#8220;In general, the big idea of improving health span is what really interests me. I want us to extend out the years that we can be healthy and happy versus on medication and decrepit,&#8221; she told us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s been a big year for Venrock, which recently closed its ninth fund with $450 million; the firm&#8217;s latest exits include last year’s IPOs of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/cloudflare-cofounder-michelle-zatlyn-on-the-companys-successful-ipo-and-whats-next/">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/10x-genomics-ipo-rockets-past-a-390m-raise">10x Genomics.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=venrockpost&amp;display=true">Disrupt 2021</a> runs September 21-23 and will be 100% virtual this year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polish computational chemistry outfit Molecule.one has raised $4.6M to expand its quest to bring theoretical drug molecules to reality. Its machine learning systems predict the best ways to synthesize potentially valuable molecules, a crucial part of creating new drugs and treatments.</p>
<p>Molecule.one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/molecule-one-uses-machine-learning-to-make-synthesizing-new-drugs-a-snap/">went on stage at Disrupt SF 2019&#8217;s Startup Battlefield</a>, where they explained the difficulty faced by the drug discovery industry, basically that they come up with lots of <em>theoretical</em> treatments but can&#8217;t actually make the molecules.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s system enters play when you have some exotic new compound you want to make in order to test it in real life, but don&#8217;t know how to make it. After all, these molecules are brand new to science — no one has created them before, so why should anyone know? Molecule.one creates a workflow starting with ordinary off-the-shelf chemicals and provides step by step instructions using known methods of how to go from A to B&#8230; and to C, D, and so on (it&#8217;s rarely simple).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company leverages machine learning and a large body of knowledge about chemical reactions to create these processes, though as CSO Stanisław Jastrzębski explained, they do it backwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Synthesis planning can be characterized as a game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In each move of this game, instead of moving a piece on a board, we break a chemical bond between a pair of atoms. The goal of the game is to break down a target molecule to molecules that can then be bought on the market and used to synthesize the target. We use algorithms similar to the ones used by DeepMind to master Go or chess to find the synthesis pathway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Co-founders Piotr Byrski and Paweł Włodarczyk-Pruszyński note that predicting organic reactions is no cakewalk, and that they have dedicated a great deal of resources towards making their system efficient and verifiable. The theoretical pathways they produce seem plausible but still need to be tested, something they do regularly internally so companies see that Molecule.one just selling good ideas but workable ones.</p>
<p>Since their debut at Disrupt, the company has acquired a number of customers with annual contracts, Byrski said, and rolled out lots of features on the platform. Włodarczyk-Pruszyński said that their efficiency has increased as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159579" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159579" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159579" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg" alt="Molecule.one founders Piotr Byrski and Paweł Włodarczyk-Pruszyński in a lab." width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Molecule-one-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2159579" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Molecule.one</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our system has matured and we have extended our platform to support planning synthesis for thousands of molecules per hour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This feature is incredibly useful when combined with AI systems for drug discovery that generate huge numbers of candidate drug molecules. All these improvements helped us gain trust in the industry and initiate collaborations with relevant parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly the problem becomes one of scaling as your customers start asking about pathways for hundreds of thousands of possible therapeutic molecules rather than a handful. For them, if they are to bear the manufacturing cost, it&#8217;s worth the outlay at the start to see if one of the compounds they&#8217;re looking at is considerably easier to make than another with a similar effect. Without simulating the entire process that&#8217;s difficult to say for sure, so they can just send the list to Molecule.one and get the report back a few days later.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159578" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159578" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png" alt="Screenshot of the Molecule.one interface, showing chemical structures." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/example-plans.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2159578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Molecule.one</p></div></p>
<p>The team can&#8217;t share any of their customers&#8217; successes (though presumably there have been some) because of course all this work is highly confidential. But they did say that like many companies in biotech they are doing what they can to support COVID-related therapies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We <a href="https://molecule.one/covid19">made part of our platform free</a> to eligible researchers working on COVID drug discovery. This has resulted in a lasting collaboration with the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/exascale-search-of-molecules/">LambdaZero project at MILA</a>, which is advised by Prof. Yoshua Bengio,&#8221; said Byrski.</p>
<p>This also offered the opportunity to test their new scaling methods, since for such a project many candidate molecules must be evaluated, not just for efficacy but the capability of being manufactured easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are incredibly excited about this area in general because it enables traversing novel regions of the chemical space, which offers enormous promise in terms of looking for drugs that have not yet been synthesized,&#8221; Byrski said.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Atmos Ventures, with a long list of participating investors: AME Cloud Ventures, Cherubic Ventures, Firlej Kastory, Inventures, Luminous Ventures, Sunfish Partners, and individuals including Bayer executive Sebastian Guth.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the money to expand the team and continue expanding generally; it also has a plan to open new offices in the U.S. and Western Europe (they&#8217;re based in Poland).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous robotics company Starship Technologies has a new CEO. The company on Tuesday said Alastair Westgarth, the former CEO of Alphabet’s Loon, would be leading the company as it looks to expand its robotics delivery service.</p>
<p>Westgarth previously headed Loon, Alphabet’s experiment to deliver broadband via high-altitude balloons, from 2017. The project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">shut down for good at the beginning of this year</a>. The company said in a farewell blog post that “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.” Prior to working at Loon, Westgarth headed the wireless antennae company Quintel Solutions, was a vice president at telecommunications company Nortel and director of engineering at Bell Mobility.</p>

<p>He will be joining Starship Technologies at a time of rapid expansion. At the beginning of 2020, Starship only had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">a couple hundred autonomous bots</a> operating in a few neighborhoods and college campuses. Last month the company said the number of deliveries since the start of the pandemic quadrupled, hitting a milestone 1.5 million commercial deliveries globally.</p>
<p>“Autonomous delivery is changing logistics as we know it, impacting billions of people around the world,” Westgarth said in a statement Tuesday. “The team at Starship has been developing and perfecting the technology and its operations for years, since creating the robot delivery category in 2014 […] I’m excited about this opportunity and looking forward to helping the company scale both on campuses and in neighborhoods, giving millions more people access to this market-leading, convenient, safe and environmentally friendly delivery service.”</p>
<p>Starship&#8217;s previous CEO Lex Bayer quietly departed in December 2020, after nearly three years at the helm. Its co-founder Ahti Heinla, who acted as interim CEO, will now become Starship&#8217;s CTO.</p>

		Mario Ciabarra, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.quantummetric.com/">Quantum Metric</a>, is a computer scientist and tech entrepreneur helping organizations align the entire product lifecycle for many major global brands with a single version of customer-defined and quantified truth.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Debt is a tool, and like any other &#8212; be it a hammer or handsaw &#8212; it’s extremely valuable when used skillfully but can cause a lot of pain when mismanaged. Fortunately, this is a story about how it can go right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, my company, Quantum Metric, was on a tremendous growth curve. We couldn’t have been more excited &#8212; and then COVID hit. Suddenly, everything was up in the air. Customer behavior quickly began to reflect the uncertainty we all felt, and my team wasn’t immune to it, either. Like most, we sweated through the first few months of the pandemic.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			If companies want to preserve equity, debt can be an advantageous choice.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On the one hand, we felt it might be our time to shine, as digital solutions rose to the surface even in industries that were previously slow to adopt them (think banking and airlines). On the other, companies were trying to lock up as much cash as they could, as fast as they could. What if our customers weren’t able to pay us?</p>
<p>One thing became crystal clear: <em>We</em> needed cash, too. First and foremost, we needed it to protect the company against the income loss we anticipated from customers who were having an especially tough time &#8212; namely, those who relied on in-person business as a major revenue source.</p>
<p>Second, we needed cash in order to scale. As the weeks following the initial shelter-in-place orders ticked by, the rush toward digital grew exponentially, and opportunities to secure <em>new</em> customers started piling up. A solution to our money problems, perhaps? Not so fast &#8212; it was a classic case of needing to <em>spend </em>in order to <em>make</em>.</p>
<p>Most startups face this dilemma at some point. Some face it continuously. We needed a way to funnel capital into growth <em>and</em> manage to stay cash strong, which was important for another reason: As we headed downstream toward a Series B funding round, we were hesitant to devalue the company (and employee shares) any more than was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>“There are no solutions, there are only trade-offs,” Thomas Sowell wrote about politics. It’s no different in business. We knew that for Quantum Metric to succeed, we had to give up something in the future in order to get what we needed in the short term. Choosing a debt round as a younger company ran the risk of cash-flow misalignment down the road, but in the same vein, an equity round might have made subsequent funding rounds more challenging.</p>
<p>Whatever we did, we had to do fast, and we had to do it in a chaotic venture capital environment (that may be an understatement). In some meetings, it felt as if VC money had dried up completely. In others, record deals were being made. Startups were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/startups-looking-bypass-traditional-ipo-process-2020-7">bypassing</a> IPOs and going public via SPACs and direct listings. Factoring in the amount of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-technologies-emerge-from-periods-of-hype-and-boom-2020-7">hype</a> that was permeating the market (something I’ve never been a fan of), the “wise” decision felt elusive. As you know from the headline of this piece, though, we chose debt, and it paid off.</p>
<h2>The benefits of choosing debt over equity</h2>
<p>There ended up being two “layers” of benefits to our debt round. The benefits of the first layer correspond directly with the goals I mentioned above; we got the cash we needed in order to expand &#8212; which meant investing in our team, product, marketing and infrastructure &#8212; and avoided diluting the company’s value for existing shareholders in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ads are coming to Twitter&#8217;s version of Stories, known as <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-fleet">Fleets</a>. The company announced today it will began pilot testing Fleet ads in the U.S., which will bring full-screen, vertical format ads to Twitter for the first time, allowing it to better compete with the vertical ads offered across social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, among others.</p>
<p>The new Fleet ads will appear in between Fleets from people you follow and will support both images and video in 9:16 format. The video ads support up to 30-seconds of content, and brands can also include a &#8220;swipe up&#8221; call-to-action within their ads.</p>
<p>For video, this is shorter than what Instagram <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/877053729032543?id=1997185213680277">offers</a> (up to 120 seconds) or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/apps/tiktok">TikTok</a> (up to 60 seconds), but is in line with best <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/tiktok-video-ad-specs/">practices</a> which <a href="https://www.thebridgecorp.com/tiktok-ad-formats-benefits/">stress</a> that shorter ads can be better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t say how often you&#8217;ll see a Fleet ad as you swipe, saying only that it will &#8220;innovate, test and continue to adapt&#8221; in this area, as it learns how people engage.</p>
<p>Advertisers, meanwhile, will receive standard Twitter ad metrics for their Fleet ads, including impressions, profile visits, clicks, website visits, and more. And for video ads, Twitter will report video views, 6s video views, starts, completes, quartile reporting and other metrics.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159503" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159503" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2159503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wendys-Fleet-Ad-Image.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159503" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The company is launching the pilot program in the U.S. with just 10 advertisers, including those in tech, retail, dining and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpg.asp">CPG</a> verticals.</p>
<p>Twitter says the pilot will help the company to understand how well these types of ads perform on Twitter, which will inform the company not only how to better optimize Fleet ads going forward, but also other areas where it may launch full-screen ads further down the road. In addition, it wants to learn how people feel about and engage with full-screen ads, as the test continues.</p>
<p>Twitter had first begun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/twitter-starts-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-fleets-which-disappear-after-24-hours/">experimenting with Fleets in spring 2020</a> as a way to offer a Stories-like product experience where users could post ephemeral content. At the time, the company hoped Fleets would encourage more hesitant users to share content to the platform, as Fleets <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/fleets">disappeared after 24 hours</a>, reducing the pressure to perform that comes with posting directly. They also don&#8217;t circulate Twitter like retweets and quote tweets do, nor do they show up in Search or Moments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159504" style="width: 366px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159504" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2159504" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FleetAd-Blog-WendysAd.gif?w=356" alt="" width="356" height="652" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159504" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">rolled out to global users</a> in November 2020. They were initially <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-companies-look-same-tiktok-stories-snapchat-spotlight-2dd1da51-cf45-4f6b-a0ab-0db79f6b7793.html">criticized</a> by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/social-media-giants-look-the-same-tiktok-twitter-instagram/">some</a> who felt that Fleets were yet another example of how all social apps were starting to look the same. Nevertheless, Fleets have now become a core part of the Twitter experience.</p>
<p>Today, people use Fleets to point to other tweets they&#8217;ve posted, or to share personal updates, photos, and commentary. However, unlike Stories on other platforms, like Snapchat or Instagram, Fleets still offer a fairly bare bones experience in terms of creator tools. You can change the background color, add stickers and text, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to say how many or what percentage of Twitter&#8217;s active user base has now adopted Fleets, noting instead that 73% of those who post Fleets say they also browse what others are sharing. The company says it plans to roll out new updates and features to Fleets in the future, as it continues to invest in the product.</p>
<p>Fleet ads will launch today in the U.S. across both iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Convenience stores are ubiquitous – and they sell the vast majority of gas purchased by consumers in the United States. But as more Americans transition to electric vehicles, a major reason people visit convenience stores will disappear.</p>
<p>Industry giant 7-Eleven is looking to capture this growing market of EV drivers. The company said Tuesday it will install 500 direct-current fast charging ports at 250 locations across North America by the end of 2022. These charging stations will be owned and operated by 7-Eleven, as opposed to fuel at its filling stations, which must be purchased from suppliers.</p>
<p>Many charging stations from some of the country’s largest providers, like EVgo, ChargePoint or Tesla’s Supercharger network, are located in a patchwork of parking lots adjacent to shopping malls or retailers like Target. But a major draw of convenience stores like 7-Eleven is that they’re already located in areas adjacent to highways or major roads – so they may have a leg up in attracting drivers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>7-Eleven may have another advantage in choosing to install DC fast chargers as opposed to slower level 2 chargers: The majority of convenience retailers are designed for quick, in-and-out service – around the time it takes to fill a tank of gas. Many don’t offer temperature-controlled places to sit, so a longer charging time would likely pose a problem for drivers. While older EV models are limited by the amount of kilowatt charges they can accept (so the output rate of the charger is inconsequential to how long it takes to charge the battery), newer vehicles can accept a wider range of charging rates.</p>
<p>As charging infrastructure – or lack thereof – remains one of the largest barriers to EV adoption, planned build-outs from mainstream retailers like the one announced by 7-Eleven could help reduce some consumer hesitancy over EVs.</p>
<p>The 500 charging stations will join 7-Eleven’s existing network of 22 charging stations, which are located in 14 stores across four states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week, another unicorn IPO. This time, Sprinklr is taking on the public markets.</p>
<p>The New York-based software company works in what it describes as the customer experience market. After attracting <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sprinklr/company_financials">over $400 million in capital while private</a>, its impending debut will not only provide key returns to a host of venture capitalists but also more evidence that New York&#8217;s startup scene has reached maturity.

<p>Sprinklr last raised a $200 million round at a $2.7 billion valuation in September 2020. That round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/sprinklr-raises-200m-on-2-7b-valuation-three-years-after-last-investment/">as TechCrunch reported</a>, also included a host of secondary shares and $150 million in convertible notes. Inclusive of the latter instrument, Sprinklr&#8217;s total capital raised to date soars above the $500 million mark.</p>

<p>Sure, Robinhood didn&#8217;t file last week as many folks hoped, but the Sprinklr IPO ensures that we&#8217;ll have more than just SPACs to chat about in the coming days. But one thing at a time. Let&#8217;s discuss what Sprinklr does for a living.</p>
<h2>Sprinklr&#8217;s business</h2>
<p>Sprinklr&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1569345/000119312521177215/d58050ds1.htm">IPO filing</a> and corporate website suffer from a slight case of <em>corporate speak</em>, so we have some work to do this morning to determine what the company does. Here&#8217;s what the company says about itself in its filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sprinklr empowers the world’s largest and most loved brands to make their customers happier.</p>
<p>We do this with a new category of enterprise software — Unified Customer Experience Management, or Unified-CXM — that enables every customer-facing function across the front office, from Customer Care to Marketing, to collaborate across internal silos, communicate across digital channels, and leverage a complete suite of modern capabilities to deliver better, more human customer experiences at scale — all on one unified, AI-powered platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not very clear, yeah? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve got you. Here&#8217;s what the company actually does:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The grassroots Democratic organization <a href="https://indivisible.org/">Indivisible</a> is launching its own team of stealth fact-checkers to push back against misinformation — an experiment in what it might look like to train up a political messaging infantry and send them out into the information trenches.</p>
<p>Called the “Truth Brigade,” the corps of volunteers will learn best practices for countering popular misleading narratives on the right. They’ll coordinate with the organization on a biweekly basis to unleash a wave of progressive messaging that aims to drown out political misinformation and boost Biden&#8217;s legislative agenda in the process.</p>
<p>Considering the scope of the misinformation that remains even after social media’s big January 6 cleanup, the project will certainly have its work cut out for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This is an effort to empower volunteers to step into a gap that is being created by very irresponsible behavior by the social media platforms,” Indivisible co-founder and co-executive director Leah Greenberg told TechCrunch. “It is absolutely frustrating that we’re in this position of trying to combat something that they ultimately have a responsibility to address.”</p>
<p>Greenberg <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/indivisible-an-early-anti-trump-group-plans-for-a-democratic-future">co-founded Indivisible with her husband</a> following the 2016 election. The organization grew out of the viral success the pair had when they and two other former House staffers published a handbook to Congressional activism. The guide took off in the flurry of “resist”-era activism on the left calling on Americans to push back on Trump and his agenda.</p>
<p>Indivisible’s Truth Brigade project blossomed out of a pilot program in Colorado spearheaded by Jody Rein, a senior organizer concerned about what she was seeing in her state. Since that pilot began last fall, the program has grown into 2,500 volunteers across 45 states.</p>
<p>The messaging will largely center around Biden&#8217;s ambitious legislative packages: the American Rescue plan, the voting rights bill HR1 and the forthcoming infrastructure package. Rather than debunking political misinformation about those bills directly, the volunteer team will push back with personalized messages promoting the legislation and dispelling false claims within their existing social spheres on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>The coordinated networks at Indivisible will cross-promote those pieces of semi-organic content using tactics parallel to what a lot of disinformation campaigns do to send their own content soaring (in the case of groups that make overt efforts to conceal their origins, Facebook calls this &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/inauthentic_behavior">coordinated inauthentic behavior</a>.&#8221;) Since the posts are part of a volunteer push and not targeted advertising, they won’t be labeled, though some might contain hashtags that connect them back to the Truth Brigade campaign.</p>
<p>Volunteers are trained to serve up progressive narratives <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2020/how-to-serve-up-a-tasty-truth-sandwich/">in a “truth sandwich”</a> that’s careful to not amplify the misinformation it’s meant to push back against. For Indivisible, training volunteers to avoid giving political misinformation even more oxygen is a big part of the effort.</p>
<p>“What we know is that actually spreads disinformation and does the work of some of these bad actors for them,” Greenberg said. “We are trying to get folks to respond not by engaging in that fight — that’s really doing their work for them — but by trying to advance the kind of narrative that we actually want people to buy into.”</p>

<p>She cites the social media outrage cycle perpetuated by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a harbinger of what Democrats will again be up against in 2022. Taylor Greene is best known for endorsing QAnon, getting yanked off of her Congressional committee assignments and comparing mask requirements to the Holocaust — comments that inspired some Republicans to call for her ouster from the party.</p>
<p>Political figures like Greene regularly rile up the left with outlandish claims and easily debunked conspiracies. Greenberg believes that political figures like Greene who regularly rile up the online left suck up a lot of energy that could be better spent resisting the urge to rage-retweet and spreading progressive political messages.</p>

<p>“It’s not enough to just fact check [and] it’s not enough to just respond, because then fundamentally we’re operating from a defensive place,” Greenberg said.</p>
<p>“We want to be proactively spreading positive messages that people can really believe in and grab onto and that will inoculate them from some of this.”</p>
<p>For Indivisible, the project is a long-term experiment that could pave the way for a new kind of online grassroots political campaign beyond targeted advertising — one that hopes to boost the signal in a sea of noise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve experienced parenthood, you&#8217;re well versed in the surprisingly small world of disposable diapers. Help may be on the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://mykudos.com/">Kudos</a>, a startup that is looking to reinvent the disposable diaper with sustainability in mind, announced the close of a $2.4 million seed round of financing today. Investors include Foundation Capital, XFund, PJC, Precursor Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, SV Angel, Underscore VC, Alpha Bridge Ventures, April Underwood and more.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Amrita Saigal says that Kudos is the first and only disposable baby diaper to earn the cotton natural seal from Cotton Inc. for having 100% cotton touching the baby&#8217;s skin instead of plastic. They&#8217;re also made with four times more plant-based materials than the top disposable diaper out there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Disposable diapers are made up of many layers. Your average disposable diaper from brands like Huggies, Pampers, etc. employ petrochemicals, fabrics like polyester and a whole lot of plastic. In fact, despite how soft it feels, most disposable diapers&#8217; top sheet (the part that touches your baby&#8217;s skin) are made of plastic.</p>
<p>Kudos uses organic cotton in place of that, and focuses on using green materials, with the absorbent core of the diaper made of wood fluff pulp that is totally chlorine free and harvested through the Forest Stewardship Council.</p>
<p>All that said, Saigal explained that performance is just as important as the composition of the diaper, saying that most parents feel that going to a more eco-friendly product sometimes means trading on performance. She explained how parents often have a much higher standard for products for their babies than they do for their own products.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m thinking about feminine care products, I might go to an eco-friendly product and it&#8217;ll be a pain if it has a little bit less performance but I can handle that for myself,&#8221; said Saigal. &#8220;But with parents, if their kid gets a rash it affects their life and their sleep. When it comes to diapers, parents aren&#8217;t willing to give that same leeway for a sustainable product.&#8221;</p>
<div>You might be wondering, as I did, about the defensibility of a product like this. What&#8217;s to stop the big players from developing a more sustainable, cotton-based diaper.</div>
<div>
<p>According to Saigal, the big brands would need to overhaul their entire manufacturing process to switch from plastic to cotton. Saigal actually left a career at P&amp;G, which is where she met Kudos&#8217; diaper engineering advisor Jim Keighley (her former boss at P&amp;G).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what he had to say about it, in a prepared statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span id="m_-3833566847854983758m_7994276844460498005gmail-docs-internal-guid-db218aeb-7fff-b5fd-8049-6076f2a8a98b">Big brands would need to do a complete overhaul of their bonding equipment, since the pressure technology they and everyone else uses for bonding only works with plastic-based materials. It just won&#8217;t work with natural materials. That would take a big investment of time and money, while detracting from their flexibility to run current products, which are market leaders.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Kudos operates on a D2C subscription model, offering a monthly box based on your baby&#8217;s changing size and weight, for $78/month. Folks can also purchase a box (with a three- to five-day supply) à la carte for $14.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted a lot in the world, and supply chains are no exception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of applications that aim to solve workflow challenges across the supply chain exist. But getting real-time access to information from transportation providers has remained somewhat elusive for shippers and logistics companies alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="http://project44.com">project44</a>. The seven-year-old Chicago-based company has built an API-based platform that it says acts as “the connective tissue” between transportation providers, third-party logistics companies, shippers and their supply chain systems. Using predictive analytics, the platform provides crucial real-time information such as estimated time of arrivals (ETAs).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Supply chains have undergone an incredible amount of change &#8212; there has never been a greater need for agility, resiliency and the ability to rapidly respond to changes across the supply chain,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Duboe, the company’s chief growth officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, project44 announced it has raised $202 million in a Series E funding round led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Emergence Capital. Girteka and Lineage Logistics also participated in the financing, which gives project44 a post-money valuation of $1.2 billion. That doubles the company’s valuation at the time of its Insight Partners-led $100 million Series D in December, and brings its total raised since inception to $442.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise is quite possibly the largest investment in the supply chain visibility space to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project44 is one of those refreshingly transparent private companies that gives insight into its financials. This month, the company says it crossed $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), which is up 100% year over year. It has more than 600 customers, including some of the world’s largest brands such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, Walmart, Nestlé, Starbucks, Unilever, Lenovo and P&amp;G. Customers hail from a variety of industries, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPG, retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, pharma and chemical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last year, the pandemic created a number of supply chain disruptions, underscoring the importance of technologies that help provide visibility into supply chain operations. Project44 said it worked hard to help customers mitigate “relentless volatility, bottlenecks, and logistics breakdowns,” including during the Suez Canal incident where a cargo ship </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/world/middleeast/suez-canal-ship.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">got stuck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, project44 plans to use its new capital in part to continue its global expansion. Project44 recently announced its </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210430005100/en/project44-Expands-Network-Coverage-in-China-for-Real-Time-Transportation-Visibility"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion into China</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has plans to grow in the Asia-Pacific, Australia/New Zealand and Latin American markets, according to Duboe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also going to continue to invest heavily in our carrier products to enable more participation and engagement from the transportation community that desires a stronger digital experience to improve efficiency and experience for their customers,” he told TechCrunch. The company also aims to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) and data science capabilities and broaden sales and marketing reach globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, project44 announced its acquisition of ClearMetal, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a San Francisco-based supply chain planning software company that focuses on international freight visibility, predictive planning and overall customer experience. With the buy, Duboe said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project44 will now have two contracts with Amazon: road and ocean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Project44 will power what they are chasing,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in March, the company also </span><a href="https://www.project44.com/press-releases/project44-acquires-ocean-insights"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Ocean Insights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand its ocean offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Chen, a managing director of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, believes that project44 is unique in its scope of network coverage across geographies and modes of transport.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most competitors predominantly focus on over-the-road visibility and primarily serve one region, whereas project44 is a truly global business that provides end-to-end visibility across their customers’ entire supply chain,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs Asset Management, noted project44 CEO and founder Jett McCandless, will help the company grow not only by providing capital but through its network and resources.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Max Q is a weekly newsletter from TechCrunch all about space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here to receive it weekly on Mondays in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>This week actually includes two, since I was out last week for a Canadian national holiday (and back today for the U.S. one, ironically). There&#8217;s plenty to cover, including Blue Origin&#8217;s bidding process, lunar landers, spaceships launching at sea and the return of our very own space event.</p>
<h3>Blue Origin&#8217;s big bid</h3>
<p>Blue Origin is auctioning off one seat on its first-ever human spaceflight, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/blue-origin-reveals-highest-bid-for-a-seat-on-its-first-human-spaceflight-currently-at-2m/">bidding got started at $1.4 million</a> — or at least, the public bidding started there. Before last week, people had been submitting blind bids, but now Blue Origin is posting the top current bid to its website whenever it hits a new high. It&#8217;s currently set at $2.8 million, meaning it&#8217;s doubled since the bids opened up to public scrutiny, and presumably FOMO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blue Origin reveals highest bid for a seat on its first human spaceflight, currently at $2M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/blue-origin-reveals-highest-bid-for-a-seat-on-its-first-human-spaceflight-currently-at-2m/embed/#?secret=EZt6EpofqL" data-secret="EZt6EpofqL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Everything&#8217;s building up to June 12, when the auction will conclude with a live, real-time online competitive bidding round. Seems likely it&#8217;ll at least cross the $3 million mark before all&#8217;s said and done, which is good news for Blue Origin, since run-of-the-mill tickets for the few minutes in suborbital space going forward will probably end up more in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range.</p>
<p>The winning bidder will be flying on July 20, if all goes to the current plan, and will be accompanied by other passengers selected by Blue Origin through some other mechanism. We don&#8217;t yet know who else will be on the ride. Bezos maybe?</p>
<h3>SpaceX&#8217;s Deimos spaceport is under construction</h3>

<p>SpaceX is really flexing its sci-fi-made-real muscle with its latest move: The company is turning two offshore oil rig platforms into floating spaceports, and one of the two, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/spacexs-first-ocean-spaceport-is-being-built-and-will-host-launches-next-year/">codenamed &#8220;Deimos&#8221; after one of Mars&#8217; moons, is already being worked on</a>. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared that the company is hoping to have it ready for operations next year, meaning it could host actual launches in 2022.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8ZIYWK1wgN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/spacexs-first-ocean-spaceport-is-being-built-and-will-host-launches-next-year/">SpaceX&#8217;s first ocean spaceport is being built and will host launches next year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX&#8217;s first ocean spaceport is being built and will host launches next year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/spacexs-first-ocean-spaceport-is-being-built-and-will-host-launches-next-year/embed/#?secret=8ZIYWK1wgN" data-secret="8ZIYWK1wgN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Eventually, Deimos and its twin, Phobos, will provide launch and landing services to SpaceX&#8217;s first fully reusable launch vehicle — Starship. Starship only just managed to land successfully after a high, but still very much atmospheric, flight test, however, so it has a way to go before it&#8217;s making amphibious departures and arrivals using the converted oil platforms.</p>
<p>Putting these in the ocean presumably helps solve some key issues, not least of which is being mindful of the impact of launching absolutely massive rockets on land anywhere near people. Ditto the landings, which, at least early on, are bound to be risky affairs better carried out with a buffer of surrounding ocean.</p>
<h3>Landers; lunar ones</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1873066" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1873066" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1873066" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg" alt="Lander Rover" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg 3544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lander_Rover.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1873066" class="wp-caption-text">Concept graphic depicting ispace&#8217;s HAKUTO-R lander and rover. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> ispace</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s quite a bit of lunar lander news this week, including Japan&#8217;s ispace revealing that it&#8217;ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/japanese-space-company-ispace-aims-to-send-landers-to-the-moon/">provide commercial lunar lander service to both Canada and Japan</a>, with a ride for both provided by SpaceX and its Falcon 9 rocket. These will be two separate missions, with the first one set for next year, and the second one set to take place in 2023.</p>
<p>Both will use ispace&#8217;s Hakuto-R lander, which it originally developed to take part in the Google-backed Lunar XPRIZE competition. That ended without a winner, but some companies, including ispace, continued to work on their landers with an eye to commercialization. The Hakuto-R being sent on behalf of JAXA will carry an adorable ball-shaped moon robot which looks like a very novel take on a rover.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, GM announced this past week that it&#8217;s working with space industry veteran Lockheed Martin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/general-motors-lockheed-martin-to-develop-new-lunar-rover-for-nasa-artemis-missions-to-the-moon/">develop a next-gen moon rover that will provide future lunar astronauts with more speed and greater range</a>. GM and Lockheed will still have to win a NASA contract in order to actually make the thing, but they&#8217;re clearly excited about the prospect.</p>
<h3>TC Sessions: Space is back in December</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2159308" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC-Sessions-Space-2021.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it&#8217;s happening December 14 and 15, and it&#8217;s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join.</p>
<p>We had an amazing line-up of guests and speakers at last year&#8217;s event, including Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck, NASA&#8217;s Kathy Lueders and more, and we&#8217;re already working on a fantastic follow-up agenda that&#8217;s sure to thrill all kinds of space fans.</p>
<p>You can <a href="//techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">already get tickets, and if you get in early, you save $100</a>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity <del>Monday</del> Tuesday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>We are back from a long weekend here in America. But no break here in the States can stop the flow of global tech news. So, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weekend: </strong>Tata <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-tata-buys-majority-stake-online-grocer-bigbasket-2021-05-28/">bought BigBasket</a>, setting up a fascinating e-commerce war in India. China is cracking down on edtech companies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-30/china-wrecks-ipo-plans-for-high-flying-online-education-startups">leading to an IPO freeze</a>. And Wejo is going public via a SPAC. You can read its investor deck <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822888/000110465921074623/tm2117781d2_425seq1.htm">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>This Morning:</strong> The are a zillion funding rounds in Europe and globally this morning, the start of what could be a super busy week&#8217;s cycle. Private Equity is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">buying Cloudera</a>, which is a surprise. Nio had chip shortage issues that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/chinas-xpeng-motors-ev-deliveries-accelerate-and-nio-declines-in-may-.html">impacted its delivery cadence</a>. The Chinese EV company does expect to meet its Q2 delivery goal, however.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Rounds:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">Truebill raised $45 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">Chipper Cash raised $100 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/singapore-based-d2c-dental-brand-zenyum-raises-40m-series-b-from-l-catterton-sequoia-india-and-other-investors/">Zenyum raised $40 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">WeFox raised $650 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">Malt raised $97 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">Sennder raised $80 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/brazils-idwall-raises-38m-for-identity-validation-platform/">Idwall raised $38 million</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/belvo-latams-answer-to-plaid-raises-43m-series-a-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/">Belvo raised $43 million</a>. And that was not even close to all the big ones.</li>
<li><strong>Riff:</strong> Late last week we missed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1569345/000119312521177215/d58050ds1.htm">the Sprinklr filing</a>. You can read it here. Quite a number of VCs have money riding on the IPO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome back, America, to the week. It&#8217;s nice to see you, everyone else. Maybe Robinhood will file this week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 restrictions lifting and employees starting to make their way back into offices, hackers are being forced to change tack. While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote workers</a> have been scammers’ main target for the past 18 months due to the mass shift to home working necessitated by the pandemic, a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> campaign is attempting to exploit those who have started to return to the physical workplace.</p>
<p>The email-based campaign, <a href="https://cofense.com/blog/phishing-credentials-covid/">observed by Cofense</a>, is targeting employees with emails purporting to come from their CIO welcoming them back into offices.</p>
<p>The email looks legitimate enough, sporting the company’s official logo in the header, as well as being signed spoofing the CIO. The bulk of the message outlines the new precautions and changes to business operations the company is taking relative to the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If an employee were to be fooled by the email, they would be redirected to what appears to be a Microsoft SharePoint page hosting two company-branded documents. “When interacting with these documents, it becomes apparent that they are not authentic and instead are phishing mechanisms to garner account credentials,” explains Dylan Main, threat analyst at Cofense&#8217;s Phishing Defense Center.</p>
<p>However, if a victim decides to interact with either document, a login panel appears and prompts the recipient to provide login credentials to access the files.</p>
<p>“This is uncommon among most Microsoft phishing pages where the tactic of spoofing the Microsoft login screen opens an authenticator panel,” Main continued. “By giving the files the appearance of being real and not redirecting to another login page, the user may be more likely to supply their credentials in order to view the updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another technique the hackers are employing is the use of fake validated credentials. The first few times login information is entered into the panel, the result will be the error message that states: “Your account or password is incorrect.”</p>
<p>“After entering login information a few times, the employee will be redirected to an actual Microsoft page,” Main says. “This gives the appearance that the login information was correct, and the employee now has access to the OneDrive documents. In reality, the threat actor now has full access to the account owner’s information.”</p>
<p>While this is one of the first campaigns that’s been observed targeting employees returning to the workplace (Check Point researchers uncovered another <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/06/25/as-organizations-get-back-to-business-cyber-criminals-look-for-new-angles-to-exploit/">last year</a>), it’s unlikely to be the last. Both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/google-campuses-reopening-covid-19/">Google</a> and Microsoft, for example, have started welcoming staff back to office cubicles, and the majority of executives expect that at least 50% of employees will be back working in the office by July, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html">PwC study</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw threat actors follow the trends throughout the pandemic, and we expect they are likely to leverage themes of returning to work in their attacks in the coming months,&#8221; Tonia Dudley, a strategic advisor at Cofense, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can expect remote workers to continue to be targeted as well. While employers begin to bring staff back to the office, it’s likely we’ll see a hybrid model of work moving forward. Both groups will be targets for phishing attacks.”</p>
<p>Threat actors typically adapt to exploit the global environment. Just as the shift to mass working over remote connections led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/what-you-need-to-know-about-covid-19-related-cyberattacks/">an increase in the number of attacks attempting to exploit remote login credentials</a>, it&#8217;s likely the number of attacks targeting on-premise networks and office-based workers will continue to grow over the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The cybersecurity industry has no shortage of technology to fight against network intruders, app corrupters, email hackers and other cyber criminals. Today a startup called <a href="http://redacted.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redacted</a> is coming out of stealth with a different approach to tackling that malicious activity: It applies threat intelligence, and then proactively goes after the hackers to recover data loss and disrupt their activities. And along with its public launch, Redacted is announcing $35 million in funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Ten Eleven Ventures, with participation from Valor Equity Partners and SVB Capital. (Ten Eleven is a VC specializing in cybersecurity that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/cyware-nabs-30m-to-help-organizations-detect-and-stop-advanced-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed a number of other startups</a>.) It brings the total raised by Redacted &#8212; which it specifically styles &#8220;[redacted]&#8221;&#8230;with brackets &#8212; to $60 million, including a previous funding of $25 million.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always interesting when a startup comes out of nowhere with a substantial round of VC backing, but it&#8217;s almost always because that startup has some interesting pedigree &#8212; and that is the case here. The company is led by Max Kelly, who was previously the chief security officer at Facebook and before that held roles at the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command. His co-founder, John Hering, was the founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Lookout. The startup is populated with a bigger team that the startup likes to say has &#8220;more than 300 years of combined experience&#8221; in cyber defense, with experience at Facebook, Amazon, NASA JPL, Symantec, Cisco, FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, Army, Air Force, Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Cyber Command and the U.K.’s GCHQ.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cyware nabs $30M to help organizations detect and stop advanced cyberattacks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/cyware-nabs-30m-to-help-organizations-detect-and-stop-advanced-cyber-attacks/embed/#?secret=QOiyYwoQ6t" data-secret="QOiyYwoQ6t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I&#8217;d actually heard about the company before &#8212; it works with another cyber startup I&#8217;ve covered called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/cado-security-locks-in-10m-for-its-cloud-native-digital-forensics-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cado</a>, which provides cyber forensics tools to Redacted (among others). Redacted is not particularly forthcoming about its customers.</p>
<p>The core of what Redacted does comes out of direct experience that Kelly said he had while working at Facebook, where he both built in-house threat response tools but also worked with third-party vendors to secure the social networking giant&#8217;s systems, employees and users.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big focus of the industry in the last 10 years was preventing the breach,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;But that was always a lie. There is nothing you can do to prevent a breach. The point is not to prevent the breach but the damage from it. Make sure people can’t get data out, and if they do, make sure you can get it back.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cado Security locks in $10M for its cloud-native digital forensics platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/cado-security-locks-in-10m-for-its-cloud-native-digital-forensics-platform/embed/#?secret=kK0f8Udr25" data-secret="kK0f8Udr25" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There was also the issue of the size of Facebook itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn’t buy any security tools that worked because of the scale of the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we thought about it and decided that the best approach would be to ask who is doing this, get them to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an environment where cybercrime has taken on the profile of some of the most advanced innovations in technology, with both bad actors and security apps and services leaning on artificial intelligence and automation to do their work, it sounds almost too human an approach. But from how Kelly describes it, it sounds like there is a very human face to cybercrime, and the mere fact of identifying bad actors can get them to retreat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a highly technical operation: The startup has also built tools, with some of its own tech and leaning on tech built by others, to find patterns in the work that cybercriminals do and eventually track them to where they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they’re in a place where they can be touched by law enforcement, that can be used to get them to stop,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if not, then it’s just the awareness that they’d been seen and that generally causes them to retreat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mix of what Redacted has built to date, he says, is being aimed at smaller, mid-sized and slightly larger corporates, particularly those that are not capable of building tools like this themselves.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;There is no cybersecurity skills gap, but CISOs must think creatively&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/there-is-no-cybersecurity-skills-gap-but-cisos-must-think-creatively/embed/#?secret=D9MidGnLff" data-secret="D9MidGnLff" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The name, meanwhile, in my opinion says something about the nimble, but also very focused, approach the startup is taking. It comes from a period when the company hadn&#8217;t yet come up with a name for itself but was already operating commercially while in stealth mode (which actually is very standard among cybersecurity startups, I&#8217;ve found, which don&#8217;t really want a lot of attention, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>&#8220;We used it as a placeholder, but I realized, as I talked to people, that they were using the name &#8220;Redacted&#8221; when referring to us,&#8221; Kelly said. He looked up redacted.com and saw it was available. &#8220;It was the universe telling me to use the name,&#8221; he said with a little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the industry’s most advanced pursuit capabilities, Redacted has the power to teach attackers that companies will hold them accountable for attacks,&#8221; said Alex Doll, founder and managing general partner at Ten Eleven Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Redacted&#8217;s&nbsp;cloud-native security platform also enables them to protect and defend companies that run their operations within a modern cloud architecture. Together, these features enable [redacted] to offer the most holistic and proactive security solution for companies in today’s elevated threat environment.” Doll is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cloudera.com">Cloudera</a> was once one of the hottest Hadoop startups, but over time the shine has come off that market, and today it went private as KKR and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, a pair of private equity firms, announced they intended to purchase Cloudera for $5.3 billion. The company has a market cap of around $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>Cloudera and Hortonworks, two key startups in the Hadoop space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/cloudera-and-hortonworks-announce-5-2-billion-merger/">merged in 2018 for $5.2 billion.</a> Cloudera was likely under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who took <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/08/12/activist-investor-carl-icahn-shakes-cloudera/">an 18% stake in the company</a> in 2019 and now stands to gain from the sale, which the company stated represented a 24% premium for shareholders at $16 a share. Prior to the market opening this morning, the stock was sitting at $12.86.</p>
<p>Back in the day, about a decade ago, when Hadoop was <em>the way</em> to process big data, venture money was pouring into the space. Over time it lost some of its glow. That&#8217;s because it was highly labor intensive, and companies began moving to the cloud and looking at software services that did more of the work for them. More modern technologies like data lakes began replacing it and the company recognized that it must change its approach to survive in the modern data processing marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Cloudera CEO Rob Bearden sees the transaction as a way to do just that. &#8220;We believe that as a private company with the expertise and support of experienced investors such as CD&amp;R and KKR, Cloudera will have the resources and flexibility to drive product-led growth and expand our addressable market opportunity,&#8221; Bearden said in a statement.</p>
<p>While there is a lot of executive jargon in that statement, it basically means that the company hopes that these private equity firms can give it some additional financial resources to move toward a more modern approach for processing large amounts of data.</p>
<p>While it was at it, Cloudera also announced a couple of acquisitions of its own to help it move toward that modernization goal. For starters, it grabbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/datacoral-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-data-infrastructure-service/">Datacoral</a>, a startup that abstracts away the infrastructure needed to build a data pipeline without using code. It also acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cazena/">Cazena</a>, a startup that helps customers build cloud data lakes, giving the company a more modern approach to processing big data. Bearden sees both of these services helping Cloudera reposition itself in the big data self-service market</p>

<p>&#8220;Both businesses will enable our combined customers to enjoy a reduction in complexity and faster time to value for their data initiatives, leading to improved insights, faster innovation, and stronger engagements with their customers and partners,&#8221; Bearden said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cloudera <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/cloudera-finishes-up-20-in-stock-market-debut/">went public in 2018</a>, closing at $18.09 a share after raising $1 billion. The vast majority of that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/31/intel-pours-740m-into-cloudera-in-exchange-for-an-18-stake/">a $740 million investment from Intel Capital</a> in 2014. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cloudera-buys-back-intels-stake-11608759285">Cloudera bought Intel&#8217;s stake</a> in the company at the end of last year for $314 million.</p>
<p>Hortonworks raised another $248 million. A third Hadoop startup, MapR, raised $280 million. The company&#8217;s assets were sold rather unceremoniously <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/hp-enterprise-buys-assets-of-ai-startup-mapr-51565028280">to HPE in 2019</a> for a price pegged at under $50 million, showing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/with-mapr-fire-sale-hadoops-promise-has-fallen-on-hard-times/">just how far the market has fallen</a> since its earlier glory days.</p>
<p>The Cloudera deal includes a brief &#8220;go shop&#8221; provision that allows it to continue to look for a better deal. It&#8217;s doubtful it will find one, and if it doesn&#8217;t the transaction with KKR and CD&amp;R is expected to close in the second half of this year subject to typical regulatory review. The company will announce earnings later today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just about every week there’s a blockbuster round coming out of South America, but in certain countries such as Ecuador, things have been more hush-hush. However, </span><a href="https://kushkipagos.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kushki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Quito-based fintech, is bringing attention to the region with today’s announcement of an $86 million Series B and a $600 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We never thought that we would return home [from the U.S.] and build a company that was more valuable in Ecuador than we had built in the U.S.,” said Aron Schwarzkopf, CEO and co-founder of Kushki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwarzkopf and his business partner, Sebastián Castro, previously built and sold a fintech called Leaf in the U.S. in 2014. The two are originally from Ecuador but moved to Boston for college, where they met watching soccer.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many other fintechs in LatAm that are out to help the unbanked, Kushki works behind the scenes building the tech infrastructure that companies like Nubank use to transfer money. Some of the functionalities they build enable both local and cross-border payment players in credit and debit cards, bank transfers, digital cash, mobile wallets and other alternative payment methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized there was a gigantic opportunity to democratize and create infrastructure to move money,” Schwarzkopf told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in 2017, already has operations in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. The Series B will be used to accelerate growth and expand to Brazil and nine other markets in Central America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, expanding to Brazil is an expensive proposition, and therefore not a path that all companies can take, even though it can be an extremely profitable move if done right. Some of the challenges include the need to translate everything into Portuguese followed by the varying financial regulations.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;There have never been more $100M+ fintech rounds than right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/embed/#?secret=SvxlxwHeaq" data-secret="SvxlxwHeaq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Kushki’s approach has to be somewhat custom in each country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on going into the markets and we basically rebuild an entire infrastructure, so we put everything into one API,” said Schwarzkopf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products similar to Kushki have been successful in other regions around the world, such as in India with </span><a href="https://www.pinelabs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pine Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Africa with </span><a href="https://flutterwave.com/us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.checkout.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checkout.com</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which now has 15 international offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build all this infrastructure, Kushki, which means “cash” in a native Andes dialect, has raised a total of $100 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from SoftBank and an undisclosed global growth equity firm, as well as previous investors including DILA Capital, Kaszek Ventures, Clocktower Ventures and Magma Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From now until 2060, people will need servers and ways to move money, and we knew that the existing payment infrastructure couldn’t support that,” said Schwarzkopf.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A technical system underpinning the European Union&#8217;s plan for a pan-EU &#8220;digital pass&#8221; for verifying COVID-19 vaccination or test status across the region has gone live today, with a handful of EU Member States connected to the gateway and more expected to follow ahead of a July 1 full launch.</p>
<p>The idea for the EU&#8217;s COVID-19 digital certificate is to offer a single system for securely verifying EU citizens&#8217; COVID-19 status &#8212; whether vaccination, a recent negative test or proof of recovery from the virus &#8212; as they cross borders within the bloc to help facilitate safer travel.</p>
<p>The digital pass relies upon QR codes and digital signatures &#8212; verified using public key cryptography &#8212; to prevent falsification. Paper-based certificates can also be used by those who do not have access to a device.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Member States that have passed technical tests and are ready to do so can start issuing and verifying certificates on a voluntary basis, the Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2721">said today</a> &#8212; with seven countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Croatia and Poland) intending to do so at this point.</p>
<p>Other countries have decided to launch the EU Digital COVID Certificate only when all functions are deployed nationwide, it added. Further details about Member States&#8217; status on activating the system are available via <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">this webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Since 10 May, 22 EU countries have tested the gateway successfully, according to the Commission, which wants maximum update of the system by 1 July &#8212; when the associated regulation will apply.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s allowed a &#8220;phasing-in period&#8221; of six weeks for the issuance of certificates for Member States that need additional time to get everything hooked up. That means it&#8217;s possible the tardiest implementations could happen when summer is all but over. (An earlier goal of EU lawmakers that everything would be up and running everywhere by June always looked ambitious.)</p>
<p>The Commission says no personal data is &#8220;exchanged or retained&#8221; during the COVID-19 digital certificate verification process, noting that the signature keys for the verification are stored on servers at a national level. These keys can be accessed &#8212; via the gateway &#8212; by national verification apps or systems all across the EU.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s rush for a COVID-19 &#8216;digital pass&#8217; stirs concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/europes-rush-for-a-covid-19-digital-pass-stirs-concerns/embed/#?secret=AdMAkgSVK0" data-secret="AdMAkgSVK0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Commission has also developed reference software and apps for the issuance, storage and verification of certificates &#8212; which it&#8217;s published on <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates">GitHub</a> &#8212; to support the rollout by EU Member States. The Commission said 12 Member States have made use of this code so far.</p>
<p>National authorities in respective EU countries are in charge of issuing the COVID-19 digital certificate to individuals &#8212; with various potential routes for citizens to obtain one, such as from a COVID-19 test centre or from their local health authority or directly via a national eHealth portal.</p>
<p>Commenting on the gateway launch in a statement, Stella Kyriakides, the EU&#8217;s commissioner for health and food safety, urged Member States to get on and complete their implementations.</p>
<p>“The EU Digital COVID Certificate shows the value added of effective e-health solutions for our citizens,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is important that during the coming weeks, all Member States fully finalise their national systems to issue, store and verify certificates, so the system is functioning in time for the holiday season. EU citizens are looking forward to travelling again, and they want to do so safely. Having an EU certificate is a crucial step on the way.”</p>
<p>Also touching on the COVID-19 digital certification launch today, Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the system will only be in place for one year &#8212; presumably that&#8217;s assuming the pandemic is actually over by summer 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU certificate is a prime example of digital tools that represent our values,&#8221; she said, in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_2804">speech</a> addressing the 2021 Digital Assembly. &#8220;The EU values privacy. No personal data will be exchanged or retained. The EU is inclusive. Whoever is not vaccinated can get a digital certificate for test or recovery. Whoever does not have a smartphone can get it on paper. With the certificate, we want to help people to move freely in times of pandemic. This is why it will only be in place for one year. Europe is a front-runner here and can set standards at the global level.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the speech, the Commission&#8217;s president also trailed another incoming digital proposal which she said would provide Europeans with a trusted online ID they could use to interact with regional governments and businesses without being forced to hand over more data than is strictly necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to offer to Europeans a new digital identity. An identity that ensures trust and protects users online. We are about to present our proposal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It will allow everyone to control their identity online, and to interact with governments and businesses, across the EU. Nobody should be forced to give more data away than is necessary for the purpose at hand. To book a hotel room online, no-one needs to know where I am from and who my friends are. With our proposal, we are offering an alternative to the models of big online platforms. We believe in a human-centred digital transition.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Personal finance startup <a href="https://www.truebill.com">Truebill</a> has raised a $45 million Series D funding round led by Accel. This comes just a few months after the company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/truebill-series-c/">$17 million Series C</a>. Overall, the startup has raised $85 million since its creation.</p>
<p>Existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Cota Capital and Eldridge Industries are also participating in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Truebill offers several tools to help people living in the U.S. take control of their finances. One of the app’s key features is that you can track all your subscriptions in one place. Users can also cancel unwanted subscriptions. For cell phone and cable bills, Truebill can negotiate a discount for you.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, the startup has been adding features to turn the app into a financial companion. You can see spending insights, create a healthy monthly budget and track it from the app, view your credit reports and more.</p>
<p>Truebill also lets you put some money aside automatically. The company analyzes your accounts to save some money when you have some money left.</p>

<p>Now, the company is working on a wealth management dashboard that centralizes all your assets and debt. Wealth management is a bit tedious as you need to connect to every single pocket of money, otherwise you don’t see the full picture.</p>
<p>“More than 10,000 members sign up for Truebill every day seeking to better understand and improve their finances,” co-founder and CEO Haroon Mokhtarzada said in a statement. &#8220;With this new capital, we’re transforming Truebill into an all-in-one, holistic platform that makes it easy for members to not only manage subscriptions and spending but also optimize their savings and make informed decisions to improve their financial health. Truebill is rapidly becoming the most valuable financial membership for everyday consumers.”</p>
<p>As you can see, the startup is growing at a rapid pace. The user base has doubled from 1 million to 2 million users since November 2020. The company analyzes $40 billion in monthly transaction volume.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of Silicon Valley and Latin American-based VC firms and angels participated in the financing, including Future Positive, Kibo Ventures, FJ Labs, Kaszek, MAYA Capital, Venture Friends, Rappi co-founder and president Sebastián Mejía, Harsh Sinha, CTO of Wise (formerly Transferwise) and Nubank CEO and founder David Vélez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing Crunchbase data, Belvo believes the round represents the largest Series A ever raised by a Latin American fintech. In May 2020, Belvo raised a $10 million seed round c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o-led by Silicon Valley’s Founders Fund and Argentina’s Kaszek</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belvo aims to work with leading fintechs in Latin America, spanning verticals like the neobanks, credit providers and personal finance products Latin Americans use every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s goal with its developer-first API platform that can be used to access and interpret end-user financial data is to build better, more efficient and more inclusive financial products in Latin America. Developers of popular neobank apps, credit providers and personal finance tools use Belvo’s API to connect bank accounts to their apps to unlock the power of open banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TechCrunch Senior Editor Alex Wilhelm explained in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Belvo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be considered similar to U.S.-based Plaid, but more attuned to the Latin American market so it can take in a more diverse set of data to better meet the needs of the various markets it serves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while Belvo’s goals are “similar to the overarching goal[s] of Plaid,” co-founder and co-CEO Pablo Viguera told TechCrunch that Belvo is not merely building a banking API business hoping to connect apps to financial accounts. Instead, Belvo wants to build a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> API, which takes in more information than is normally collected by such systems. Latin America is massively underbanked and unbanked so the more data from more sources, the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In essence, we’re pushing for similar outcomes [as Plaid] in terms of when you think about open banking or open finance,” Viguera said. “We’re working to democratize access to financial data and empower end users to port that data, and share that data with whoever they want.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet Belvo, a YC-backed startup building a financial API for Latin America&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/embed/#?secret=qHlJFDdzvE" data-secret="qHlJFDdzvE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates under the premise that just because a significant number of the region’s population is underbanked doesn’t mean that they aren’t still financially active. Belvo’s goal is to link all sorts of accounts. For example, Viguera told TechCrunch that some gig economy companies in Latin America are issuing their own cards that allow workers to cash out at small local shops. In time, all those transactions are data that could be linked up using Belvo, casting a far wider net than what we’re used to domestically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s work to connect banks and non-banks together is key to the company’s goal of allowing “any fintech or any developer to access and interpret user financial data,” according to Viguera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viguera and co-CEO Oriol Tintoré founded Belvo in May of 2019, and it was part of Y Combinator’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter 2020 batch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since launching its platform last year, the company says it has built a customer base of more than 60 companies across Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, handling millions of monthly API calls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is important because as Alex noted last year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to other players in the API-space, Belvo charges for each API call that its customers use (in this sense, it has a model similar to Twilio’s). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, over the past year, Belvo says it expanded its API coverage to over 40 financial institutions, which gives companies the ability to connect to more than 90% of personal and business bank accounts in LatAm, as well as to tax authorities (such as the SAT in Mexico) and gig economy platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essentially we take unstructured financial data, which an individual might have outside of a bank such as integrations we have with gig economy platforms such as Uber and Rappi. We can take a driver’s information from their Uber app, which is kind of built like a bank app, and turn it into meaningful bank-like info which third parties can leverage to make assessments as if it’s data coming from a bank,” Viguera explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to scale its product offering, continue expanding its geographic footprint and double its current headcount of 70. Specifically, Belvo plans to hire more than 50 engineers in Mexico and Brazil by year’s end. It currently has offices in Mexico City, São Paulo and Barcelona. The company also aims to launch its bank-to-bank payment initiation offering in Mexico and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belvo currently operates in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s seeing “a lot of opportunity” in other markets in Latin America, especially in Chile, Peru and Argentina, Viguera told TechCrunch. “In due course, we will look to pursue expansion there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fred Blackford, founding partner of Future Positive, believes Belvo represents a “truly transformational opportunity for the region’s financial sector.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicolás Szekasy, co-founder and managing partner of Kaszek, noted that demand for financial services in Latin America is growing at an exponential rate .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Belvo is developing the infrastructure that will enable both the larger institutions and the emerging generation of younger players to successfully deploy their solutions,” he said. “Oriol, Pablo and the Belvo team have been leading the development of a sophisticated platform that resolves very complex technical challenges, and the company’s exponential growth reflects how it is delivering a product that fits perfectly with the requirements of the market.” </span></p>
