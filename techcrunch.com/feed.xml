										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One never knows how a confirmation hearing will go these days, especially one for a young outsider nominated to an important position despite challenging the status quo and big business. <a href="http://www.linamkhan.com/">Lina Khan</a>, just such a person up for the position of FTC Commissioner, had a surprisingly pleasant time of it during today&#8217;s Senate Commerce Committee confirmation hearing — possibly because her iconoclastic approach to antitrust makes for good politics these days.</p>
<p>Khan, an associate professor of law at Columbia, is best known in the tech community for her incisive essay &#8220;Amazon Antitrust&#8217;s Paradox,&#8221; which laid out the failings of regulatory doctrine that have allowed the retail giant to progressively dominate more and more markets. (She also recently contributed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">House report on tech policy</a>.)</p>
<p>When it was published, in 2018, the feeling that Amazon had begun to abuse its position was, though commonplace in some circles, not really popular in the Capitol. But the growing sense that laissez-faire or insufficient regulations have created monsters in Amazon, Google, and Facebook (to start) has led to a rare bipartisan agreement that we must find some way, any way will do, of putting these upstart corporations back in their place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This in turn led to a sense of shared purpose and camaraderie in the confirmation hearing, which was a triple header: Khan joined Bill Nelson, nominated to lead NASA, and Leslie Kiernan, who would join the Commerce Department as General Counsel, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?511008-1/nasa-administrator-ftc-commissioner-confirmation-hearing">for a really nice little three-hour chat</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden will nominate Big Tech critic and antitrust star Lina Khan to the FTC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/lina-khan-biden-ftc-antitrust/embed/#?secret=jdJCInc6fQ" data-secret="jdJCInc6fQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Khan is one of several in the Biden administration who signal a new approach to taking on Big Tech and other businesses that have gotten out of hand, and the questions posed to her by Senators from both sides of the aisle seemed genuine and got genuinely satisfactory answers from a confident Khan.</p>
<p>She deftly avoided a few attempts to bait her — including one involving Section 230; wrong Commission, Senator — and her answers primarily reaffirmed her professional opinion that the FTC should be better informed and more preemptive in its approach to regulating these secretive, powerful corporations.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets representative of the questioning and indicative of her positions on a few major issues (answers lightly edited for clarity):</p>
<p><strong>On the FTC getting involved in the fight between Google, Facebook, and news providers:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Everything needs to be on the table. Obviously local journalism is in crisis, and i think the current COVID moment has really underscored the deep democratic emergency that is resulting when we don&#8217;t have reliable sources of local news.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also cited the increasing concentration of ad markets and the arbitrary nature of, for example, algorithm changes that can have wide-ranging effects on entire industries.</p>

<p><strong>On Clarence Thomas&#8217;s troubling suggestion that social media companies should be considered &#8220;common carriers&#8221;:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it prompted a lot of interesting discussion,&#8221; she said, very diplomatically. &#8220;In the Amazon article, I identified two potential pathways forward when thinking about these dominant digital platforms. One is enforcing competition laws and ensuring that these markets are competitive.&#8221; (i.e. using antitrust rules)</p>
<p>&#8220;The other is, if we instead recognize that perhaps there are certain economies of scale, network externalities that will lead these markets to stay dominated by a very few number of companies, then we need to apply a different set of rules. We have a long legal tradition of thinking about what types of checks can be applied when there&#8217;s a lot of concentration and common carriage is one of those tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should clarify that some of these firms are now integrated in so many markets that you may reach for a different set of tools depending on which specific market you&#8217;re looking at.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clarence Thomas plays a poor devil&#8217;s advocate in floating First Amendment limits for tech companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clarence-thomas-plays-a-poor-devils-advocate-in-floating-first-amendment-limits-for-tech-companies/embed/#?secret=Wwtmwk9dzB" data-secret="Wwtmwk9dzB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This was a very polite way of saying common carriage and existing antitrust rules are totally unsuitable for the job.)</p>
<p><strong>On potentially reviewing past mergers the FTC approved:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The resources of the commission have not really kept pace with the increasing size of the economy, as well as the increasing size and complexity of the deals the commission is reviewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was an assumption that digital markets in particular are fast moving so we don&#8217;t need to be concerned about potential concentration in the markets, because any exercise of power will get disciplined by entry and new competition. Now of course we know that in the markets you actually have significant network externalities in ways that make them more sticky. In hindsight there&#8217;s a growing sense that those merger reviews were a missed opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Here Senator Blackburn (R-TN) in one of the few negative moments fretted about Khan&#8217;s &#8220;lack of experience in coming to that position&#8221; before asking about a spectrum plan — wrong Commission, Senator.)</p>
<p><strong>On the difficulty of enforcing something like an order against Facebook:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the challenges is the deep information asymmetry that exists between some of these firms and enforcers and regulators. I think it&#8217;s clear that in some instances the agencies have been a little slow to catch up to the underlying business realities and the empirical realities of how these markets work. So at the very least ensuring the agencies are doing everything they can to keep pace is gonna be important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In social media we have these black box algorithms, proprietary algorithms that can sometimes make it difficult to know what&#8217;s really going on. The FTC needs to be using its information gathering capacities to mitigate some of these gaps.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>On extending protections for children and other vulnerable groups online:</strong></p>
<p>Some of these dangers are heightened given some of the ways in which the pandemic has rendered families and children especially dependent on some of these [education] technologies. So I think we need to be especially vigilant here. The previous rules should be the floor, not the ceiling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall there was little partisan bickering and a lot of feeling from both sides that Khan was, if not <em>technically</em> experienced at the job (not rare with a coveted position like FTC Commissioner), about as competent a nominee as anyone could ask for. Not only that but her highly considered and fairly assertive positions on matters of antitrust and competition could help put Amazon and Google, already in the regulatory doghouse, on the defensive for once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed in the last decade-ish of instant photography, yet all the while the boxy build of instant cameras has stayed more or less intact. Modern instant shooters have slimmed down and put on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gift-guide-photography-2020-best-photography-gifts-ideas-for-photographers/"> a variety of calming pastel tones</a>, but they&#8217;re not exactly slender.</p>
<p>But lo, Polaroid — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/weve-come-full-rectangle-polaroid-is-reborn-out-of-the-impossible-project/">the new Polaroid, not the old Polaroid</a> — has done a thing. The company says its latest camera, the Polaroid Go, is the world&#8217;s smallest analog instant camera. And you know, yeah, it looks really quite small.</p>
<p>How small is small? It&#8217;s 4.1 inches long, 2.4 inches tall and a little over 3 inches wide. The Go is undeniably tiny but boasts a handful of useful features, including a selfie timer, selfie mirror and the ability to take dreamy double exposures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the promo photos, Polaroid&#8217;s models hold it like a delicate canapé or casually wield it with a few dainty fingers as it dangles from various stylish-looking accessories (camera straps? necklaces?). The company really wants people to wear this thing, it seems, and I for one am not above it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142052" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142052" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2142052 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png?w=680" alt="Polaroid Go" width="680" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png?resize=768,599 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png?resize=680,530 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image_go_polaroid_camera_film_bundle_009035_006017_front_800x-e1619047372187.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142052" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Polaroid</p></div></p>
<p>With the Go, Polaroid continues the sort of annoying but I guess necessary instant photography trend of making a new film format, which in this case is basically a miniaturized version of its iconic old-school square film. And while the camera is teeny, TechCrunch&#8217;s own tiny camera-haver and forthcoming review writer Devin Coldewey says you don&#8217;t actually lose much size in the shots compared to something like the Instax Mini.</p>
<p>Polaroid claims that the Go marks the &#8220;most significant and exciting change to the Polaroid form factor in decades&#8221; and it&#8217;s probably not wrong. The company&#8217;s improbable return from the dead was likely more exciting, but we don&#8217;t want to undermine how cute this thing is. Let&#8217;s just hope it makes pictures good.</p>
<p>The Polaroid Go will join the Polaroid Now, its standard though now hideously bloated sibling, and the OneStep+, which blends digital and analog and connects to a phone over Bluetooth. It&#8217;s <a href="https://us.polaroid.com/collections/go-film-bundle">on preorder now and will retail for $100</a>, which is the same amount you&#8217;d pay for the regular old new Polaroid camera. But why would you?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO Ashim Gupta today to learn more about his company's foray into the public markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After an upward revision, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UiPath priced its IPO last night at $56 per share</a>, a few dollars above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised target range</a>. The above-range price meant that the unicorn put more capital into its books through its public offering.</p>
<p>For a company in a market as competitive as robotic process automation (RPA), the funds are welcome. In fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">RPA has been top of mind</a> for startups and established companies alike over the last year or so. In that time frame, enterprise stalwarts like SAP, Microsoft, IBM and ServiceNow have been buying smaller RPA startups and building their own, all in an effort to muscle into an increasingly lucrative market.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Gartner reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-meteoric-rise-from-unknown-startup-to-35b-rpa-juggernaut/#:~:text=the%20fastest-growing%20area">RPA was the fastest-growing area</a> in enterprise software, and while the growth has slowed down since, the sector is still attracting attention. UIPath, which Gartner found was the market leader, has been riding that wave, and today’s capital influx should help the company maintain its market position.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that when the company had its last private funding round in February, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">brought home $750 million</a> at an impressive valuation of $35 billion. But as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">noted over the course of its pivot to the public markets</a>, that round valued the company above its final IPO price. As a result, this week&#8217;s $56-per-share public offer wound up being something of a modest down-round IPO to UiPath&#8217;s final private valuation.</p>

<p>Then, a broader set of public traders got hold of its stock and bid its shares higher. The former unicorn&#8217;s shares closed their first day’s trading at precisely $69, above the per-share price at which the company closed its final private round.</p>
<p>So despite a somewhat circuitous route, UiPath closed its first day as a public company worth more than it was in its Series F round — when it sold 12,043,202 shares sold at $62.27576 apiece, per SEC filings. More simply, UiPath closed today worth more per-share than it was in February.</p>
<p>How you might value the company, whether you prefer a simple or fully-diluted share count, is somewhat immaterial at this juncture. UiPath had a good day.</p>
<p>While it’s hard to know what the company might do with the proceeds, chances are it will continue to try to expand its platform beyond pure RPA, which could become market-limited over time as companies look at other, more modern approaches to automation. By adding additional automation capabilities — organically or via acquisitions — the company can begin covering broader parts of its market.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashim-gupta-0372ba5/">Ashim Gupta</a> today, curious about the company’s choice of a traditional IPO, its general avoidance of adjusted metrics in its SEC filings, and the IPO market’s current temperature. The final question was on our minds, as some companies have pulled their public listings in the wake of a market described as &#8220;challenging&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Why did UiPath not direct list after its huge February raise?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">antitrust hearing in the U.S. Senate</a>, Apple and Google representatives were questioned on whether they have a &#8220;strict firewall&#8221; or other internal policies in place that prevent them from leveraging the data from third-party businesses operating on their app stores to inform the development of their own competitive products. Apple, in particular, was called out for the practice of copying other apps by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who said the practice had become so common that it earned a nickname with Apple&#8217;s developer community: &#8220;sherlocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherlock, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)">has its own Wikipedia entry</a> under software, comes from Apple&#8217;s search tool in the early 2000s called Sherlock. A third-party developer, Karelia Software, created an alternative tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia_Watson">Watson</a>. Following the success of Karelia&#8217;s product, Apple added Watson&#8217;s same functionality into its own search tool, and Watson was effectively put out of business. The nickname &#8220;Sherlock&#8221; <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/06/developers-talk-about-being-sherlocked-as-apple-uses-them-for-market-research">later became shorthand</a> for any time Apple copies an idea from a third-party developer that threatens to or even destroys their business.</p>
<p>Over the years, developers claimed Apple has &#8220;sherlocked&#8221; <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/">a number of apps</a>, including Konfabulator (desktop widgets), iPodderX (podcast manager), Sandvox (app for building websites) and Growl (a notification system for Mac OS X) and, in more recent years, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/apple-flux-ios-93-sherlock/">F.lux</a> (blue light reduction tool for screens) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/the-makers-of-duet-display-and-luna-on-life-after-apples-sidecar/">Duet and Luna</a> (apps that makes iPad a secondary display), as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/">various screen-time-management tools</a>. Now Tile claims <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">Apple has also unfairly entered its market</a> with AirTag.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During his questioning, Blumenthal asked Apple and Google&#8217;s representatives at the hearing &#8212; Kyle Andeer, Apple&#8217;s chief compliance officer and Wilson White, Google&#8217;s senior director of Public Policy &amp; Government Relations, respectively &#8212; if they employed any sort of &#8220;firewall&#8221; in between their app stores and their business strategy.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OqSLFymm35"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/embed/#?secret=OqSLFymm35" data-secret="OqSLFymm35" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Andeer somewhat dodged the question, saying, &#8220;Senator, if I understand the question correctly, we have separate teams that manage the App Store and that are engaged in product development strategy here at Apple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal then clarified what he meant by &#8220;firewall.&#8221; He explained that it doesn&#8217;t mean whether or not there are separate teams in place, but whether there&#8217;s an internal prohibition on sharing data between the App Store and the people who run Apple&#8217;s other businesses.</p>
<p>Andeer then answered, &#8220;Senator, we have controls in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to note that over the past 12 years, Apple has only introduced &#8220;a handful of applications and services,&#8221; and in every instance, there are &#8220;dozens of alternatives&#8221; on the App Store. And, sometimes, the alternatives are more popular than Apple&#8217;s own product, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t copy. We don&#8217;t kill. What we do is offer up a new choice and a new innovation,&#8221; Andeer stated.</p>
<p>His argument may hold true when there are strong rivalries, like Spotify versus Apple Music, or Netflix versus Apple TV+, or Kindle versus Apple Books. But it&#8217;s harder to stretch it to areas where Apple makes smaller enhancements &#8212; like when Apple introduced Sidecar, a feature that allowed users to make their iPad a secondary display. Sidecar ended the need for a third-party app, after apps like Duet and Luna first proved the market.</p>
<p>Another example was when Apple built screen-time controls into its iOS software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/28/apple-defends-its-takedown-of-some-apps-monitoring-screen-time/">but didn&#8217;t provide</a> the makers of third-party screen-time apps with an API so consumers could use their preferred apps to configure Apple&#8217;s Screen Time settings via the third-party&#8217;s specialized interface or take advantage of other unique features.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said he interpreted Andeer&#8217;s response as to whether Apple has a &#8220;data firewall&#8221; as a &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posed the same question, Google&#8217;s representative, White, said his understanding was that Google had &#8220;data access controls in place that govern how data from our third-party services are used.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TDT4CS8zXX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=TDT4CS8zXX" data-secret="TDT4CS8zXX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blumenthal pressed him to clarify if this was a &#8220;firewall,&#8221; meaning, he clarified again, &#8220;do you have a prohibition against access?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a prohibition against using our third-party services to compete directly with our first-party services,&#8221; White said, adding that Google has &#8220;internal policies that govern that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senator said he would follow up on this matter with written questions, as his time expired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new bill known as the Fourth Amendment is Not for Sale Act would seal up a loophole that intelligence and law enforcement agencies use to obtain troves of sensitive and identifying information to which they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have legal access.</p>
<p>The new legislation, proposed by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rand Paul (R-KY), would require government agencies to obtain a court order <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/27/vermont-passes-first-first-law-to-crack-down-on-data-brokers/">to access data from brokers</a>. Court orders are already required when the government seeks analogous data from mobile providers and tech platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s no reason information scavenged by data brokers should be treated differently than the same data held by your phone company or email provider,&#8221; Wyden said. Wyden describes the loophole as a way that police and other agencies buy data to &#8220;end-run the Fourth Amendment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul criticized the government for using the current data broker loophole to circumvent Americans&#8217; constitutional rights. &#8220;The Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable search and seizure ensures that the liberty of every American cannot be violated on the whims, or financial transactions, of every government officer,&#8221; Paul said.</p>
<p>Critically, the bill would also ban law enforcement agencies from buying data on Americans when it was obtained through hacking, violations of terms of service or &#8220;from a user’s account or device.&#8221;</p>
<p>That bit highlights the questionable practices of Clearview AI, a deeply controversial tech company that sells access to a facial recognition search engine. Clearview&#8217;s platform collects pictures of faces scraped from across the web, including social media sites, and sells access to that data to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table">police departments around the country</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">federal agencies like ICE</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t9LlnLMEal"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">Clearview AI landed a new facial recognition contract with ICE</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI landed a new facial recognition contract with ICE&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/embed/#?secret=t9LlnLMEal" data-secret="t9LlnLMEal" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In scraping their sites for data to sell, Clearview has run afoul of just about every major social media platform&#8217;s terms of service. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google have all denounced Clearview for using data culled from their services and some have even sent cease-and-desists ordering the data broker to stop.</p>
<p>The bill would also expand privacy laws to apply to infrastructure companies that own cell towers and data cables, seal up workarounds that allow intelligence agencies to obtain metadata from Americans&#8217; international communications without review by a FISA court and ensure that agencies seek probable cause orders to obtain location and web browsing data.</p>
<p>The bill, embedded below, isn&#8217;t just some nascent proposal. It&#8217;s already attracted bipartisan support from a number of key co-sponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side and Republicans Mike Lee and Steve Daines. A House version of the legislation was also introduced Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve covered Swiss robotics company ANYbotics with some regularity over the years. The company has offered its own take on the quadrupedal robotics space that has, naturally, drawn comparisons to Boston Dynamics’ Spot. Of course, as we noted earlier, the company’s take on the category has been in development for several years, so there may be a case of convergent evolution here.</p>
<p>Today the company announced that it’s ready to take ANYmal to the next level. ANYbotics is positioning its robot as a “end-to-end robotic inspection solution.” Specifically, the robot is designed to inspect places like energy and industrial plants, patrolling areas where it’s not ideal to have a human on-site, 24/7 &#8212; if at all.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141863" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141863" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ANYbotics-Introduces-End-to-End-Robotic-Inspection-Solution.2021-04-21-14_21_51.gif" alt="" width="800" height="421" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ANYbotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mounted atop the robot is a customizable payload, featuring a number of different sensors for inspection, including visual, acoustic and thermal readings. The on-board camera features remote pan and tilt options for a better picture of an area.</p>
<p>The ANYmal is capable of walking up stairs and squeezing into areas that might otherwise be inaccessible for more traditional wheeled robotics. It can perform inspections autonomously and return to its charging dock when the battery is low.</p>
<p>The robot is currently in pilot deployment and the company has opened it up to preorders. It expects to start delivering units to customers in the second half of the year. The company is also offering a kind of on-boarding to get clients up to speed.</p>

<p>“Acting as a single point-of-contact, ANYbotics&#8217; experts closely work with the customer in evaluating the tasks to be automated and prepare the organization for the deployment of autonomous mobile inspection robots,” it writes in a release. “The team checks the feasibility and impact in simulations, on-site demonstrations, and long-term pilot deployments. Once the implementation roadmap is established, the team trains the customer in commissioning and supports in scaling the system throughout their facilities.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's the software that can determine if a micromobility company breaks out of the rideshare model and into the sales or subscription model, or becomes subsidized by or absorbed into public transit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The days of the shared, dockless micromobility model are numbered. That&#8217;s essentially the conclusion reached by Puneeth Meruva, an associate at Trucks Venture Capital who recently<a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance"> authored a detailed research brief on micromobility</a>. Meruva is of the opinion that the standard for permit-capped, dockless scooter-sharing is not sustainable — the overhead is too costly, the returns too low — and that the industry could splinter.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Most companies playing to win have begun to vertically integrate their tech stacks by developing or acquiring new technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;Because shared services have started a cultural transition, people are more open to buying their own e-bike or e-scooter,&#8221; Meruva told TechCrunch. &#8220;Fundamentally because of how much city regulation is involved in each of these trips, it could reasonably become a transportation utility that is very useful for the end consumer, but it just hasn’t proven itself to be a profitable line of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>As dockless e-scooters, e-bikes and e-mopeds expand their footprint while consolidating under a few umbrella corporations, companies might develop or acquire the technology to streamline and reduce operational costs enough to achieve unit economics. One overlooked but massive factor in the micromobility space is the software that powers the vehicles — who owns it, if it&#8217;s made in-house and how well it integrates with the rest of the tech stack.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the software that can determine if a company breaks out of the rideshare model into the sales or subscription model, or becomes subsidized by or absorbed into public transit, Meruva predicts.</p>
<p>Vehicle operating systems haven’t been top of mind for most companies in the short history of micromobility. The initial goal was making sure the hardware didn&#8217;t break down or burst into flames. When e-scooters came on the scene, they caused a ruckus. Riders without helmets zipped through city streets and many vehicles ended up in ditches or blocking sidewalk accessibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/madrid-authorities-order-scooter-ban/">City officials were angry</a>, to say the least, and branded dockless modes of transport a public nuisance. However, micromobility companies had to answer to their overeager investors — the ones who missed out on the Uber and Lyft craze and threw millions at electric mobility, hoping for swift returns. What was a Bird or a Lime to do? The only thing <em>to</em> do: Get back on that electric two-wheeler and start schmoozing cities.</p>
<h2>How the fight for cities indirectly improved vehicle software</h2>
<p>Shared, dockless operators are currently in a war of attrition, fighting to get the last remaining city permits. But as the industry seeks a business to government (B2G) model that morphs into what companies think cities want, some are inadvertently producing vehicles that will evolve beyond functional toys and into more viable transportation alternatives.</p>
<p>The second wave of micromobility was marked by newer companies like Superpedestrian and Voi Technology. They learned from past industry mistakes and developed business strategies that include building onboard operating systems in-house. The goal? More control over rider behavior and better compliance with city regulations.</p>
<p>Most companies playing to win have begun to vertically integrate their tech stacks by developing or acquiring new technology. Lime, Bird, Superpedestrian, Spin and Voi all design their own vehicles and write their own fleet management software or other operational tools. Lime writes its own firmware, which sits directly on top of the vehicle hardware primitives and helps control things like motor controllers, batteries and connected lights and locks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We all know these constant video calls are doing <em>something</em> to our brains. How else could we get tired and frazzled from sitting around in our own home all day? Well, now Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/brain-research">done a little brain science</a> and found out that yeah, constant video calls do increase your stress and brain noise. Tell your boss!</p>
<p>The study had 14 people participate in eight half-hour video calls, divided into four a day — one day with 10-minute breaks between, and the other all in one block. The participants wore EEG caps: brain-monitoring gear that gives a general idea of types of activity in the old grey matter.</p>
<p>What they found is not particularly surprising, since we all have lived it for the last year (or more for already remote workers), but still important to show in testing. During the meeting block with no breaks, people showed higher levels of beta waves, which are associated with stress, anxiety and concentration. There were higher peaks and a higher average stress level, plus it increased slowly as time went on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taking 10-minute breaks kept stress readings lower on average and prevented them from rising. And they increased other measurements of positive engagement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141832" style="width: 931px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141832" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png" alt="Graph showing how breaks keep stress low during video calls." width="921" height="926" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png 921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ms-brain2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft/Valerio Pellegrini</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly validating even if it seems obvious. And while EEG readings aren&#8217;t the most exact measurement of stress, they&#8217;re fairly reliable and better than a retrospective self-evaluation along the lines of &#8220;How stressed were you after the second meeting on a scale of 1-5?&#8221; And of course it wouldn&#8217;t be safe to take your laptop into an MRI machine. So while this evidence is helpful, we should be careful not to exaggerate it, or forget that the stress takes place in a complex and sometimes inequitable work environment.</p>
<p>For instance: <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/04/13/zoom-fatigue-worse-women/">A recent study published by Stanford</a> shows that &#8220;Zoom Fatigue,&#8221; as they call it (a mixed blessing for Zoom), is disproportionately suffered by women. More than twice as many women as men reported serious post-call exhaustion — perhaps because women&#8217;s meetings tend to run longer and they are less likely to take breaks between them. Add to that the increased focus on women&#8217;s appearance and it&#8217;s clear this is not a simple &#8220;no one likes video calls&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, has tech solutions to the problems in its Teams product, such as adding buffer time to make sure meetings don&#8217;t run right into each other, or the slightly weird &#8220;together mode&#8221; that puts everyone&#8217;s heads in a sort of lecture hall (the idea being it feels more natural).</p>
<p>Stanford has a few <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">recommendations</a>, such as giving yourself permission to do audio only for a while each day, position the camera far away and pace around (make sure you&#8217;re dressed), or just turn off the self-view.</p>
<p>Ultimately the solutions can&#8217;t be entirely individual, though — they need to be structural, and though we may be leaving the year of virtual meetings behind, there can be no doubt there will be more of them going forward. So employers and organizers need to be cognizant of these risks and create policies that mitigate them — don&#8217;t just add to employee responsibilities. If anyone asks, tell them science said so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It might be time for neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops to start thinking about a subscription business — at least according to a new Y Combinator-backed startup called <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/">Per Diem</a>. The company is announcing today that it has raised $2.3 million in seed funding led by Two Sigma Ventures.</p>
<p>As co-founder CEO Tomer Molovinsky put it, Per Diem helps local businesses &#8220;build their own Amazon Prime.&#8221; He said that he and his co-founder/CTO Doron Segal started working on this during the pandemic, as local businesses became more willing to consider new models to increase loyalty and regular purchases.</p>
<p>Not that this is an entirely new concept. In fact, Molovinsky said a number of the startup&#8217;s early customers already offered subscriptions of their own, like <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/national/normans-farm-market">Norman&#8217;s Farm Market</a> with its CSA subscription for produce, or <a href="https://www.per-diem.co/new-york/ixv-coffee">IVX Coffee</a> with a program initially focused on filling up reusable mugs with coffee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But apparently these programs were usually managed through spreadsheets or an &#8220;old-school Rolodex,&#8221; making them increasingly difficult to manage as they grew. So Per Diem has built software to handle things like ordering, pickups/deliveries and payments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141825" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141825" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="Per Diem" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Per Diem</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Today we offer support for both local delivery and shipping, and then we plan to build that out [with] different types of integrations, delivery partners and shipping partners,&#8221; Molovinsky said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re building on that core fundamental, which is that this is a brick-and-mortar business. That&#8217;s the ultimate differentiator.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Per Diem emphasizes creating a strong in-store experience for subscribers, since that&#8217;s where they build a real relationship with the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to build a future where … I&#8217;m getting all my food from warehouses in another state,&#8221; Segal added. &#8220;I want to be able to say, &#8216;Oh, I get my food from John, I get my coffee from Linda.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Diem says that after Norman&#8217;s Farm Market used the software to offer vegetable box subscription on its website, it sold over 500 subscriptions in the first month alone. And IVX is now able to offer a full menu of espresso, match and coffee (drip and bean) subscriptions, with the average subscriber visiting the store five days a week.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141831" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141831" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Per Diem founders Doron Segal and Tomer Molovinsky" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/founders.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141831" class="wp-caption-text">Per Diem founders Doron Segal and Tomer Molovinsky. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Per Diem</p></div></p>
<p>The startup is currently focused on New York, but it&#8217;s already working with businesses in Phoenix and Washington, D.C. as well, and Molovinsky said there are no real geographic limitations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he said he&#8217;s hoping to create &#8220;more value&#8221; for businesses, which could eventually mean cross-promoting different subscriptions or creating a neighborhood-wide subscription.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to stay focused on what are the things we can unlock for [our customers],&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re struggling with email marketing, so we added tools like that into our system. Over time, we can build up our system to continue to strengthen the relationship between the customer and the business.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I’m a female entrepreneur who created my first startup a few months ago. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Once my startup gets off the ground — and as COVID-19 gets under control — I’d like to visit the United States to test the market and meet with investors. Which visas would allow me to do that? </strong></p>
<p><strong>—Noteworthy in Nairobi</strong></p>
<p>Dear Noteworthy,</p>
<p>Congratulations on founding your startup! There are many ways to engage with the U.S. startup ecosystem, and you can start now, even before you physically come to the United States.</p>
<p>I recommend doing some research into the programs and resources offered to entrepreneurs like you through the U.S. Embassy and Consulates near you in your home country. I recently interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillian-wahl-tuco-460a0548/">Lilly Wahl-Tuco</a>, a foreign service officer who has worked for the U.S. Department of State for 15 years, on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/067-diplomacy-through-supporting-entrepreneurs-with-lilly-wahl-tuco/">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Wahl-Tuco discussed some of the State Department resources &#8212; including programs, competitions and grants &#8212; made available by U.S. embassies and consulates for entrepreneurs living in the area.</p>

<p>Serving as the first <a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-office-of-policy-and-public-outreach/">Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH)</a> officer at the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2015, Wahl-Tuco was tasked with energizing the entrepreneurs of Bosnia. After she traveled around the country, visiting every incubator and meeting several entrepreneurs, Wahl-Tuco said she was surprised that most of the people she talked with didn’t know about the resources that the U.S. government offers through its embassies.</p>
<p>She recommends that entrepreneurs reach out, network and do online research to figure out what’s offered in their country or even if other foreign embassies offer resources and programs aimed at entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Wahl-Tuco also suggested that entrepreneurs reach out to their local U.S. Embassy. For example, you can contact the <a href="https://ke.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Kenya</a> to find out if you can discuss your startup and business plan with an ESTH officer (if there is one) or someone else there. Connecting with embassy staff can open up many opportunities.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest hearing to target Big Tech will drill down on competition in Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play. The Senate hearing, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores">set for Wednesday at 2:30 p,m. EDT</a> and embedded below, will feature testimony from the two big app store gatekeepers, and three companies that have banded together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/">to critique the immense power</a> that Apple and Google command in the mobile software market.</p>
<p>Last year, 13 app makers created the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/app-makers-band-together-to-fight-for-app-store-changes-with-new-coalition-for-app-fairness/"> Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a group organizing against Apple in particular for its stranglehold over app distribution and the hefty fees it collects from software developers. The group is linked to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-17-coalition-for-app-fairness-behind-north-dakota-bill-against-apple">legislation in states like North Dakota</a> that seeks to make state laws more more favorable to software makers by removing app store fees and has expanded since its inception.</p>
<p>Spotify, Tile and Match Group (which owns Tinder, Hinge and other dating apps) are all members of the coalition and will be testifying in the Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing Wednesday. That committee is helmed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">an emerging tech antitrust hawk</a> who&#8217;s made reining in Big Tech&#8217;s power a cornerstone of her political brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No tech CEOs will be giving testimony this time around — they&#8217;ve sent legal counsel instead — but the dynamic might be interesting given that the two Big Tech companies will appear alongside their fierce critics, who are aligned with the lawmakers who called the hearing.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnCUmJvNIr0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The hearing comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">a day after Apple launched AirTags</a>, its own Tile-like product that can geolocate lost items like keys and wallets. Tile has criticized Apple for more than a year over those plans, claiming the tech giant implemented policies to hamstring the market leader in a product category it planned to compete within. The company previously testified before the House&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110386/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-DaruK-20200117.pdf">airing those concerns last January</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition,&#8221; Tile CEO C.J. Prober said Tuesday following Apple&#8217;s big event. &#8220;Unfortunately, given Apple’s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prober called lawmakers&#8217; interest in examining Apple&#8217;s policies &#8220;entirely appropriate&#8221; in light of Tile&#8217;s history of issues with the company.</p>
<p>Software makers have long been waging a battle against Apple over its iron grip on the app world. Last year, Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/epics-latest-argument-in-its-fight-against-apple-keeps-antitrust-issues-front-and-center/">elevated that struggle</a>, picking a fight with Apple over the 30% cut the company takes on payments made through its App Store. Apple punished the company for its attempt at a workaround for the fees, kicking Epic&#8217;s hit game Fortnite out of the App Store and prompting Epic to launch an antitrust suit against the $2 trillion company. Epic&#8217;s day in court kicks off next month, on May 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Right on schedule, Google today launched the third developer preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">Android 12</a>, the latest version of its mobile operating system. According to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">roadmap</a>, this will be the last developer preview before Android 12 goes into beta, which is typically also when you&#8217;ll likely see the first over-the-air updates for nondevelopers who want to try it out. For now, developers still have to <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get">flash a device image</a> to their supported Pixel devices.</p>
<p>Google notes that with the beta phase coming up, now is the time for developers to start compatibility testing to make sure their apps are ready. Currently, the plan is for Android 12 to reach platform stability by August 2021. At that point, all the app-facing features will be locked in and finalized.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in this preview? As usual, there are dozens of smaller new features, tweaks and changes, but the highlights this time around are the ability for developers to provide new haptic feedback experiences in their apps and new app launch animations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new app launch experience may be the most noticeable change here for both developers and users. The new animation will take the app from launch to a splash screen that shows the app&#8217;s icon and then to the app itself. &#8220;The new experience brings standard design elements to every app launch, but we’ve also made it customizable so apps can maintain their unique branding,&#8221; Google explains. Developers will get quite a bit of leeway in how they want to <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/window/SplashScreen">customize this splash screen</a> with their own branding. The most basic launch experience is enabled by default, though.</p>
<p>Rich haptic feedback is also new in this release. It&#8217;s hard not to look at this and think of Apple&#8217;s now mostly abandoned Force Touch, but this is a bit different. The idea here is to provide &#8220;immersive and delightful effects for gaming, and attentional haptics for productivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other new features in this release include a new call notification template that is meant to make it easier for users to manage incoming and ongoing calls. Google says these new notifications will be more visible and scannable. There are also improvements to the Neural Networks API for machine learning workloads and new APIs to support a wider range of ultra high-resolution camera sensors.</p>
<p>With Android 12, Google is also deprecating its RenderScript API for running computationally intensive tasks in favor of GPU compute frameworks like Vulkan and OpenGL.</p>
<p>You can find a full breakdown of all of the changes in this release <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are any number of seed rounds that cross our desks every day, a never-ending march of enterprise software, consumer apps, games, hardware, biotech and sometimes even a space startup. But amid the regular flow of funding news, it&#8217;s still rare to come across a company raising money to take on addiction with software. So when <a href="https://www.affecttherapeutics.com/">Affect&#8217;s</a> $1 million seed round from <a href="https://alleycorp.com/">AlleyCorp</a> came to my attention, I wanted to learn a bit more.</p>
<p>As someone who went to rehab for alcohol use disorder in what appeared to be a partially renovated middle school where the highest-tech thing that was in our group rooms were <em>chairs</em>, the idea of using software to help addicts reduce use and get their life back intrigued me.</p>
<p>Focused on stimulant abuse in particular, the startup wants to help people addicted to methamphetamine, for example, fully cease their use of the drug. Affect CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinmuhlner/">Kristin Muhlner</a> talked me through the company&#8217;s efforts during an interview. In short, the Affect app combines contingency management (<a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/evidence-based-approaches-to-drug-addiction-treatment/behavioral-therapies/contingency-management-interventions-motivational-incentives">rewards for positive behaviors</a>) and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897895/">a form of therapy with known impact on addiction</a>). Regarding the latter, Muhlner told TechCrunch during an interview that well-known recovery programs like <a href="https://aa.org/">AA</a> or <a href="https://www.smartrecovery.org/">SMART Recovery</a> also use forms of CBT in their approaches to helping addicts.</p>
<p>In app form, those two concepts break down into things like cash rewards for multiday abstinence or attending a group session. On the therapy front, Affect offers group therapy, individual therapy, addiction counseling and drug testing.</p>
<p>Like many companies today, Affect intends to learn from more data; it expects, per a deck that TechCrunch was able to review, machine learning to help the company hone its model and service over time. Let&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p>Critically, Affect is not opposed to medically assisted recovery, which matters. There is, in some recovery-focused theologies, a belief that any sort of medical assistance is akin to merely replacing one addiction, or substance, with another. This harmful view is <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment">contradicted by science</a>. So, to see Affect cite adjuvant medication in its own pitch materials was heartening.</p>
<p>Stimulant abuse is rampant in America, and meth addiction is among the <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">most deadly drugs in the country</a>. Meth is no fucking joke. The only good amount of meth usage is precisely and exactly zero meth usage. So what Affect is building could actually change the world for stimulant addicts if it works.</p>
<p>I honestly hope Affect company winds up raising a bit more to more fully test out its thesis regarding addiction recovery. With insurance companies picking up the tab for Affect&#8217;s software, it has a chance to reach lots of folks in need. So many, in fact, that when I asked its CEO how it was handling go-to-market work, she said that her company had been warned that her user group was hard to reach. However, after putting up a digital ad, her company had to take it down seven minutes later. How&#8217;s that for product-market fit.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope we see more startups working on this problem. Addiction is not going away and older methods are not the only way forward for addicts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/figma/">Figma</a> spent years in stealth before launching its web-based collaborative design tool. Since coming into the light, the company has been iterating quickly. Today, Figma launches its biggest product update to date.</p>
<p>Meet FigJam, Figma&#8217;s new whiteboarding tool.</p>
<p>The entire concept of Figma stemmed from the fact that designers were taking up much more space at the figurative table and needed a place to collaborate efficiently. That is only more true today, especially during the last year of working from home, which is why Figma is extending itself throughout the workflow of designers with whiteboarding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only does FigJam give designers a place to come up with ideas together, but it also gives nondesigners a place to participate in the brainstorm.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma raises $50 million Series D led by Andreessen Horowitz&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/embed/#?secret=ETCxV3zGIz" data-secret="ETCxV3zGIz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>FigJam functionality includes sticky notes, emojis and drawing tools, as well as shapes, pre-built lines and connectors, stamps and cursor chats. As expected, FigJam works with Figma so components or other design objects breathed into life on FigJam can easily be moved into Figma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our point of view here was focusing on how to make FigJam work as the first step in the design process, before you go into actually doing design work,&#8221; said Figma founder and CEO Dylan Field. &#8220;We see people looking for a better, more fluid experience, but we also wanted to make it simple enough to bring other people into the tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>To take that a step further, Figma is also introducing voice chat into all of its products. That means users who are designing alongside one another in Figma or brainstorming in FigJam don&#8217;t need to hop into a separate Zoom call or Google Meet, but can just toggle on chat in Figma to use audio.</p>
<p>Figma didn&#8217;t build its voice chat from scratch, but rather worked with a partner to bring this to market. Figma did not specify which partner/tech it&#8217;s working with on voice chat.</p>

<p>Alongside the release of FigJam and voice chat, Figma is also releasing a more full-featured mobile app, which will be in beta through TestFlight at launch.</p>

<p>One final update that Figma is announcing today is branching and merging in Figma. This allows designers who are updating the design system, for example, to branch out and do their work and then merge that work with the existing design system, rather than updating a shared component or resource and affecting everyone else&#8217;s workflow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recent laws allowing healthcare providers to refuse care because of conscientious beliefs and denying care to transgender individuals might not seem like an issue for the tech industry at first blush, but these types of legislation directly contradict the core values of health tech.</p>
<p>Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson last month signed into law <a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R&amp;measureno=SB289">S.B. 289</a>, known as the “Medical Ethics and Diversity Act,” which allows anyone who provides healthcare services &#8212; not just doctors &#8212; to refuse to give non-emergency care if they believe the care goes against their conscience.</p>
<p>Arkansas is <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/374077-health-care-conscience-laws-infringe-on-the-rights-of-others">one of several states in the U.S. that have been pushing laws like this </a>over the past several years. These &#8220;conscience laws&#8221; are harmful to all patients &#8212; particularly LGBTQ individuals, women and rural citizens &#8212; especially because over <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/25/20929539/catholic-hospitals-religious-refusal-rural-health-care-evan-minton">40% of available hospital beds are controlled by Catholic institutions</a> in some states.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			While disguised as a safeguard that prevents doctors from having to participate in medical services that are at odds with their religious beliefs, these laws go far beyond that and should be repealed.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While disguised as a safeguard that prevents doctors from having to participate in medical services that are at odds with their religious beliefs, these laws go far beyond that and should be repealed.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Non-emergency&#8221; service is open to interpretation</h2>
<p>The Arkansas legislation is one giant slippery slope. Even beyond the direct effects that the law would have on reproductive rights and the LGBTQ community, it leaves open questions about the many different services that medical professionals could decline simply by saying it goes against their conscience.</p>
<p>Broadly letting healthcare providers decide which services they will perform based on religion, ethics or conscience essentially eliminates protections patients have under federal anti-discrimination regulations.</p>
<p>What constitutes an &#8220;emergency&#8221; to one doctor or EMT may be deemed a &#8220;non-emergency&#8221; by another. By allowing medical professionals to avoid performing some services, the bill can be interpreted as allowing anyone involved in the provision of healthcare services to avoid performing any kind of service, as long as they say they believed it wasn&#8217;t an emergency at the time.</p>
<p>The law also allows individuals to refuse to refer patients to someone who would provide the desired service for them. This places an undue burden on patients with physical or mental health issues and causes delays in treatment as the patient searches for an alternate provider. In cases of health and life-threatening issues, for example, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/catholic-hospitals-refuse-to-treat_n_5b06c82fe4b05f0fc8458db3">women have been refused treatment at Catholic medical institutions and forced to ride to the closest emergency care center</a>.</p>
<h2>The health tech community is working to improve the health of all</h2>
<p>The Arkansas law runs counter to the values of the businesses that are working hard to develop and improve medical technologies. Health tech startups at their core are fighting to provide more and better services to more patients &#8212; whether it’s by building platforms to make healthcare accessible to all, developing specific medical devices to improve the quality of service or researching new treatments and vaccines.</p>
<p>Imagine developing a vaccine for a global pandemic and then allowing doctors the right to refuse to administer it because it’s open to interpretation whether the virus represents an emergency to specific people. Or imagine <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwi/pr/hospital-pharmacist-plead-guilty-attempting-spoil-hundreds-covid-vaccine-doses">a hospital pharmacist who deliberately tries to spoil hundreds of vaccine doses</a> because of the conspiracy theories he believes. Laws like the one in Arkansas open up the healthcare system to abuse by conspiracy theorists, and it is already the case that many <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/wellness-qanon-coronavirus/">wellness providers are basing their advice and services on QAnon falsehoods</a>.</p>
<p>The health tech community is not just developing medications and devices for patients whose beliefs are similar to their own. Equally, medical professionals should not be making it harder for people to get needed medical care based on personal feelings. On the contrary, the ultimate goal of health tech businesses and healthcare providers alike should be a singular focus on improving the quality of care for all.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Medical ethics&#8221; and anti-LGBTQ laws are unethical</h2>
<p>As the health tech community continues to work tirelessly to bring new solutions to the marketplace to improve the health of everyone, it must also stand against laws like this, which threaten to eradicate the important gains that have been made in enhancing the lives and health of patients.</p>
<p>The Arkansas law &#8212; and others like it &#8212; place the burden of finding appropriate care on the patient instead of on the medical community, where it belongs. These laws must be repealed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was “the eighth wonder of the world,” Donald Trump said, driving a golden shovel into the ground. The then-president touted Foxconn’s planned Wisconsin factory as a major win for his economic goals.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, the future of the manufacturing deal is far less certain. Earlier this week, the state announced a dramatic scaling back of a plan it had hoped would return blue-collar jobs back to the hard hit state. The Taiwanese manufacturing giant is scaling back its investment from $10 billion to $672 million.</p>
<p>The new plans also call for a massive cut to potential headcount &#8212; to 1,454, down from 13,000. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers framed the reduction as a tax-saving deal in <a href="https://wedc.org/blog/gov-evers-announces-renegotiated-foxconn-contract-to-save-taxpayers-2-77-billion/">a press release issued this week</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“When I ran to be governor, I made a promise to work with Foxconn to cut a better deal for our state—the last deal didn’t work for Wisconsin, and that doesn’t work for me,” Evers said. “Today I’m delivering on that promise with an agreement that treats Foxconn like any other business and will save taxpayers $2.77 billion, protect the hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure investments the state and local communities have already made, and ensure there’s accountability for creating the jobs promised.”</p>
<p>Evers stepped into the role of Governor in 2019, following Scott Walker, who played a key role in negotiating the deal under Trump. The package included in the neighborhood of $4 billion in incentives for Foxconn, a record-breaking deal for the firm.</p>
<p>Plans for the TV factory shifted considerably since it was announced nearly four years ago, and in early 2019, it appeared that Foxconn had abandoned it altogether, before a phone call from Trump apparently put plans back on track.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/foxconn-sharply-scales-back-wisconsin-investment-2021-04-20/">Reuters notes</a>, the state has already spent in excess of $200 million on infrastructure, training and other aspects ahead of the planned factory opening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a major update to <a href="https://meet.google.com/">Meet</a>, its video-meeting service, which brings several user interface tweaks for desktop users, as well as quite a bit of new functionality, including multipinning so that you can highlight multiple feeds instead of just one, as well as new AI-driven video capabilities for light adjustments, autozoom and a new Data Saver feature that limits data usage on slower mobile networks.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;re increasingly tired of video meetings (to the point where I often just keep the camera off). But the reality is that this style of meeting will be with us for the foreseeable future, whether we like them or not.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141684" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BGPiP2_Minimize_Drag.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141684" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141684 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BGPiP2_Minimize_Drag.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141684" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google notes that today&#8217;s release is meant to make meetings &#8220;more immersive, inclusive and productive.&#8221; The new UI doesn&#8217;t look to be a radical change, but it puts more of the controls and features right at your fingertips instead of hiding them in a menu. It also consolidates them in the bottom row instead of the current system that spreads out features between the main menu bar and an additional small menu at the top.</p>
<p>For presenters who don&#8217;t want to see themselves on the screen, Meet now also lets you minimize or completely hide your own video feed &#8212; and if you really want to glance into your own eyes, you can also pin your feed to the rest of the grid. Google says it also plans to soon let you turn off your self-feed across all Meet calls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG_Pin_preso_5fps.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141713" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG_Pin_preso_5fps.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Talking about pinning, one feature that seems especially useful is the ability to highlight multiple feeds. This new multipinning capability will make it easier to focus on the participants in a chat that are most active, for example. This feature will roll out in the coming months.</p>
<p>And coming in a few months, some of those highlighted feeds may look a bit more interesting (or annoying, depending on your point of view) because one new feature Google has planned &#8212; but isn&#8217;t ready to roll out yet &#8212; is video background replacement. For now, Google will only offer three scenes: a classroom, a party and a forest. The company says more will follow, but it doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;ll be able to bring your own videos to this feature anytime soon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141710" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG__just_placed-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141710" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141710" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG__just_placed-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141710" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other new features in this release include Meet&#8217;s capability to automatically spruce up your video feed a bit to make sure you&#8217;re more visible in a dark environment and enhance your video when you are sitting in front of a bright background. This will roll out in the coming weeks. There&#8217;s also autozoom, which uses AI to automatically zoom in on you and put you in the middle of your frame. That&#8217;s coming to paid Google Workspace subscribers in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the words of co-founder and CEO Jonathan Shambroom, <a href="https://www.creatorplus.com">Creator+</a> is a new startup that will &#8220;finance, produce and distribute feature-length films from today&#8217;s top creators and emerging storytellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is coming out of stealth today and also announcing that it has raised $12 million in funding led by Petra Group and Freestyle Capital, with participation from Jake Roper, Peter Hollens, Wendy Ayche (aka Wengie), Selina Tobaccowala, Jazwares CEO Judd Zebersky and others.</p>
<p>Shambroom (who&#8217;s been an executive at numerous startups and also served as general manager at Crackle) told me that one of the key aspects of the Creator+ strategy is that it controls &#8220;both sides of the equation&#8221; — it&#8217;s both producing films and building its own streaming platform, where the movies will be available for individual purchase, with no subscriptions and no ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that allows the startup to control costs and distribution, but it also &#8220;enables us to do something brand new with creators,&#8221; giving them a 50-50 split on revenue, as well as sharing audience data and ownership of the intellectual property.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creator&#8221; is a term that gets used pretty broadly, and Creator+ isn&#8217;t announcing any specific deals today. But co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Benjamin Grubbs (who previously led creator partnerships at YouTube) told me the company is initially focused on &#8220;storytellers and artists.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4flKgWJgdP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/next-10-ventures/">Former YouTube exec unveils Next 10 Ventures, a $50M fund to back online creators</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former YouTube exec unveils Next 10 Ventures, a $50M fund to back online creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/next-10-ventures/embed/#?secret=4flKgWJgdP" data-secret="4flKgWJgdP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that there are a lot of gifted storytellers on some of these large, open, ad-supported platforms where they already reach large audiences and fan bases,&#8221; Grubbs said. &#8220;But there are constraints, whether that’s time-based or economic, on the types of stories that you can actually tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Creator+ will allow those creators to break free of some of those constraints, making feature films with budgets in the low seven figures. Shambroom said the startup wants to deliver &#8220;what people expect in a film, 90 minutes give-or-take … in many of the genres that exist today&#8221; while also allowing creators to experiment with new formats and new production technologies. In some cases, these movies could be a creator&#8217;s &#8220;passion project,&#8221; while in other cases Creator+ could match them up with the right script.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a multitude of roles and opportunities for creators, both in front of or behind the camera,&#8221; Grubbs added.</p>
<p>Creator+ plans to put between five and 10 films into production this year, with the first titles released in 2022. Shambroom said it&#8217;s committed to supporting underrepresented storytellers and has already hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benokeefe/">Ben O&#8217;Keefe</a> as its head of diversity and impact. The team also has global ambitions, which is why they brought on international investors, including Malaysia-based Petra Group.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The tidal wave of growth is upon us — an unprecedented economic boom that will manifest later this year, bringing significant investments, acquisitions and customer growth. But most tech companies and startups are not adequately prepared to capitalize on the opportunity that lies ahead.</p>
<p>Here’s how marketing in tech will shift — and what you need to know to reach more customers and accelerate growth in 2021.</p>
<p>First and foremost, differentiation is going to be imperative. It’s already hard enough to stand out and get noticed, and it’s about to get much more difficult as new companies emerge and investments and budgets balloon in the latter half of the year. Virtually all major companies are increasing budgets to pre-pandemic levels, but will delay those investments until the second half of the year. This will result in an increased intensity of competition that will drown out any undifferentiated players.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The second half of 2021 will bring incredible growth, the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Additionally, tech companies need to be mindful not to ignore the most important part of the ecosystem: people. Technology will only take you so far, and it’s not going to be enough to survive the competition. Marketing is about people, including your customers, team, partners, investors and the broader community.</p>
<p>Understanding who your people are and how you can use their help to build a strong foundation and drive exponential growth is essential.</p>
<p>Tactically, the most successful tech companies will embrace video and experimentation in their marketing — two components that will catapult them ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Ignoring these predictions, backed by empirical evidence, will be detrimental and devastating. Fasten your seatbelts: 2021 is going to be a turbocharged year of growth opportunities for marketing in tech.</p>
<h2>Differentiation is crucial</h2>
<p>The explosion of tech companies and startups seeking to be the next big thing isn&#8217;t over yet. However, many of them are indistinguishable from each other and lack a compelling value proposition. Just one look at the websites of new and existing tech companies will reveal a proliferation of buzzwords and conceptual illustrations, leaving them all looking and sounding alike.</p>
<p>The tech companies that succeed are those that embrace one of the fundamentals of effective marketing — positioning.</p>
