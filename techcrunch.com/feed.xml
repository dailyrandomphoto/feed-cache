					<description><![CDATA[The dashboard enables businesses to automatically store, ship and retrieve employee computers in a way that is remote and hands-free.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rippling.com/hardware">Rippling</a>, a startup building a platform to manage all aspects of employee data, from payroll and benefits through to device management, launched Rippling Inventory Management, what founder and CEO Parker Conrad is touting as the “world’s first cloud IT closet.”</p>
<p>The dashboard enables businesses to automatically store, ship and retrieve employee computers in a way that is remote and hands-free. Rippling stores and monitors company devices so they no longer need an “IT closet” on-site or utilize an employee’s home. Rippling also manages the logistics related to the devices, including wiping and assigning devices and issuing prepaid mailers for machines that need to be returned.</p>
<p>Customers pay a per employee, per month fee to use the dashboard to hire, or fire employees, and set up all of the apps (and access) that the employee will need on their computer. In addition, the user can see all of the outstanding shipments and where they are in the process of being delivered or returned.</p>
<p>The product launch is buoyed by a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/rippling-nabs-145m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-build-out-its-all-in-one-platform-for-employee-data/">$145 million Series B round in 2020 </a>that gave the company a valuation of $1.35 billion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rippling-invmgmt-shippedbox.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="364" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205113" class="wp-caption-text">Rippling inventory management gif. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rippling</p></div></p>
<p>The inventory management platform stems from a problem Rippling saw as remote work became more prevalent over the past 18 months, Conrad told TechCrunch. The company itself used to have an IT closet, which he considers “the last physical part about managing employees.”</p>
<p>“What this does is kill the IT closet,” he added. “If you don’t work in an office and decide to leave, some companies don’t have a process on how to get the former employee’s device back. We had a situation ourselves where employees would ship computers back to one person, and she had them stacked up in her apartment.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The leadership team spent a long time looking for an inventory management service, and also saw customers posting about it on social media. However, Conrad considers this a problem that didn’t really exist until March 2020.</p>
<p>He explained that with the exception of a few outlier companies, most were not remote and physically handed a computer to new employees or gathered them from the desk of someone who left. Once they were remote, it was difficult to keep track of who had which device and how to get them back if needed.</p>
<p>“Everyone can be done online now, and you don’t have to come into the office to sign paperwork,” Conrad said. “This is the last piece that companies need and works to solve the last-mile problem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s iPhone review goes back to Disneyland for the first time in a couple of years for, uh, obvious reasons. I’m happy to report that the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 performed extremely well and the limited testing I was able to do on the iPhone mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max showed that for the first time you’re able to make a pretty easy choice based on size once you’ve decided you’re ok without telephoto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major reasons I keep bringing these iPhones back to Disneyland is that it’s pretty much the perfect place to test the improvements Apple claims it is making in an intense real-world setting. It’s typically hot, the network environment is atrocious, you have to use your phone for almost everything these days from pictures to ticket scanning to food ordering and you’re usually there as long as you can to get the most out of your buck. It’s the ideal stress test that doesn’t involve artificial battery rundowns or controlled photo environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my testing, most of Apple’s improvements actually had a visible impact on the quality of life of my trip, though in some cases not massive. Screen brightness, the longer telephoto and battery life were all bright spots.</span></p>
<p><b>Performance and battery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery of the iPhone 13 Pro hit just over the 13 hour mark in the parks for me running it right to the dregs. Since there was so much video testing this year, the camera app did stay on screen longer than usual at just over 1hr of active ‘on screen’ usage which does put a bit of a strain on the system. I’d say that in real-world standard use you’ll probably get a bit more than that out of it so I’m comfortable saying that Apple’s estimate of an hour or more longer video playback time from the iPhone 12 Pro is probably pretty accurate. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205847" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it was hard to get the same level of stress on the iPhone 13 Pro Max during my tests, I’d say you can expect even more battery life out of it, given the surplus it still had when my iPhone 13 Pro needed charging. Bigger battery, more battery life, not a big shock.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using it in the parks and doing the rope drop I’d say I would plan on taking it off the charger at 6am or so and plan to have a charger handy by about 4pm so you don’t go dead. That’s not a bad run overall for an iPhone in challenging conditions and with heavy camera use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s new ProMotion display was a nice upgrade as well, and I did notice the increased screen brightness. Typically the bump in brightness was only truly noticeable side-by-side with an iPhone 12 Pro with high-key content displayed on the screen. Popping open the Disneyland app for the barcode meant a bit better consistency in scanning (though that’s pretty hard to say for sure) and a visual increase in overall brightness in direct sun. Out of the Sun I’d say you’d be hard pressed to tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variable refresh rate of the ProMotion screen cranking all the way up to 120hz while scrolling Safari is a really nice quality of life improvement. I’m unfortunately a bit jaded in this department because I’ve done a ton of my computing on the iPad Pro for the past couple of years, but it’s going to be an amazing bump for iPhone users that haven’t experienced it. Because Apple’s system is not locked at 120hz, it allows them to conserve battery life by slowing down the screen’s refresh rate when viewing static content like photos or text when not scrolling. I’m happy to say that I did not see any significant ramping while scrolling, so it’s really responsive and seamless in its handling of this variability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new A15 chip is, yes, more powerful than last year. Here’s some numbers if that’s your sort of thing:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205784" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png 1488w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressive as hell, especially for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more battery life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The power-per-watt performance of Apple’s devices continues to be the (relatively) un-sung victory of its chips department. It’s not just that this year’s iPhones or the M1 laptops are crazy fast, it’s that they’re also actually usable for enormous amounts of time not connected to a charger. For those curious, the iPhone 12 Pro appears to have 6GB of RAM. </span></p>
<p><b>Design</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205845" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design of the iPhone continues to be driven by the camera and radio. Whatever is necessary to support the sensors and lenses of the camera package and whatever is necessary to ensure that the antennas can accommodate 5G are in control of the wheel at this point in the iPhone’s life, and that’s pretty natural. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera array on the back of the iPhone 13 Pro is bigger and taller in order to accommodate the three new cameras Apple has installed here. And I do mean bigger, like 40% bigger overall with taller arrays. Apple’s new cases now have a very noticeable raised ridge that exists to protect the lenses when you’re setting the case down on a surface. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything else is sort of built around the camera and the need for wireless charging and radio performance. But Apple’s frosted glass and steel rim look retains its jewel-like quality this year and they’re still really good looking phones. I doubt the vast majority of people will see them long without a case but while you do they’re nice looking phones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The front notch has been pared down slightly due to improvements in camera packaging, which leaves a tiny bit more screen real-estate for things like videos, but we’ll have to wait to see if developers find clever ways to use the extra pixels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, on to the cameras.</span></p>
<p><b>Cameras</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems impossible that Apple continues to make year-over-year improvements that genuinely improve your optionality and quality of images that are enough to matter. And yet. The camera quality and features are a very real jump from the iPhone 11 Pro across the board and still a noticeable improvement from the iPhone 12 Pro for you early adopters. Anything older and you’re going to get a blast of quality right to the face that you’re going to love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera packaging and feature set is also more uniform across the lineup than ever before with Apple’s IBIS in camera sensor shift stabilization system appearing in every model &#8212; even the iPhone 13 mini which is a crazy achievement given the overall package size of this sensor array.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my experience in the parks this year, Apple’s improvements to cameras made for a material difference no matter which lens I chose. From low light to long zoom, there’s something to love here for every avid photographer. Oh, and that Cinematic Mode, we’ll talk about that too. </span></p>
<p><b>Telephoto</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all of the lenses I expected improvement from, the telephoto was actually not that high on my list. But I was pleasantly surprised by the increased range and utility of this lens. I am an admitted telephoto addict, with some 60% of my photos on iPhone 12 Pro taken with the tele lens over the wide. I just prefer the ability to pick and choose my framing more closely without having to crop after the fact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Night Mode on the telephoto now means that it doesn’t fall back to the wide lens with crop in dark conditions as it used to. Now you get that native telephoto optics plus the Night Mode magic. This means much better black points and great overall exposure even hand held at zoom &#8212; something that felt just completely out of reach a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the higher zoom level, portraits are cropped tighter, with better organic non-portrait-mode bokeh which is lovely. With this new lens you’re going to be able to shoot better looking images of people, period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a camera person, the 3x reminds me a lot of my favorite 105mm fixed portrait lens. It’s got the crop, it’s got the nice background separation and the optical quality is very, very good on this lens package. Apple knocked it out of the park on the tele this time around. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205813" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longer optical range was also very handy in a Disneyland world where performers are often kept separate from guests &#8212; sometimes for effect but mostly because of pandemic precautions. Being able to reach out and get that shot of Kylo Ren hyping up the crowd was a fun thing to be enabled to do.</span></p>
<p><b>Wide</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s wide lens gets the biggest overall jump in sensor technology. A larger ƒ/1.5 aperture and new 1.9µm pixels roughly doubles the light gathering &#8212; and it shows. Images at night and inside ride buildings had a marked improvement in overall quality due to deeper blacks and better dynamic range. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Night Mode enabled, the deeper light gathering range and improved Smart HDR 4 makes for deeper blacks and a less washed out appearance. If I had to characterize it, it would be ‘more natural’ overall &#8212; a theme I’ve seen play out across the iPhone cameras this time around. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205830" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without Night Mode enabled, the raw improvement in image quality due to more light being captured is immediately evident. Though I think there are few situations where you need to turn off Night Mode any more, subjects in motion in low light are one of those and you’ll get a few inches extra of wiggle room with this new sensor and lens combo in those instances. </span></p>
<p>Having sensor shift OIS come to the wide on the iPhone 13 across the range is a huge godsend to both still shots and video. Though I&#8217;m spoiled having been able to play with the iPhone 12 Pro Max&#8217;s stabilization, if you haven&#8217;t shot with it before you&#8217;re going to be incredibly happy with the additional levels of sharpness it brings.</p>
<p><b>Ultra Wide</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s ultra wide camera has been in need of some love for a while. Though it offered a nice additional perspective, it has suffered from a lack of auto-focus and sub-par light gathering ability since its release. This time around it gets both a larger ƒ/1.8 aperture and autofocus. Apple claims 92% more light gathering and my testing in pretty rough lighting conditions shows a massive improvement across the board. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically at Disneyland I like to shoot the wide in one of two ways: up close to create a fisheye-type perspective for portraits or to snag a vista when the lighting or scene setting is especially good. Having auto focus available improves the first a ton and the wider aperture gives the second a big boost too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out these shots of a moonlit Trader Sam’s, a snap that you might grab because the lighting and scenery are just right. The iPhone 12 Pro isn’t bad at all here but there is an actually quite clear difference between the two in exposure. Both of these were taken with Night Mode disabled in order to compare the raw improvement in aperture.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205857" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delta is clear, and I’m pretty impressed in general with how much Apple keeps improving this ultra wide camera, though it seems clear at this point that we’re hitting the upper limits of what a 12MP sensor at this size can bring to a lens with such a wide POV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new ISP also improves Night Mode shooting here too &#8212; and with a bit more raw range to work with given the wider aperture, your night mode shots lose even more of that bright candy-like look and get a deeper and more organic feeling. </span></p>
<p><b>Macro photos and video</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another new shooting possibility presented by the iPhone 13 Pro is a pretty impressive macro mode that can shoot as close as 2cm. It’s really, really well done given that it’s being implemented in a super wide lens on a smartphone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to shoot incredibly detailed snaps very, very close-up. We’re talking ‘the surface texture of objects’ close; ‘pollen hanging off a bee’s thorax’ close; dew&#8230;well you get the idea. It’s close, and it’s a nice tool to have without having to carry a macro attachment with you. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-large wp-image-2205809" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0166-rotated.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found the sharpness and clarity of the macro images I captured to be excellent within the rough 40% area that comprised the center of the capture area. Due to the fact that the macro mode is on the ultra wide, there is a significant amount of chromatic aberration around the edges of the image. Basically, the lens is so curved you get a bit of separation between wavelengths of light coming in at oblique angles, leading to a rainbow effect. This is only truly visible at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> close distances at the minimum of the focal range. If you’re a few cm away you’ll notice and you’ll probably crop it out or live with it. If you’re further away getting a ‘medium macro’ at 10cm or whatever you’ll likely not notice it much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a separate factor from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slim field-of-focus that is absolutely standard with all macro lenses. You’re going to have to be precise at maximum macro, basically, but that’s nothing new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how large scale Disneyland is I actually had to actively seek out ways to use the macro, though I’d imagine it would be useful in more ways in other venues. But I still got cool shots of textures in the bottles in Radiator Springs and some faux fungi at Galaxy’s Edge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macro video is similarly fun but requires extremely stable hands or a tripod to really take advantage of given that the slightest movement of your hands is going to move the camera a massive amount of distance proportional to the focal area. Basically, tiny hand moves, big camera moves in this mode. But it’s a super fun tool to add to your arsenal and I had fun chasing bugs around some flower petals in the garden of the Grand Californian hotel with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2205817" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4AF9D56D-7240-4737-B2AB-38FDA41E04C2_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></a>As a way to go from world scale down to fine detail it’s a great way to mix up your shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting quirk of the ultra wide camera being the home of macro on iPhone 13 Pro is that there is a noticeable transition between the wide and ultra-wide cameras as you move into macro range. This presents as a quick-shift image transition where you can see one camera clicking off and the other one turning on &#8212; something that was pretty much never obvious in other scenarios even though the cameras switch all the time depending on lighting conditions and imaging judgement calls made by the iPhone’s camera stack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users typically never notice this at all, but given that there is now an official macro camera available when you swoop in close to an object while you’re on 1x then it’s going to flip over to the .5x mode in order to let you shoot super close. This is all totally fine, by the way, but can result in a bit of flutter if you’re moving in and out of range with the cameras continuously switching as you enter and exit ‘macro distance’ (around 10-15cm). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I queried about this camera switching behavior, Apple said that “a new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances for macro photography and video.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should solve this relatively small quirk for people who want to work specifically at the macro range. </span></p>
<p><b>Photographic Styles and Smart HDR 4</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the constant tensions with Apple’s approach to computational photography has been its general leaning towards the conservative when it comes to highly processed images. Simply put, Apple likes its images to look ‘natural’, where other similar systems from competitors like Google or Samsung have made different choices in order to differentiate and create ‘punchier’ and sometimes just generally brighter images. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did some </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/iphone-11-pro-disney-after-dark/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comparisons of these approaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back when Apple introduced Night Mode two years ago.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general idea hasn’t changed much even with Apple’s new launches this year, they’re still hewing to nature as a guiding principle. But now they’ve introduced Photographic Styles in order to give you the option of cranking two controls they’re calling Tone and Warmth. These are basically vibrance and color temperature (but only generally). You can choose from 5 presets including no adjustments or you can adjust the two settings on any of the presets on a scale of -100 to +100. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would assume that long term people will play with these and recommendations will get passed around on how to get a certain look. My general favorite of these is vibrant because I like the open shadows and mid-tone pop. Though I would assume a lot of folks will gravitate towards Rich Contrast because more contrast is generally more pleasing to the human eye. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="940" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg 2232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=768,705 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=1536,1409 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=2048,1879 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this shot of some kid-sized speeders, you can see the effects on the shadows and midtones as well as the overall color temperature. Rather than being a situational filter, I view this as a deep ‘camera setting’ feature, much like choosing the type of film that you wanted to roll with in a film camera. For more contrast you might choose a Kodak Ektachrome, for cooler-to-neutral colors perhaps a Fuji, for warm skin tones perhaps a Kodak Portra and for boosted color maybe an Ultramax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This setting gives you the option to set up your camera the way you want the color to sit in a similar way. The setting is then retained when you close camera.app. This way when you open it, it’s set to shoot the way you want it to. This goes for the vast majority of camera settings now under iOS 15, which is a nice quality of life improvement over the old days when the iPhone camera reset itself every time you opened it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that these color settings are ‘imbedded’ in the image, which means they are not adjustable afterwards like Portrait Mode’s lighting scenarios. They are also not enabled during RAW &#8212; which makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart HDR4 also deserves a mention here because it’s now doing an additional bit of smart segmentation based on subjects in the frame. In a situation with a backlit group of people, for instance, the new ISP is going to segment out each of those subjects individually and apply color profiles, exposure, white balance and other adjustments to them &#8212; all in real time. This makes for a marked improvement in dark-to-light scenarios like shooting out of windows and shooting into the sun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would not expect much improvement out of the selfie camera this year, it’s just much the same as normal. Though you can use Cinematic Mode on it which is fun if not that useful in selfie modes.</span></p>
<p><b>Cinematic Mode</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an experimental mode that has been shipped live to the public. That’s the best way to set the scene for those folks looking to dive into it. Contrary to Apple’s general marketing, this won’t yet replace any real camera rack focus setup on a film set, but it does open up a huge toolset for budding filmmakers and casual users that was previously locked behind a lot of doors made up of cameras, lenses and equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinematic Mode uses the camera’s depth information, the accelerometer and other signals to craft a video that injects synthetic bokeh (blur) and tracks subjects in the frame to intelligently ‘rack’ focus between them depending on what it thinks you want. There is also some impressive focus tracking features built in that allow you to lock onto a subject and follow them in a ‘tracking shot’ which can keep them in focus through obstacles like crowds, railings and water. I found all of these depth-leveraging features that did tracking to be incredibly impressive in my early testing, but they were often let down a bit by the segmentation masking that struggled to define crisp, clear borders around subjects to separate them from the background. It turns out that doing what portrait mode does with a still image is just insanely hard to do 30 times a second with complex, confusing backgrounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature is locked to 1080p/30fps which says a lot about its intended use. This is for family shots presented on the device, AirPlayed to your TV or posted on the web. I’d imagine that this will actually get huge uptake with the TikTok filmmaker crowd who will do cool stuff with the new storytelling tools of selective focus.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cinematic.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205890" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cinematic.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did some test shooting with my kids walking through crowds and riding on carousels that was genuinely, shockingly good. It really does provide a filmic, dreamy quality to the video that I was previously only able to get with quick and continuous focus adjustments on an SLR shooting video with a manually focused lens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, I think, is the major key to understanding Cinematic Mode. Despite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new creative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who have no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to stabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of tracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just inaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing to experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be rewarded with some great looking shots to add to their iPhone memories widget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be writing more about this feature later this week so stay tuned. For now, what you need to know is that an average person can whip this out in bright light and get some pretty fun and impressive results, but it is not a serious professional tool, yet. And even if you miss focus on a particular subject you are able to adjust that in post with a quick tap of the edit button and a tap on a subject &#8212; as long as it&#8217;s within the focal range of the lens. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RPReplay_Final1631944407.2021-09-21-07_59_49.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignright size-large wp-image-2205792" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RPReplay_Final1631944407.2021-09-21-07_59_49.gif?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a filmmaking tool for the run and gun generation it’s a pretty compelling concept. The fact is that it allows people to spend less time and less technical energy on the mechanics of filmmaking and more time on the storytelling part. Moviemaking has always been an art that is intertwined with technology — and one of the true exemplars of the ideal that artists are always the first to adopt new technology and push it to its early limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Apple’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/hands-on-with-the-iphone-7-plus-crazy-new-portrait-mode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">portrait mode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has improved massively over the past 6 years, I expect Cinematic Mode to keep growing and improving. The relatively sketchy performance in low light and the locked zoom are high on my list to see bumps next year, as is improved segmentation. It’s an impressive technical feat that Apple is able to deliver this kind of slicing and adjustment not only in real-time preview but also in post-shooting editing modes, and I’m looking forward to seeing it evolve. </span></p>
<p><b>Assessment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great update that improves user experience in every way, even during an intense day-long Disneyland outing. The improved brightness and screen refresh means easier navigation of park systems and better visibility in daylight for directions and wait times and more. The better cameras mean you’re getting improved shots in dark-to-light situations like waiting in lines or shooting from under overhangs. The nice new telephoto lets you shoot close-up shots of cast members who are now often separated from the crowds by large distances, which is cool &#8212; and as a bonus acts as a really lovely portrait lens even while not in Portrait mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall this was one of the best experiences I’ve had testing a phone at the parks, with a continuous series of ‘wow’ moments with the cameras that sort of made me question my confirmation bias. I ended up with a lot of shots like the night mode wide angle and telephoto ones I shared above that impressed me so much I ended up doing a lot of gut checking asking other people in blind tests what they thought of the two images. Each time I did so the clear winner was the iPhone 13 &#8212; it really is just a clear cut improvement in image making across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the package is pretty well turned out here too, with massive performance gains in the A15 Bionic with not only no discernable impact on battery life but a good extra hour to boot. The performance chart above may give the wow factor but that performance charted on the power usage of the chip across a day is what continues to be the most impressive feat of Apple’s chip teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iPhones 13 are an impressive field this year, providing a solid moat of image quality, battery life and now, thankfully, screen improvements that should serve Apple well over the next 12 months.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turns out COVID-19 lockdowns have been good for the indoor hobby of hardware hacking: The U.K.-based foundation behind the low-price microprocessor Raspberry Pi announced close of a $45 million funding round yesterday.</p>
<p>The cash injection into the trading arm of the (nonprofit) Raspberry Pi Foundation values it at $500 million (pre-money), founder Eben Upton confirmed.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by London-based Lansdowne Partners and The Ezrah Charitable Trust, a private charitable foundation based in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to welcome Lansdowne Partners and The Ezrah Charitable Trust as our first outside shareholders to help us achieve the next steps in our growth,&#8221; said Upton in a statement. &#8220;We are seeing strong demand from consumers as they use our PCs to access the internet for work and entertainment, and even faster growth from industrial companies globally as they design Raspberry Pi into their innovative IoT applications. This funding will enable us to scale to meet future demand.</p>
<p>“Our new investors will not only add value to our strategy and help support our growth but they also understand the rationale and ethos of our business model, aimed at enabling access to hardware and software tools for everyone and delivering a consumer PC experience from only $35 as well as building partnerships with a growing range of OEMs across the world.”</p>
<p>The Pi Foundation said the financing will be used to expand what is already an ample product line of Pi microprocessors.</p>

<p>Spending on marketing is also planned, across both the consumer (&#8220;build it yourself&#8221; PC) and industrial (IoT) sectors.</p>
<p>Its trading arm ships 7 million+ devices a year at this point.</p>
<p>While, in total, the Pi Foundation also said it&#8217;s shipping over 42 million (Pi-powered) PCs to more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly saw increased interest in Raspberry Pi during lockdown,&#8221; Upton told TechCrunch. &#8220;It was satisfying to be able to supply units to young people who needed machines to study from home on, and we had some great philanthropic support (notably from the Bloomfield Trust) to roll kits out to disadvantaged young people in the U.K.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our current sustained increase in demand is driven primarily by industrial customers as the economy rebounds from COVID-19,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term the focus is on investing in manufacturing and supply chain to meet demand,&#8221; he also said, expanding on the plan for the funding. &#8220;In the longer term, this funding is going to allow us to invest more in product development: As our products become more sophisticated, they become much more expensive and time-consuming to develop, so being able to hire more engineers is a key driver of future growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a supporting statement, Peter Davies of Lansdowne Partners, added: “We are very excited to be investing with Raspberry Pi, an organisation we have followed and admired for many years. The commercial and human impact it has achieved in its first decade has been extraordinary and we look forward to assisting the company to expand this even further in coming years as new capital is deployed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.just.insure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Insure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pay-per-mile insurance technology company, has raised $8 million in a funding round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrossCut Ventures, ManchesterStory and Western Technology Investments co-led the investment, which brings its total raised to $15.3 million since its January 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles-based Just says it uses telematics “to reward safe drivers and reduce insurer bias” by looking at factors such as how, when and where customers drive, rather than factors such as ZIP code or marital status as most traditional insurers do. Or put more simply, it charges customers only for miles driven and its rates vary based on driving behavior. This way, Just says it’s able to offer lower rates for “safer drivers,” and it claims to save its customers around 40% from their “previous auto insurance company.” For now, it’s only available in Arizona, although the company plans to expand to other markets such as Texas, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Georgia.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205365" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205365" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2205365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg 1946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Just-Homescreen-2.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205365" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Just Insure</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Just is not the first company to offer personalized auto insurance. There’s Metromile, which launched its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized pay-per-mile auto insurance in 2012. And there’s also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/10/public-investors-stay-in-love-with-tech-as-root-and-affirm-file-to-ipo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Ohio-based car insurance startup that uses smartpho</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ne technology to understand individual driver behavior. Although there are similarities between Root and Just, there are also distinct differences, according to founder and CEO Robert Smithson.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<p>Root charges customers a monthly fee, and when policies are renewed, the rate is subject to change based on driving behavior. Just has a similar model. If its drivers exhibits safe driving behavior, their rates can fall. On the other hand, if they exhibit dangerous behavior, their rates can rise. But unlike Root, Smithson said, Just only charges its &#8220;liability only&#8221; customers for miles driven. There is no monthly fee. For &#8220;full cover&#8221; customers, Just also includes a &#8220;small daily charge&#8221; to reflect the risk that someone could steal their car. For its part, MetroMile charges customers a base rate <em>plus</em> a per mile rate. Neither rate are affected by how a person drives, notes Smithson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [Just] per mile price that a customer gets can change every month. This means we&#8217;re able to rapidly reward safe drivers with lower rates, and to increase them for those who drive less well,&#8221; Smithson said. &#8220;This rapid feedback loop encourages people to make smarter driving decisions. And it means that our customers have fewer accidents, and we do better. &#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>In 2020, Root had a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/d768cb47-df9e-4d14-8711-ea814a2de5e0)%7C">direct loss ratio of 82%</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Just&#8217;s direct loss ratio is 65.8% year to date so far. But of course, it has far fewer customers and is only serving one market. Still, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">company says that it has already achieved underwriting profitability in terms of what portion of premium to it pays out in claims.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
<p>Also, with so many people shifting to working from home over the last year, Just says it has seen increased demand this year. It issued over 1,000 new policies in the second quarter, up “tenfold” compared<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same period in 2020. The startup said during that same time, its revenue climbed 1,400% compared to the second quarter of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“People are simply driving less as a result of increased work-from-home rates, and this isn’t changing anytime soon,&#8221; Smithson said. &#8220;Our approach enables us to offer customers rates that are truly reflective of their driving.”</p>
<p>The company likens its user experience to that of a prepaid phone card. Just customers can “load up” their account for $30 for minimum liability-only coverage and <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$75 for full coverage to start driving.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The company&#8217;s</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> insurance policy is for 30 days.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So as customers drive, their balance declines. Every 30 days, the company changes each customer’s price as it gathers more data about their driving habits.</span></p>

<p>It’s an approach that Matt Kinley, co-founder and managing partner at ManchesterStory, had never before seen.</p>
<p>“It is more fair, affordable and customized across the board, and unique because the company offers customers rates that are actually reflective of their driving, which rewards safe drivers with lower insurance premiums,” he said.</p>
<p>The company plans to use its new capital in part to do some hiring &#8212; it currently has a staff of 35 &#8212; and scale its product offering. It is also planning to launch beyond Arizona into neighboring states. In particular, Smithson said the startup is “keen” to launch in Texas.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden has pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. He intends to meet this ambitious target through a wave of new federal spending and government programs.</p>
<p>But our best hope for reducing carbon emissions isn&#8217;t new government spending. It&#8217;s a technological sea change &#8212; one that can only come from the private sector.</p>
<p>In fact, the government is slowing progress against climate change by imposing regulations that prevent emissions-lowering technologies from reaching the market. If our leaders really want to save the planet, they need to get out of the way of entrepreneurs who can actually do so.</p>
<p>One would expect the government to embrace technology with the potential to cut carbon pollution. After all, Biden himself has promised to &#8220;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/">spur American technological innovations</a>&#8221; as part of his climate agenda.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the most promising green tech breakthroughs face severe headwinds as a result of misguided or antiquated federal policies.</p>
<p>One such technology &#8212; profiled in &#8220;<a href="https://www.theysayitcantbedone.com/">They Say It Can&#8217;t Be Done</a>,&#8221; a new documentary on the relationship between innovators and regulations &#8212; is <a href="https://climatechange.medill.northwestern.edu/2016/11/29/artificial-trees-might-be-needed-to-offset-carbon-dioxide-emissions/">an artificial tree</a> developed by Arizona State University physicist and engineer Klaus Lackner. These man-made trees contain a special plastic resin that can absorb carbon dioxide and release it when submerged in water. They&#8217;re 1,000 times more effective at taking in carbon dioxide from the air than natural trees. Once captured, this carbon dioxide can then be reclaimed and converted into fuel.</p>
<p>Lackner&#8217;s design could be scaled to produce units that each remove a metric ton of carbon dioxide daily. The main stumbling block is <a href="https://www.onlocationinc.com/blog/regulatory-hurdles-of-a-revolutionary-technology-to-fight-climate-change">the lack of clear regulations</a> surrounding carbon capture technologies &#8212; specifically the transport and storage of captured carbon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Until a uniform federal framework exists, the process of bringing this technology to market will remain impossibly complicated and <a href="https://lawliberty.org/innovation-in-a-regulatory-labyrinth/">fraught with risk</a>.</p>
<p>Or consider technologies that could reduce the need for large-scale livestock farming. Raising billions of chickens, pigs and cattle requires vast amounts of water, feed and land. The resulting carbon footprint is massive &#8212; about <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/">7.1 gigatons of greenhouse gases a year</a>.</p>
<p>Here too, new technologies could help reduce emissions. Researchers are designing cell-cultured meat &#8212; chicken, pork and beef produced in the lab rather than the feedlot. This <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sustainability_cultivated_meat.pdf">lab-grown protein</a> is safe, healthy and far less carbon-intensive than traditionally farmed meat.</p>
<p>One startup that makes lab-grown meat, Eat Just, recently obtained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/eat-just-to-sell-lab-grown-meat-in-singapore-after-gaining-world-first-regulatory-approval/">approval</a> to sell its cell-cultured chicken in Singapore. But it&#8217;s still waiting on the green light from U.S. regulators. <a href="https://thespoon.tech/eat-justs-josh-tetrick-on-what-it-will-take-to-normalize-the-concept-of-cultured-meat/">According to the firm&#8217;s founder</a>, it could be another year &#8212; or more &#8212; before U.S. approval comes through.</p>
<p>For an industry as capital-intensive as cultured meat production, this sluggish approval process can make it impossible for a startup to launch and get its products to market.</p>
<p>High-tech solutions like these are precisely what&#8217;s required to protect our planet from the threat of climate change. While it is impossible to say whether lab-grown meat is the future of sustainable food or if artificial trees are the best solution for sequestering atmospheric carbon, an accessible and level regulatory playing field allows the best innovations to thrive.</p>
<p>Too many Americans believe that when it comes to climate change, only the government is up to the task. The fact is, the main barrier to large-scale adoption of sustainable technologies isn&#8217;t a lack of government involvement, but too much &#8212; or at least the wrong kind.</p>
<p>In order to make good on his promise to reduce the nation&#8217;s carbon footprint, the president and his team will need to recognize how government obstructs the development and deployment of technology that can fulfill that promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber said Tuesday that it could hit one measure of profitability in the third quarter, earlier than expected, as the ride-hailing company saw gains in its delivery and mobility businesses. The ride-hailing service <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/d6f5405e-e252-4c03-bdc4-d8899e94d535.pdf">told regulators in a filing this morning</a> that it anticipated an increase in gross bookings and stronger adjusted EBITDA in the quarter than it had forecasted for shareholders in its last investor presentation.</p>
<p>The company now anticipates gross bookings for the current quarter to land between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion, up from an initially promised $22 billion to $24 billion range. The company&#8217;s forecasted adjusted EBITDA, an accommodating method of calculating profit, was also raised to between -$25 million and $25 million in the quarter ending September 30, and improvement from the company&#8217;s previous anticipation of a result merely “better than a loss of $100 million.”</p>
<p>“They say that crisis breeds opportunity and that’s certainly been true of Uber during the last 18 months,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Uber is now on track to adjusted EBITDA breakeven in quarter three, CFO Nelson Chai said &#8212; an achievement that may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the economics of ride-hailing, which is characterized by perilous unprofitability.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch’s Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">explains</a> for Extra Crunch, “adjusted EBITDA” is a way of calculating profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and other costs. Consider, for example, that Uber lost $6.77 billion in 2020 (admittedly an improvement from its previous yearly loss of $8.51 billion). But under adjusted EBIDTA accounting, those numbers dropped to losses of $2.73 billion and $2.53 billion, respectively.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rlDVaX48i2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">Will ride-hailing profits ever come?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will ride-hailing profits ever come?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/embed/#?secret=rlDVaX48i2" data-secret="rlDVaX48i2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Uber did not provide a full picture of its financials for the third quarter in its recent 8-K filing &#8212; that will come when the company reports its performance after the conclusion of Q3. However, it looks like the company may reach positive adjusted EBITDA by the fourth quarter, meeting a long-held promise to investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ride-hailing giant further noted that its fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is projected to land between $0 and $100 million, compared to the previously anticipated, and more generic, expectation of merely “adjusted EBITDA profitability.” Uber cautioned that &#8220;significant forecasting uncertainty&#8221; may cause it to provide an updated forecast.</p>
<p>Still, for Uber the long march to adjusted profitability appears to finally be in sight. All it took was a global pandemic, layoffs and far-higher prices for the achievement to be managed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">the first day of Disrupt</a>, so things are a bit busy here at TechCrunch. In honor of that fact, entries from The Exchange concerning NFT volume viz recent marketplace valuations and how an accelerating pace of change helps startups by exposing more market voids will have to wait.</p>
<p>But we do have time this morning for a little incredulity, so let&#8217;s indulge.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/klarna-ceo-market-volatility-has-me-nervous-about-an-ipo.html">reported</a> today that <a href="https://twitter.com/klarnaseb">Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski</a> is not enthused about present-day market conditions, and thus isn&#8217;t in a hurry to take his company public.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some merit to the idea; after all, Klarna has shown a strong ability to raise huge sums of capital while private.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why not just keep at it? In short, because the company has to either go public or sell itself to a larger company at some point. Given that we&#8217;ve already seen PayPal and Square cut checks to buy BNPL volume, the list of potential acquirers for Klarna is not as long as you might think. The company, flush with billions in private-market funding, will need to go public. It&#8217;s a simple question of <em>when. </em></p>
<p>Which makes the following all the more surprising. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/klarna-ceo-market-volatility-has-me-nervous-about-an-ipo.html">Via CNBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The volatility in the market right now makes me nervous to IPO to be honest,” Siemiatkowski told CNBC’s Karen Tso at the London Tech Week conference on Monday. “I think it would be nice to IPO when it’s a little bit more sound. And right now it doesn’t feel really sound out there.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh. Color us confused.</p>
<p>The public market for BNPL companies actually feels pretty damn strong at the moment.</p>
<p>Affirm, for example, is a BNPL company publicly listed in the United States. In Q2 2021 (Q4 fiscal 2021 for the company), <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/affirm-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-results">Affirm reported</a> gross merchandise volume of $2.5 billion, and revenues of $261.8 million. Those figures were up 106% and 71%, respectively. Affirm also posted a net loss of $128.2 million in the quarter, and $430.9 million in red ink during its most recent fiscal year (the 12 months ending June 30, 2021).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tumblr is entering <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/post/662944143853715456/its-for-tumblr-you-its-from-tumblr-us-its">open beta</a> for its subscription product Post+, meaning that all U.S. users can now try out the monetization feature. The product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">launched in closed beta</a> in July, allowing users hand-picked by Tumblr to place some of their content behind a monthly paywall. This marked the first time that Tumblr allowed bloggers to monetize their content directly on the platform, but the feature was met with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">backlash from users</a> who worried about how the feature would change the site&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>Now, Tumblr has responded to user feedback by removing the blue Post+ badge that appeared next to the names of users who enabled the feature. Tumblr differentiates itself from other sites by not revealing users&#8217; follower and following counts, so users were concerned that this distinction, which looked like a Twitter verification badge, contradicted that key aspect of Tumblr culture. Tumblr is also adding a $1.99/month price point in open beta &#8212; before, subscriber-only content could be priced at $3.99, $5.99 and $9.99. Tumblr will only take 5% of creator profits &#8212; comparatively, Patreon takes <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing">between 5% and 12%</a> depending on the tier. Payments will be processed through Stripe.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trouble in fandom paradise: Tumblr users lash out against its beta subscription feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/embed/#?secret=Wbg5LHr1xy" data-secret="Wbg5LHr1xy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, Tumblr users were dismayed by the way Post+ was rolled out. Many bloggers were concerned that in the closed beta, Post+ users didn&#8217;t have the ability to block paying subscribers without first contacting support &#8212; this could potentially expose users to harassment without the tools to manage it. Tumblr corrected that mistake in the open beta, so now, users can block subscribers themselves. Creators can also put existing content behind the Post+ paywall.</p>
<p>Some users upset with the Post+ rollout <a href="https://postplus-protest.tumblr.com/post/657433316725833728/post-plus-is-coming-whether-you-want-it-or-not">staged a protest</a>, which &#8212; with over 98,000 notes &#8212; is the first thing that shows up when you <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/post+plus?sort=top">search</a> &#8220;post plus&#8221; on Tumblr. Many people on Tumblr have amassed followings by posting iterative fan content, like fanfiction. Tumblr cited fanfiction as an example of the kind of content that creators can put behind a paywall, but users remain concerned that they will be subject to legal action if they were to do so. Archive of Our Own, a major fanfiction site, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072622/fanfic-ao3-free-speech-censorship-fandom">prohibits its users</a> from linking to sites like Patreon or Ko-Fi, since some intellectual property rights holders can be litigious about the monetization of fanfiction. While it&#8217;s considered fair use to make fan content, profiting from it can be considered a violation of copyright.</p>
<p>When Tumblr<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/tumblrs-back-in-the-app-store-following-porn-ban-announcement/"> banned pornographic content</a> in 2018, monthly page views <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">decreased by 29%</a> &#8212; to date, the blogging platform hasn&#8217;t regained that traffic. After being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">sold to Automattic</a> in 2019, Tumblr has committed to capturing the attention of Gen Z audiences, who the platform says make up about 48% of its users. Tumblr says it&#8217;s catering Post+ to serve Gen Z audiences, but the results of the open beta will begin to reveal whether or not this is what users on the platform want.</p>

<p>The round was co-led by L Catterton, a joint venture between LVMH and Catterton, Entrée Capital and Pico Venture Partners. Additional investors also joined, including Saga VC, as well as leading artists, art collectors, museums, gallerists and trustees at institutions such as MOMA and Guggenheim as well as Shalom McKenzie, an online gambling entrepreneur and investor who also invests in NFTs. Prior to the Series A round, Niio had raised $8 million, initially from strategic angels, followed by a seed round from institutions in 2017.</p>
<p>Niio will use its capital to grow its artist community and scale its app-enabled subscription and purchase platform, which is blockchain<span lang="EN-US">&#8211;</span>based and will include a trading-enabled marketplace for NFTs and other digital art assets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Digital art has become an accepted, mainstream medium with the market accelerating largely due to the explosive growth of NFTs,&#8221; <span lang="EN-US">said </span>Niio CEO and co-founder Rob Anders. &#8220;The transformation <span lang="EN-US">people</span> are experiencing is the most significant and consequential moment for culture in decades, making new kinds of art accessible and experienced on screens in ways like never before.&#8221;</p>

<p>By providing Niio’s tools to a global community of 6,000 galleries, institutions and artists, Niio’s platform and blockchain enables artists to distribute, manage, monetize and preserve their work.</p>

<p>Niio claims it will be free for all artists, forever, to respect and support the creative community and artists’ ability for publishing, managing and protecting their life’s work.</p>
<p>“We have realized our vision for a platform that first and foremost empowers artists and enables their work to be experienced digitally and available globally. We are gratified by the trust that more than 6,000 artists have placed in us &#8212; as we enable them to publish, manage protect and monetize their life’s work,” Niio<span lang="EN-US"> co-founder</span> Oren Moshe said.</p>
<p>Approximately 10,000 global business customers have been using the Niio platform for the past two to three years<span lang="EN-US">, Anders said</span>. Clients range from art professionals, including galleries, museums, studios and art schools, to luxury brands, hotel chains and real estate developers, who subscribe and display curated art streams from the 15,000 premium works available on the platform, to millions of people across public spaces and places in over 30 countries, Anders<span lang="EN-US"> said</span>.</p>
<p>“There are over 1 billion smart TVs in the market and our partner Samsung has 30-40% of the market contributing to our ability to offer a ‘last mile’ proposition,” Anders said.</p>
<p>The digital art market <span lang="EN-US">is projected to be approximately</span> $50 – $100 billion by 2025, according to Anders.</p>
<p>“Digital art has long been on our radar at L Catterton. We are very bullish on its future, and our ongoing evaluation of the sector brought us to Niio,” said Michael Farello, managing partner at L Catterton’s Growth Fund. “We are convinced that their platform approach including both subscription and an NFT offering combined with the reputation they have built in the critical artist community and the validation from their partnership with Samsung – will make them a market leader.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is a physical activity deficit in our world. Three fourths of adults say staying in shape is very important for health benefits. Yet, one in four adults and 81% of adolescents are insufficiently physically active, <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/physical-activity#tab=tab_1">according to the World Health Organization.</a> Even before COVID-19, less than 24% of children 6 to 17 years of age did 60 minutes of physical activity daily, as per <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/physicalactivity/facts.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.</p>
<p>Working from home and staying at home during the pandemic exacerbated being physical inactivity. Most people opt for sedentary entertainment that involves minimal movement like watching movies or streaming live concerts, playing video games and throwing virtual parties.</p>
<p>To solve the global problem of inactivity by creating new ways to encourage active play for everyone, <a href="https://www.nex.inc/">NEX</a>, a San Jose and Hong Kong-based motion entertainment startup, is building motion entertainment &#8211; content that encourages physical movement. It is now announcing a $25 million Series B round to coincide with launch of <a href="https://www.nex.inc/products/active-arcade">Active Arcade</a>, its new mobile AI interactive motion-tracking game.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The new funding was led by Blue Pool Capital, with participation from Samsung Ventures, SparkLabs and Susquehanna. This round also attracted influencers in sports, entertainment industries and business executives including Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), Albert Pujols (LA Dodgers), Thierry Henry (Arsenal Legend), Sabrina Ionescu (WNBA), tech CEOs and founders from YouTube, Dapper Labs, Alchemy, OpenDoor, WordPress and executives from Zendesk, Uber, MasterClass and Facebook.</span></p>
<p>This latest round comes after NEX raised an $8.5 million Series A in 2019 from the NBA, Will Smith&#8217;s Dreamers Fund, and the Alibaba Entrepreneurship Fund. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/an-app-that-uses-ai-to-help-you-improve-your-basketball-shot-just-raised-4-million/">It also previously raised a $4 million seed round</a> from Charmides Capital, Harris <span class="il">Blitzer</span> <span class="il">Sports</span> &amp; <span class="il">Entertainment</span> <span class="il">Ventures</span> and Mandra Capital, Steve Nash, Jeremy Lin and Mark Cuban in 2018. Many other leaders in sports, media and technology have also baked NEX.</p>
<p>The Series B round brings NEX’s total raised so far to $40 million.</p>
<p>NEX was founded in 2018 by David Lee, Philip Lam and Reggie Chan, with a mission to transform passive activity into active play through apps like Active Arcade. Its first app, HomeCourt, has been played in more than 200 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“A pandemic drew even more attention to the already huge and growing problem of more sedentary lifestyles across the world,” said Dave Lee, CEO and co-founder of NEX. “Having fun while moving is one of the purest definitions of play. But unlike the old days, the standard of engagement for active play must be on par with the best video games. It was apparent to us that accessible motion-based entertainment was the answer to a global need for more physical activity.”</p>
<p>Some people say that they don’t have enough time for physical activity, but the real problem is the idea that leisure time is supposed to be spent doing things that are fun and easy while getting active is perceived as expensive, time consuming and hard.</p>
<p>NEX’s newly launched Active Arcade, with a collection of motion games, helps both kids and adults move more by playing games. It is accessible to everyone, everywhere by any computing device with a camera, like smartphone, tablets, laptops and desktops.</p>
<p>Unlike other motion-based entertainment companies’ products that require expensive gear like a VR headset, connected hardware or game consoles, NEX develops motion-based entertainment apps without requiring special equipment, monitors, or a subscription.</p>
<p>Anyone can play Active Arcade using their body movement. Each game has different game play, style and depth, so there’s something for players of any age or level of activity.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AR4BahK1So?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“There are many high-tech exercise programs global companies developed in the motion-based entertainment industry, but most of them require expensive new equipment or a steep learning curve,” said Alex Wu, vice president of Strategy, MarComm and Partnerships at NEX.</p>
<p>With a proprietary combination of AI using mobile and vision technology, NEX merges the digital and physical worlds into a phone application that can create games like Active Arcade.</p>
<p>This summer, the company launched its limited test version of Active Arcade, Lee said.</p>
<p>NEX launched its first AI-based basketball training app HomeCourt in 2018, which was demoed on stage alongside Steve Nash at an Apple iPhone special event.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am constantly looking to invest in companies and products that I can stand behind and that are in line with my values. Nex&#8217;s approach to get kids and adults moving more and transforming activity into a play, is a mission I am wholeheartedly behind,&#8221; Steve Nash, Brooklyn Nets Coach and 2x league MVP said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> has often preached about responsible capitalism, and today at Dreamforce, the company&#8217;s annual customer extravaganza, it announced a notable achievement in the battle against global climate change. The company said that it has achieved effective Net Zero energy usage across its entire value chain with 100% renewable energy, while purchasing carbon offsets when that&#8217;s not possible.</p>
<p class="p1">At the same time, it announced updates to the Sustainability Cloud, a product that the company sells to other organizations to manage their climate initiatives, proving you can be responsible, and still be capitalists. Suzanne DiBianca, chief impact officer &amp; EVP for corporate relations at Salesforce, speaking at yesterday&#8217;s Dreamforce press event says the company is proud to be an example of a large organization taking positive climate action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited about our commitment to climate action around being a Net Zero company today. And this is not in 2030, not in 2040, not in some other future moment. We know we have to accelerate, and we have gotten to Net Zero today including our entire value chain, which is Scope 1, 2 and 3. Very few companies have gotten here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There is a lot of sustainability jargon there, so we spoke to Ari Alexander, GM of Sustainability Cloud to break it down for us. Alexander explained that the sustainability community measures a company&#8217;s carbon footprint in three main areas known as Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3. &#8220;Scope 1 and 2 are what you own, what you operate, what you control and then what energy is procured in order to power your operation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Scope 3 is everything else your company touches, which is referred to as &#8216;up and down the value chain&#8217; in industry parlance. &#8220;The vast majority of the emissions that a company is responsible for are actually not in their direct operational control, but relate to their upstream suppliers that they procure goods and services from, or in the case of other industries the downstream use of the product or the life of a product,&#8221; he said. A downstream example might be what happens to your phone after you trade it in for a new one.</p>
<p>So when Salesforce says that it&#8217;s Net Zero up and down the value chain, it involves everything it controls and every company it interacts with in the act of doing business. Because there are so many variables here outside of Salesforce&#8217;s control, Alexander says when the company can&#8217;t ensure that a partner or vendor is in compliance with the standard set by the company, it buys what he calls &#8220;high quality carbon offsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also for where we can&#8217;t do that immediately, we are purchasing high quality carbon offsets to make up the difference to be able to be fully Net Zero now, while we continue on that really important journey of reducing to absolute zero across the supply chain [over time],&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In addition, the company announced updates to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/salesforce-is-developing-an-app-to-help-build-a-sustainable-company/">the Sustainability Cloud</a>, the commercial tool it has developed to sell to other companies, using the same tools and technology that Salesforce is using in-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainability is undergoing a transformation in that it&#8217;s going from something that&#8217;s a nice to have to something that&#8217;s actually at the heart of business transformation itself. That it&#8217;s one of the mega trends of our time and growing exponentially every year, and part of what that means is that companies are moving significant resources in order to respond to the climate crisis and moving sustainability to the core of how they do business,&#8221; Alexander said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company published a blueprint based on its own plans to be a more sustainable organization called the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/assets/pdf/reports/salesforce-climate-action-plan-2021.pdf">Salesforce Climate Action Plan</a> (link to pdf) that it is making available for free online.</p>
<p>The company also announced plans to accelerate its tree planting goals to grow 30 million trees this year. This involves working with other organizations to plant, grow and restore 100 million trees in a 10 year period, a goal that they have been pushing to make happen much sooner.</p>
<p>Company president and COO Bret Taylor speaking at the Dreamforce press event said that the climate crisis has had an impact on everyone, and he believes Salesforce can have a meaningful impact based on its behavior while acting as an example for other organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re showing up at Dreamforce, [&#8230;] really to recognize that we think business is the greatest platform for change and to paint a picture of this vision for inspiring every organization to become a trusted enterprise and address these crises [like climate],&#8221; Taylor said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ben Rubin understands where social is going. In fact, he understands it so well, he&#8217;s always there early.</p>
<p>Rubin is the current CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://slashtalk.com/">Slashtalk</a> and an angel investor who scouts for Sequoia Capital. He previously founded Houseparty and Meerkat — apps that pioneered group video chat and mobile livestreaming, respectively — shaping massive social trends in their earliest stages.</p>
<p>In 2015, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">Meerkat took SXSW by storm</a>. The app seemed to have captured lightning in a bottle, and entrenched players in social noticed. Twitter was early to the trend too, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/how-periscope-works/">bought Periscope earlier that year</a>, and leveraged Meerkat&#8217;s momentum to attract people to its own product. Half a year later, Facebook vaulted into the space with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/facescope/">Facebook Live</a>.</p>
<p>Meerkat didn&#8217;t keep up, but it did transform. In 2016, the same team launched Houseparty, a group video chat app geared toward connecting established friends in casual virtual hangouts rather than streaming to the masses. Three years later, in a world not yet ravaged by the pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">it sold to Fortnite maker Epic Games</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fortnite maker Epic acquires social video app Houseparty&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/embed/#?secret=ioYXI7spwn" data-secret="ioYXI7spwn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With people driven indoors and away from IRL social interactions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/houseparty-reports-50m-sign-ups-in-past-month-amid-covid-19-lockdowns/">Houseparty boomed</a>. In a single month during the pandemic&#8217;s early phase, the app saw 50 million new signups and hit the top of the charts across the iOS App Store and Google Play. But Houseparty struggled to retain users, and by fall of 2021 Epic announced that it would unceremoniously wind down the project and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-to-shut-down-houseparty-in-october-including-the-video-chat-fortnite-mode-feature/">pull Houseparty from app stores.</a></p>
<p>Only time will tell if Houseparty&#8217;s technology will play a role in Epic&#8217;s vision for the metaverse — an interconnected series of seamless virtual worlds for people to explore and socialize in. But regardless of the app&#8217;s eventual fate, Houseparty&#8217;s take on social spontaneity and casual group video was ahead of its time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If anyone is well positioned to know where social networks are going in the near future, it&#8217;s probably Rubin. He&#8217;s now working on Slashtalk, &#8220;an anti-meeting tool for fast, decentralized conversations.&#8221; Slashtalk&#8217;s ethos echoes both Meerkat and Houseparty&#8217;s belief in social serendipity, but this time Rubin is focused on the workplace rather than consumer social.</p>
<p>Rubin will join us onstage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> to talk about his new company and the trends powering current upheavals in social networking, from decentralization and ownership to the future of a connected post-pandemic world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.typed.biz/">Business Canvas</a>, the South Korean document management SaaS company behind Typed, announced today it has raised a $2.5 million seed round led by <a href="http://venture.miraeasset.co.kr/en/">Mirae Asset Venture Investment</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.kakao.vc/">Kakao Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.nextrans.vn/">Nextrans Inc</a>.</p>
<p>The seed round will be used for accelerating product development and the global launch of an open beta for its AI-powered document management platform. The company opened an office in Santa Clara, California this year to spur its global expansion.</p>
<p>The problem that Business Canvas has identified and is building solutions to target is the challenge faced by people who are tasked with ingesting information and producing writing or decisions based on that: lawyers, entrepreneurs, researchers, students and communications workers like journalists among them. People are bombarded with information these days, thanks to technology. That might be good in some cases, but in the world of work, and specifically written work, there is such a thing as too much information, which can take a lot of time to process, and thus eat into the time we need to produce work based on that information.</p>
<p>Business Canvas, founded in 2020 by CEO Woojin Kim, Brian Shin, Seungmin Lee, Dongjoon Shin and Clint Yoo, is hoping to solve the challenge that every knowledge worker and writer faces: spending more time on research and file organization than the actual content output they need to create.</p>
<p>“In fact, people commit over 30% of their working hours trying to search for that file we once saved in a folder that we just cannot find anymore,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Through a network that intelligently tracks and organizes files based on the user’s interactions, Typed brings together knowledge from different websites and applications into one simple-to-use and quick-to-learn digital workspace.</p>
<p>Strictly keeping its users&#8217; information and their confidential files uninterrupted, Typed does not access the content of users’ documents but utilizes them as machine learning data, Kim told TechCrunch. It collects users&#8217; actions as data points, merging this with publicly available metadata from documents and resources under users&#8217; permission, Kim added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Modern document writing has not changed since the 1980s,” Yoo said. “While we have more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before, we use the same rudimentary methods to organize and make sense of it. We want any writer &#8212; from lawyers and entrepreneurs to researchers and students &#8212; to focus on creating great content instead of wasting time organizing their source material. We achieved this by making knowledge management more like the way our brain operates.”</p>
<p>Since the launch of the closed beta test in February 2021, Typed has seen significant user growth, with 25,000 files uploaded and 350% month-over-month active user growth. It does not disclose active user numbers but said that it currently has more than 10,000 users on the waitlist.</p>
<p>Typed will be available through a freemium model and is currently accepting beta registrations on its website.</p>
<p>“When we tested our closed beta, our metrics showed top traction among students as well as journalists, writers and lawyers, who require heavy research and document work on a frequent basis. We opened up access earlier this month for the waitlists in over 50 countries. These are primarily B2C users,” Kim told TechCrunch. “As for B2B, we are currently in the process of proof-of-concept for one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea. Smaller teams like startups, boutique law, consulting firms, venture capitals and government institutions also have been adopting Typed as well.”</p>
<p>“While the company is still in its nascent stage in its development, Typed has the potential to fundamentally change how we work individually or as a team. If there is a business to take on our outdated way of writing content, it’s them [Typed],” Shina Chung, Kakao Ventures CEO said.</p>
<p>The global market size for social software and collaboration SaaS is <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/social-software-and-collaboration-market-forecast-to-net-4-5-billion-in-2021/">estimated at $4.5 billion in 2021</a>, increasing over 17% year on year, Kim said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.batteryresourcers.com/">Battery Resourcers</a>, a startup that’s developing a closed-loop approach to lithium-ion battery materials, has raised $70 million in mid-round funding to scale its commercial operations across two continents.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in Worcester, Massachusetts, doesn’t just recycle batteries. It’s also engineered a process to turn that recycled material back into critical battery materials – specifically, nickel-manganese-cobalt cathodes and purified graphite, a material used in anodes. It intends to sell those materials right back to the battery manufacturer.</p>
<p>This latest round saw participation from new investor Hitachi Ventures, as well as existing investors Orbia Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover’s InMotion Ventures, Doral Energy, At One Ventures, TDK Ventures and Trumpf Ventures.</p>
<p>Battery Resources secured a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/">$20 million Series B</a> a little over five months ago. That funding was to accelerate the launch of the startup’s first commercial-scale facility, which will be able to process 10,000 tons of batteries per year. CEO Michael O’Kronley told TechCrunch in a recent interview that that plant will open in the first quarter of 2022, though the company has not yet announced where it will be located in the U.S.</p>
<p>With this new funding, the company will be opening two additional commercial-scale sites in Europe, which will be operational by the end of 2022. In all, Battery Resourcers aims to have 30,000 tons of recycling capacity by the end of next year across its three commercial-scale locations. Cathode material production will be added to these sites in the following year.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons to look abroad, O’Kronley said, not least because Battery Resourcers anticipates Europe being an even larger market than the U.S.</p>
<p>“Europe has the same concerns the U.S. does about retaining critical battery materials in the supply chain,” he said, adding that European lawmakers currently mandate battery recycling on the part of OEMs, and will likely mandate the use of recycled materials in batteries. “Couple that with the amount and the number of gigafactories that have been announced in Europe, relative to the US, most people believe, including Battery Resourcers, we believe the European market will be larger than the North American market.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The lion’s share of critical battery materials are currently produced in Asia, but O’Kronley said the industry is shifting from being highly concentrated in specific locations to a more global operation.</p>
<p>“Whether it&#8217;s the Asian company that is moving to Europe or North America, or new entrants that are coming in and supplying Europe and North America – we&#8217;re a new entrant coming in supplying these regions – the battery material supply chain will absolutely have to be localized,” he said. “We’re part of that.”</p>
<p>O’Kronley added that the company has been in talks with a number of OEMs and consumer electronics companies, but declined to specify any details. However, he did say that vehicle OEMs and battery manufacturers have already taken the company’s cathode material and built it into batteries for testing and to compare it to “virgin” cathodes.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s Battery Resourcers’ belief that long term, you need a vertically integrated supply chain, and to be able to extract the highest amount of value out of these spent batteries,” O’Kronley said. “We&#8217;re moving upstream in making these engineering materials that go right back into a new battery.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The latest round comes just 90 days from Bilt's launch.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt Rewards</a>, a loyalty program for property renters to earn points on rent with no fees and build a path toward homeownership, announced Tuesday a round of $60 million in growth funding that values the company at $350 million.</p>
<p>The investment comes from Wells Fargo and Mastercard and a group of the nation’s largest real estate owners, including The Blackstone Group, AvalonBay Communities, Douglas Elliman, Equity Residential, GID-Windsor Communities, LENx, The Moinian Group, Morgan Properties, Starwood Capital Group and Related.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-rewards-program-for-your-rent-payments-meet-bilt/">Bilt launched back in June</a> out of Kairos, the startup studio led by Ankur Jain, focused on enabling over 109 million renters in the U.S. to earn points from paying their rent every month — typically someone’s largest monthly expense. Since then, the program was rolled out across over 2 million rental units, Jain told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are the first and only alliance of the major property owners to create this kind of program and already have 15 of the top 20 owners involved,” he added. “We are also the only co-branded card to offer points on rent.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A rewards program for your rent payments? Meet Bilt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-rewards-program-for-your-rent-payments-meet-bilt/embed/#?secret=TxW97VFDFS" data-secret="TxW97VFDFS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Greg Bates, GID president and CEO, said his company has 130 assets spread across the top 20 markets and manages 40,000 apartment units. He learned about Bilt from a colleague who attended a proptech conference where Jain demoed the Bilt card.</p>
<p>For as long as Bates has been in the real estate industry, about 20 years or so, renters have wanted to pay rent with a credit card for convenience and to earn loyalty points. However, that was cost-prohibitive in terms of the surcharges needed to be added to the rental rate &#8212; until Bilt, he said. The card “is incredibly easy to use” and integrates into property owners’ online payment systems.</p>
<p>“Bilt has transformed the value proposition for residents that want to use a credit card and for landlords that want to accept them,” Bates added. “There will always be barriers to entry for products like this, but Bilt spent time with Mastercard and Wells Fargo to develop this unique product which will be a competition differentiator for a few years to come.”</p>
<p>In addition to the new funding, Bilt is also announcing new benefits for its loyalty members and upgraded offerings for the Bilt Mastercard, including the ability to earn up to 50,000 points on rent per year and unlimited points using the credit card.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For members, Bilt will pay interest in the form of points for a member’s account each month based on their average daily points balance over the 30-day period, and offer a concierge service for members choosing to redeem their Bilt points toward a home down payment. In addition, members can earn bonus points on top of points used by landlords on new leases and renewals.</p>
<p>Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. Members can also report their rent payments to the credit bureaus at no cost, which can help build credit history for millions of young renters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company’s new “0-1-2-3” point earning structure for Bilt Mastercard holders provides no annual fee, 1x points on rent payments, 2x points on travel, 3x points on dining and 1x points on all other purchases.</p>
<p>This is the company’s first major external financing round and will be used to expand its real estate and loyalty partner network, grow its distribution channels and make its platform credit card more widely available to the public. Jain estimates Bilt is seeing 20% enrollment across residents.</p>
<p>As more renters move to homeownership over time, Bilt has plans to leverage this potential larger business to eventually become a mortgage provider for them.</p>
<p>“Renting is something people do for a while, and the core business has a massive scale opportunity, especially in the demographic under 35 years old, who tend to be up-and-coming professionals,” Jain added. “This is a unique target market, and Bilt will grow with them as they build their path to homeownership.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Shelf Engine’s grocery order automation technology applies AI to food order volume so that grocery customers can reduce their food waste by as much as 32%.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://shelfengine.com/">Shelf Engine</a>’s mission to eliminate food waste in grocery retailers now has some additional celebrity backers. The company brought in a $2 million extension to its $41 million Series B announced in March.</p>
<p>Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Shaun White and Shawn Mendes are the new backers, who came in through a strategic round of funding alongside PLUS Capital to bring the Seattle-based company’s total funding to $60 million since the company’s inception in 2016. This includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/shelf-engine-has-a-plan-to-reduce-food-waste-at-grocery-stores-and-12-million-in-new-cash-to-see-i/">$12 million Series A</a> from 2020.</p>
<p>Shelf Engine’s grocery order automation technology applies advanced statistical models and artificial intelligence to deliver accurate food order volume so that customers can reduce their food waste by as much as 32% while increasing gross margins and sales of more than 50%. The company has already helped retailers divert 1 million pounds of food waste from landfills, Stefan Kalb, co-founder and CEO of Shelf Engine, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We’ve had phenomenal growth last year, some of it from our mid-market customers, but mostly from customers like Target and Kroger,” Kalb said. “Our other big news is that we hired a president (<a href="https://www.shelfengine.com/news/kane-mccord-shelf-engine-president-chief-revenue-officer/">Kane McCord</a>) in the past six weeks, which is cool to have the reinforcement on the leadership side.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Shelf Engine has a plan to reduce food waste at grocery stores, and $12 million in new cash to do it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/shelf-engine-has-a-plan-to-reduce-food-waste-at-grocery-stores-and-12-million-in-new-cash-to-see-i/embed/#?secret=N5tEUqQ5r2" data-secret="N5tEUqQ5r2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the company, which works with retailers like Kroger, Whole Foods and Compass Group, saw over 540% revenue growth. At the same time, it grew its employees to 200 from 23, Kalb said. He expects to more than double Shelf Engine’s headcount over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>As a result, the new funding will be used to scale with current customers and accelerate further investment in R&amp;D of its AI systems and automation capabilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amanda Groves, partner at PLUS Capital, said her firm works with about 65 individuals who are in film, television, sports and culture, including the four new investors in Shelf Engine.</p>
<p>She says many of her clients are looking to participate in business as an investor or with sweat equity. Her firm works with them to determine interests and will then source opportunities and invest alongside them.</p>
<p>Shelf Engine fits into one of PLUS Capital’s core investment areas of sustainability. The firm looks across different sectors like food, energy, apparel, packaging and recycling. Shelf Engine’s approach of leveraging technology to aid in sustainability efforts was attractive to all of the investors, as was their method of scaling within grocery clients without affecting consumer behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When Shelf Engine is installed in the grocery store, they can reduce spoilage by 10% right off the bat — that immediacy of the impact was what got our clients excited,” Groves added.</p>
<p>One of Shelf Engine’s first celebrity investors was Joe Montana, and Kalb said partnering with celebrities enables the company’s mission to eliminate food waste and address the climate crisis to be made more aware.</p>
<p>“B2B software is not as glamorous, but the climate has become a big issue and something many celebrities care about,” he added. “Shawn Mendes has over 60 million followers, so for him to share about this issue is extremely meaningful. Where he invests will lead to his followers knocking on the doors of stores and saying ‘this matters to me.’ That is the strategy shift from B2B to a movement for our community.”</p>
<p>The company is not alone in tackling food waste, which globally each year amounts to $1.3 trillion. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apeel-bites-into-another-250m-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation-to-accelerate-fresh-food-supply-chains/">Apeel</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/food-sharing-app-olio-raises-43m-series-b-as-the-world-switches-on-to-the-food-waste-crisis/">OLIO</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperfect-foods-secures-95mm-series-d-investment-commitment-301212899.html">Imperfect Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200717005006/en/Cambridge-Crops-Rebrands-as-Mori-and-Raises-12-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-to-Combat-Food-Waste">Mori</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-phood-heats-up-2m-seed-to-reduce-food-waste/">Phood Solutions</a> are all working to improve the food supply chain and have attracted venture dollars in the past year to go after that mission.</p>
<p>Shelf Engine is already in over 3,000 stores nationwide in the areas of grocery, food service and convenience stores, which “is a large lift from 18 months ago,” Kalb said. Next up, the company is progressing to open new categories and managing more projects. He is specifically looking at what the company can manage in the store and manage for the customer.</p>
<p>“We are getting to the point where we can manage more of the store in complex categories like meat, seafood and deli that are mainly custom,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/chronicle-cso-stairwell-cybersecurity-startup/">Stairwell emerged from stealth in 2020</a>, the startup was shrouded in secrecy. Now with $20 million in Series A funding, its founder and CEO Mike Wiacek — who previously served as chief security officer at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chronicle/">Chronicle</a>, Google’s moonshot cybersecurity company — is ready to talk.</p>
<p>As well as raising $20M, an investment round co-led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sequoia-capital/">Sequoia Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accel/">Accel</a>, Stairwell is launching Inception, a threat hunting platform that aims to help organizations determine if they were compromised now or in the past. Unlike other threat detection platforms, Inception takes an &#8220;inside out&#8221; approach to cybersecurity, which starts by looking inwards at a company’s data.</p>
<p>“This helps you study what&#8217;s in your environment first before you start thinking about what&#8217;s happening in the outside world,” Wiacek tells TechCrunch. “The beautiful thing about that approach is that&#8217;s not information that outside parties, a.k.a. the bad guys, are privy to.”</p>
<p>This data, all of which is treated as suspicious, is continuously evaluated in light of new indicators and new threat intelligence. Stairwell claims this enables organizations to detect anomalies within just days, <a href="https://www.capita.com/sites/g/files/nginej291/files/2020-08/Ponemon-Global-Cost-of-Data-Breach-Study-2020.pdf">rather than the industry average of 280 days</a>, as well as to “bootstrap” future detections.</p>
<p>“If you go and buy a threat intelligence feed from Vendor X, do you really think that someone who&#8217;s spending hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars to conduct an offensive campaign isn&#8217;t going to make sure that whatever they&#8217;re using isn&#8217;t in that field?,” said Wiacek. “They know what McAfee knows and they know other antivirus engines know, but they don&#8217;t know what you know and that&#8217;s a very powerful advantage that you have there.”</p>
<p>Stairwell’s $20 million in Series A funding, which comes less than 12 months after it secured $4.5 million in seed funding, will be used to further advance the Inception platform and to increase the startup’s headcount; the Palo Alto-based firm currently has a modest headcount of 21.</p>
<p>The Inception platform, which the startup claims finally enables enterprises to “outsmart the bad guys”, is launching in early release for a limited number of customers, with full general availability scheduled for 2022.</p>
<p>“I just wish we had a product to market when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/solarwinds/">SolarWinds</a> happened,” Wiacek added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve entered the throes of hardware season, with big events from all of the industry’s big names. Amazon has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/amazon-is-releasing-its-own-tvs-with-alexa-built-in/">announced</a> a number of new Fire TVs, with plans for a big (likely Echo-focused) event a week from today. In the meantime, the retail giant just dropped a sizable surprise on our heads in the form of a brand new Kindle Paperwhite.</p>
<p>I say “surprise” primarily because the whole of the Kindle hardware division has been quiet for a while now. When the Paperwhite got its last major upgrade in 2018, we noted, “The Voyage may be dead, but the Kindle line still has some life left in it.” Because, let’s face it, the whole of the devoted e-reader market isn’t exactly bustling. Sure Kobo is still hanging around the edges, but Amazon more or less sits alone as a monolith these days.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205337" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205337" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2205337" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="894" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg 1217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=768,671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=680,594 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205337" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>There were some rumblings, however, including a UI update for the line and a smattering of leaks, precipitating today’s news. And sure enough, here’s a new Paperwhite, representing the biggest update to the mid-tier Kindle in recent memory.</p>
<p>The star of the show is a long-awaited increase to the display &#8212; up from six to 6.8 inches, while maintaining the 300 PPI pixel density. That’s edging into the seven-inch 300 PPI Kindle Oasis territory. Like the Oasis, the bezels are flush with the device and they’ve been shaved down 12% from the previous generation (to 10.2mm) to help maintain the device’s footprint.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205340" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205340" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205340 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg 3008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=1536,818 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=2048,1091 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205340" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Honestly, though, the most exciting addition here is USB-C charging. I realize that sounds a bit silly, but the Kindle line has been the last vestige of microUSB &#8212; it’s one of the few reasons I keep those cables around anymore. I fully expected the pricier Oasis to be the first device to adopt the new (well, newer) connector, but, then, that would require Amazon to release a new Oasis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Charging is faster, requiring 2.5 hours to go from zero to full. The battery itself has also been improved, up to 10 weeks on a charge from six &#8212; but what’s a month between friends, right? The other surprise on the battery side of things is the arrival of wireless charging. That’s available with the new Paperwhite Signature Edition, which also bumps the base-level 8GB of storage up to 32GB. Amazon is also introducing a $30 charging dock, which is available separately &#8212; it should work with any standard Qi charging pad.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205345" style="width: 985px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205345" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2205345" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="779" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg 975w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205345" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Max brightness on the screen has been bumped up 10%, coupled with an auto-adjusting light based on ambient light. Like the Oasis, the light will adjust to a warmer color to save your eyes closer to bedtime. The processor has been improved since the last gen (no specifics there at the moment), promising 20% faster page turning. The device is made from with 60% post-consumer recycled plastics and 70% recycled magnesium.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite runs $140 for standard and $190 for the Signature Edition. They come with four free months of Kindle Unlimited and are up for preorder today. Also up for preorder is the first-ever Kids edition of the device. The Kindle Paperwhite for Kids features a kid-friendly cover, a year of Amazon Kids+ and a two-year warranty. That runs $160.</p>
