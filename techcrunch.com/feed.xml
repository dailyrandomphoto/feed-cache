										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lightspeed Venture Partners, the well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has backed the likes of DoubleClick and Snapchat, is in the midst of hiring a new London-based investment partner as it looks to put down further ties to Europe, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Paul Murphy, whose investments include Tier, Hopin, Klang and Bunch, is being hired away from Northzone, the European VC firm that’s probably best known for being an early backer of Spotify. The signing is still in progress but could be announced in the next few weeks. Murphy has been at the Northzone for three years and was promoted to general partner in late 2019 when the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/northzone-raises-new-500m-fund/">raised a new $500 million fund</a> in late 2019.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reached out to Murphy and Lightspeed for comment and will update this article if or when I hear back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VI6Vaiwfa3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=VI6Vaiwfa3" data-secret="VI6Vaiwfa3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to VC, Murphy co-founded Dots, the mobile games company in New York. He also built and invested in various companies at startup studio Betaworks. (Notably, Murphy helped launch Giphy in the U.S., which Lightspeed ended up backing and later sold to Facebook for $400 million). Before that, he held several roles at Microsoft in the U.S., U.K. and India. He also holds a BS in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech and an MBA from The IE Business School in Spain, according to the Northzone website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fact that Lightspeed is formerly putting more people on the ground in Europe should come as no surprise to close watchers of the ecosystem here. TechCrunch first heard rumors that the Menlo Park-based VC was recruiting a partner in London as far back as August in 2019. That saw Rytis Vitkauskas join the U.S. as its first partner in London the following September, according to LinkedIn. Should Murphy&#8217;s recruitment be confirmed it would signal a significant expansion of a Lightspeed London &#8220;office,&#8221; and confirmation that the VC is doubling down in the region.</p>
<p>Those rumors in late last 2019 coincided with news spreading that another Silicon Valley VC heavyweight, Sequoia, was also doing the same &#8212; along with talk of other U.S. VC firms &#8212; as European tech companies continue to create more value than ever before. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/7-things-we-just-learned-about-sequoias-european-expansion-plans/">Sequoia&#8217;s own plans</a> were finally announced in November, including that it had poached Luciana Lixandru away from rival Accel Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lisa Wu, a partner at Norwest with investments like Calm, Plaid, Opendoor and Grove Collaborative, has a message for founders: Think like a VC during your pitch presentation. After all, accepting capital isn&#8217;t simply adding more money to your balance sheet. It is about picking a venture partner who will be there with you through the highs and lows. Some even liken it to a marriage that you can&#8217;t divorce from.</p>
<p>No pressure, of course.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we won’t leave you hanging: Wu is joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, our annual event with content specifically tailored to first-time founders and investors, to talk about exactly this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Norwest, Wu worked in Amazon’s corporate development team, Bessemer Venture Partners and founded BANZAI, which brought food focused on quality and nutrition to schools.</p>
<p>With experience on both sides of the investing table, Wu is going to talk about how founders can make the most out of each minute within a one-hour pitch presentation. She’ll discuss ways that founders can read the virtual room, how to take advice and how to talk big-picture ideas to convey market size and competition.</p>
<p>Wu joins a fantastic cast of top experts, discussing topics such as fundraising, operations and marketing. Her workshop is part of the two days of events that explore seed and Series A fundraising, recruiting and more for early-stage startups at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage – Operations and Fundraising</a> on April 1 &amp; 2. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=dawnbeltpost&amp;display=true">Grab your ticket now</a> before prices increase tonight!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company that recently closed its acquisition of Uber’s self-driving subsidiary, has snapped up another startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Aurora is buying OURS Technology, the second lidar startup it has acquired in less than two years. Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">acquired Blackmore</a>, a Montana-based lidar startup in May 2019.  Aurora declined to disclose the acquisition price or other financial terms of the deal. OURS Technology, which was founded in 2017 by a team of University of California-Berkeley researchers and Phds, employs 12 people. The entire team is heading to Aurora, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are always on the lookout for how we can make progress as quickly as possible and <span class="il">OURS</span>’s expertise in developing <span class="il">lidar</span> chips adds to the expertise we already have and accelerates our work,” an Aurora spokesperson said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidar, or </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">light detection and ranging radar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is considered by most companies developing autonomous driving systems </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a critical and necessary sensor to safely deploy self-driving vehicles at scale. A future where millions of self-driving vehicles coursing through cities is still years — even decades some argue — away. But that hasn&#8217;t prevented dozens of lidar companies from launching, each one aiming to cash in on that eventual demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of the 70-odd companies that exist in the industry today are developing and trying to sell time-of-flight lidar sensors, which send out pulses of light outside the visible spectrum and then measures how long it takes for each of those pulses to return. As they come back, the direction of, and distance to, whatever those pulses hit are recorded as a point and eventually forms a 3D map. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lidar companies, including Blackmore and OURS Technology, are pursuing Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) lidar, which emits a low-power and continuous wave, or stream, of light. FMCW lidar developers tout two primary benefits of this technology. It can measure distance with a higher dynamic range and instant velocity, meaning it can gauge the speed of the objects coming to or moving away from them. It also doesn&#8217;t struggle with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interference from sun or other other sensors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But FMCW is also complex. FMCW starts as a range finder on a chip. To make it a 3D lidar, many FMCW developers use big mirrors and other components to provide the field of view, which pushes up the size of the sensors. OURS Technology claims to be a lidar-on-a-chip company, which suggests that this four-year-old company has developed a way to combine everything into a solid-state scanning mechanism. This would allow the sensor to shrink in size, solving one of FMCW&#8217;s primary issues.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Aurora unveiled last summer its so-called <a href="https://medium.com/aurora-blog/aurora-debuts-firstlight-lidar-c8d850f0cbe7">FirstLight Lidar</a>, a sensor based on Blackmore&#8217;s technology that was developed for its fleet of self-driving vehicles, namely long-haul trucks. Aurora is clearly interested in OURS&#8217; speed of development, <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/the-power-of-fmcw-lidar-and-scale-acquiring">noting in its announcement</a> that the startup been able to produce four generations of <span class="il">lidar</span> in just three years and developed a solid-state scanning mechanism compatible with its technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use the startup&#8217;s expertise and development know-how to make its sensor scaleable.

<p>What you may not know is that you have only a few hours left to take advantage of early-bird pricing on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost&amp;display=true">single event or dual-event pass</a>. Beat the deadline — <strong>11:59 p.m. (PST) tonight</strong> — score the lowest possible price and save $100.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage</a> functions like a minibootcamp for entrepreneurs. You’ll hear from top experts, founders and investors from across the startup ecosystem. They’ll share valuable tips, advice and hard-won lessons they learned in the trenches. We’re talking issues that every startup founder needs to master or understand well enough to delegate wisely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#6db46596-2ca9-43aa-bbb6-9a7aab71bf62">slate of experts</a> will present workshops on subjects like operations, fundraising, pitch deck pointers, term sheet tips, product-market fit, brand building, growth marketing, recruiting, taming your tech stack and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here are just two examples to whet your entrepreneurial appetite. Marlon Nichols, founding managing partner of MaC Venture Capital, will discuss how to get noticed by investors, how to grow your business and how to survive in the crowded, competitive space of tech startups. He’ll offer insights on how to network, craft a great pitch and target the best investors for your success.</p>
<p>You’re just beginning to build your startup — what could go wrong? Plenty according to Fuel Capital’s Leah Solivan. Currently an early-stage investor, Solivan founded TaskRabbit, a startup she led to a successful exit in 2017 (acquired by IKEA). She’ll share ways to avoid making big mistakes early in your founding journey.</p>
<p>We reserved day two of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage</a> for something truly exciting — the TC Early Stage Pitch Off. We sent out a call for competitors and the response was overwhelming. Narrowing the field wasn&#8217;t easy, but we chose 10 early-stage startup founders. They’ll each get five minutes to deliver their best pitch to a panel of prominent VC judges — followed by a five-minute Q&amp;A. Those judges will pick three founders to move to the finals for a second pitch-and-Q&amp;A to a new set of judges. The winner receives a feature article on TechCrunch.com, a free, one-year subscription to ExtraCrunch and a free Founder Pass to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, African e-commerce giant Jumia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/jumia-narrows-losses-as-its-payment-service-grows-financial-results/">released its second full-year financials</a> for Q4 and its fiscal year 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were mixed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; active customers and gross profit increased, while orders and gross merchandise volume (GMV) fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A particular feature that has troubled the company since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012 was also present, namely persistent adjusted EBITDA and operating losses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, those metrics fell year over year, and the company, in a statement, said that it had demonstrated &#8220;meaningful progress on our path to profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unevenness of Jumia&#8217;s business is also reflected in how its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JMIA/">share price</a> performed in the past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n March 2020, the company hit rock bottom and traded at an all-time low of $2.15 after facing fraud allegations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it hit an all-time high of $69.89 almost a year later this February. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the release of its financials, two things were top of TechCrunch&#8217;s mind: What made Jumia&#8217;s value swell by more than 3,000% in the last year, and will the e-commerce player&#8217;s unending losses end anytime soon?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with Jumia co-CEO <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-hodara-8183854">Jeremy Hodara</a> to get his insights on these two questions and on issues that have faced the company in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Talking profitability with Jumia</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has edited for length and clarity.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: This time last year, Jumia was trading between $2 and $4. Now it&#8217;s within $40 to $50. What do you think has been the driving factor behind this?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jeremy Hodara:</strong> What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> important about the stock rise is two things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, in general, the world realized that there was a big paradigm shift in e-commerce and that e-commerce was the way to go for the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is something you can look at for every e-commerce company in the past 12 to 18 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing that happened is that we at Jumia have been very clear about the opportunities e-commerce represents in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is a real problem of access to consumption and has a strong value proposition to those who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don&#8217;t fancy brick-and-mortar stores in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we never </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have proven is that you can build a profitable e-commerce business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will change soon because what we&#8217;ve done quarter after quarter is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be disciplined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bring clarity that we&#8217;re going after a profitable business model and profitable growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as people understood and saw what we were doing, it also gave them more confidence about how exciting this opportunity is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, what happened in the last 12 months was the combination of people understanding how important e-commerce is worldwide. Secondly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jumia brought proof points that it was building a sustainable and profitable business model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Would you say Andrew Left&#8217;s reversal in October and his decision to take long positions at Jumia also affected the share price?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I said earlier, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it had to do with the story of e-commerce change for the future. That didn&#8217;t start in October; it started months before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being disciplined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quarter after quarter to build what&#8217;s right started months before, so I can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comment if his decision affected our share price or if an investor&#8217;s negative or positive comments would change market sentiment toward our stock</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jumia narrows losses, as its payment service grows in financial results&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/jumia-narrows-losses-as-its-payment-service-grows-financial-results/embed/#?secret=5CHjeT2wyb" data-secret="5CHjeT2wyb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve talked about how Jumia is trying to build a profitable business. But how&#8217;s it going to do that if the company reports losses quarter after quarter and year after year?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re on the right path, considering that our EBITDA losses reduced by 47% last quarter, and we&#8217;ll be trying to do so every quarter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want to go about it by improving the efficiency of the business and opening new avenues for growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most exciting thing about e-commerce is that first, you build large assets for your own use, but it becomes relevant for other stakeholders over time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, we have an application and website with very engaged visitors, and we&#8217;re exploring having third-party advertisers who place ads on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our logistics service is also another way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re building tools and technology to equip our logistics partners and help them become more productive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This drives our costs per delivery down and is the type of benefit that comes with scaling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a path to profitability by opening the assets we&#8217;ve built for ourselves to benefit our ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jumia&#8217;s expenses dropped last year, but revenue also dropped despite a little increase in customer base. Aren&#8217;t those worrying signs?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the revenue side, here&#8217;s how we should look at it. When you&#8217;re a marketplace, your revenue is the commission that you make from a transaction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you&#8217;re a seller on Jumia and sell something that costs $100 and your commission is 10%, your revenue inside the P&amp;L of Jumia will be $10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If I buy a product from you at $90 and sell it to my consumer for $100, I&#8217;ll record $100 as the revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the insurance from the financial pinpoint between what you call the third-party and the first-party model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first-party model, you record as the revenue the value of the product. At the marketplace, you only record the commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jumia has, give or take, 10% of its business as the first-party model and 90% as the marketplace model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that percentage changed over time, and when it did, you can see how the revenue went down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we don&#8217;t base our profitability on revenue. What is the right KPI for us is the gross profit as it shows the monetization of Jumia. It has been growing quarter after quarter, this time by 12%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our active consumers growing 12% from 6.1 million in Q4 2019 to 6.8 million in Q4 2020 shows a disciplined growth toward profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>If there&#8217;s indeed a path to profitability, why did Jumia investors &#8212; Rocket Internet and MTN &#8212; exit the company? And does that put pressure on the company?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, not at all. The fact that Jumia was able to gain support from the companies was a blessing, and they&#8217;ve come a long way with us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But like any investor after six to nine years, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was time for them to decide to leave the company, and I&#8217;ll say the company was lucky to have had them along our side from the beginning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I can&#8217;t say for them, but for myself, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one can say that their leaving after so many years is a sign of distrust in our ability to become profitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>One of the positives of your financials was JumiaPay. Does it tie into Jumia&#8217;s journey to being profitable?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay is an amazing opportunity for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a great commerce platform, you have a fantastic opportunity to build a great payments solution for your consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that consumers are adopting it very fast, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is because the platform also gives them access to other digital services where they top up their phone, pay bills and get loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it is a great payment method for consumers who want to prepay for services. And when you prepay for products, you make logistics more efficient and have more sales.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Revisiting Jumia’s JForce scandal and Citron&#8217;s short-sell claims&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/revisiting-jumias-jforce-scandal-and-citrons-short-sell-claims/embed/#?secret=uM76jkMkcX" data-secret="uM76jkMkcX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Sales remind me of the fraud issues in 2019 when some J-Force team members engaged in improper sales practices. What is Jumia doing to avoid situations like that?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a lesson we&#8217;ve learnt, and we have put in the right compliance, the right internal control team to resolve such situations. I&#8217;ll say one of the reasons why we&#8217;re becoming one of the most professional organizations in Africa is because we now have these systems in place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>As an African company, how is Jumia addressing concerns around diversity, especially at top positions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African with Jumia is who we are serving, our African sellers, our African consumers and our African team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Nigeria, Juliet Anammah, who was the CEO of Jumia Nigeria, is now the chairperson of Jumia Group. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an African or a non-African company, but what I can tell you is that our team is African, our consumers are African, and we&#8217;re selling on the continent every day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s what should make sense to our ecosystem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jamaica&#8217;s JamCOVID app and website were taken offline late on Thursday following a third security lapse, which exposed quarantine orders on more than half a million travelers to the island.</p>
<p>JamCOVID was set up last year to help the government process travelers arriving on the island. Quarantine orders are issued by the Jamaican Ministry of Health and instruct travelers to stay in their accommodation for two weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>These orders contain the traveler&#8217;s name and the address of where they are ordered to stay.</p>
<p>But a security researcher told TechCrunch that the quarantine orders were publicly accessible from the JamCOVID website but were not protected with a password. Although the files were accessible from anyone&#8217;s web browser, the researcher asked not to be named for fear of legal repercussions from the Jamaican government.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 quarantine orders were exposed, some dating back to March 2020.</p>
<p>TechCrunch shared these details with the Jamaica Gleaner, which was <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210226/another-jamcovid-lapse">first to report on the security lapse</a> after the news outlet verified the data spillage with local cybersecurity experts.</p>
<p>Amber Group, which was contracted to build and maintain the JamCOVID coronavirus dashboard and immigration service, pulled the service offline a short time after TechCrunch and the Jamaica Gleaner contacted the company on Thursday evening. JamCOVID&#8217;s website was replaced with a holding page that said the site was &#8220;under maintenance.&#8221; At the time of publication, the site had returned.</p>
<p>Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia did not return a request for comment.</p>
<p>Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica’s Ministry of National Security, also did not respond to a request for comment or our questions — including if the Jamaican government plans to continue its contract or relationship with Amber Group.</p>
<p>This is the third security lapse involving JamCOVID in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Last week, Amber Group secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">an exposed cloud storage server</a> hosted on Amazon Web Services that was left open and public, despite containing more than 70,000 negative COVID-19 lab results and over 425,000 immigration documents authorizing travel to the island. Savadia <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210221/amber-group-breaks-silence-personal-data-exposure">said in response</a> that there were &#8220;no further vulnerabilities&#8221; with the app. Days later, the company fixed a second security lapse after leaving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/jamaica-amber-group-jamcovid-security-lapse/">a file containing private keys and passwords</a> for the service on the JamCOVID server.</p>
<p>The Jamaican government has repeatedly defended Amber Group, which says it provided the JamCOVID technology <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">to the government &#8220;for free.&#8221;</a> Amber Group&#8217;s Savadia has previously been quoted as saying that the company built the service in &#8220;three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/pm-holness-and-national-security-council-get-comprehensive-update-on-the-countrys-cybersecurity-apparatus/">a statement</a> on Thursday, Jamaica&#8217;s prime minister Andrew Holness said JamCOVID &#8220;continues to be a critical element&#8221; of the country&#8217;s immigration process and that the government was &#8220;accelerating&#8221; to migrate the JamCOVID database — though specifics were not given.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> platform is chock full of data about how a company operates and communicates. Atlassian launched a machine learning layer, which relies on data on the platform with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/atlassian-smarts-adds-machine-learning-layer-across-the-companys-platform-of-services/"> the addition of Atlassian Smarts</a> last fall. Today the company announced it was acquiring <a href="http://www.chartio.com/">Chartio</a> to add a new data analysis and visualization component to the Atlassian family of products. The companies did not share a purchase price.</p>
<p>The company plans to incorporate Chartio technology across the platform, starting with Jira. Before being acquired, Chartio has generated its share of data, reporting that 280,000 users have created 10.5 million charts for 540,000 dashboards pulled from over 100,000 data sources.</p>
<p>Atlassian sees Chartio as way to bring that data visualization component to the platform and really take advantage of the data locked inside its products. &#8220;Atlassian products are home to a treasure trove of data, and our goal is to unleash the power of this data so our customers can go beyond out-of-the-box reports and truly customize analytics to meet the needs of their organization,&#8221; Zoe Ghani, head of product experience at platform at Atlassian <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-acquires-chartio">wrote in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mEgKvjoilK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/atlassians-two-year-cloud-journey/">Atlassian&#8217;s two-year cloud journey</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Chartio co-founder and CEO Dave Fowler <a href="https://chartio.com/blog/atlassian/">wrote in a blog post </a>on his company website that the two companies started discussing a deal late last year, which culminated in today&#8217;s announcement. As is often the case in these deals, he is arguing that his company will be better off as part of large organization like Atlassian with its vast resources than it would have been by remaining stand-alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we’ve been proudly independent for years, the opportunity to team up our technology with Atlassian’s platform and massive reach was incredibly compelling. Their product-led go to market, customer focus and educational marketing have always been aspirational for us,&#8221; Fowler wrote.</p>
<p>As for Chartio customers unfortunately, according to a notice on the company website, the product is going to be going away next year, but customers will have plenty of time to export the data to another tool. The notice includes <a href="https://chartio.com/docs/migration-guide/">a link to instructions</a> on how to do this.</p>
<p>Chartio was founded in 2010, and participated in the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/176">Y Combinator Summer 2010</a> cohort. It raised a modest $8.03 million along the way, according to Pitchbook data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To better understand what's going on with the companies hoping to help you finance your next mistaken purchase, let's check out earnings results from Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the e-commerce market grows, startups are racing to help online retailers sell larger items to consumers with so-called &#8220;buy-now-pay-later&#8221; options. Via BNPL, consumers turn a one-time purchase into a limited string of regular payments.</p>
<p>Terms vary, but the space is very active. TechCrunch covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/scalapay-raises-48m-to-scale-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-in-europe/">Scalapay&#8217;s January $48 million round</a>, what the Italian BNPL described as a <em>seed</em> round. Also this year, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/alma-raises-59-4-million-for-its-klarna-like-payment-option/">France&#8217;s Alma raise a $59.4 million Series B for its BNPL efforts</a>. And I recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/wisetack-raises-19m-as-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-for-irl-services-scales/">covered Wisetack&#8217;s aggregate $19 million fundraise</a> as it looks to make more noise about its service that focuses on real-world transactions like home improvement.</p>
<p>But unlike some burgeoning startup niches where we lack visible results from leading players to use as a lens for vetting the market, we do have a number for the BNPL space. This morning, to better understand what&#8217;s going on with the younger companies hoping to help you finance your next mistaken purchase, let&#8217;s check out earnings results from Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm.</p>

<p>Klarna, based in Sweden, is said to be considering a direct listing.

<h2>BNPL results</h2>
<p>The BNPL cohort of startups is showing signs of pursuing verticalization to find veins of market demand that remain untapped by the largest players in their market. So, while Affirm wants to check you out everywhere online, providing you with repayment options wherever you travel digitally, Wisetack wants to integrate with a particular set of merchants. The latter model could provide startups pursuing similar, narrower market targets the ability to better understand their economics and perhaps generate more total margin on their loans.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a long way to say that even with the information at our disposal, we&#8217;re thinking <em>directionally</em>. But doing so is both good fun and illustrative, so let&#8217;s get into it. First, Klarna.</p>
<h3>Klarna</h3>
<p>This morning we&#8217;ll look at Klarna&#8217;s <a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/sites/15/2020/11/26063938/Klarna-publishes-financial-update-for-January-September-2020-press-release.pdf">Q3 2020 report</a> and its<a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/02/25063416/Press-release-Klarna-Q1-Q4-2020-Financial-Report.pdf"> Q4 report</a> from the same year.</p>
<p>The gist is that Klarna had a super-solid 2020. In its Q3 update, Klarna wrote that it saw 43 percent growth in gross merchandise volume during the first nine months of the year. In its Q4 report, it noted a full-year number of 46 percent GMV growth. From that, we can intuit that Klarna had a great fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Turning to the U.S. market, Klarna first reported &#8220;10 million total consumers by [the Q3] period end, and 11 million by the end of October.&#8221; And for the full year, it wrote that it had seen &#8220;15 million consumers choosing to shop with Klarna by January 2021&#8221; in the United States. Again, those look pretty great.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relativity Space has just revealed what comes after Terran 1, the small launch vehicle it hopes to begin flying later this year. It&#8217;s next rocket will be Terran R, a much larger orbital rocket with around 20x the cargo capacity of Terran 1, that will also be distinguished from its smaller, disposable sibling by being fully reusable — across both first and second stages, unlike SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9.</p>
<p>I spoke to Relativity Space CEO and founder Tim Ellis about Terran R, and how long it&#8217;s been in the works for the space startup. Ellis said that in fact, the vision ever since Relativity&#8217;s time at Y Combinator has included larger lift rockets — and much more.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I founded Relativity five years ago, it always was inspired by seeing SpaceX launching and landing rockets, docking with the International Space Station, and this idea that going to Mars was critically important for humanity&#8217;s future, and really expanding the possibilities for human experience, on Earth and beyond,&#8221; Ellis told me. &#8220;But all of the animations faded to black right when people walked out [of spaceship landing on Mars], and I believed that 3D printing had to be this inevitable technology that was going to build humanity&#8217;s industrial base on Mars, and that we needed to really inspire dozens, or even hundreds of companies to work on making this future happen.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Relativity Space&#8217;s focus on 3D printing and cloud-based software helps it weather the COVID-19 storm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/relativity-spaces-focus-on-3d-printing-and-cloud-based-software-helps-it-weather-the-covid-19-storm/embed/#?secret=Q0WmBtGY2I" data-secret="Q0WmBtGY2I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The long-term goal for Relativity Space, Ellis said, has always been to become an &#8220;end-product 3D-printing company,&#8221; with its original Terran 1 light payload rocket simply representing the first of those products it&#8217;s bringing to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;3D printing is our new tech stack for aerospace, and really is rewriting something that we don&#8217;t feel has fundamentally changed over the last 60 years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really bringing automation that replaces the factory fixed tooling, supply chains, hundreds of thousands of parts, manual labor and slow iteration speed, with something that I believe is needed for the future on Earth, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terran R, which will have a payload capacity of over 20,000 kg (more than 44,000 lbs.) to low-Earth orbit, is simply &#8220;the next logical step&#8221; for Relativity in that long-term vision of producing a wide range of products, including aerospace equipment for use right here on Earth. Ellis says that a larger launch vehicle makes sense given current strong customer demand for Terran 1, which has a max payload capacity of 1,250 kg (around 2,755 lbs.) to low-Earth orbit, combined with the average size of satellites being launched today. Despite the boon in so-called &#8220;small&#8221; satellites, many of the constellations being built today have individual satellites that weigh in excess of 500 kg (1,100 lbs.), Ellis points out, which means that Terran R will be able to delivery many more at once for these growing on-orbit spacecraft networks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really the same rocket architecture, it&#8217;s the same propellant, same factory, it&#8217;s the same printers, the same avionics and the same team that developed Terran 1,&#8221; Ellis said about the forthcoming rocket. That means that it&#8217;s actually relatively easy for the company to spin up its new production line, despite Terran R actually being quite functionally different than the current, smaller rocket — particularly when it comes to its full reusability.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Terran R will have both a reusable first and second stage. SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9&#8217;s first stage (a liquid fuel rocket booster) is reusable and detaches from the second stage before quickly reorienting itself and reentering Earth&#8217;s atmosphere for a propulsive landing just after entering space. The Falcon 9 second stage is expendable, which is the space term for essentially just junk that&#8217;s discarded and eventually de-orbits and burns up on reentry.</p>
<p>SpaceX had planned to try to make the Falcon 9 second stage reusable, but it would&#8217;ve required too much additional mass via heat shielding for it to make sense with the economics it was targeting. Ellis was light on details about Terran R&#8217;s specifics, but he did hint that some unique use of fairly unusual materials made possible though 3D printing, along with some sparing use of generative design, will be at work in helping the Relativity rocket&#8217;s second stage reusable in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s still entirely 3D-printed, we&#8217;re actually going to use more exotic materials and design geometries that wouldn&#8217;t be possible at all, traditionally, to manufacture,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just too complicated looking; it would be way too difficult to manufacture traditionally in the ways that Terran R is designed. And that will actually make it a much more reusable rocket, and really helped build the best reusable rocket possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terran R will also use a new upper-stage engine that Relativity Space is designing, which is also unique compared to the existing engines used on Terran 1. It&#8217;s 3D-printed as well, but uses a copper thrust chamber that will allow it to have higher overall power and thrust capabilities, according to Ellis. When I spoke to Ellis on Thursday evening, Relativity had just completed its first full successful duration test of the new engine, a key step toward full production.</p>
<p>Ellis said that the company will share more about Terran R over the course of this year, but did note that the existing large 3D printers in its production facilities are already sized correctly to start building the new rocket — &#8220;The only change is software,&#8221; he said. He also added that some of the test sites Relativity has contracted to use at NASA&#8217;s Stennis Space Center are able to support testing of a rocket at Terran R&#8217;s scale, too, so it sounds like he&#8217;s planning for rapid progress on this new launch vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://newness.com/">Newness</a>, a startup co-founded by former Twitch employees, has raised $3.5 million in a Sequoia-led seed round for its live-streaming platform aimed at beauty creators and their fan communities. Though today&#8217;s creators are not without options when it comes to livestreaming &#8212; Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook are all popular choices &#8212; Newness is focused on building differentiated tools and features that work well for the beauty streamer market in particular. This includes offering options for both public and private streams, engagement mechanisms that reward positive contributions, moderation features, and the ability for fans to earn access to free beauty products by community participation.</p>
<p>In the new round, Jess Lee invested on behalf of Sequoia Capital. Other investors in <a href="https://newness.com/">Newness</a> include Cowboy Ventures (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aileen-lee">Aileen Lee)</a>, Upside Partnership (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kent-goldman">Kent Goldman)</a>, Dream Machine (former TechCrunch editor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexia-tsotsis">Alexia Bonatsos</a>), Index Ventures (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nina-achadjian">Nina Achadjian</a>), Twitch co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlin3/">Kevin Lin</a>, former Twitch execs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshipman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshipman/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614378233472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFm84exhRM_tMimQ5UzW5bWNhj-Dg">Jonathan Shipman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-sutton-b986611/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-sutton-b986611/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614378233472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAVm0w-lsAvnzZLdzxEnutTIugGg">John Sutton</a>, Eventbrite founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hartz/">Kevin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliahartz/">Julia Hartz</a>, Incredible Health co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imanabuzeid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/imanabuzeid/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614378233472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-IkRj2ZLpeD3W5-QeVIqjFMXNxw">Iman Abuzeid</a>, and other angel investors from Twitch.</p>
<p>The idea for Newness comes from CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyqian">Jenny Qian</a>, an early Twitch employee who held a number of roles at the game-streaming site over the years, most recently as the Senior Director of Business Strategy for Twitch&#8217;s video platform. She&#8217;s joined by CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/youripark/">Youri Park</a>, who also previously worked at Twitch, as well as Blizzard and Facebook Gaming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though always an avid gamer herself, Qian says she began getting into skincare after she turned 30. She then soon realized the potential in the live-streaming beauty space.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so used to the format from Twitch. And, in some ways, I feel like I was spoiled with live-streaming,&#8221; she explains. Being able to hang out with streamers, ask questions, and learn from them was something that made the live format so compelling, she believes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118284" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118284" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118284" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg 3286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=1536,775 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1033 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.26.10-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118284" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Newness</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It made me scratch my head and think: why didn&#8217;t something like this exist for the beauty community? It&#8217;s a community that is just as passionate, if not more so&#8230;and it&#8217;s a content category that is so incredibly popular. How come there isn&#8217;t a live medium available?,&#8221; she wondered.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Qian admits she didn&#8217;t feel comfortable going live on Twitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to be made fun of for my gameplay. But I think it&#8217;s another if I take my makeup off, and people are making fun of me for how I look. It just cuts to a whole new level,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>With Newness, the goal is to create a sort of anti-Twitch, in a way. It aspires to be a wholesome, positive community for beauty creators and fans, where moderation is a key focus and fans get rewarded for quality participation, not trolling.</p>
<p>When creators go live, Newness will pair them with an in-house moderator to help them feel more comfortable and to keep the content flowing. Once they&#8217;re a more established streamer, Newness will work with the creator to locate and elevate a moderator from their own fan community to help out with future streams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans are awarded virtual items called crystals for positive participation and good behavior &#8212; for example, for watching your favorite stream and engaging in chat. In Newness, every chat message also has a little heart next to it. And the more hearts you earn over time for higher-quality comments, the more crystals you also earn.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118291" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118291" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118291" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg 1712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=768,663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=680,587 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1326 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-9.33.14-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118291" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Newness</p></div></p>
<p>These crystals can be redeemed for full-size beauty products, which Newness will source through brand deals. Because moderators spend more time on the platform, they&#8217;ll also earn more crystals &#8212; and that means more opportunities for products.</p>
<p>The positive reward system has so far proven successful during beta tests, as around 66% of Newness viewers, on average, end up chatting during live streams, Qian says.</p>
<p>Another differentiating feature for Newness is the ability for creators to host both public and private streams. The latter is not meant to be some sort of OnlyFans equivalent, but is instead focused on allowing creators to host more professional and exclusive live events. With private streams, creators can sell both general admission and even pricier VIP tickets that could come with some sort of reward &#8212; like a goodie bag of beauty supplies.</p>
<p>In addition to events, Newness supports an in-app tipping mechanism called &#8220;gifting&#8221; on everyday streams.</p>
<p>Eventually, the startup plans to take a share of the revenue these transactions generate, but it hasn&#8217;t yet rolled that out as it&#8217;s still beta testing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118469" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118469" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118469" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/livestream.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Newness</p></div></p>
<p>At present, the Newness community its small. And it still chooses which creators are allowed to live stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;We handpick the creators that we let on to our platform and keep it invite-only because we want to make sure that our earliest creators are helping to set the tone and building the culture of the community,&#8221; she says. The startup wants to ensure there are enough community members to sustain itself, while also not allowing the community to become toxic as it scales.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really care about cultivating an incredibly wholesome community. So for us, safety, moderation &#8212; all that is really important to us,&#8221; Qian notes.</p>
<p>The creators produce a range of content, including more expert advice and product reviews to more casual &#8220;get ready with me&#8221; videos and vlogs.</p>
<p>Newness, of course, will face steep competition from larger, existing platforms for streamers, like YouTube and Instagram, as well as from newcomers more focused on beauty videos, like <a href="https://supergreat.com/">Supergreat</a>.</p>
<p>The startup has been in beta testing since last year, and is only available on the web for the time being. With the seed funding, Newness expects to build out its iOS consumer app in 2021, to complement its dedicated streaming app for creators. (Creators can also opt to stream from their DSLRs, if they prefer.)</p>
<p>It also aims to hire engineering talent and build out its 14-person team that&#8217;s now spread out across San Francisco, New York (thanks to some ex-Glossier hires), and L.A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murder of George Floyd last May ignited many things in the United States last year &#8212; one of which that was perhaps unexpected: a rise in the number of digital banks targeting the Black community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of the Black community took their belief that big banks are not meeting their needs and turned them into startup concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those startups, First Boulevard (formerly called Tenth), has just raised $5 million in seed funding from Barclays, Anthemis and a group of angel investors such as actress Gabrielle Union, Union Square Ventures&#8217; John Buttrick and AutoZone CFO Jamere Jackson.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For co-founder and CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-j-hawkins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Hawkins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the genesis for the Overland, Kansas-bank came after Floyd’s murder, when he and friend </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asyabradley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asya Bradley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were talking about what Black America “really needed to get out of a vicious cycle” of dealing with the same issues with no real solutions in sight.</span></p>

Image Credits: <span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard</span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After viewing yet another tragedy engulf the Black community, and the all-too-familiar protests against persisting issues,” Hawkins said, “it was beyond clear to me that the solutions Black America needs must be financially focused and developed within our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair both had fintech experience. Hawkins had founded Griffin Technologies, a company focused on providing real-time, contextual intelligence to community banks and credit unions. And Bradley most recently was a founding team member and head of revenue at Synapse, a platform that built banking-as-a-service APIs to help bank the unbanked of America by connecting fintech platforms to banking institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They discovered there were only about 19 Black banks in the U.S., collectively holding about $5 billion in assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And their technology was really behind the times,” Hawkins said. “We also took a hard look at some of the existing digital banks to really see who was really going about it in the same way that we felt like America needed, and it was pretty clear at that point, that no one was really attacking the issue of helping Black America build some level of financial stability through the form of a wealth-building play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair formed First Boulevard last August under the premise that Black Americans are “massively underserved consumers” of financial products and services despite having a collective spending power of </span><a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/buying-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 trillion annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup’s mission is to empower Black Americans “to take control of their finances, build wealth and reinvest in the Black economy” via a digitally native platform. First Boulevard has 100,000 people on its waitlist currently with an expected launch in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Part of its goal with the new capital involves building out a Black business marketplace, which will give its members Cash Back for Buying Black<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. It also plans to use the money to expand its team, increase its customer base and grow its platform to offer fee-free debit cards, financial education and on developing technology to help members automate their saving and wealth-building goals.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;For more equitable startup funding, the &#8216;money behind the money&#8217; needs to be accountable, too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/for-more-equitable-startup-funding-the-money-behind-the-money-needs-to-be-accountable-too/embed/#?secret=4MJd2aT7do" data-secret="4MJd2aT7do" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">History has proven that oppressed communities can succeed when their finances are centralized, and when it comes to financial services for the Black community, a centralizing force is long overdue,” Hawkins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash Back for Buying Black<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> program helps members earn up to 15% cash back when they spend money at Black-owned businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe the most recent stat was that 41% of Black-owned businesses have closed since COVID-19 started,” Hawkins said. “We want to support them as much as we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard also is focused on passively building wealth for its communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black America as a whole has been blocked from learning how money works. We want to connect our members to wealth-building assets such as micro investments like money market accounts, high-yield savings and cryptocurrency &#8212; things that Black America has largely been blocked from,&#8221; Hawkins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley, who serves as First Boulevard’s COO, believes the current financial industry was not built to serve the needs of melanated people. Its goal is to take their understanding of the unique needs of the Black community to provide things such as early access to wages, round-up savings features, targeted financial education and budgeting tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair aims to have a “fully inclusive” team that represents the community it’s trying to serve. Currently, its 20-person staff is 60% Black and 85% BIPOC. Two-thirds of its leadership team are women and 100% is BIPOC. The company plans to boost its headcount to 50 by year&#8217;s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very proud of that considering that in the fintech space, those are not normal numbers from a leadership perspective,” Bradley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Palencsar, an investor at the Female Innovators Lab by Barclays and Anthemis, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that her firm has always recognized “that access to financial services has long remained a challenge despite the digital evolution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is especially true for Black Americans who often reside in financial deserts and struggle to find platforms that truly look to serve them,” she said. “First Boulevard deeply understands the challenge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palencsar believes that First Boulevard’s mission of helping Black Americans not just bank, but actually build wealth, is unique in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard sees the wealth gap that continues to grow within the U.S. and wants to build a digital banking platform that addresses the systemic and structural challenges that face this population while enabling Black Americans and allies to invest in the community,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also recently announced a partnership with Visa, under which First Boulevard will be first to pilot Visa’s new suite of crypto APIs. First Boulevard will also launch a First Boulevard Visa Debit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard is one of several digital banks geared toward Black Americans that have emerged in recent months. <a href="http://www.paybby.com">Paybby</a>, a digital bank for the Black and brown communities, recently acquired Wicket, a neobank that uses AI and biometric technology to create a personalized experience for users. Hassan Miah, the CEO and founder of Paybby, said the bank’s goal is to be “the leading smart, digital bank for the Black and brown communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paybby, which started by offering a bank account and a way to expedite PPP loans, will soon be adding a cryptocurrency savings account for the Black and brown communities.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black buying power is projected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2024,” Miah said. “Brown buying power is over $2 trillion. Paybby wants to take a good portion of this multitrillion-dollar market and give it back to these communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October,</span> Greenwood <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greenwood-closes-3-million-seed-round-to-build-online-banking-solution-for-blacks-and-latinx-301147915.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $3 million in seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from private investors to build what it describes as “the first digital banking platform for Black and Latinx people and business owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, co-founder Ryan Glover, founder of Bounce TV network, said it was “no secret that traditional banks have failed the Black and Latinx community.”</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. Before we get into this week&#8217;s show, make sure to check out all the news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/the-equity-podcast-is-getting-bigger-and-better/">here</a> about how Equity is expanding, and becoming even more of a thing in 2021! We are beyond hyped about it.</p>
<p>Coming on the back of such a wild news week, we had to cut and cut from the notes doc to get the show to size. So, here&#8217;s what made the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase filed to go public. Alex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">wrote about its S-1 filing here</a>, and Danny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/usv-has-been-aggressively-selling-off-shares-in-coinbase-in-run-up-to-ipo/">riffed on a fascinating nuance regarding its cap table here</a>.</li>
<li>Hopin is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">raising more money, at an even larger valuation</a>. Every time we cover the latest version of this story, we think it must be the last time. And then it happens again. So, check back here in October for when Hopin raises again.</li>
<li>Reddit also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/reddit-series-e-more-capital/">picked up more money</a>. Again. Our take is that the capital must mean that Reddit is a better business than we anticipated.</li>
<li>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian backed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/chief-community-officer-is-the-new-cmo/?tpcc=ECTW2020">new community tool</a> proving the monetary value of the community. That led us into a conversation about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/contra-series-a/">professional network for independent workers</a> that is competing with LinkedIn, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/the-landing-is-bringing-shoppable-social-and-collaboration-to-interior-design/">collaborative workspace for interior design fans. </a></li>
<li>Toast is said to be on the road to an IPO, so we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/?tpcc=ECTW2020">riffed on what Olo&#8217;s IPO can tell us</a> about the Boston-based unicorn.</li>
<li>Shippo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/shippo-raises-45m-more-at-495m-valuation-as-ecommerce-booms/">raised more money after a big 2020</a>; can the company double again in 2021?</li>
<li>Finix raised $3 million through an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/">SPV filled with more than 80 Black and LatinX investors. </a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wondering how to nail that virtual pitch meeting and raise VC funding? Or how to build a high-octane sales team? What about recruiting early team members that will fuel future growth? Managing the finances of a new company while also wondering about your own personal finances as a founder? Legal? Marketing? PR?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A little less than three years ago at the Computer Science Museum in Mountain View, California, the founders of a young company hailing from Cambridge, England addressed a crowd of celebrities, investors and entrepreneurs at Y Combinator&#8217;s August Demo Day promising a revolution in food science.</p>
<p>Over the years, the event has become a relatively low-tech, low-budget showcase for a group of tech investors and billionaire industry insiders to take a look at early-stage businesses that could be their next billion-dollar opportunity.</p>
<p>Sharing the stage with other innovation-minded budding entrepreneurs, the Cambridge scientists boasted of a technology that could produce a sweetener that would mimic not just the taste of sugar, but the caramelization and stickiness that makes sugar the go-to additive for the bulk of roughly 74% of packaged foods that are made with some form of sweetener.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/yc-summer-2018-demo-day-1-picks/"> Their company, Cambridge Glycoscience </a> could claim a huge slice of a market worth at least a $100 billion market, they said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, the company has a new name, Supplant, and $24 million in venture capital financing to start commercializing its low-cost sugar substitute made from the waste materials of other plants.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 startups that caught our eye from day 1 of YC Demo Day S18&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/yc-summer-2018-demo-day-1-picks/embed/#?secret=yGrgeuySga" data-secret="yGrgeuySga" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>The bitter history of the sweetest ingredient</h2>
<p>Sugar came into the human diet roughly 10,000 years ago as sugarcane, which is native to New Guinea and parts of Taiwan and China. Over the next 2,000 years the crop spread from those regions to Madagascar, and eventually took root in India, where it was first refined in about 500 BC.</p>
<p>From there, the sweetener spread across the known world. By the first century AD Greek and Roman scholars were referencing its medicinal properties and, after the Crusades, sugar consumption traveled across Europe through the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>It was a welcome replacement from Europe&#8217;s mainstay, honey, and the early artificial sweeteners used by the Romans, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-first-artificial-sweetener-poisoned-lots-of-romans-5877587">which contained near-lethal doses of lead</a>.</p>
<p>The cold climates of Northern Europe proved mostly inhospitable to sugarcane cultivation, so the plant took root in the more temperate South and the islands off Europe&#8217;s southern coast.</p>
<p>Those regions also became home to the first European experiments with agricultural slavery &#8212; a byproduct of the sugar trade, and one that would plant the seeds for the international exploitation of indigenous American and African labor for centuries as the industrial growth of sugar production spread to the New World.</p>
<p>First, European indentured servants and enslaved indigenous people&#8217;s powered the production of sugar in the Americas. But as native populations died off due to the introduction of European diseases, genocidal attacks and back-breaking labor, African slaves were brought to the new colonies to work the fields and mills to make refined sugar.</p>
<h2>Sugar hangover</h2>
<p>The horrors of slavery may be the most damning legacy of industrial sugar, but it&#8217;s far from the only problem caused by the human craving for sweeteners.</p>
<p>As climate change becomes more of a threat, fears of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-agriculture/brazil-cancels-decree-barring-sugarcane-cultivation-in-the-amazon-idUSKBN1XG311">increasing deforestation to meet the world&#8217;s demand &#8212; or to provide cover for other industrialization of virgin forests &#8212; have arisen</a> thanks to new policies in Brazil.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Conventional cane sugar is heavily water intensive,&#8221; said Supplant co-founder Tom Simmons in an interview. That&#8217;s another problem for the environment as water becomes the next resource to be stressed by the currents of climate change. And species&#8217; extinction presents another huge problem too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;The WWF number one source for biodiversity lost globally is cane sugar plantations,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;Sugar is a massive consumer of water and in contrast, there&#8217;s big sustainability pitch for what we do&#8230; the raw materials are products of the current agricultural industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And the quest for sugar substitutes in the U.S. has come with related health costs as high-fructose corn syrup has made its way into tons of American products. Invented in 1957, corn syrup is one of the most common sweeteners used to replace sugar &#8212; and one that&#8217;s thought to have incredibly disastrous effects on the health of consumers worldwide.</p>
<p>The use of corn syrup has been linked to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-high-fructose-corn-syrup-is-bad#The-bottom-line-">an increasing prevalence of diabetes, obesity and fatty liver disease</a> in the world&#8217;s population.</p>

<h2>Looking for a healthier substitute</h2>
<p>As Supplant and its investors look to take the crown as the reigning replacement for sugar, they join a long line of would-be occupants to sugar&#8217;s throne.</p>
<p>The first viable, non-toxic chemically derived sugar substitute was discovered in the late 18th century by a German chemist. Called saccharine, it was popularized initially during sugar shortages caused by the first World War and gained traction during the health crazes of the sixties and seventies.</p>
<p>Saccharin, still available in pink Sweet&#8217;N Low packets and a host of products, was succeeded by aspartame (known commercially as Equal and present as the sugar substitute in beverages like Diet Coke), which was supplanted by sucralose (known as Splenda).</p>
<p>These chemically derived sweeteners have been the standard on the market for decades now, but with a growing push for natural &#8212; rather than chemical &#8212; substitutes for sugar and their failures to act as a replacement for all of the things that sugar can do as a food ingredient, the demand for a better sugar has never been higher.</p>
<h2>Supplanting the competition</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not everything that we back is going to change the world. This, at scale, does that,&#8221; said Aydin Senkut, the founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, the venture firm that&#8217;s one of Supplant&#8217;s biggest backers. </span></p>
<p>Part of what convinced Senkut is the fact that Supplant&#8217;s sweetener has already received preliminary approvals in the European Union by the region&#8217;s regulatory equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration. That approval not only covers the sale of Supplant&#8217;s product as a sweetener, but also as a probiotic with tangible health benefits he said.</p>
<p>So not only is the Supplant product arguably a better and more direct sugar replacement, as the founders claim, it also has health benefits through providing increased fiber in consumers who use it regularly, Senkut said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The European FDA is even stricter than the U.S. FDA,&#8221; Senkut said. &#8220;[And] they got pre-approval for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senkut and Felicis invested in Cambridge Glycosciences almost immediately after seeing the company&#8217;s presentation at Y Combinator.</p>
<p>&#8220;We became the largest investors at seed,&#8221; Senkut said.</p>
<p>Its selling points were the product&#8217;s extremely low glycemic index and its ability to be manufactured from waste plant fibers, which means that it ultimately can be produced at a lower cost, according to Senkut.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the difference?</h2>
<p>Supplant differs from its competition in a number of other key ways, according to company co-founder Tom Simmons.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While companies like the Israeli startup <a href="https://www.douxmatok.com/">DouxMatok</a> or Colorado&#8217;s MycoTechnology and Wisconsin&#8217;s Sensient work on developing additives from fungus or tree roots or bark that can enhance the sweetness of sugars, Supplant uses alternative sugars to create its sweetener, Simmons said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The core difference is they’re working with cane sugar,&#8221; according to Simmons. &#8220;Our pitch is we make sugars from fiber so you don’t need to use cane sugar.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Simmons said that these other startups have been approaching the problem from the wrong direction. &#8220;The problem that their technology addresses isn&#8217;t the problem the industry has,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about texture, bulking, caramelization and crystallization&#8230; We have a technology that&#8217;s going to give you the same sweetness gram for gram.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are six different types of calorific sugar, Simmons explained. There&#8217;s lactose, which is the sugar in milk; sucrose, which comes from sugarcane and sugar beets; maltose, found in grains like wheat and barley; fructose, the sugar in fruits and honey; glucose, which is in nearly everything, but especially carbohydrate-laden vegetables, fruits and grains; and galactose, a simple sugar that derives from the breakdown of lactose.</p>
<p>Simmons said that his company&#8217;s sugar substitute isn&#8217;t based on one compound, but is derived from a range of things that come from fiber. The use of fibers means that the body recognizes the compounds as fibrous and treats them the same way in the digestive tract, but the products taste and act like sugar in food, he said. &#8220;Fiber-derived sugars are in the category of sugars, but are not the calorific sugars,&#8221; said Simmons.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118311" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118311" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2118311" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="625" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=768,469 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=2048,1250 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-51829869.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118311" class="wp-caption-text">NEW YORK &#8211; DECEMBER 6: Packets of the popular sugar substitute Splenda are seen December 6, 2004 in New York City.

<h2>Trust the process?</h2>
<p>Supplant&#8217;s technology uses enzymes to break down and fragment various fibers. &#8220;As you start breaking it down, it starts looking molecularly like sucrose &#8212; like cane sugar &#8212; so it starts behaving in a similar way,&#8221; said Simmons.</p>
<p>This is all the result of years of research that Simmons began at Cambridge University, he said. &#8220;I arrived at Cambridge intending to be a professor. I did not arrive in Cambridge intending to start a business. I was interested in doing science, making inventions and stuff that would reach the wider world. I always imagined the right way for me to do that was to be a professor.&#8221;</p>
<p>In time, after receiving his doctorate and beginning his post-doctoral work into the research that would eventually turn into Supplant, Simmons realized that he had to start a company. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">To try and do something impactful I was going to have leave the university,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>In some ways, Supplant operates at the intersection of all of Simmons&#8217; interests in health, nutrition and sustainability. And he said the company has plans to apply the processing technology across a range of consumer products, eventually, but for now the company remains focused on the $100 billion sugar substitute market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s a handful of different core underlying scientific approaches in different spaces,&#8221; he said. The sort of things that go into personal care and homecare. Those chemicals. A big drive in the industry is for both less harsh and harsh chemicals in shampoos but also to do so in a way that’s sustainable. That&#8217;s made from a sustainable source but also biodegradable.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>With the money that the company has now raised from investors including <a href="https://mantaray.vc/">Manta Ray</a>, <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla Ventures</a>, Felicis, <a href="https://www.somacap.com/">Soma Capital</a> and Y Combinator, Supplant is now going to prove its products in a few very targeted test runs.* The first is a big launch with a celebrity chef, which Simmons teased, but did not elaborate on.</p>
<p>Senkut said that the company&#8217;s rollout would be similar to the ways in which Impossible Foods went to market, beginning with a few trial runs in higher-end restaurants and foodstuffs before trying to make a run at a mass consumer market.</p>
<p>The feedstocks for Supplant&#8217;s sugar substitute come from sugarcane bagasse and wheat and rice husks, and the processing equipment comes from the brewing industry. That&#8217;s going to be a benefit as the company looks to build out an office in the U.S. as it establishes a foothold for a larger manufacturing presence down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re t<span style="font-weight: 400;">aking known science and applying it in the food industry where we know that it has value,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not inventing any brand new enzymes and each part of the process &#8212; none of it on their own are new. The discovery that these sugars work well and can replace cane sugar. That’s something that no one has done before. Most sugars don’t behave like cane sugar in food. They’re too dry, they’re too wet, they’re too hard, they’re too soft.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Ultimately the consumer product&#8217;s mission resonates highly for Simmons and his 20-person team. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re going to use these hugely abundant renewable resources produced all around the world,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

TechCrunch understands Brandwatch’s key executive team will be staying on. The move combines two large players to offer a broad range of services, from PR to marketing and online customer engagement. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Cision has a media contact database of approximately 1 million journalists and media outlets and claims to have over 75,000 customers. Brandwatch applies AI and machine learning to the practice known as &#8220;social listening&#8221;.</p>
<p>Along the way, Brandwatch raised a total of around $65 million. It was Series A-funded by <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nauta-capital">Nauta Capital</a>, </span>followed by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/highland-capital-partners-europe">Highland Europe</a> and then <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/partech">Partech</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Giles Palmer, founder, and CEO of Brandwatch said: “We have always built Brandwatch with ambition… Now is the time to take the next step – joining a company of significant scale to create a business and a suite of products that can have an important global impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abel Clark, CEO of Cision said: “The continued digital shift and widespread adoption of social media is rapidly and fundamentally changing how brands and organizations engage with their customers. This is driving the imperative that PR, marketing, social, and customer care teams fully incorporate the unique insights now available into consumer-led strategies. Together, Cision and Brandwatch will help our clients to more deeply understand, connect and engage with their customers at scale across every channel.”</p>
<p>Brandwatch has been on an almost case-study of a journey from fundraising to acquisition to a merger, but less characteristically for a well-funded tech company, it did much of it from its hometown of Brighton, on the southern coast of England.</p>
<p>The financing journey began for Giles Palmer, with angel funding in 2006. In 2010 Brandwatch raised $1.5 million from Durrants, a marketing and PR firm, and a Series A round from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nauta-capital">Nauta Capital</a>. In 2014 it raised $22 million in funding in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/brandwatch-raises-22m-to-boost-its-social-media-monitoring-platform/">Series B round</a> led by Highland Europe. That was followed by a $33 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/social-intelligence-startup-brandwatch-raises-33m-series-c-to-grow-in-us/">Series C financing</a> led by Partech Ventures in 2015.</p>
<p>With the war chest, it went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/social-media-monitor-brandwatch-acquires-content-marketing-platform-buzzsumo/">acquire</a> BuzzSumo in 2017, a content marketing and influencer identification platform, for an undisclosed sum. And in 2019 Brandwatch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/social-intelligence-platforms-brandwatch-and-crimson-hexagon-merge/">merged </a>with a similar business, Crimson Hexagon, creating a business with around $100 million in ARR. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/brandwatch-turns-its-war-chest-on-acquiring-market-research-startup-qriously/">acquired</a> the London-based SaaS research platform Qriously.</p>
<p>Brandwatch was recently <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/p/forrester-2020-social-listening-wave/">named</a> a leader in Forrester’s guide for buyers of social listening solutions.</p>

<p>The Black Mirror-style pull of seeing long-lost relatives &#8212; or famous people from another era &#8212; brought to a synthetic approximation of life, eyes swivelling, faces tilting as if they&#8217;re wondering why they&#8217;re stuck inside this useless digital photo frame, has led to an inexorable <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">stream of social shares since it was unveiled yesterday at a family history conference&#8230; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">MyHeritage&#8217;s AI-powered viral marketing playbook with this deepfakery isn&#8217;t a complicated one: They&#8217;re going straight for tugging on your heart strings to grab data that can be used to drive sign-ups for their other (paid) services. (Selling DNA tests is their main business.)</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s free to animate a photo using the &#8220;deep nostalgia&#8221; tech on MyHeritage&#8217;s site, but you don&#8217;t get to see the result until you hand over at least an email (along with the photos you want animated, ofc) &#8212; and agree to its T&amp;Cs and privacy policy. Both of which have attracted a number of concerns over the years.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/the-norwegian-consumer-council-reports-myheritage-for-unlawful-terms-and-conditions/">Norwegian Consumer Council</a> reported MyHeritage to the national consumer protection and data authorities after a legal assessment of the T&amp;Cs found the contract it asks customers to sign to be &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/myheritage-breach-exposes-92m-emails-and-hashed-passwords/">2018</a> MyHeritage also suffered a major data breach &#8212; and data from that breach was later <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/">found for sale</a> on the dark web, among a wider cache of hacked account info pertaining to several other services.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MyHeritage breach exposes 92M emails and hashed passwords&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/myheritage-breach-exposes-92m-emails-and-hashed-passwords/embed/#?secret=od34v0fZ9U" data-secret="od34v0fZ9U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company &#8212; which, as we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/francisco-partners-is-acquiring-myheritage-sources-say-for-600m/">earlier this week</a>, is being acquired by a U.S. private equity firm for ~$600 million &#8212; is doubtless relying on the deep pull of nostalgia to smooth over any individual misgivings about handing over data and agreeing to its terms.</p>
<p>The face animation technology itself is impressive enough &#8212; if you set aside the ethics of encouraging people to drag their long-lost relatives into the uncanny valley to help MyHeritage cross-sell DNA testing (with all the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-08/man-in-the-window">massive privacy considerations</a> around putting that kind of data in the hands of a commercial entity).</p>
<p>Looking at the inquisitive face of my <a href="https://myhr.tg/1hZSY9gd">great-grandmother</a> I do have to wonder what she would have made of all this?</p>
<p>The facial animation feature is powered by Israeli company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/d-id-the-israeli-company-that-digitally-de-identifies-faces-in-videos-and-still-images-raises-13-million/">D-ID</a>, a TechCrunch Disrupt battlefield alum &#8212; which started out building tech to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/d-id-nabs-4m-to-protect-images-from-being-read-by-facial-recognition-algorithms/">digitally de-identify faces</a> with an eye on protecting images and video from being identifiable by facial recognition algorithms.</p>
<p>It released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxJMzNR_i5w">demo video</a> of the newer, photo-animating technology last year. The tech uses a driver video to animate the photo &#8212; mapping facial features from the photo onto that base driver to create a &#8220;live portrait&#8221;, as D-ID calls it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Live Portrait solution brings still photos to life. The photo is mapped and then animated by a driver video, causing the subject to move its head and facial features, mimicking the motions of the driver video,&#8221; D-ID said in a press release. &#8220;This technology can be implemented by historical organizations, museums, and educational programs to animate well-known figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s offering live portraits as part of a wider &#8220;AI Face&#8221; platform, which will offer third parties access to other deep learning, computer vision and image processing technologies. D-ID bills the platform as a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for synthesized video creation.</p>
<p>Other tools include a &#8220;face anonymization&#8221; feature, which replaces one person&#8217;s face on video with another&#8217;s (such as for documentary film makers to protect a whistleblower&#8217;s identity); and a &#8220;talking heads&#8221; feature that can be used for lip syncing or to replace the need to pay actors to appear in content such as marketing videos as it can turn an audio track into a video of a person appearing to speak those words.</p>
<p>The age of synthesized media is going to be a weird one, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are big investment firms, and then there are big investment firms. <a href="https://www.brookfield.com/">Brookfield Asset Management</a>, the Toronto-based,122-year-old outfit whose current market cap is $63 billion and that oversees $600 billion in assets, clearly falls into the latter camp. Think real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private equity, and credit. If it falls into a defined asset class, Brookfield probably has it in its portfolio.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also true of venture capital, though venture is new enough to Brookfield that founders who might like its capital are still getting the memo. Indeed, it was a little less than four years ago that Brookfield Technology Partners began investing off the company&#8217;s balance sheet and soon after recruited Josh Raffaelli &#8212; a Stanford MBA who cut his teeth as a principal with Draper Fisher Jurvetson, then spent another five years with Silver Lake &#8212; to lead the practice.</p>
<p>Its existence came as a surprise to him, actually. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a tech investor in Silicon Valley,&#8221; says Raffaelli. &#8220;My entire professional career has been in a 15-minute drive from the house I grew up in. And I had never heard about Brookfield before they started this practice because it&#8217;s in businesses. It&#8217;s in real estate. It has done things that are not generally tech-enabled.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not until fairly recently, that is. Raffaelli and his 11-person team have not only made dozens of bets since then, but they’re currently investing out of a pool of capital that features third party capital in addition to that of Brookfield — which is a first. As for what they are looking for, the idea is help Brookfield reimagine how its many office towers, malls and other real estate might be used or developed or leased or insured. It’s to make Brookfield smarter, better prepared, and more profitable. In return, the startups get industry expertise &#8212; and a major customer in Brookfield.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, its bets have varied widely, as with <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/iot-security-startup-armis-doubles-valuation-to-2b-with-125m-round">Armis</a>, an IoT startup focused on unmanaged device security; <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/renewable-investment-wave-continues-as-solar-lending-company-loanpal-raises-800-million/">Loanpal</a>, a point-of-sale payment platform for solar and other home efficiency products; and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/carbon-health-raises-100-million-with-plans-to-expand-pop-up-clinics-ahead-of-covid-19-vaccination-programs/">Carbon Health</a>, a primary care company that blends real-world and virtual visits. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting our themes effectively from the Brookfield ecosystem,&#8221; Raffaelli says.</p>
<p>Pulling back the curtain a bit more, Raffaelli says his team writes checks of $25 million to $50 million dollars and that they look for companies with $10 million in revenue that are seeing top-line year-over-year growth of more than 100%. In terms of pacing, they jump into roughly one new deal per quarter.</p>
<p>The fund is also independent and has its own custom committee, but the committee is made up of the senior managing partners from each line of Brookfield&#8217;s businesses. (&#8220;These are the people that actually help us translate our investment themes that we&#8217;re generating here,&#8221; Raffaelli notes.)</p>
<p>To highlight how the operation works, Raffaelli points to <a href="https://www.latch.com/">Latch</a>, a smart access software business that announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/">last month</a> that it&#8217;s using a blank-check company backed by the real estate giant Tishman Speyer to become publicly traded. Brookfield owns roughly 70,000 multifamily units in North America, &#8220;so we have a lot of doors that need a lot of locks,&#8221; Raffaelli says. Latch, of course, is not the only smart access lock out there, so Brookfield ran &#8220;what was almost like a mini [proposal process], reaching out to all different companies in the market to understand how they compete,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>It was a &#8220;six-month exercise,&#8221; but ultimately, his group led Latch&#8217;s Series B round in 2018 and since then, Brookfield was bought about 7,000 blocks from the business. That&#8217;s meaningful, considering that when Brookfield first invested, the company had less than $20 million in bookings and those 7,000 locks have since brought in an additional $10 million to $15 million in revenue, Raffaelli says. &#8220;When we buy a lot of things at that stage of a company,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;we&#8217;re enhancing their trajectory.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="biH9QGBgLo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/">Smart lock maker Latch teams with real estate firm to go public via SPAC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Smart lock maker Latch teams with real estate firm to go public via SPAC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/embed/#?secret=biH9QGBgLo" data-secret="biH9QGBgLo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not a foolproof strategy, doubling down. If Latch&#8217;s locks turned out to be lemons (they haven&#8217;t), Brookfield would be out a big check along with a sizable capital expenditure. It&#8217;s why Brookfield takes its time, says Raffaelli, adding that if he has done his job right, his team is involved with a company well before it is raising a round and already shown that it is a &#8220;strategic partner that has another lever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Either way, Raffaelli says that while the commercial real estate market has been hard hit by the pandemic, it has, counterintuitively, been a productive time for his group given the stronger incentive it has given the real estate world to adopt tech tools faster.</p>
<p>Among the bets about which Raffaelli sounds most enthusiastic right now is <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.vts.com/">VTS</a>, for example, a leasing and asset management platform that can show properties remotely, and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://deliverr.com/">Deliverr</a>, an e-commerce fulfillment startup that Raffaelli describes as &#8220;Amazon Prime for everybody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Raffaelli convincingly argues that while the use case for a lot of real estate is changing,  the so-called built world remains Brookfield&#8217;s strongest competitive advantage given the size of its footprint.  The way he sees it, its options going forward are plentiful. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking at retail locations becoming ghost kitchens; you&#8217;re looking at retail locations turning into distribution and logistics facilities. We can turn physical locations into healthcare sites for [our portfolio company] Carbon Health, and our mall locations into locations for urgent care and primary care clinics for testing and vaccinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will never be a completely seamless transition. Brookfield has to be &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; given the pandemic and its devastating impacts, too. But Raffaelli comes across as excited in conversation nonetheless. The idea of turning physical real estate into a &#8220;mechanism for change within technology businesses,&#8221; he says, is a &#8220;very powerful place to be.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://raenabeauty.com/">Raena</a> was founded in 2019 to create personal care brands with top social media influencers. After several launches, however, the Singapore-based startup noticed an interesting trend: customers were ordering batches of products from Raena every week and reselling them on social media and e-commerce platforms like Shopee and Tokopedia. Last year, the company decided to focus on those sellers, and pivoted to social commerce.</p>
<p>Today Raena announced it has raised a Series A of $9 million, co-led by Alpha Wave Incubation and Alpha JWC Ventures, with participation from AC Ventures and returning investors Beenext, Beenos and Strive. Its last funding announcement was a $1.82 million seed round announced in July 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Raena raises $1.82 million to help influencers in Southeast Asia launch their own consumer brands&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/raena-raises-1-82-million-to-help-influencers-in-southeast-asia-launch-their-own-consumer-brands/embed/#?secret=oazPaFDkap" data-secret="oazPaFDkap" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After interviewing people who had set up online stores with products from Raena, the company&#8217;s team realized that sellers&#8217; earnings potential was capped because they were paying retail prices for their inventory.</p>
<p>They also saw that even though new C2C retail models, like social commerce, are gaining popularity, the beauty industry&#8217;s supply chain hasn&#8217;t kept up. Sellers usually need to order minimum quantities, which makes it harder for people to start their own businesses, Raena co-founder Sreejita Deb told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, you have to block your capital upfront. It&#8217;s difficult for individual sellers or micro-entrepreneurs to work with the old supply chain and categories like beauty,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Raena decided to pivot to serve those entrepreneurs. The company provides a catalog that includes mostly Japanese and Korean skincare and beauty brands. For those brands, Raena represents a way to enter new markets like Indonesia, which the startup estimates has $20 billion market opportunity.</p>
<p>Raena resellers, who are mostly women between 18 to 34 years old in Indonesia and Malaysia, pick what items they want to feature on their social media accounts. Most use TikTok or Instagram for promotion, and set up online stores on Shopee or Tokopedia. But they don’t have to carry inventory. When somebody buys a product from a Raena reseller, the reseller orders it from Raena, which ships it directly to the customer.</p>
<p>This drop-shipping model means resellers make higher margins. Because they don&#8217;t have to buy their inventory, it also dramatically lowers the barrier to launching a small business. Even though Raena&#8217;s pivot to social commerce coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, Deb said it grew its revenue 50 times between January and December 2020. The platform now has more than 1,500 resellers, and claims a 60% seller retention rate after six months on the platform.</p>
<p>She attributes Raena&#8217;s growth to several factors, including the increase in online shopping during lockdowns and people looking for ways to earn additional income during the pandemic. While forced to stay at home, people also <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/social-media-habits-during-pandemic">began spending more time online</a>, especially on the social media platforms that Raena resellers use.</p>
<p>Raena also benefited from its focus on skincare. Though many retail categories, including color cosmetics, took a hit, <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/the-beauty-trends-customers-are-buying-during-covid-19">skincare products proved resilient</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw skincare had higher margins, and there are certain markets that are experts at formulating and producing skincare products, and demand for those products in other parts of the world,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve continued being a skincare company and because that is a category we had insight into, it was our first entry point into this social selling model as well. Ninety percent of our sales are skincare,&#8221; Deb added. &#8220;Our top-selling products are serums, toners, essences, which makes a lot of sense because people are in their homes and have more time to dedicate to their skincare routines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Social commerce, which allows people to earn a side income (or even a full-time income), by leveraging their social media networks, has taken off in several Asian markets. In China, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/">Pinduoduo has become a formidable rival</a> to Alibaba through its group-selling model and focus on fresh produce. In India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/meesho-india">Meesho resellers</a> sell products like clothing through social media platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Social commerce is also gaining traction in Southeast Asia, with gross merchandise value growing threefold during the first half of 2020, <a href="https://ikala.tv/news/social-commerce-surges-in-southeast-asia/">according to iKala</a>.</p>
<p>Deb said one of the ways Raena is different from other social commerce companies is that most of its resellers are selling to customers they don’t know, instead of family and friends. Many already had TikTok or Instagram profiles focused on beauty and skincare, and had developed reputations for being knowledgeable about products.</p>
<p>As Raena develops, it plans to hire a tech team to build tools that will simplify the process of managing orders and also strike deals directly with manufacturers to increase profit margins for resellers. The funding will be used to increase its team from 15 to over 100 over the next three months, and it plans to enter more Southeast Asian markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tim Hortons, the Canadian coffee and doughnut giant, has raised a new round of funding for its Chinese venture. The investment is led by Sequoia China with participation from Tencent, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/tim-hortons-eyes-china-coffee-drinkers-with-tencent-investment/">digital partner in China</a>, and Eastern Bell Capital. The round comes two years after Tim Hortons made its foray into China&#8217;s booming coffee industry.</p>
<p>Tim Hortons didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of its latest fundraise but noted in a <a href="https://weibo.com/6969784101/K3G7jvUI7?from=page_1006066969784101_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime">social media post</a> that the proceeds will be used for opening more stores, building its digital infrastructure, brand presence and more.</p>
<p>Tencent, the Chinese social media and entertainment behemoth, first backed the 57-year-old Canadian coffee chain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/tim-hortons-eyes-china-coffee-drinkers-with-tencent-investment/">last May</a>. At the time the tie-up was seen as Tencent&#8217;s move to counter archrival Alibaba&#8217;s alliance with Starbucks to deliver coffee and help the American coffee titan go digital in China.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tim Hortons&#8217; collaboration with the WeChat parent is in a similar vein. It has so far accumulated three million members through its WeChat mini program, a type of lightweight app that runs within the instant messenger. To appeal to young Chinese consumers, Tim Hortons opened <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU2MTM3NjE5Mg==&amp;mid=2247485088&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=21ce8625300c131ca23a8797a60a3f8d&amp;chksm=fc78f80fcb0f7119766b4e140910a421b2fcc18ea945190febfbdde5b0a2540ed23735eabf9c&amp;scene=21#wechat_redirect">an esports-themed café</a> with Tencent, China&#8217;s biggest gaming company.</p>
<p>Two years into operating in China, Tim Hortons says it has reached storefront-level profitability with a footprint of 150 locations across 10 major cities. It plans to add more than 200 locations in 2021 and reach 1,500 stores nationwide in the next few years.</p>
<p>The dramatic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/chinas-luckin-coffee-raises-up-to-651m-in-upsized-us-ipo/">rise</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/following-multiple-scandals-including-luckin-coffee-nasdaq-ready-to-tighten-rules-on-ipo-listings/">fall</a> of coffee delivery startup Luckin brought the prospects of China&#8217;s coffee market to the forefront. Despite the investment frenzy around Luckin and other coffee businesses, coffee drinking still has a relatively low penetration in China compared to countries like the United States and Germany. On the other hand, coffee consumption is growing at a much faster rate of 15% in China, well above the global average of 2%, and is projected to reach 1 trillion yuan ($150 million) in 2025, according to a 2020 <a href="https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H3_AP202004021377475527_1.pdf?1585842837000.pdf">report</a> by Dongxing Securities.</p>
