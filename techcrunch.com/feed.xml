										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before you can improve a workflow, you have to understand how work advances through a business, which is more complex than you might imagine inside a large enterprise. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://celonis.com">Celonis</a> comes in. It uses software to identify how work moves through an organization and suggests more efficient ways of getting the same work done, also known as process mining</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a significant partnership with <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> where IBM Global Services will train 10,000 consultants worldwide on Celonis. The deal gives Celonis, a company with around 1200 employees access to the massive selling and consulting unit, while IBM gets a deep understanding of a piece of technology that is at the front end of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">the workflow automation trend</a>.</p>
<p>Miguel Milano, chief revenue officer at Celonis says that digitizing processes has been a trend for several years. It has sped up due to COVID, and it&#8217;s partly why the two companies have decided to work together. &#8220;Intelligent workflows, or more broadly spoken workflows built to help companies execute better, are at the heart of this partnership and it&#8217;s at the heart of this trend now in the market,&#8221; Milano said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other part of this is that IBM now owns Red Hat, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/29/assessing-ibms-34-billion-red-hat-acquisition/">acquired in 2018 for $34 billion</a>. The two companies believe that by combining the Celonis technology, which is cloud based, with Red Hat, which can span the hybrid world of on premises and cloud, the two together can provide a much more powerful solution to follow work wherever it happens.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think that moving the [Celonis] software into the Red Hat OpenShift environment is hugely powerful because it does allow in what&#8217;s already a very powerful open solution to now operate across this hybrid cloud world, leveraging the power of OpenShift which can straddle the worlds of mainframe, private cloud and public cloud. And data straddle those worlds, and will continue to straddle those worlds,&#8221; Mark Foster, senior vice president at IBM Services explained.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Celonis pushes beyond process mining into automated workflow tooling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/celonis-moves-beyond-process-discovery-into-automated-workflow-tooling/embed/#?secret=DcPr5gOwr9" data-secret="DcPr5gOwr9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You might think that IBM, which acquired <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises">robotic process automation vendor</a>, WDG Automation last summer, would simply attempt to buy Celonis, but Foster says the partnership is consistent with the company&#8217;s attempt to partner with a broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that this is very much part of an overarching focus of IBM with key ecosystem partners. Some of them are going to be bigger, some of them are going to be smaller, and [&#8230;] I think this is one where we see the opportunity to connect with an organization that&#8217;s taking a leading position in its category, and the opportunity for that to take advantage of the IBM Red Hat technologies…&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The companies had already been working together for some time prior to this formal announcement, and this partnership is the culmination of that. As this firmer commitment to one another goes into effect, the two companies will be working more closely to train thousands of IBM consultants on the technology, while moving the Celonis solution into Red Hat OpenShift in the coming months.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly a big deal with the feel of an acquisition, but Milano says that this is about executing his company&#8217;s strategy to work with more systems integrators (SIs), and while IBM is a significant partner it&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are becoming an SI consulting-driven organization. So we put consulting companies like IBM at the forefront of our strategy, and this [deal] is a big cornerstone of our strategy,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From the earliest days of the pandemic, it was no secret that video chat was about to become a very hot space.</p>
<p>Over the past several months investors have bankrolled a handful of video startups with specific niches, ranging from always-on office surveillance to platforms that encouraged plenty of mini calls to avoid the need for more lengthy team-wide meetings. As the pandemic wanes and plenty of startups begin to look toward hybrid office models, there are others who have decided to lean into embracing a fully remote workforce, a strategy that may require new tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getpingpong.com/">PingPong</a>, a recent launch from Y Combinator&#8217;s latest batch, is building an asynchronous video chat app for the workplace. We selected PingPong as one of our favorite startups that debuted last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Our favorite companies from Y Combinator’s W21 Demo Day: Part 2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/embed/#?secret=04IbtlENHk" data-secret="04IbtlENHk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s central sell is that for remote teams, there needs to be a better alternative to Slack or email for catching up with co-workers across time zones. While Zoom calls might be able to convey a company&#8217;s culture better than a post in a company-wide Slack channel, for fully remote teams operating on different continents, scheduling a company-wide meeting is often a nonstarter.</p>
<p>PingPong is selling its service as an addendum to Slack that helps remote product teams collaborate and convey what they&#8217;re working on. Users can capture a short video of themselves and share their screen in lieu of a standup presentation and then they can get caught up on each other&#8217;s progress on their own time. PingPong&#8217;s hope is that users find more value in brainstorming, conducting design reviews, reporting bugs and more inside while using asynchronous video than they would with text.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot to do before we can replace Slack, so right now we kind of emphasize playing nice with Slack,&#8221; PingPong CEO Jeff Whitlock tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our longer-term vision is that what young people are doing in their consumer lives, they bring into the enterprise when they graduate into the workforce. You and I were using Instant Messenger all the time in the early 2000s and then we got to the workplace, that was the opportunity for Slack&#8230; We believe in the next five or so years, something that&#8217;s a richer, more asynchronous video-based Slack alternative will have a lot more interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Building a chat app specifically designed for remote product teams operating in multiple time zones is a tight niche for now, but Whitlock believes that this will become a more common problem as companies embrace the benefits of remote teams post-pandemic. PingPong costs $100 per user per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Longtime venture capitalist Hans Tung is a big guy. His size might just be lifesaving.</p>
<p>A first-generation Taiwanese-American who came to the U.S. and to LA specifically in 1984, it was a fraught time for the then 14-year-old. Two years earlier, a 27-year-old, Chinese-American draftsman named Vincent Chin was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/who-vincent-chin-history-relevance-1982-killing-n771291">beaten to death</a> in Detroit by a Chrysler plant supervisor and his stepson, a laid-off autoworker, who believed that Chin was of Japanese descent and were angry over the growing success of Japan&#8217;s auto industry. He was killed the night of his own bachelor party.</p>
<p>Anti-Asian sentiment may have seemed to lessen over the following decades, but it has still remained constant, and Tung as been on the receiving end of it, he says. &#8220;Growing up, I faced my share of taunts, of racial epithets, whether it was in California or Boston or New York. I&#8217;m fortunate that I&#8217;m over 6&#8217;4&#8243; tall and weigh more than 200 pounds,&#8221; or he might be physically harassed at some point, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tung has never been more mindful of his dimensions than now, with anti-Asian sentiment abruptly worsening last year based on political rhetoric about the coronavirus. &#8220;As COVID broke out in China, we knew that Asian Americans would be blamed,&#8221; says Tung, who flies back and forth to China routinely for work as a managing director with the cross-border investment firm GGV Capital. &#8220;We saw this with SARS, too, but it wasn&#8217;t as big a pandemic, so people were being harassed and not killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Tung believes life is more dangerous right now for Asians in the U.S. based on conversations with friends and family members and the worrisome headlines to emerge of elderly individuals in particular being beaten on the streets of <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/03/17/elderly-asian-woman-beats-up-man-attacking-her-in-san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-nab-suspect-elderly-asian-american-man-attacked/story?id=76371868">Oakland</a> and on <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/03/30/asian-man-beaten-unconscious-on-subway/">New York subways</a> and outside of Times Square, as happened on Monday when a 65-year-old woman was <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nypd-arrests-suspect-in-brutal-beating-on-65-year-old-asian-woman/2973656/">viciously attacked</a> in a scene that was filmed by an onlooker and has provoked national outrage.</p>
<p>The numbers back him up. From 2019 to 2020, overall hate crime rate declined while hate crimes targeting Asians increased, as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-nearly-150-2020-mostly-n-n1260264">first reported by NBC</a> and based on analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Overall, its examination revealed that while such crimes decreased overall by 7% last year, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150%, with the biggest surge in New York, where anti-Asian hate crimes rose from three in 2019 to 28 last year, an 833% increase.</p>
<p>With those numbers seemingly continuing to climb in 2021, Tung and his partners at GGV Capital decided to take action two weeks ago, quickly settling on what they do best, which is to respond to the rising violence with their financial muscle and network. A first step was <a href="https://twitter.com/GGVCapital/status/1372776918156648452">publicly</a> offering to match $100,000 in donations to organizations that support the AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) communities. GGV&#8217;s move was almost immediately matched by other investors and founders eager to help, including Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners and Eric Kim and Chi-Hua Chien of Goodwater Capital, who are also matching up to $100,000 in donations.</p>
<p>Fast-forward and Tung says that 11 days into GGV&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/GGVCapital/status/1377305038796681218">de facto Twitter campaign</a>, roughly $5 million in donations have now been made by more than 175 founders (including Jen Rubio, Stewart Butterfield and Eric Yuan) and members of more than 30 venture firms in a kind of partnership that is &#8220;rare to see in the VC community,&#8221; Tung notes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great start, says Tung, who is among the 15% of Asian-Pacific Islanders who are partners at U.S. venture firms, according to National Venture Capital Association figures.</p>
<p>At the same time, he notes that the problem is ongoing and that more resources &#8212; which everyone is sending on an individual basis to a variety of Asian-American community groups that are dealing with a spiking racism and its implications &#8212; are needed. Indeed, to help funnel donor interest in the right direction, GGV is recommending at least five organizations whose work it believes to be making an impact. These include <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://secure.donationpay.org/aajc/">Asian Americans Advancing Justice</a>, <a href="https://www.redcanarysong.net/about-us">Red Canary Song</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-aapi-community-fund">GoFundMe Support the AAPI Community</a>, <a href="https://donate.givedirect.org/?cid=14711">Stop AAPI Hate</a> and <a href="https://compassioninoakland.org/donate">Compassion in Oakland</a>.</p>

<p>Tung takes pains to note that GGV has been active in other campaigns, including AllRaise, the organization that&#8217;s bringing more gender equality to investment firms and to the board room. He says that his partners were also highly moved by the Black Lives Matter movement last spring, donating to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other organizations.</p>
<p>He says that earlier movements &#8212; including an effort by investor Ryan Sarver of Redpoint last year to help both front-line workers and restaurant workers by devising a way for donors to “buy” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/bay-area-effort-to-feed-hospital-workers-partners-with-jose-andres-world-central-kitchen/">chef-made meals for hospital staff</a> &#8212; have been experiences from which he has learned.</p>
<p>One of those lessons is that when something is close enough to one&#8217;s heart, it&#8217;s worth the risk of being perceived as a &#8220;VC who is showing off&#8221; if it moves the needle.</p>
<p>In this case, says Tung, &#8220;so many of these crimes are treated as individual incidents and not as hate crimes,&#8221; which come with more severe penalties, he is determined to raise awareness and visibility into the matter, even if it means making himself more vulnerable about his own experience than he might be fully comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to Asian hate, it&#8217;s such a personal matter,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has some thoughts and updates about its News Feed, Siri gets some new voices and Tonal becomes a unicorn. This is your Daily Crunch for March 31, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook makes it easier to view a non-algorithmic News Feed</strong></p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/facebook-denies-its-algorithms-are-a-problem-but-launches-a-tool-to-more-easily-view-a-non-algorithmic-news-feed/">highlighted features today</a> that should make it easier for users to see a version of the News Feed that isn&#8217;t shaped by the company&#8217;s algorithms. These include a Favorites view that displays posts from up to 30 of your favorite friends and Pages, as well as a Most Recent view, which just shows posts in chronological order.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sarah Kunst, founding partner at Cleo Capital, has worn many hats. She&#8217;s been an entrepreneur, served on plenty of boards, is a contributing author at Marie Clare, has been a senior advisor to Bumble and worked as a consultant in marketing, business development and more.</p>
<p>With all that experience, she knows all too well that the process of fundraising starts well before your first pitch meeting. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re so excited to have Kunst join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed/">Early Stage</a> in July to discuss how to get ready to fundraise.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Kunst has discussed the topic with us. On a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, Kunst and one of her portfolio company founders Julia Collins described how to conduct the process of fundraising.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>For example, there is a story to tell, metrics to share and an art to building momentum before you ever start filling your calendar. That all requires preparation, and Kunst will outline how to go about that at our event in July.</p>
<p>Early Stage is going down twice this year, with our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">first event taking place tomorrow</a>! Here&#8217;s a look at some of the topics we&#8217;ll be covering:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the growth of game-streaming audiences have continued on desktop platforms, the streaming space has felt surprisingly stagnant at times, particularly due to the missing mobile element and a lack of startup competitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://lowkey.gg/">Lowkey</a>, a gaming startup that builds software for game streamers, is aiming to build out opportunities in bit-sized clips on mobile. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup wants to be a hub for both creating and viewing short gaming clips but also sees a big opportunity in helping streamers cut down their existing content for distribution on platforms like Instagram and TikTok where short-form gaming content sees a good deal of engagement.</span></p>
<p>The startup announced today that they&#8217;ve closed a $7 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from a host of angel investors including Figma&#8217;s Dylan Field, Loom&#8217;s Joe Thomas and Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret and William Hockey.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We last covered Lowkey in early 2020 when the company was looking to build out a games tournament platform for adults. At the time, the company had already pivoted after going through YC as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/camelot-lets-twitch-and-youtube-audiences-pay-for-what-they-want-to-see/">Camelot</a>, which allowed audiences on Twitch and YouTube to pay creators to take on challenges. This latest shift brings Lowkey back to the streaming world but more focused on becoming a tool for streamers and a mobile hub for viewers.</p>
<p>Twitch and YouTube Gaming have proven to be pretty uninterested in short-form content, favoring the opportunities of long-form streams that allow creators to press broadcast and upload lengthy streams. Lowkey users can easily upload footage captured from Lowkey&#8217;s desktop app or directly import a linked stream. This allows content creators to upload and comment on their own footage or remix and respond to another streamer&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for streamers has been adapting widescreen content for a vertical video form factor, but CEO Jesse Zhang says that it&#8217;s not really a problem with most modern games. &#8220;Games inherently want to focus you attention on the center of the screen,&#8221; Zhang tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So, almost all clips extend really cleanly to like a mobile format, which is what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lowkey&#8217;s desktop app is available on Windows and their new mobile app is now live for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lowkey-social-gaming-videos/id1553098190">iOS</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the same day that Deliveroo&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">fizzled at the start of trading</a>, Compass announced via a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563190/000119312521101664/d36119ds1a.htm">fresh S-1 filing</a> that it will reduce the number of shares in its impending flotation and sell them at a lower price.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Taken together, the various market signs could point to a modest to moderate cooling in the tech IPO market.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The move by Compass, a venture-backed residential brokerage, to lower its implied public-market valuation and sell fewer shares is a rebuke of the company&#8217;s earlier optimism regarding its valuation and ability to raise capital. The company&#8217;s IPO is still slated to generate as much as a half-billion dollars, so it can hardly be called a failure if it executes at its rejiggered price range, but the cuts matter.</p>
<p>Especially when we consider several other factors. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">Deliveroo IPO</a>, as discussed this morning, was impacted by more than mere economics. And there are questions regarding how interested seemingly more conservative countries&#8217; stock exchanges will prove in growth-oriented, unprofitable companies.</p>
<p>But added to the mix are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material/">recent declines</a> in the valuation of public software companies, effectively repricing the value of high-margin, recurring revenue. The reasons behind that particular change are several, but may include a rotation by public investors into other asset categories, or an air-letting from a sector that may have enjoyed some valuation inflation in the last year.</p>

<p>In that vein, SMB cloud provider DigitalOcean&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/digitalocean-starts-trading-on-nyse.html">own post-IPO declines</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/olo-raises-ipo-range-as-digitalocean-sees-possible-5b-debut-valuation/">its offering price</a> are a bit more understandable, as is a lack of a higher price interval from Kaltura, a video-focused software company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/a-look-at-4-ipo-updates-and-2-late-stage-funding-rounds/">as it looks to list</a>.</p>

<p>Today, Microsoft announced that it has received a contract to outfit the United States Army with tens of thousands of augmented reality headsets based on the company&#8217;s HoloLens tech. This contract could be worth as much as $21.88 billion over 10 years, the company says.</p>
<p>Microsoft will be fulfilling an order for 120,000 AR headsets for the Army based on their Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) design. The modified design upgrades the capabilities of the HoloLens 2 for the needs of soldiers in the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios,&#8221;  a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/31/army-moves-microsoft-hololens-based-headset-from-prototyping-to-production-phase/">blog post</a> from Microsoft&#8217;s Alex Kipman reads.</p>
<p>The contract builds on the two-year $480 million contract that Microsoft won back in 2018 to outfit the U.S. Army with augmented reality tech. At the time, the contract detailed that the deal could potentially result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets. “Augmented reality technology will provide troops with more and better information to make decisions. This new work extends our longstanding, trusted relationship with the Department of Defense to this new area,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>Microsoft says this announcement marks the transition from prototyping these designs to producing and rolling them out in the field.</p>
<p>This is a massive scaleup for augmented reality tech that has seen few large-scale rollouts and gives Microsoft a government contractor budget to tackle base technology problems that could scale down to consumer and enterprise-level devices in the future. Many of the industry&#8217;s biggest players in augmented reality have been reluctant or outspoken in their avoidance of military contracts but Microsoft has remained undeterred in competing for these contracts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s daughter-in-law Lara Trump <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CND8tIwrfc4/">promoted a new interview</a> with the former president on Facebook and Instagram Tuesday, but a workaround to Trump&#8217;s ban on two of the world&#8217;s most popular social networks wasn&#8217;t long for this world.</p>
<p>She was apparently swiftly cautioned by Facebook that anything posted &#8220;in the voice of President Trump&#8221; is not currently allowed on Facebook or Instagram and would be subject to removal. Trump himself remains banned on Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">pending a decision by the Oversight Board</a>, the external governing body the company set up to tackle it thorniest platform policy decisions.</p>
<p>Those rules apply to any accounts or pages associated with the Trump campaign as well as any belonging to former surrogates for the campaign, two categories that Lara Trump&#8217;s account falls into. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaraLTrump/posts/1547529562119509">screenshots depicting emails</a> from the company were legitimate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Facebook does still make a news exemption for Trump, presumably for something more akin to a &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview, but in this case he was being interviewed by someone involved in his campaign who then planned to promote the video on a campaign-associated account.</p>
<p>While Facebook won&#8217;t host the video itself, Lara Trump opted for a workaround to the workaround, linking to the interview on Rumble, a video sharing website that saw an<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90574842/what-is-rumble-meet-the-video-platform-trumps-supporters-are-flocking-to"> influx of Trump supporters late last year</a>.</p>
<p>She also posted to the video on The Right View, a web-based show previously produced by the Trump campaign that the Washington Post describes as &#8220;a sort of pro-Trump answer to ABC’s &#8216;The View.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News announced this week that it would bring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/03/29/fox-lara-trump-hire/">Lara Trump into the fold</a>, hiring the member of the Trump family on as a paid contributor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year wasn&#8217;t an easy one for just about anybody, but <a href="https://projectinclude.org/remote-work-report/">a new report from Project Include</a> shows that the shift to remote work affected some groups more negatively than others. Unsurprisingly, it was people already struggling against harassment and bias, particularly women of color and those identifying as LGBTQ, who saw the biggest jumps in those behaviors.</p>
<p>The report is based on a survey of about 2,800 people and interviews with tech workers and subject matter experts in numerous countries and industries. There&#8217;s not a lot of good news in it, but why should there be? Sadly, the unprecedented confluence of multiple disasters in 2020 has spawned another, quieter disaster in working conditions.</p>
<p>Remote work has changed how people interact, and the result of that has been, among other things, significant increases to gender- and race-based harassment. Over a quarter of those surveyed reported an increase in harassment and workplace hostility — and of those experiencing increases, 98% were women or nonbinary and 99% were nonwhite.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trans people were much more likely to experience harassment and hostility, as were were all Black respondents, especially women and nonbinary people. Asian, Latinx, and multiracial respondents also reported more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132803" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132803" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png" alt="Graphs illustrating the numbers of various demographics experiencing harassment." width="1024" height="1093" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png 1405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=281,300 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=768,820 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=637,680 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Project Include</p></div></p>
<p>The switch to remote productivity and communication seems to have made this harassment difficult to avoid. An increase in reliance on 1:1 communication via chat, email and video calls meant working directly with harassers was inescapable and difficult to report. &#8220;Respondents noted that individual harassers would follow them across online spaces to where they were,&#8221; the report adds.</p>
<p>People with mental health conditions, particularly those with PTSD, were twice as likely to report experiencing harassment than those without.</p>
<p>Changes to expectations and tools meant big increases to anxiety and drops in work-life balance. Nearly two-thirds of respondents reported being expected to work longer days, and more than half said they felt pressure (or were plainly expected) to be online outside of official working hours. The survey reported that 10% said managers were checking in daily, and 5% reported two or more times per day. Others complained about surveillance software like keystroke and screen monitoring.</p>
<p>Workers with disabilities found that companies often chose productivity and collaboration tools that had inadequate accessibility features — for example, Zoom calls without automatic captioning that required lip-reading to keep up.</p>
<p>As for reporting harassment, most said they did not do so because they didn&#8217;t trust their HR department or company at large to handle the complaints properly or respond fairly. One person even reported that it was a person within HR itself that was harassing them. Less than half of respondents said they trusted their company to respond to these issues properly; about a third said they did <em>not</em> trust the company to do so; about the same number said their workplace doesn&#8217;t even have the tools to intervene or solve any issue they might bring up.</p>
<p>These and more statistics are available in the report, which goes into detail on a number of other issues and behaviors, as well as making a number of suggestions as to what companies can do to step up. Of course if your company has waited until now to take action, that&#8217;s a problem right there. But in general the idea is to actually listen to workers, hold leadership accountable and take actions with measurable impact like no-meeting days and generous time-off policies.</p>
<p>Most of all, don&#8217;t expect things to just &#8220;go back to normal.&#8221; CEO of Vaya Consulting Nicole Sanchez puts it best as quoted in the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most companies are not ready to bring people back together physically, even electively. People at the executive level are going to be shocked to find out that what they’re actually dealing with is a whole lot of live active trauma. A lot of companies that go back and try and make it like it was before will wonder, &#8220;Why aren’t these pieces fitting together anymore?&#8221; And the answer, I hope, that we get collective agreement on is: Those pieces never fit together. They just fit together for you. Now, you’re seeing all the seams and all of the vulnerabilities, and now you have to reinvent your company.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://datapeople.io/">Datapeople</a>, a startup that sells software designed to make recruiting more equitable, announced that it has raised $8 million across two funding events, including a $5 million round in mid-2020.</p>
<p>The company, which counts <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/">Uncork Capital</a>, <a href="https://nextviewventures.com/">NextView Ventures</a> and <a href="https://firstround.com/">First Round Capital</a> as backers, does two things. Its initial product, what Datapeople calls &#8220;Language Analytics,&#8221; scans job postings, offering suggested edits to customers to help them attract a more diverse group of applicants.</p>
<p>And, coming shortly, Datapeople is rolling out what it calls &#8220;Recruiting Analytics,&#8221; a service that provides a high-level view of a company&#8217;s aggregate recruiting efforts. The recruiting side of its software service will keep tabs on diversity data such as the pace at which a company&#8217;s job posting attracts women against related jobs&#8217; own performance, among other bits of data-focused reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per a release that TechCrunch viewed ahead of publication, Datapeople&#8217;s view isn&#8217;t that there aren&#8217;t products in the market that provide charts of how a company&#8217;s recruiting process may be performing at a surface level. Instead its view is when it comes to asking more complex questions about the treatment of different groups of people, current solutions fall short. That&#8217;s the space it intends to place its new product.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lN5mMLug1E"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/why-ceos-should-spend-up-to-half-their-time-recruiting/">Why CEOs should spend up to half their time recruiting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why CEOs should spend up to half their time recruiting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/why-ceos-should-spend-up-to-half-their-time-recruiting/embed/#?secret=lN5mMLug1E" data-secret="lN5mMLug1E" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Datapeople co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyland/">Phillip Reyland</a> to chat about its recent capital raises and business performance.</p>
<p>According to Reyland, his startup&#8217;s language product is sold to in-house recruiting teams at mid-market through Fortune 100 companies. Related startup <a href="http://Textio.com">Textio</a> <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/textio-raises-12m-seattle-startup-looks-reach-job-candidates-writing-technology/">raised more capital last spring</a>, implying that there&#8217;s enough market demand for job-focused language tooling to support at least two venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>On the recruiting analytics side of the Datapeople house, Reyland told TechCrunch that the recruiting industry is today where marketing was 20 years ago. Given the rise in marketing software that we&#8217;ve seen over that time frame, Datapeople sees a long, broad market for new tooling in its target market.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to track how well Datapeople&#8217;s new product performs, as Reyland told TechCrunch that 2020 was the best year in its history. That, plus the capital it raised last year, means that the startup has a high bar to clear this year. Perhaps the new service will help it meet said goals.</p>
<p>The company intends to roughly double its mid-30s staff number to meet those expectations. It&#8217;s off to a good start, with Reyland telling TechCrunch that its Q1 2021 was &#8220;awesome.&#8221; As the company is, per its fundraising history, pretty early-stage, we&#8217;re willing to wait one more round to hammer it for more specifics.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, my colleague Matt Harris coined the term “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewharris/2019/11/19/fintech-the-fourth-platform-part-one/?sh=1b757166cb28">embedded fintech</a>” to describe how virtually all software-driven companies will soon embed financial services into their applications, from sending and receiving payments to enabling lending, insurance and banking services, an idea that quickly spread within the fintech community.</p>
<p>Vertical apps such as Toast for restaurants, Squire for barbershops and Shopmonkey for car repair shops will deliver financial services to businesses in the future rather than traditional, stodgy financial institutions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Embedded procurement is the natural evolution of embedded fintech.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The embedded fintech movement has just begun, but there is already a sister concept percolating: embedded procurement. In this next wave, businesses will buy things they need through vertical B2B apps, rather than through sales reps, distributors or an individual merchant’s website.</p>
<p>If you own a coffee shop, wouldn’t it be convenient to schedule recurring orders for beans and milk from the same software portal where you process payments, manage accounting and handle payroll? The companies that figured out how to monetize financial services via embedded fintech are well positioned to monetize through procurement, too.</p>
<p>Embedded procurement is the natural evolution of embedded fintech. The salon software company Fresha is a typical embedded fintech story. Fresha’s platform is an online and mobile platform specially designed for spas and salons, encompassing appointment scheduling, reporting and analytics, marketing promotions, and point-of-sale capabilities. The software is free for salons; Fresha monetizes through payment processing.</p>
<p>In the future, Fresha will undoubtedly turn to embedded procurement, becoming a logical place for business owners to order and manage inventory like shampoo, scissors, brushes and other supplies. In turn, Fresha can aggregate demand from thousands of spas to place orders with its suppliers, leveraging its scale to negotiate more favorable pricing on behalf of its customers. Borrowing a concept from the healthcare world, vertical software companies will become group purchasing organizations in every sector.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Picture it. It’s September, and you’re at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> about to present your virtual elevator pitch to thousands of attendees around the world. In the short span of 120 seconds, your company will become known to a rapt audience of early-startup influencers including potential customers, investors, tech icons and the media.</p>
<p>An awesome opportunity, amirite? Don’t just picture it — make it happen by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">exhibiting in Startup Alley</a>. Yes, it really is that easy. Every early-stage startup that exhibits in Startup Alley gets to pitch to the Disrupt audience.</p>
<p>It’s not only a tremendous opportunity to practice, pitching at Disrupt can have long-term benefits. Don’t just take our word for it. Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute, talks about her company’s experience pitching last year at Disrupt 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Startup Alley exhibitors got to pitch to attendees, and we were thrilled with how it went. I recorded the pitch, and now we just shoot potential investors a quick video saying, “take a look at our CEO pitching at Disrupt 2020.” It’s a great piece of marketing collateral.”</p>
<p>Along with the epic exposure that comes from pitching at Disrupt, Startup Alley exhibitors also have a shot at being interviewed during one of the many hour-long Startup Alley Crawls. Each tech category gets its own crawl — we’ll post the specific times in the agenda closer to the show’s opening — and TechCrunch journalists will interview a select number of exhibiting founders from each category.</p>
<p>Here’s yet another reason to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> sooner rather than later. Your pass makes you eligible to participate in Startup Alley+, a curated experience designed to help founders increase their opportunities for exposure and business growth. Only 50 companies — chosen by TechCrunch — will form this cohort, and there&#8217;s no additional cost. Here’s the kicker — the benefits start months before Disrupt 2021 begins. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Learn more about the Startup+ experience here</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know that TechCrunch editors award two Startup Alley exhibitors with a Startup Battlefield Wild Card? Those founders get to compete for $100,000 in the always epic Startup Battlefield competition. Who knows? You might follow in the steps of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/recordgram-thinks-your-phone-is-the-new-recording-studio/?_ga=2.255114062.739798790.1561385469-21262877.1546616128&amp;_gac=1.128542206.1559149543.CjwKCAjw27jnBRBuEiwAdjQXDPwyBPHjxvb8oEViYRSrVto53q8pleF-kUlsDn9V24VnEGPCqfrR2BoCsvQQAvD_BwE">RecordGram</a>. That startup, chosen from Startup Alley as a Wild Card, went on to win the Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Exhibiting in Startup Alley is a savvy strategy. You’ll pitch your company to a global audience, gain valuable exposure, meet and connect with influencers and potential customers. Win-win-win.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today is officially launching a new feature called Remix, which offers a way to record your Reels video alongside a video from another user. The option is similar to TikTok&#8217;s existing Duets feature, which also lets users react to or interact with another person&#8217;s video content while creating their own. Instagram&#8217;s new feature has been in public testing before today, so some Instagram users may have already gained access.</p>
<p>We recently reported on Instagram&#8217;s plans with Remix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/snapchat-is-developing-its-own-take-on-tiktok-duets-with-a-new-remix-feature/">when noting that Snapchat was developing a Remix feature</a> of its own. In fact, Snapchat is also using the name &#8220;Remix&#8221; for its TikTok Duets rival that&#8217;s currently in development.</p>
<p>On TikTok, Duets are a key part to making the app feel more like a social network and less of just a passive video-watching experience. Users take advantage of Duets to sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user&#8217;s video. They will do things like cook someone else&#8217;s recipe, record a reaction video, or even just watch a video from a smaller creator to give them a boost.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok competitors &#8212; like Instagram Reels, Snapchat&#8217;s Spotlight or YouTube&#8217;s Shorts, for example &#8212; have launched their short-form video experiences without a full set of engagement or editing features like TikTok has, making their apps feel like pale knockoffs of the original. Remix on Reels is a first step toward changing that perception, by giving users at least one important option to engage and collaborate with their fellow creatives.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Now you can use the Remix feature in Reels to create your own reel next to one that already exists <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f3ad.png" alt="🎭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Whether you’re capturing your reaction, responding to friends or bringing your own magic to trends, Remix is another way to collab on Instagram <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/eU8x74Q3yf">pic.twitter.com/eU8x74Q3yf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1377304845204422661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To use the new Remix feature, you&#8217;ll first tap on the three-dot menu on a Reel and select the new &#8220;Remix this Reel&#8221; option. The screen will then split into the original Reel and your own new one, where you can begin to record side by side with the original. When you&#8217;ve finished, you can tweak other aspects of the recording like the volume of the original video or your audio and you can optionally add a voiceover. After applying these or any other edits, you can publish the Remix.</p>
<p>The feature will only be available on newly uploaded Reels &#8212; so unfortunately, if you want your older Reels to be duetted, you either need to reupload them or go back to your old Reel and specifically enable Remix.</p>

<p>Your Remixes will appear alongside any other Reels you&#8217;ve recorded on the Reels tab on your Instagram profile, and you&#8217;ll be able to track who has remixed your content through Instagram&#8217;s Activity tab.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out, starting today, says Instagram. It will be enabled by default on all new Reels published from a public account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyone is scrambling to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Clubhouse</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">clone</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">right now</a>, but for Discord it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>With everyone stuck at home searching for safe ways to rekindle their social lives over the last year, Discord&#8217;s appeal exploded. The company cites new behavior it observed during the pandemic as the inspiration for Stage Channels, a new feature that will facilitate more structured voice chats with designated speakers and listeners.</p>
<p>Voice chat is already Discord&#8217;s core feature. It&#8217;s been that way for years, offering gamers a crystal clear, seamless voice chat service that blew the functionality of in-game chat services out of the water. But there&#8217;s no denying the Clubhouse-inspired voice event zeitgeist at the moment, even if ultimately Discord was there first in many ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2132346" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132346" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132346 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?w=680" alt="Discord Stage Channels" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132346" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p>
<p>Discord says the new kind of channel will be useful for stuff like voice-based AMAs and interviews, book clubs and even karaoke. The new channels will capture activity that&#8217;s already happening on Discord, making it way easier for anyone who runs a server to host formalized conversations without needing to mess around with a bunch of granular user permissions stuff.</p>
<p>The new channel type fits right in with Discord&#8217;s existing vibe. Stage Channels do what&#8217;s on the label, allowing anyone who runs a Discord to curate a speaker experience and use moderator tools to control who gets the mic and when. Much like Clubhouse (or Zoom), participants can raise their hand to speak. They can also slink out quietly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132356" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132356" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132356 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132356" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p>
<p>Stage Channels will be specific to community servers, which are geared around larger groups on Discord. To enable the new kind of channel, server owners will need to convert a channel to a community server if it isn&#8217;t one already.</p>
<p>Because Discord is Discord, discovery for voice-based events won&#8217;t work like it does on Clubhouse, which serves up user-created live events front and center to anyone who opens the app. Community servers on Discord can apply to be featured in the server discovery menu, but the app&#8217;s focus remains on private, intimate groups and larger interest-based communities that you&#8217;re already a part of.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LinkedIn confirms it&#8217;s working on a Clubhouse rival, too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/embed/#?secret=AV04RFuMtd" data-secret="AV04RFuMtd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Given its healthy user base and existing utility as the go-to app for casual, seamless voice chat, Discord is well positioned to capture a completely different market for voice-based events. The app is a mainstay of the gaming community and generally skews young, putting it in contrast with the entrepreneurs, VCs and brands that flocked to Clubhouse&#8217;s early buzz.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s gaming DNA isn&#8217;t holding it back. In recent years, Discord has grown beyond its gaming roots without betraying them, expanding into a seamless chat experience for everything from college study groups to influencer fan hubs. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">Discord doubled its valuation</a> within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/">six months.</a> Just a quarter later, Microsoft is reportedly in talks with the company on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/technology/microsoft-discord-deal.html">$10 billion deal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Finance for Founders</strong></p>
<p><em>As a founder, you not only have to master your company’s finances, but you also have to tackle your own personal finances. Managing your money as a founder comes with a unique set of questions (see: QSBS). Leveraging her expertise from LearnVest and as a Certified Financial Planner<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Alexa von Tobel (founder/managing partner, Inspired Capital Partners) will share financial planning best practices so founders can remove this layer of stress from the pressure of building a business.</em></p>
<p><strong>Building and Leading a Sales Team</strong></p>
<p><em>Contrary to popular opinion, even the very best products don’t sell themselves. Salespeople do. Hear from Zoom’s chief revenue officer, at the helm of the company’s sales team during the biggest period of growth of any software company ever, lay out how to build a stellar sales team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping and the Power of Product-Led Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>Building a bootstrapped company forces you to be creative. For Calendly, it pointed the company toward a product-led growth model built on virality. Hear from Calendly’s Tope Awotona and OpenView’s Blake Bartlett, as they cover pro tips on bootstrapping, PLG and when a profitable company should consider raising capital.</em></p>
<p>There’s plenty more to explore, and TC Early Stage offers something for everyone. Here’s what Chloe Leaaetoa, founder of Socicraft, told us about her experience at Early Stage last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>This conference caters to early stage founders no matter where you are in your process. Maybe your pitch deck is set but you need to hire internationally — they had a session on that. The range of topics was all-encompassing.</p></blockquote>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’re living in a phenomenal moment for machine learning (ML), what<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonali-sambhus/"> Sonali Sambhus</a>, head of developer and ML platform at Square, describes as “the democratization of ML.” It’s become the foundation of business and growth acceleration because of the incredible pace of change and development in this space.</p>
<p>But for engineering and team leaders without an ML background, this can also feel overwhelming and intimidating. I regularly meet smart, successful, highly competent and normally very confident leaders who struggle to navigate a constructive or effective conversation on ML &#8212; even though some of them lead teams that engineer it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Integrating ML teams effectively into the business starts with an understanding of what makes the right candidate and how to structure the team for maximum velocity and focus.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than two decades in the ML space, including work at Apple to build the world&#8217;s largest online app and music store. As the senior director of engineering, anti-evil, at Reddit, I used ML to understand and combat the <a href="https://redditblog.com/2019/07/29/the-benefits-of-machine-learning-to-study-small-dataset-of-social-conversations/">dark side of the web</a>.</p>
<p>For this piece, I interviewed a select group of successful ML leaders including Sambhus; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lgavish/">Lior Gavish</a>, co-founder at Monte Carlo; and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yotamhadass/"> Yotam Hadass</a>, VP of engineering at Electric.ai, for their insights. I’ve distilled our best practices and must-know components into five practical and easily applicable lessons.</p>
<h2>1. ML recruiting strategy</h2>
<p>Recruiting for ML comes with several challenges.</p>
<p>The first is that it can be difficult to differentiate machine learning roles from more traditional job profiles (such as data analysts, data engineers and data scientists) because there’s a heavy overlap between descriptions.</p>
<p>Secondly, finding the level of experience required can be challenging. Few people in the industry have substantial experience delivering production-grade ML (for instance, you’ll sometimes notice resumes that specify experience with ML models but then find their models are rule-based engines rather than real ML models).</p>
<p>When it comes to recruiting for ML, hire experts when you can, but also look into how training can help you meet your talent needs. Consider upskilling your current team of software engineers into data/ML engineers or hire promising candidates and provide them with an ML education.</p>

<p>The other effective way to overcome these recruiting challenges is to define roles largely around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product: Look for candidates with a technical curiosity and a strong business/product sense. This framework is often more important than the ability to apply the most sophisticated models.</li>
<li>Data: Look for candidates that can help select models, design features, handle data modeling/vectorization and analyze results.</li>
<li>Platform/Infrastructure: Look for people who evaluate/integrate/build platforms to significantly accelerate the productivity of data and engineering teams; extract, transform, load (ETLs); warehouse infrastructures; and CI/CD frameworks for ML.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gaming sector has never been hotter or had higher expectations from investors who are dumping billions into upstarts that can adjust to shifting tides faster that the existing giants will.</p>
<p>Bay Area-based <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> is one of the second-layer gaming platforms looking to build on the market&#8217;s momentum. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve closed a $100 million Series C funding round, bringing their total funding to $160 million. The round was led by XN, with participation from SoftBank and LVP alongside existing investors Benchmark, Bitkraft, Correlation Ventures and Epic Games.</p>
<p>When Manticore closed its Series B back in September 2019, VCs were starting to take Roblox and the gaming sector more seriously, but it took the pandemic hitting to really expand their expectations for the market. &#8220;Gaming is now a bona fide super category,&#8221; CEO Frederic Descamps tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Manticore&#8217;s Core gaming platform is quite similar to Roblox conceptually, the big difference is that the gaming company is aiming to quickly scale up a games and creator platform geared toward the 13+ crowd that may have already left Roblox behind. The challenge will be coaxing that demographic faster than Roblox can expand its own ambitions, and doing so while other venture-backed gaming startups like Rec Room, which recently raised at a $1.2 billion valuation, race for the same prize.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rec Room raises at $1.25B valuation from Sequoia and Index as VCs push to find another Roblox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/rec-room-raises-at-1-25b-valuation-from-sequoia-and-index-as-vcs-push-to-find-another-roblox/embed/#?secret=Z21IiStLyS" data-secret="Z21IiStLyS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like other players, Manticore is attempting to build a game discovery platform directly into a game engine. They haven&#8217;t built the engine tech from scratch; they&#8217;ve been working closely with Epic Games, which makes the Unreal Engine and made a $15 million investment in the company last year.</p>
<p>A big focus of the Core platform is giving creators a true drag-and-drop platform for game creation with a specific focus on &#8220;remixing,&#8221; allowing users to pick pre-made environments, drop pre-rendered 3D assets into them, choose a game mode and publish it to the web. For creators looking to inject new mechanics or assets into a title, there will be some technical know-how necessary, but Manticore&#8217;s team hopes that making the barriers of entry low for new creators means that they can grow alongside the platform. Manticore&#8217;s big bet is on the flexibility of their engine, hoping that creators will come on board for the chance to engineer their own mechanics or create their own path toward monetization, something established app stores wouldn&#8217;t allow them to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creators can implement their own styles of [in-app purchases] and what we&#8217;re really hoping for here is that maybe the next battle pass equivalent innovation will come out of this,&#8221; co-founder Jordan Maynard tells us.</p>
<p>This all comes at an added cost; developers earn 50% of revenues from their games, leaving more potential revenue locked up in fees routed to the platforms that Manticore depends on than if they built for the App Store directly, but this revenue split is still much friendlier to creators than what they can earn on <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics">platforms like Roblox</a>.</p>
<p>Building cross-platform secondary gaming platforms is host to plenty of its own challenges. The platforms involved not only have to deal with stacking revenue share fees on non-PC platforms, but some hardware platforms that are reticent to allow them all, an area where Sony has been a particular stickler with PlayStation. The long-term success of these platforms may ultimately rely on greater independence, something that seems hard to imagine happening on consoles and mobile ecosystems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic&#8217;s remarkable impact on the app industry has not slowed down in 2021. In fact, consumer spending in apps has hit a new record in the first quarter of this year, <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/consumers-spent-32-billion-on-apps-in-q1-2021-the-biggest-quarter-since-records-began/">a new report from App Annie</a> indicates. The firm says consumers in Q1 2021 spent $32 billion on apps across both iOS and Google Play, up 40% year-over-year from Q1 2020. It&#8217;s the largest-ever quarter on record, App Annie also notes.</p>
<p>Last year saw both app downloads and consumer spend increase, as people rapidly adopted apps under coronavirus lockdowns &#8212; including apps for work, school, shopping, fitness, entertainment, gaming and more. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">previously reported</a> a record 218 billion in global downloads and record consumer spend of $143 billion for the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132696" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132696" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png 2002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These trends have continued into 2021, it seems, with mobile consumers spending roughly $9 billion more in Q1 2021 compared with Q1 2020. Although iOS saw larger consumer spend than Android in the quarter &#8212; $21 billion versus $11 billion, respectively &#8212; both stores grew by the same percentage, 40%.</p>
<p>But the types of apps driving spending were slightly different from store to store.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Games, Social and Entertainment apps saw the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of consumer spending, while Games, Photo &amp; Video and Entertainment apps accounted for the strongest growth on iOS.</p>

<p>By downloads, the categories were different between the stores, as well.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Social, Tools and Finance saw the biggest download growth in Q1, while Games, Finance and Social Networking drove download growth for iOS. Also on Google Play, other top categories included Weather (40%) and Dating (35%), while iOS saw Health and Fitness app downloads grow by a notable 25% &#8212; likely a perfect storm as New Year&#8217;s Resolutions combined with continued stay-at-home measures that encouraged users to find new ways to stay fit without going to a gym.</p>

<p>The top apps in the quarter remained fairly consistent, however. TikTok beat Facebook, in terms of downloads, and was followed by Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp and Zoom. But the short-form video app only made it to No. 2 in terms of consumer spend, with YouTube snagging the top spot. Tinder, Disney+, Tencent Video and others followed. (Netflix has dropped off this chart as it now directs new users to sign up directly, rather than through in-app purchases).</p>

<p>Though Facebook&#8217;s apps have fallen behind TikTok by downloads, its apps &#8212; including Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram &#8212; still led the market in terms of monthly active users (MAUs) in the quarter. TikTok, meanwhile, ranked No. 8 by this metric.</p>
<p>Up-and-comers in the quarter included privacy-focused messaging app Signal, which saw the strongest growth in the quarter by both downloads and MAUs &#8212; a calculation that App Annie calls &#8220;breakout apps.&#8221;  Telegram closely followed, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">users bailed from mainstream social after the Capitol riot.</a> Another &#8220;breakout&#8221; app was MX TakaTak, which is filling the hole in the market for short-form video that resulted from India&#8217;s ban  of TikTok.</p>

<p>Gaming, meanwhile, drove a majority of the quarter&#8217;s spending, as usual, accounting for $22 billion of the spend &#8212; $13 billion on iOS (up 30% year-over-year) and $9 billion on Android (up 35%). Gamers downloaded about a billion titles per week, up 15% year-over-year from 2020.</p>
<p>Among Us! dropped to No. 2 in the quarter by downloads, replaced by Join Clash 3D, while DOP 2: Delete One Part jumped 308 places to reach No. 3.</p>

<p>Roblox led by consumer spend, followed by Genshin Impact, Coin Master, Pokémon GO and others. And although Among Us! dropped on the charts by downloads, it remained No. 1 by monthly active users in the quarter, followed by PUBG Mobile, Candy Crush Saga, Roblox and others.</p>
<p>App Annie notes that the pandemic also accelerated the mobile gaming market, with game downloads outpacing overall downloads by 2.5x in 2020. It predicts that mobile gaming will reach $120 billion in consumer spending this year, or 1.5x all other gaming formats combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is adding two new voices to Siri&#8217;s English offerings, and eliminating the default &#8220;female voice&#8221; selection in the latest beta version of iOS. This means that every person setting up Siri will choose a voice for themselves and it will no longer default to the voice assistant being female, a topic that has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/22/female-by-default/">come up quite a bit</a> with regards to bias in voice interfaces over the past few years.</p>
<p>The beta version should be live now and available to program participants.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the first of these assistants to make the choice completely agnostic with no default selection made. This is a positive step forward as it allows people to choose the voice that they prefer without the defaults bias coming into play. The two new voices also bring some much needed variety to the voices of Siri, offering more diversity in speech sound and pattern to a user picking a voice that speaks to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In some countries and languages Siri already defaults to a male voice. But this change makes the choice the users’ for the first time.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,&#8221; a statement from Apple reads. &#8220;This is a continuation of Apple’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.”</p>
<p>The two new voices use source talent recordings that are then run through Apple&#8217;s Neural text to speech engine, making the voices flow more organically through phrases that are actually being generated on the fly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard the new voices and they sound pretty fantastic, with natural inflection and smooth transitions. They&#8217;ll be a welcome addition of choice to iOS users. Here are some samples of the voices in action:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s a recording of Siri’s new lineup of American voices in iOS 14.5. Voices 1 and 4 are the existing ones, voices 2 and 3 are the new ones. <a href="https://t.co/6emei4B3Z9">pic.twitter.com/6emei4B3Z9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Gruber (@gruber) <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1377410922147274754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This latest beta also upgrades the Siri voices in Ireland, Russia and Italy to Neural TTS, bringing the total voices using the new tech to 38. Siri now handles 25 billion requests per month on over 500 million devices and supports 21 languages in 36 countries.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="49kZxmxJVm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/white-label-voice-assistants-will-win-the-battle-for-podcast-discovery/">White-label voice assistants will win the battle for podcast discovery</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;White-label voice assistants will win the battle for podcast discovery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/white-label-voice-assistants-will-win-the-battle-for-podcast-discovery/embed/#?secret=49kZxmxJVm" data-secret="49kZxmxJVm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new voices are available to English-speaking users around the world and Siri users can select a personal preference of voice in 16 languages.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that these two new voices are just the first expansion in Siri&#8217;s voice selections. More diversity in voice, tone and regional dialect can only be a positive development for how inclusive smart devices feel. Over the past few years we have finally begun to see some movement from Amazon, Google and Apple to aggressively correct situations where the assistants have revealed bias in their responses to queries that use negative or abusive language. Improvements there, as well as in queries on social justice topics and overall accessibility improvements, are incredibly key as we continue to see an explosion of voice-first or voice-native interfaces. These kinds of choices matter, especially at a scale of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
