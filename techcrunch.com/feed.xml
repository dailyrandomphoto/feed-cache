										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp will today begin beta testing a new, cloud-based version of its <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp">WhatsApp Business API</a>, hosted on parent company Facebook&#8217;s infrastructure. With the shift to the cloud, the setup time for integrating with the API will drop from weeks to only minutes, the company claims, so businesses can more quickly transition to WhatsApp&#8217;s API platform to communicate with their customers who have opted in to receive their messages.</p>
<p>The company has been steadily building out its Business API over the past couple of years to become one of the key ways the otherwise free messaging app will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/whatsapp-business-api/">generate revenue from its service</a>. Businesses today pay WhatsApp on a per-message basis, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#usd">with rates that vary</a> based on the number of messages sent and region. Currently, hundreds of thousands of larger businesses have adopted the existing (non-cloud based) API, including brands like Vodafone, Coppel, Sears Mexico, BMW, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Itau Brazil, iFood, and Bank Mandiri, among others.</p>
<p>This older version of the API will continue to be supported and WhatsApp doesn&#8217;t have any current plans to force them to shift over to the new cloud-based version at this time. Both APIs are free to use.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226987" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Generally, businesses using the WhatsApp Business API will work with a solutions provider like Zendesk or Twilio, who help facilitate integrating the API with the customer&#8217;s backend systems. In these cases, WhatsApp is often just one part of the company&#8217;s customer communications strategy. They may also direct communications with customers to other channels, like SMS or other messaging apps, email, and more. But this API integration process, historically, has taken time &#8212; even as long as several weeks, or potentially, even a month.</p>
<p>With the pandemic having accelerated a shift to online shopping that was already underway before Covid, many companies don&#8217;t want to wait that long when getting up and running on new systems.</p>
<p>The new cloud-based API aims to simplify things on that front by offering a much easier, and therefore faster, technical integration process.</p>
<p>Initially, beta testers for the new API will include a couple dozen of WhatsApp&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/partner-directory/search?solution_type=messaging&amp;platforms=whatsapp">solution provider partners</a>, such as Zendesk in the U.S., Take in Brazil, and MessageBird in the E.U.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Cloud API is a big step in reducing the complexity of using WhatsApp for both service providers like us and our customers,&#8221; noted Zendesk VP of Product, Mike Gozzo, in a statement. &#8220;Not needing to worry about hosting WhatsApp Clients will allow us to better focus on supporting the many rich features available via the API,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The launch comes at a time when the way people connect with businesses is changing. Today, over 175 million WhatsApp users message a business every day, and this trend is growing &#8212; particularly in non-U.S. markets like India, Brazil, and Indonesia, WhatsApp notes. More broadly, WhatsApp is seeing demand from consumers in shifting to messaging instead of using 1-800 numbers where they have to navigate phone systems and be placed on hold. This is annoying for customers. And call centers can be expensive for the businesses to operate, too.</p>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s own survey, conducted last year, indicates a preference among its users for messaging over calls. It found that 75% of users in some of its largest countries said they wanted to be able to communicate with businesses through messaging. And 68% said they were &#8220;more likely&#8221; to do business or make a purchase from a business that they were able to contact via messaging.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has been taking advantage of this trend in another way, as well. Its other significant revenue stream involves click-to-chat ads that pop up on Facebook&#8217;s News Feed or in Instagram, which offer consumers a way to send a message to a business on WhatsApp with a click of a button.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company addresses the small business market with its WhatsApp Business App, which allows local shops, like mom-and-pops, to get online to reach customers. It&#8217;s now grown to 50 million users globally f<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/whatsapp-officially-launches-its-app-for-businesses-in-select-markets/">ollowing its 2018 launch</a>.</p>
<p>Before today&#8217;s Cloud API launch, WhatsApp had been working on other<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/"> API improvements</a>. These included giving businesses the ability to more quickly respond to inbound messages and support for different types of messages, like out-of-stock alerts, for consumers who opted in. (Before, WhatsApp&#8217;s API was focused on &#8220;timely&#8221; notifications &#8212; like sending out a boarding pass for a flight, for instance.)</p>
<p>The company says customers who receive communications from businesses will see an informational message at the top of their conversation that will inform them that <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/faq/">this is a different experience</a> than messaging with friends or family (which is fully encrypted). Customers can also choose to end communications in a number of ways, depending on what the business supports. They may be able to opt-out by just texting the business to stop or visit the company&#8217;s website to make a change. But the easiest way may be just to block the business in the app.</p>
<p>The Cloud API is arriving in a limited beta starting today with select partners who will be onboarding their first clients in the days ahead.</p>
<p>However, WhatsApp plans to open up the API to other solution providers and to businesses directly starting in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canalys reported today that <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-pc-market-q3-2021?ctid=2427-02db49b9cb532b1f918f69dad9d76847">worldwide PC sales fell 2%</a> in the third quarter, but perhaps the most startling data point in the latest PC market survey was that Chromebooks sales were cut in half from 18% of total sales last quarter to just 9% this one.</p>
<p>The good news for the market in general was that with over 122 million units moving in the quarter, these numbers were still above pre-pandemic levels, but there are some storm clouds on the horizon as overall supply chain issues could complicate things for PC manufacturers in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>Overall Chromebook sales were down 37% year-over-year as the pandemic-induced sales frenzy finally slowed down with 5.3 million units being sold. The Chromebook numbers reflected the doldrums in sales with top Chromebook retailers taking huge hits. The top vendor Lenovo was down over 20% year-over-year, while HP in second place lost a whopping 66% and Acer in third place was down over 28%.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227009" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Canalys speculated this had more to do with market saturation than parts shortages or other supply chain issues. &#8220;The Chromebook market was hit by a massive downturn, with a 37% year-on-year fall in shipments (52% quarter on quarter) in Q3. This comes as major education markets such as the US and Japan reach saturation point, with public sector funding of digital education programs slowing,&#8221; according to the firm.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227036" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227036" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?w=680" alt="Graph showing overall PC sales and Chromebooks as a percentage of those sales. Overall Chromebook sales dropped from 18% of total sales last quarter to 9% this quarter." width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227036" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile tablet shipments dropped 15% year-over-year with sales down in every region except Asia-Pacific, which bucked the trend with sales up 23%. Compare that with North America where sales were down 24%.</p>
<p>Apple held onto the tablet market share lead with 40% of the market, up from 34.4% in the year-ago time period, but it wasn&#8217;t as good as it sounds as they sold almost exactly the same number of units as last year, meaning they had 0% growth. Samsung market share was down a tick from 20.4% a year ago to 19.1% this quarter, but sales dropped steeply, down over 20% over last year. Lenovo came in third with 11.3% share, up from 9.5% a year ago, and good for modest 2% growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall PC sales told a bit better story with top vendor Lenovo up 4.1%, Apple in second up 4.6% and HP coming in third in the negative column down 5.7% with the company especially hard hit by the drop in Chromebook sales.</p>
<p>Brian Lynch, a research analyst at Canalys says that holiday shopping season may bring some relief in spite of supply chain issues. &#8220;Sales will improve in Q4 QoQ despite supply chain issues, largely due to holiday related consumer demand around the world. This will come via lower cost, less material-intensive devices. Consumers tend to buy less powerful devices putting a lesser strain on component manufacturers,&#8221; Lynch told TechCrunch. That said, the firm expects relatively static performance in Q4 in terms of YoY growth, and then marginal, steady growth in 2022 and the years following.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Canalys counts sales into the channel, rather than sales to end customers for its market survey methodology. That means it&#8217;s counting units it sold to a company like Best Buy or Staples, rather than to a consumer end user.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earbuds should be easy to review. Compared to the myriad other product categories we look at day in, day out, there aren’t that many variables. Do they sound good? How’s the battery life? What about the noise canceling? How do they fit?</p>
<p>That last bit is, of course, highly subjective &#8212; even more so than the others. And it points to one of the biggest issues with reviewing the products. Much like the music we listen to on them, preference is a deeply personal thing. These are products we often wear for hours at a time, intimately pressed against our ears while we work, travel, exercise and even sleep.</p>
<p>As I’ve often written, I’ve never seen a consumer electronics category develop as quickly as Bluetooth earbuds, going from novelty to commodity seemingly overnight. The truth is that most of them are pretty good.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a rule, I often tell people to go with a pair from the company that made their phone. There’s something to be said for a pair of products that were effectively built to work together. That’s a good place to start, certainly. But there are plenty of other variables worth considering when buying a set of buds for yourself &#8212; or as gift this holiday season. Sound, price, comfort, design and size are all worth considering here.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I’ve reviewed more wireless earbuds than any other product category (by a fairly wide margin). There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution among them &#8212; and probably never will be in this space. What follows are some of my favorites in this burgeoning and booming category. You can’t go too wrong with any of them.</p>
<h3>Apple AirPods Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1905294" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1905294" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1905294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg" alt="Airpods Pro" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg 3008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1905294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Price: $249<br />
Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/apples-airpods-pro-set-a-pricey-new-standard-for-earbuds/">Apple’s AirPods Pro set a pricey new standard for earbuds</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having just celebrated their third anniversary, Apple’s pro-level buds are a bit long in the tooth. But in terms of the overall package, they’re still the ones to beat. Sure, the company just introduced the third generation of the standard buds, with new features that blurred the line between models, but pricing aside, the Pros are still superior in most ways. That is, unless you’ve got an aversion to silicone tips.</p>
<p>They sound great, are comfortable, have excellent noise canceling and work seamlessly with iOS devices.</p>
<h3>Beats Fit Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2224326" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224326" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2224326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Price: $199<br />
Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/beats-fit-pro-review-ahead-of-the-pack/">Ahead of the Pack</a></p>
<p>Until today, I would point to the Powerbeats Pro anytime someone asked me for a good pair of workout headphones. And while the Fit Pro don’t replace that product outright, they’ve moved to the top of my list for the category. As someone who recently took up running again, I’m impressed with what Beats was able to do in such a small category. I’ve had an aversion to stability wings after testing some rigid and painful models in the past, but the company got things right here.</p>
<h3>OnePlus Buds Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2189197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189197" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Price: $150<br />
Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/oneplus-buds-pro-review-much-better/">Much Better</a></p>
<p>After striking out with their first pair of buds, OnePlus got a lot more things right with the Pros. They’re not setting the world on fire with any sort of tech innovation here, but they’re a solid and well-rounded pair that won’t require you to take out a second mortgage. The Pros have good noise canceling, are comfortable and, bonus, pump meditative white noise into your ears with a squeeze of the stems.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2226101" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226101" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2226101 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9943.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226101" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>

Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-getting-out-of-their-own-way/">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</a></p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the Galaxy line, Samsung’s Buds aren’t flashy. And, honestly, that’s fine. They’re compact, solid and get the job done. Like the OnePlus Buds Pro, they’re not pushing any boundaries, but they’re an excellent pair of $150 buds, with adaptive noise canceling. They play particularly well with other Samsung devices, so if you’re in the Galaxy ecosystem, these are probably the ones to get.</p>
<h3>Sony WF-1000XM4</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2226102" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226102" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2226102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_9524.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>

Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/sony-sets-a-new-standard-with-the-wf-1000xm4-earbuds/">Sony sets a new standard with the WF-1000XM4 earbuds</a></p>
<p>Not for the faint of heart &#8212; or wallet &#8212; Sony returned with another set of truly excellent audiophile earbuds this year. They tend toward the bigger and bulkier side of things, so I wouldn’t recommend going for a run in them, but if you’re looking for a pair of buds to, say, enjoy the hell out of a great live jazz record, these are truly tough to beat. Along with their predecessors, the WF-1000XM3 and confusingly similarly named WH-1000XM3/4 over-ear phones, Sony continues to be the gold standard for great-sounding headphones.</p>
<h2>Wildcards:</h2>
<h3>Nothing Ear (1)</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2182585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182585" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182585" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>

Review:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nothing-ear-1-review/"> Something interesting</a></p>
<p>Honorable mentions for a pair of wildcards/underdogs for those looking outside of the big cos. Nothing made a well constructed pair of buds at a good price. They also look the part, with a clever, semi-transparent design language. I had some connectivity issues early on, though the company has largely addressed that with subsequent firmware upgrades. If you&#8217;re looking for something outside the Apple/Samsung/Sony world that won’t break the bank, give these a look.</p>
<h3>Nura NuraTrue</h3>

Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/nura-finally-goes-fully-wireless-with-the-nuratrue-buds/">The hardware startup adapts its innovative sound tech for truly wireless earbuds</a></p>
<p>Nura adapted its clever sound-adapting technology into a pair of portable buds. They lack some of the immersive depth of their over-ear counterparts, but the company is able to create a truly impressive musical experience with its custom profiles.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a satellite breaks down, you can’t just call AAA. On-orbit servicing (OOS) enables inspections, repairs and technology upgrades for both military and commercial satellites — extending their service viability, reducing dangerous space debris and saving a galactic ton of money. Consider this: a military satellite in geostationary orbit can cost more than a billion dollars. Would you junk a billion-dollar car if you could fix it instead?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very high-tech version of reduce, reuse and recycle, on-orbit ops/services lead to orbital sustainability— a more efficient, affordable operating environment for both the public and private sectors. Plus, the ability to install new payloads, such as upgraded communication or navigation systems, to existing satellites supports their mission while, again, reducing costs and space clutter.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this isn’t our first foray into this category, Orbit Fab, who </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnyrgrGvXwU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched in Startup Battlefield</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Disrupt in 2019, is </span><a href="https://blog.executivebiz.com/2021/10/orbit-fab-afrl-enter-into-randd-agreement-to-develop-on-orbit-refueling-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with the U.S Air Force Research Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to advance on-orbit refueling technology. They also just raised $10M from both VC and prime contractor investors.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon announced today that a TikTok app is <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/tiktok-now-available-on-amazon-fire-tv-in-u-s-and-canada-afc62bf2977d">now available</a> on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/amazon-fire-tv/">Amazon Fire TV</a> for users in the U.S. and Canada. The app is also coming soon to Echo Show devices.</p>
<p>After downloading TikTok from the Fire TV Appstore, users can log in to their TikTok account, or create one if they aren&#8217;t already one of the app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">one billion monthly active users</a>. Then, like the mobile app, users can browse TikTok feeds like &#8220;following,&#8221; &#8220;for you,&#8221; and the discover page. On the app itself, you have to manually scroll to view the next video clip, but the Fire TV app has autoplay, so you won&#8217;t have to press a button on your remote or tell Alexa to play the next video every few seconds (or minutes).</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that you could watch vertically-oriented short-form videos on the big screen &#8212; TikTok apps can already be used on <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-on-google-tv-and-android-tv-is-here">Google TV and Android TV</a>, as well as some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsung-tiktok-app-for-smart-tvs-coming-soon-to-the-us/">Samsung smart TVs</a>. But now that TikTok enables creators to upload videos up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">three minutes long</a>, it might feel more natural to opt for big screen-viewing than it would if you were only watching 15-second videos, for instance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like TikTok&#8217;s update to support longer videos this summer, making its app accessible on TVs is yet another show of competition with YouTube, which created <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">YouTube Shorts </a>as a TikTok competitor earlier this year.</p>

<p>To support the creative process, Pinterest is also launching a virtual studio where producers will work with creators to help them develop their content and provide A/V support, so they can go live more easily.</p>
<p>The new episodes will begin airing starting on November 8, and will air Monday through Friday at 3 PM PDT / 6 PM EDT in the U.S. on the Pinterest iOS app to start. Each Friday, products will drop into a live shopping experience where Pinterest users will be offered discounts from participating brands, including Patagonia, All Birds, Crown Affair, Melody Ehsani, Outdoor Voices, Mented and others.</p>
<p>According to Pinterest&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LnTYC0wlmd-0WV587B8PGqzNLhIZg-1Xh7I79y8OsMw/viewform?edit_requested=true#response=ACYDBNgUy4RB_Sc7JuxYxDHrDZjASzsFlqr1HwHchvqz3jE2vAB5u-Ws0ZP4hxJhLQIiVdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call to action,</a> these shows will be 30 minutes in length and will include a 10-30 minute pre-production call with Pinterest&#8217;s team and AV tech check.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea, Pinterest explains, is to create a new way for its users to become inspired &#8212; instead of just browsing images for products and ideas, as before, Pinterest TV allows the company to move further into video and the creator economy.</p>
<p>This shift is a pivot Pinterest has been trying to make for many months. As new social networks like TikTok are becoming the place where younger, Gen Z users are discovering ideas which then translate into online shopping purchases, Pinterest&#8217;s image pinboard experience has started to feel dated &#8212; like a holdover from another era of the web. This is an issue facing other, older social networks, as well. Instagram&#8217;s head, for example, recently said its app<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> would no longer be focused on photo sharing</a>, as it&#8217;s now embracing video.</p>
<p>Similarly, Pinterest has been working to make video more core to its platform. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">it introduced a TikTok-like &#8220;Watch&#8221; tab</a> where users can vertically scroll through a feed of creator&#8217;s videos, which they can like, comment on and save to their Pinterest boards. These videos are a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">newer type of content type which Pinterest calls &#8220;Idea Pins,</a>&#8221; a video-first feature that lets creators demonstrate some sort of idea or DIY &#8212; like cooking a recipe or doing a craft, for example.</p>
<p>To encourage creators to make videos, Pinterest is investing $20 million in Creator Rewards and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">offering other tools to allow them to monetize their content</a>, like those for enabling affiliate links, partnering with brands on sponsored content, product tagging and more.</p>
<p>However, most of what Pinterest has been doing on the video front so far has not been unique. Instead, it&#8217;s about a site playing catch-up with where the web is heading &#8212; toward creator-backed content, videos and live shopping experiences.</p>
<p>Pinterest TV is another example of this broader plan being put into action. And to be successful, Pinterest will need to be able to prove it&#8217;s worth creators&#8217; time and effort, given the competition among social platforms for creator talent &#8212; not to mention the large creator funds being offered by the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Snap and YouTube as they try to combat the TikTok threat.</p>
<p>So far, Pinterest says creators who’ve pilot tested Pinterest TV episodes were able to increase their followings, with some creators more than doubling their followers after a live episode. However, the company will still need to prove out that larger followings will translate to larger creator revenues over time. (At launch, Pinterest says it&#8217;s not directly profiting from Pinterest TV).</p>
<p>While Pinterest TV is only currently available to select creators, the company is offering<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LnTYC0wlmd-0WV587B8PGqzNLhIZg-1Xh7I79y8OsMw/viewform?edit_requested=true#response=ACYDBNgUy4RB_Sc7JuxYxDHrDZjASzsFlqr1HwHchvqz3jE2vAB5u-Ws0ZP4hxJhLQIiVdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a sign-up form</a> for others who are interested in creating TV episodes through the new service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is rolling out a pilot program in the Netherlands that opens 10 Supercharger locations to non-Tesla electric vehicles for the first time.</p>
<p>Non-Tesla drivers that want to use a Supercharger location will first need to download the Tesla app and create an account with the company. From there, they can select &#8220;Charge Your Non-Tesla,&#8221; search for a location, add a payment method and start charging, according to information on Tesla&#8217;s Netherlands website.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Trial program for opening Tesla Superchargers to other EVs has begun <a href="https://t.co/g4HpgRGl7d">https://t.co/g4HpgRGl7d</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226956" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1455186850155479048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Drivers operating non-Tesla EVs will not have a totally seamless charging experience; while Tesla users can simply plug in and out, these drivers will have to indicate on the app when to start and stop the charging session. And while the price of electricity will stay the same for Tesla owners, non-Teslas will incur additional costs, including those “associated with charging a large number of different cars and made to make the locations suitable for cars from other brands,” the company said.</p>
<p>Only EVs with a CCS standard connection will be eligible to participate in the pilot. Here in the U.S., Tesla Superchargers use a proprietary connector, but CEO Elon Musk indicated in a second-quarter earnings call in July that an adapter could be sold or offered at the company’s North America charging locations, should the network open in the U.S. He also suggested that the company could implement dynamic pricing during busy periods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pilot will let Tesla “gain experience, monitor flow at the loaders and collect user feedback,” the company said on its website. Tesla is encouraging its drivers to continue using the 10 locations as normal, likely to ensure that it is getting good data on how its flagship users are affected. In the case of non-Teslas charging slower than Tesla vehicles, the pilot will also likely measure the impact of slower charging times on other users.</p>
<p>Musk has long indicated that such a program, which the company is calling the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/nl_NL/support/non-tesla-supercharging?&amp;redirect=no&amp;utm_source=notifications&amp;utm_medium=tesla_app&amp;utm_campaign=ntsc_pilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Non-Tesla’s Supercharger Pilot,”</a> might eventually be introduced. He confirmed in July that the network would open to non-Teslas by the end of this year, and this pilot appears to be just the beginning; the company said on its website that it will be adding additional countries to the program “in the near future.”</p>
<p>Tesla’s Supercharger network includes over 25,000 fast chargers, by far the largest network owned and operated by an automaker in the world.</p>
<p>“Our ambition has always been to open the Supercharger network to Non-Tesla electric cars in order to encourage more drivers to make the switch to electric driving,” Tesla said.</p>
<p>During the earnings call in July, Andrew Baglino, Tesla’s senior VP of powertrain and energy engineering, made the case that opening the Supercharger network to non-Teslas could result in lower electricity costs overall.</p>
<p>“Increasing the utilization of the network actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for our customers and make the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster,” he said. “And no matter what, we&#8217;re going to continue to aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speeds, improving the trip planning tools to protect against site congestion using dynamic pricing, as Elon mentioned.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://octoml.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OctoML</a>, a Seattle-based startup that helps enterprises optimize and deploy their machine learning models, today announced that it has raised an $85 million Series C round led by Tiger Global Management. Previous investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition, Madrona Venture Group and Amplify Partners also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $132 million, including a $28 million Series B round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/octoml-raises-28m-series-b-for-its-machine-learning-acceleration-platform/">announced earlier this year</a>.</span></p>
<p>The company was co-founded by <span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Luis Ceze, CTO Tianqi Chen, CPO Jason Knight, Chief Architect Jared Roesch and VP of Technology Partnerships Thierry Moreau, who together also created the <a href="https://tvm.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache TVM</a> open source machine learning compiler framework. TVM is currently in use by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. OctoML builds on TVM&#8217;s ability to automatically optimize machine learning models and allow them to run on virtually any hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ceze told me, since raising its Series A round, the company has signed up a number of hardware partners, including <a href="https://octoml.ai/blog/importance-of-our-qualcomm-partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm</a>, AMD and Arm. The company also recently worked with Microsoft on a project about deploying <a href="https://octoml.ai/blog/with-apache-tvm-microsoft-research-runs-the-latest-computer-vision-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video content moderation at scale</a>. The company says its users, which feature a number of Global 100 companies, including Toyota, are seeing a 2-10x improvement in their ML model performance after using its service.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226785" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpO4y1mPMWA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time of its Series B earlier this year, the company had just started onboarding some early adopters to its SaaS platform. As Ceze noted ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, that service hasn&#8217;t quite reached general availability yet, but OctoML is now working with a larger number of customers and is focused on making them successful on its platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As models proliferate and get more sophisticated, deploying them in the cloud is also getting more expensive, Ceze noted, so a system that can optimize these models immediately leads to cost savings for the company&#8217;s customers. &#8220;It&#8217;s not only a cost issue but also a sustainability issue,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;If you make something twice as fast on the same hardware, making use of half the energy, that has an impact at scale.&#8221; Increasingly, he noted, the large cloud providers also hit capacity limits for deploying high-end GPUs (there is a chip shortage, after all), so being able to move their models to a different GPU or maybe even to a CPU is another advantage.</span></p>
<p>Ceze noted that the company didn&#8217;t have to raise new funding at this point, but that the team decided to be opportunistic despite still having a healthy runway. &#8220;We looked at all of our opportunities in hardware enablement, in accelerating the SaaS business and cloud enablement. We were, &#8216;oh wow, so we can get even faster here and capture this business.&#8217; We have a business opportunity right in front of us, but we need to scale fast to take full advantage of it,&#8221; Ceze said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to quickly expand its team across various engineering and sales functions to take advantage of this opportunity as it brings on new customers. OctoML also plans to build out its partner ecosystem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OctoML is creating a profound shift in the way organizations build next-generation AI models and applications,&#8221; said Tiger Global partner John Curtius. &#8220;OctoML’s vision of delivering a unified deployment lifecycle for users across all the ML hardware vendors they rely on is making ML development more cost-effective and accessible to a broader set of developers. We’re excited to welcome Luis and the co-founding team at OctoML to the Tiger portfolio, and look forward to playing a role in their next growth chapter.&#8221;</span></p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://zendesk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendesk</a> announced it was acquiring <a href="https://www.momentive.ai/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momentive</a> Global Inc. (<a href="https://investor.zendesk.com/ir-home/financial-reports/financial-releases/financial-releases-details/2021/Zendesk-to-Acquire-Momentive-and-Its-Iconic-SurveyMonkey-Platform/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the organization behind SurveyMonkey</a>) for $4.13 billion last week, it might have felt like a steep price to pay, but it seems that companies are willing to pay a high price to understand what users and customers are thinking &#8212; and that&#8217;s what <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a> gives Zendesk.</p>
<p>Zendesk, whose core offering involves customer service, now has a way to get feedback on that service and collect valuable data about the interactions. In fact, company CEO and founder Mikkel Svane says it&#8217;s all about using that data to create a customer intelligence platform. &#8220;We will deliver a rich, colorful picture of every customer so businesses really understand their customers and can build more authentic relationships,&#8221; Svane said in a statement.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, co-founder and analyst at SMB Group, says the deal makes sense in the context of finding a way to get a better grip on customer attitudes. &#8220;Momentive gives Zendesk a proven, easy-to-use survey tool to provide its customers with another avenue to learn more about their customers’ attitudes and requirements, not just now, but in the future,&#8221; she said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;If they can make it easy to access and analyze blended data from these two platforms, it should provide their customers with a more complete view of individual customers and overall market trends,&#8221; she said. And understanding the customer experience should help improve and refine it when need be.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the ability to collect data and build a more complete picture of the customer is becoming increasingly essential to companies like Zendesk. &#8220;The current [thinking] is that you need survey tools to understand what customers, employees, etc. are thinking and feeling. And that&#8217;s why Zendesk bought Momentive. If you don&#8217;t have the data you need, start a survey,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that it might be tempting to compare this to the $8 billion 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">SAP-Qualtrics deal</a>, but he says while they have overlap, Qualtrics is a far more sophisticated platform, as shown by its market cap today of almost $24 billion, compared to Momentive&#8217;s $4.1 billion purchase price. &#8220;Qualtrics is better understood as being an analytics platform with deep and broad capabilities beyond surveys, which is why its valuation is what it is today,&#8221; Leary explained.</p>
<p>For some perspective, both companies reported earnings last Thursday, with Zendesk reporting $347 million in revenue up 32% YoY for a $1.38 billion run rate. Meanwhile, Momentive reported $109.4 million in revenue, up 24% YoY, putting it on a $437.6 million run rate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From a financial standpoint, the company said that adding Momentive will push it to $3.5 billion in revenue a year ahead of schedule (in 2024) and it&#8217;s anticipating that revenue will reach $4.5 billion by 2025, according to <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/911660223/files/doc_presentations/2021/ZEN-MNTV-Transaction-Deck-10-28-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company presentation</a> about the deal.</p>
<p>The stock market was not kind to either company after the deal was announced last Thursday. When the market closed on Friday, Zendesk was down almost 15% and Momentive down over 8%. Zendesk is still down a bit this morning in early trading, while Momentive is up slightly.</p>
<p>In addition to SurveyMonkey, Momentive also includes a custom mobile survey tool called <a href="https://www.getfeedback.com/en/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetFeedback</a> and a market research arm that is part of the parent company.</p>
<p>Both companies&#8217; boards have already approved the deal. It will still need to be approved by the stockholders at both organizations, who if the initial reaction of the market is any indication, might need to be convinced. In addition, the deal will be subject to standard regulatory oversight. If it makes past these hurdles, it is expected to close some time in the first half of next year. Momentive CEO Zander Laurie will remain with the combined company after the close.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Google suffered a major defeat in its legal battle with Sonos in August, when a U.S. International Trade Commission judge ruled that Google infringed on five of Sonos&#8217; audio technology patents. If the ruling is upheld, Google could pay <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-apple-google-optis-sonos-legal-battles-over-patents-2021-8?mkt_tok=ODUwLVRBQS01MTEAAAF-8utVWcT5kjyev2UB_LaOp5OuoOpv5hKM_-AsApGr57bJBrj28zod4Vj2Mvn2fl5RnGfD0KKA_MCfoWTmClHOe10fMd1x8aNlAqBrZ6m_NPk">hundreds of millions</a> and face a ban on importing everything from Pixel smartphones to Nest speakers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a trivial development. It&#8217;s the latest in a string of lawsuits and complaints intended to stop Big Tech from pilfering IP from smaller companies.</p>
<p>In recent years, Big Tech firms have increasingly infringed on smaller rivals&#8217; IP. Those smaller firms have started fighting back &#8212; and now the largest tech companies could face tens of billions in court-ordered damages and legal fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Big Tech executives continue their reckless infringement, their firms could suffer irreparable financial and reputational damage. Stealing rivals&#8217; IP is no longer merely unethical &#8212; it&#8217;s a business decision so disastrously shortsighted that it arguably constitutes a breach of executives&#8217; fiduciary duties to shareholders.</p>
<p>For a long time, giant technology firms like Apple figured they could freely prey on smaller competitors, which wouldn&#8217;t have the financial or legal firepower to fight back. That&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
<p>Small firms have decided suing is worth the cost &#8212; and have won big. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/11/apple-panoptis-lawsuit-506-million-lte-patents/">just</a> <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1366761/apple-hit-with-308-5m-verdict-in-edtx-patent-trial">three</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/30/apple-virnetx-503-million-patent-infringement/#:~:text=Apple%20Ordered%20to%20Pay%20VirnetX%20Another%20%24502.8%20Million%20for%20Patent%20Infringement,-Friday%20October%2030&amp;text=A%20jury%20today%20ruled%20that,of%20infringing%20on%20VirnetX%20patents">cases</a> this past year, juries awarded small firms more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/texas-distanced-juries-hit-big-tech-with-3-7-billion-of-awards">$1 billion</a>. In August, Apple was ordered to pay PanOptis <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-hit-with-300-million-patent-verdict-after-new-optis-trial-2021-08-13/">$300 million</a> over 4G technology infringement. And last year, a court ordered the company to pay <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-could-owe-1-1-billion-to-virnetx/">$1 billion</a> in damages to VirnetX, a VPN patent holder.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Apple. Last October, a federal court ordered Cisco to pay nearly <a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2020/10/09/centripetal-networks-awarded-1-9-billion-infringement-suit-cisco/id=126094/">$2 billion</a> to Centripetal Networks, a cybersecurity and software firm. The judge in that case called Cisco&#8217;s actions &#8220;an egregious case of willful misconduct beyond typical infringement.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IP theft has the potential to put a significant dent into Big Tech&#8217;s bottom lines. Though these companies boast market capitalizations of hundreds of billions, even trillions, of dollars, racking up mammoth court-ordered payouts isn&#8217;t pleasant.</p>
<p>For example, Cisco&#8217;s payout cost it <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271853/worldwide-net-sales-of-cisco-systems-since-2006/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Cisco's%20revenue%20amounted,and%20technology%20services%20and%20products">4%</a> of its annual revenue. Apple recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/texas-distanced-juries-hit-big-tech-with-3-7-billion-of-awards">settled</a> with a Japanese company rather than have to pay yet another billion dollars in damages. And it threatened to pull out of the United Kingdom entirely rather than face a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/11/apple-attorneys-threaten-uk-market-exit-if-court-orders-unacceptable-patent-fees">$7 billion</a> patent-infringement fee in the British courts.</p>
<p>Even if big firms can weather the financial penalties of their IP theft, the resulting reputational damage is considerable.</p>
<p>U.S. congressional committees regularly haul executives into their chambers for hearings about antitrust and privacy infractions. Consumers increasingly regard Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon with distaste &#8212; or worse. If politicians and customers learn these companies&#8217; profits rest on persistent patent theft, their reputations will take a pounding.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Big Tech executives have a legal fiduciary duty to their shareholders. Executives who continue to turn a blind eye to the risks involved with patent trials &#8212; exposing their firms to immense legal and reputational risk &#8212; will eventually find their morally questionable decisions reflected in share prices.</p>
<p>For their part, shareholders, rank-and-file employees and other stakeholders should hold executives to account. It&#8217;s in the interest of the biggest institutional investors to pressure Apple and others to settle pending cases and hash out licensing agreements with small vendors.</p>
<p>If Big Tech starts operating within the bounds of IP law, they&#8217;ll prime the entire sector for sustained success.</p>
<p>As Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto points out in his seminal work, “The Mystery of Capital,” a society&#8217;s economic prosperity is hugely dependent on its protection and preservation of property rights, including intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Societies with strong property rights protections encourage people to invest in their own ideas. Conversely, societies with weak property rights protections discourage such investment &#8212; and innovation is discouraged as well.</p>
<p>The U.S. tech sector is no exception. Consumers and shareholders should want both small and large firms to thrive. Smaller firms develop input software, applications and hardware that often ends up in consumer-facing products.</p>
<p>But when the big guys bully the little guys and pillage their best ideas without paying, the little guys have no incentive to innovate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for Big Tech to stop patent theft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder is bringing back &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; its interactive in-app event that allows its users another way to break the ice besides just matching and chatting. After the first season&#8217;s &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; apocalyptic storyline brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">over 20 million users</a>, Tinder said it would introduce a new installment, this time featuring a &#8220;whodunit&#8221; murder mystery. That event, &#8220;Swipe Night: Killer Weekend,&#8221; will kick off starting on November 7th at 6 PM, the company announced this morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; will go live in Tinder&#8217;s new Explore section, <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first introduced in June</a>, where the company will now house more of its social experiences. In addition to &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; this section also includes &#8220;Hot Takes,&#8221; which let members chat in real time in a sort of speed dating, timed experience, and &#8220;Passions,&#8221; where users can meet others with similar interests, among other things.</p>
<p>This time, Tinder has made some changes to how &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; will work. Instead of watching a story play out and then making choices as to what they should do next, the new event more directly involves Tinder users themselves, where they become a suspect in the murder mystery. Players will also be able to explore and search rooms within the house and investigate objects for clues.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the end of each week, participants are asked to choose their suspect and they&#8217;ll be paired with another user who chose a different suspect in a &#8220;Fast Chat&#8221; experience (where users can chat without matching), in order to discuss their thoughts, analyze clues and solve the mystery together. These pairings will be algorithmic, based on the user&#8217;s profile preferences where they&#8217;ve indicated who they&#8217;re looking for in terms of factors like age, gender, distance and others. But their choice of a different suspect is meant to help facilitate a conversation &#8212; something that&#8217;s been tricky on online dating apps, where users often struggle with opening lines.</p>
<p>When the conversation ends, players can choose to match with the other person if they want to continue to talk to them beyond the &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; experience.</p>
<p>The company believes this type of low-pressure chat will make it easier for users to test out their compatibility before matching and provides a better overall experience than sending a message to someone in the app, which they might not see until the next day. And by playing a game together, users may be able to be more authentic as they describe their thoughts and choices. This, Tinder argues, is a better way to get to know someone than making a snap decision over a user&#8217;s profile.</p>
<p>Plus, notes Tinder VP of Product Kyle Miller, this type of real-time chat is preferred by Tinder&#8217;s younger users, like Gen Z.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Demographically, we&#8217;re seeing Gen Z engage with these kinds of interactive, fun ways to meet new people features a lot more,&#8221; he explains.  &#8220;This is one of the big reasons why we built &#8216;Explore&#8217; &#8212; we wanted Tinder to feel alive, experiential and immersive&#8230;When you&#8217;re doing kind of the same pattern over and over again of swiping and matching and then chatting&#8230;it can become monotonous. Not what we desired,&#8221; Miller continues. &#8220;Injecting that kind of fun and novelty, but also substance, I think is what we&#8217;re finding Gen Z is really latching on to.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time, Tinder will also make &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; more broadly available, by launching it in 25 global markets, while the original version started off only in the U.S.</p>
<p>And it will be playable at any time, unlike the first season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last time we did &#8216;Swipe Night,&#8217; it was pretty limited in its availability &#8212; Sundays, or only on the weekends,&#8221; says Miller. &#8220;This will be live in &#8216;Explore&#8217; and even after the season is out, it will continue to be available in &#8216;Explore.&#8217; Six months from now, you could actually participate in &#8216;Swipe Night&#8217; and, similar to streaming to today, you&#8217;ll be able to rewatch, or re-experience, the episodes to go back to find more clues.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also didn&#8217;t rule out a future where there&#8217;s a catalog of interactive experiences for users to participate in, at any time, even if they weren&#8217;t all versions of &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; necessarily.</p>
<p>These types of experiences, as they launch, could help Tinder increase user engagement over time, as well as provide better results for members. The first &#8220;Swipe Night&#8217;s&#8221; 20 million users saw a 26% increase in matches, noted Tinder. And now, interest in the &#8220;true crime&#8221; genre is at an all-time high, with bios mentioning it having increased by 20% since the year&#8217;s start. Over 30,000 Tinder bios say they&#8217;re looking for their &#8220;partner in crime,&#8221; as well.</p>
<p>This season of &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; is <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item=122516" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item%3D122516&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635858754389000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hDcpDhcuboY6v4T7Tja7B">directed by Sasie Sealy</a> and features a young, Gen Z cast that includes Ashley Ganger (Grand Army/Netflix), Calvin Seabrooks (Dollface/Hulu, Westworld/HBO Max), Luke Slattery (New Amsterdam, Late Night), Francesca Olivia Xuereb (Room 203, The Sex Lives of College Girls/HBO Max), Nozipho Mclean (The Inheritance, Are You Happy Now), Ivan Carlo (Gossip Girl/HBO Max) and Emile Ravenet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The thing that makes earbuds supremely difficult to review is that no two sets of ears are exactly the same. Heck, no two ears are exactly the same, period. As someone prone to pain using the wrong set for an extended period, I can appreciate the importance of finding the right pair.</p>
<p>When the Beats Fit Pro first leaked, I had my misgivings. Design-wise, they more or less look like the Studio Buds the Apple subsidiary released over the summer, with one major difference: wings. Wings, wingtips, eartips, fins, whatever you call them, I hate them. I respond viscerally to the sight of them, in fact &#8212; weird little pointed things you’re meant to jam into your ears.</p>
<p>Now, I admit that much of this is a holdover from testing workout headphones some years back. In those days, wings were, to a fault, hard plastic things that were every bit as pointed as they looked. And while I can appreciate from a stability standpoint how such a feature works during, say, a long run, I largely try to avoid putting pointy things in or near sensitive parts of my body &#8212; except when absolutely necessary.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225150" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In spite of my initial hesitancy, I’m happy to report that my concerns were overblown. The Fit Pros are comfortable. Like surprisingly so. The buds themselves are fairly small, with the eartips adding wingspan to the design. They’re not unlike the Powerbeats Pro in that respect, but they’re able to accomplish their task with significantly less plastic. The key to the tips’ success is their size and shape and, equally important, the fact that the silicone they’re made from is malleable, meaning they keep things still without digging into the surrounding cartilage.</p>
<p>I’m going to stop short of calling them the most comfortable earbuds I’ve tested. Honestly, that distinction probably belongs to their older sibling, the Powerbeats Pro. While that design is big and somewhat unwieldly, the over-the-ear displaces the weight and pressure of the buds. And while the Fit Pros only weigh 11.2 grams, that can still wear on you after extended periods.</p>
<p>They also do an admirable job keeping things in place. I took up running again recently, and have been trying all sorts of earbuds (with limited success). When we think about keeping headphones in place while working out, we (I think understandably) tend to focus on physical movement. What we tend to ignore is how that combines with sweat, making it both difficult to keep the buds in place and hard to fumble to adjust them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The Fit Pro excelled there better than any other buds of recent vintage on this front. If you’re primarily looking for a pair of gym buds, these are hard to beat (so to speak). The wingtip meets the bud to form a physical button. It’s meant to be pressed at the edge furthest from the tip. Pressing in the middle will apply more pressure to your ear. A single press will play/pause/answer a call, double skips a track forward, three goes back and a long press toggles between ANC and transparency modes.</p>
<p>These sorts of physical buttons are necessary for workout headphones. Touch gets a bit tricky when you sweat. The biggest downside on this front is that the relatively small size does result in some accidental button presses if you need to adjust them while working out. But even so, they’re well ahead of most earbuds for this purpose. It’s also a nice change from Studio Buds, which I found extremely difficult to keep in place while going for a run.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224322" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224322" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2224322" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0666.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224322" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the wingtip’s attachment to the button means it’s not removable or user-replaceable. That’s a bit of a bummer. It would be great to be able to take the tips off when a workout is over, though likely that would compromise their structural integrity &#8212; and it’s just another thing to possibly lose. But if the wingtip gets damaged, you’ll need to send the whole thing back (if under warranty). Apple/Beats isn’t selling that bit separately.</p>
<p>The sound is good here &#8212; pretty similar to what you get on other Beats. That is to say, it’s bass-heavy. If you’re looking for a pair of buds for, say, enjoying the subtle nuances of jazz, I’d recommend something from Sony. These are more “let’s toss on a pumped-up playlist and go for a run” headphones &#8212; and there’s certainly a place for that. Active noise canceling is excellent, as well. It did a good job blocking out ambient street noise and bad gym music, especially when I swapped in a large pair of silicone tips.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224327" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224327" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2224327" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0650.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224327" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Being Apple-owned, it’s probably unsurprising that the buds work best with iOS devices. That’s due in large part to the inclusion of the H1 chip. In addition to fast paring and automatic device switching, you’ll get Find My functionality and Spatial Audio. That last bit, which is also available on various AirPods, uses headtracking to redirect the sound of audio. That means a more speaker-like experience for music listening and assigning the location of voices based on screen placement in FaceTime. I’ll be honest, it feels like a novelty for now. Android users, meanwhile, should download the Beats app for the full experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224324" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224324" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2224324" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0664.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224324" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>One of the unheralded upshots of moving from loops to wingtips is getting a significantly smaller charging case. The Powerbeats Pro’s case is a monster. The Fit Pro’s isn’t small by any stretch (it’s still significantly larger than the AirPods), but it’s actually small enough to carry around in a pocket. And thanks to some hardware advances, you actually get more combined battery on the Fit, at 27 hours versus 24. The buds themselves are rated at six to seven hours, depending on use. The case takes about 90 minutes for a full charge, doing so via USB-C &#8212; a distinct advantage for those of us who aren’t big Lightning fans. Points lost, however, for the exclusion of wireless chargin.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Fit Pros don’t actually replace any other member of the Beats family. Power Beats Pro, Studio Buds and all of the tethered units are sticking around. There’s a bit of redundancy here, but Beats has always played it a bit faster and loser than its parent company on that front.</p>
<p>At $199, they’re right between the Beats Studio and the Powerbeats Pro. But for most people in most cases (particularly those who work out frequently), they’re the best bet of the bunch. They go up for preorder today and start shipping November 5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">More of the world’s economy is moving online, and that is underscored by the long list of recent fundings and acquisitions in the digital ID authentication and anti-money laundering (AML) space, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okta’s $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0</a>. Today, another startup announced it has raised capital: end-to-end due diligence platform <a href="https://www.firstaml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First AML</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Blackbird Ventures (which is also one of First AML’s users) and Headline led a $21 million (about $29.2 million NZD) Series B in the New Zealand-based company, with participation from returning investors Bedrock Capital, Icehouse Ventures and Pushpay founder Eliot Crowther. This brings First AML’s total raised to about $30.1 million USD (about $42 million USD).</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, First AML entered Australia this year and will use part of its Series B to expand into international markets, starting with the United Kingdom. It is also looking at Singapore and the United States. The company also plans to double its employee count from 90 to 180.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226857" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta acquires cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/embed/#?secret=afyF8bH6yu" data-secret="afyF8bH6yu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the main ways First AML is different from other digital ID authentication startups (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/forgerock-files-for-ipo-as-identity-and-access-management-business-grows/">ForgeRock</a>, to name a few) is that instead of individual end users, it focuses on complex entities and transactions, which may mean performing due diligence on multiple organizations and people at a time. Unlike many other authentication and KYC (know your customer) startups, its main clients aren’t banks. Its clients include other types of financial service providers, accountants, law firms and real estate agencies.</p>
<p>“We haven’t focused on working with banks because there are a lot of medium-sized enterprises in the economy that also need to comply with AML rules,” co-founder and chief executive officer Milan Cooper told TechCrunch. “Many people focus on banks because those are the big guys, but the smaller law firms and investment firms, they need to comply as well. What we’ve found is that they don’t have the resources to invest in internal teams to set up a really sophisticated compliance process.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jumio raises $150M as its all-in-one ID authentication platform crosses 300M verified identities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/embed/#?secret=PgapNJ3zbp" data-secret="PgapNJ3zbp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First AML’s founding team, which also includes Bion Behdin and Chris Caigou, wanted to launch the startup because two of them (Cooper and Caigou) were former corporate bankers and “saw the pain of AML onboarding firsthand context and how it would slow down transactions,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>For example, compliance teams needed to contact multiple stakeholders for documentation, and often had to follow up because the wrong paperwork was sent. “The KYC process is so cumbersome and it was not a good customer experience trying to onboard, so we saw an opportunity to streamline it and remove friction.”</p>
<p>The company’s proprietary platform seeks to automate as much of the compliance process as possible, such as ID verification (including biometric identification for remote verifications) and visual tools that help clients understand company ownership structures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226860" style="width: 1032px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226860" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png" alt="An example of First AML's user interface" width="1022" height="863" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png 1022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=300,253 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=768,649 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=680,574 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226860" class="wp-caption-text">An example of First AML&#8217;s user interface. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> First AML</p></div></p>
<p>“We take on the full KYC process end to end, and importantly, we do it for complex customer entities like companies and trusts. This is where many of our competitors don’t offer a full end-to-end solution,” said Cooper. “They might offer a solution for identity verification of a single person, whereas we are taking that whole process off their hands, which includes digging through the layers of a complex entity to understand who the beneficial owners are and coordinating the data collection process from multiple beneficial owners.”</p>
<p>For example, law firms that need to comply with AML regulations use First AML to conduct KYC on potential clients, which may include companies with multiple shareholders, directors and subsidiaries, that all need to be checked. Meanwhile, investment firms turn to the platform to onboard new investors, including trust structures and other types of complex entities.</p>
<p>Many of First AML’s clients previously relied on manual email and paper-based processes that often required people to send notarized copies of documents like passports or utility bills. First AML’s platform starts by analyzing an entity’s structure. Then it pulls data from public sources and obtains information from non-public sources.</p>
<p>“Essentially we figure out what’s going on in these complex entity structures, which are very prevalent in financial and other sectors, and then the platform facilitates data collection from multiple stakeholders within that complex entity, including biometric ID verification, and uploaded documents,” Cooper explained.</p>
<p>First AML is also building database, which currently has more than 350,000 verified entities. If an entity onboards through its platform and is involved in other compliance procedures, First AML can get their consent to retrieve their previous verifications. This means they don’t need to go through the full AML process every time they do a transaction. “It’s a key differentiator for us and a key competitive advantage that will really speed up the way KYC happens in the future,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>Cooper said the recent publication of <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pandora Papers</a>, an investigative report that revealed the hidden offshore accounts of 35 former and current world leaders, has increased concerns about AML compliance.</p>
<p>“Our take is that there is still a lot of shady transactions going on in the global economy and the Pandora Papers have revealed that there is a lot of money going around and tax evasion occurring. For us, this is a signal to governments that AML laws are needed in many countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Australia is still behind some of the rest of the world in terms of introducing AML rules into new sectors like legal accounting and real estate. The U.S. is another example where it’s the financial sector that’s captured, but non-financial sectors are not. It puts more pressure on lawmakers to clamp down on these illegal activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Blackbird Ventures partner Samantha Wong said, “We heavily rely on First AML. This is what is special about this deal—how intimately connected we are to the customer pain point, our love for the product roadmap and the network effects that emerge as their business model goes global.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past 20 years, there has been a steady flight of capital away from deep-tech – those science-and tech-related breakthroughs on which world-changing businesses are built, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://waldencatalyst.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walden Catalyst</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> said.  </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The VC firm has a belief in the ability of data as the “fuel” and AI as the “engine” to transform the way people live, work and play. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lip-Bu Tan and Young Sohn created this fund to invest in early-stage deep tech companies, specifically big data, AI, semiconductor, cloud, and digital biology, Managing Partner of Walden Catalyst Sohn told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The San Francisco-based venture capital firm announced today the closing of a $550 million fund, which was oversubscribed. The company did not disclose the names of its limited partners. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225583" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sohn and Tan, who have proven track records across the semiconductors, cloud, and electronics industries, are early investors in many tech companies, including Zoom, Inphi, Berkeley Lights, Habana, and Nuvia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Walden Catalyst is a new fund founded in early 2021, but it has a strong legacy from Walden International and Samsung Catalyst Fund,” said Sohn, who previously held the position of corporate president and chief strategy officer at Samsung Electronics. Tan is also the founder and chairman of Walden International. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Walden Catalyst focuses on the U.S., Europe, and Israel as it sees consistent breakthroughs from the three regions in the areas of its interest, deep tech, Young said. Also, its partners have deep networks in those countries, having invested in the deep tech industries over the last few decades, helping Walden find breakthrough ideas attracting top entrepreneurs, Young added.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To date, Walden Catalyst has invested in six deep-tech startups, three in the US, two in Israel, and one in the EU, Young continued. Walden Catalyst’s portfolio companies include </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/speedata-emerges-from-stealth-with-70m-and-groundbreaking-chip-technology-to-accelerate-big-data-analytics-processing/">Speedata</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, MindsDB, AI21 Labs, and the other three companies that remain in stealth mode, he mentioned. The company&#8217;s initial ticket size ranges from a few million to $25 million in one round, Young noted. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[To date, the company has over 9,000 paying customers, has tripled revenue in the past 12 months and maintained profitability for more than 18 months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.apollo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo.io</a>, which is developing sales intelligence and engagement software for business-to-business companies, brought in $32 million in Series B funding to continue with its go-to-market acceleration approach.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital led the round and was joined by NewView Capital and existing investor Nexus Venture Partners. The latest funding gives the San Francisco-based company $40 million in total funding since it was founded in 2015, co-founder and CEO Tim Zheng told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Zheng previously founded a company in the education space doing something similar that helped customers send more targeted marketing emails. When friends saw how well it worked, they wanted a tool like that for their respective industries, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226582" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He says the subscription-based service has amassed over 2 million business contacts to help customers more accurately identify prospective customers using advanced algorithms and more than 200 unique business attributes. The tool displays this information automatically when visiting LinkedIn profiles and will also alert you with new contact information if someone changes jobs or is promoted.</p>
<p>“Usually the way to generate sales is to find the pipeline of customers, and to do that outbound, you have to figure out the right people, and we streamline and automate that process,” he added. “Instead of setting up Apollo in months, it takes minutes and a couple of clicks.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sales reps that were averaging 10 to 12 meetings can look to book three times that amount using Apollo, Zheng said. To date, the company has over 1 million user signups and 9,000 paying customers. It has grown its user base by more than 200% and tripled revenue in the past 12 months and maintained profitability for more than 18 months.</p>
<p>He believes there is still a big part of the market that is untapped, and the new funding will enable the company to accelerate marketing, engineering and product development. The company also intends to double its employees to 300 in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Sri Pangulur, partner at Tribe Capital, joined Apollo.io’s board. Pangulur was tracking the company over the last year and the firm decided to lead the round after seeing its adoption and using the product itself.</p>
<p>“As we emerge from the pandemic, buyers want an Amazon-like experience where companies are anticipating their needs. You need user data to better drive the sales experience, and as it evolves more personalized capabilities as well,” he added. “Apollo has some unique positioning in that they are doing product-led growth, but also covering the data stack as well.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Users can choose to create from scratch or import designs, then use the library and layouts features to create fully functional pages.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The traditional way to design for the mobile environment involves a lot of back-and-forth as developers design in one program, prototype in another and collaborate in yet a third tool.</p>
<p>A new startup, <a href="http://www.createwithplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play,</a> is touting itself as “the only native iOS product design tool that makes it possible to <a href="https://createwithplay.medium.com/4eab0d770738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create, iterate and collaborate directly from your phone</a>.” Legacy software requests workarounds and hacks to do something similar, explained company co-founder and co-CEO Dan LaCivita.</p>
<p>“This is the only design tool that uses the phone as a primary input device,” he told TechCrunch. “It allows you to design, prototype and collaborate from the phone and is the only one that gives product designers a way to experience designs as they are creating them on the medium they are using. You can essentially play in Apple’s sandbox without having to code.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can choose to create from scratch or import designs from tools, like Figma, and use the Play Library for common user interface components like buttons, cards and video players or Page Layouts for something quick and customizable to create fully functional pages. There’s also native iOS features like live maps, augmented reality and camera functionality.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h97u3rmHgj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/">Figma continues expansion beyond design with updates to FigJam whiteboard tool</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma continues expansion beyond design with updates to FigJam whiteboard tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/embed/#?secret=h97u3rmHgj" data-secret="h97u3rmHgj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>LaCivita started the company in 2019 with Eric Eng, Joon Park and Michael Ferdman, who all worked together in a previous startup called Firstborn where they built websites and mobile products.</p>
<p>“We experienced all of the pain points firsthand,” LaCivita said. “Joon said there had to be a better way. We are continuing to build on traditional graphic design software, so we don’t need another tool, but another approach, like the phone, as an input device.”</p>
<p>Play is in the App Store, but is in private beta with a waitlist of over 25,000 people. They will be let in over the next few months and into next year. It is a freemium model right now, but next year will also have some pricing tiers.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $9.1 million in funding led by First Round Capital and including Oceans Ventures. The round is a combination of seed rounds from earlier this year and last year.</p>
<p>The funding will go toward scaling the team and continuing to develop new products, like Play for iPad, which was announced two weeks ago, that was a direct ask from customers, LaCivita said. It also recently unveiled its Teams feature to allow people to collaborate with one another.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the founders first met with Todd Jackson from First Round Capital they were not looking to raise, but the “relationship clicked,” LaCivita said, and they found a partner that they felt would collaborate more as a teammate than as a venture capitalist.</p>
<p>Jackson said he found Play on Twitter and became intrigued. In his previous roles at Dropbox and Facebook, he had worked with designers having the same usability issues.</p>
<p>He sent Play to some of his friends who spent hours building a design and adding animations that were only available on the desktop.</p>
<p>“It never occurred to me that you could do this much on a phone,” he said. “There is a mental model where people think there is just one design tool that does one thing. We often talk about how many ideas for mobile products don’t see the light of day because you can’t share it with someone else. Play unlocks that for everyone.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mosaic.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosaic Building Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Phoenix, Arizona-based construction tech startup, has raised $44 million in a Series B funding round led by Peak State Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors Starwood Capital, invisionAZ, Tekfen Ventures, Volt Capital, Brightstone and Naval Ravikant also put money in the round. They joined previous backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Building Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, 8VC, Founders Fund and the Milstein family, bringing Mosaic’s total funding to $68.75 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Mosaic’s software and team serve as a tech-enabled general contractor for production-scale residential development projects. In other words, the company manages construction infrastructure in what it says is an effort to free up real estate developers to focus on things like land acquisition, sales and marketing and architecture. The end goal? To make residential construction more scalable.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226734" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it is able to do that because its technology actually automates the construction planning process. Its software is designed to shorten build times, cut costs, reduce materials waste and improve construction quality for homebuilders. At its core, Mosaic’s technology digitizes standard construction plans and identifies the best way for homes to be built onsite, using the same materials, workers and procedures as traditional home builders do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Salman Ahmad, co-founder and CEO of Mosaic: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been trying to vertically integrate our construction operations with our technology stack&#8230;instead of us trying to take the approach of just building software that addresses a single point solution, we&#8217;re basically trying to do what AWS did for tech startups where home builders and residential developers are able to offload their construction operations to Mosaic and focus their time and energy on their business operations.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226737" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226737" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226737 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mosaic CEO and co-founder Salman Ahmad / Mosaic</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of proptech companies using software to make construction more efficient, but Mosaic has taken a unique strategy of</span><a href="https://www.builderonline.com/land/development/mandalay-homes-partners-with-mosaic-for-new-home-construction-in-arizona_o"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquiring a home builder, Mandalay Homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a move that created an instant pipeline to put its technology to work on building new homes, according to Ahmad. To date, the company has completed 160 homes and has 195 under construction, with the plan of building 400 homes over the next two years.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is looking to double its current 70-person headcount by the end of 2022 and to speed up the construction of homes within its more than $500 million residential development project pipeline.  Specifically, it is actively recruiting engineering, product, back office, construction and project management roles. It is also looking to expand outside of its home state Arizona by the end of next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that doesn’t serve the other 99.99% of homes that are still customized to the buyer and built on site,” he wrote via email. “No one has figured out a way to change that equation until Sep and Salman started Mosaic, and the magic of why Mosaic works is they care just as much about why people work together as the homes that get built.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosaic’s effort to have a focus on tradespeople, or subcontractors, in fact is something that Ahmad is proud of &#8212; especially as the labor shortages rage on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that the trade partners are the industry&#8217;s most precious resources and a lot of what Mosaic’s focus has been to develop technologies and tools to really enable our trade partners to be successful and to be able to lean on  osaic as a trusted and preferred building partner,” he said. “It&#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious to us that maximizing the efficiency of the precious trade resources that we have is paramount to not just our success as a business, but the success of the industry and to addressing some of the broader housing crises that exist across the country.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While studying engineering at Stanford, Alex Kolchinski, Alex Gruebele and Max Perham met and bonded around the lack of food options on campus and the cost of the options that were there.</p>
<p>“Even on a subsidized meal plan, it would cost $10 for lunch and more for dinner,” Kolchinski told TechCrunch. “I would sit and do my work in the dining hall just to be able to eat two lunches. Alex (Gruebele) would just go to Chipotle and spend his stipend there.”</p>
<p>While thinking about how to provide good food at a lower cost, both Kolchinski and Gruebele, who were doing PhD work involving robotics, got to thinking about how robots could help people with meal prepping and other tasks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It turns out that a $10 burrito bowl really costs $3 in food costs, and the rest of the money goes to places like labor, overhead and real estate,” Kolchinski added. “If we built a self-contained restaurant, we would bring down the price of really good food, and it would be close by.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226433" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226433" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226433" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Step-by-step-bowl-animation.gif" alt="Mezli bowl animation" width="900" height="900" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226433" class="wp-caption-text">Animation of how a Mezli bowl comes together. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mezli</p></div></p>
<p>The trio paired up with Michelin-star chef Eric Minnich, who was previously part of the founding culinary team and executive chef of Spanish restaurant The Commissary in San Francisco, to start <a href="https://www.mezli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mezli</a>, a company building fully autonomous modular restaurants. Most of the plans were laid out last year, and started in January at Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Mezli&#8217;s prototype robot restaurant is making a minority of the bowls served to customers and is supplemented by a human-powered kitchen. It is up and running and serving customers from the company’s KitchenTown location in San Mateo. The machines take up a 10-foot by 20-foot space and are freestanding. They are loaded with ingredients, initially offering Mediterranean-style grain bowls, side dishes and drinks.</p>
<p>The bowls start at $6.99. Diners can order directly from the restaurant or order online and pick up the food or have it delivered. The test location is already showing promise: 44% of customers who have tried the food have become repeat customers, Kolchinski said.</p>
<p>The company is now working on its third version of its prototype that will be ready for a public launch next year, he said. That momentum is backed by a $3 million seed round from investors including Metaplanet, roboticist Pieter Abbeel, restaurateur Zaid Ayoub and Y Combinator. That new funding will enable the company to add more talent, parts, food and operational expenses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once the company can scale, Mezli will be able to mass produce thousands of the modular restaurants and deploy them in a fraction of the time and money it takes for traditional restaurants to get up and running, Kolchinski added.</p>
<p>“We will be scaling up to a few locations and then mass producing them,” he said. “We expect to hit 1,000 locations faster than other restaurants due to our mass production method.”</p>
<p>One of Mezli’s backers, Pieter Abbeel, is a professor at UC Berkeley and an entrepreneur on the founding team of both Gradescope and Covariant. He heard about Mezli from some of the founding teams’ classmates and wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>He was attracted to the company’s vision of providing healthy food that is more affordable and accessible. As a scientist himself, he also liked the “<a href="https://fs.blog/first-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first principles</a>” approach to using business and engineering to reduce the bottleneck of getting food into people’s hands and how the food is served.</p>
<p>“It resonates with me,” Abbeel said. “Anything physical is always harder than you think, so if you don’t come up with a first principles way to solve it, it will be difficult. In addition, from day one, the food was being served and that is compelling.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your spooktacular central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. <em>Happy Halloween</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an insane week of news that kicked off with <strong>Tesla</strong> hitting a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/trillion-dollar-tesla/">trillion-dollar market valuation</a> when shares pushed higher after Hertz announced plans to buy 100,000 of its electric vehicles. At the same time, the FSD software beta saga has continued to play out. The latest was National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman <strong>Jennifer Homendy</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/ntsb-chair-elon-musk-change-tesla-autopilot/">calling on Tesla</a> to change the design of its advanced driver assistance system to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to the company’s CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FSD controversy is not fading away. I wonder if Tesla owners, especially those who bought into FSD years ago, will turn on Musk and the company? They can&#8217;t possibly love Musk&#8217;s latest comments, in which he confirmed that Tesla vehicles with Autopilot 2.0 will need a camera upgrade before owners who already bought FSD can get access to the beta software. But perhaps these owners will happily bring in their vehicles for the upgrade. How do you expect this to play out?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I started my week by exchanging a Jeep Wrangler 4XE Unlimited Sahara plug-in hybrid for the new all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQS580 4MATIC. These vehicles, which were provided to me for one week of testing, couldn&#8217;t be more different. Reflecting on my experiences with EVs over the past six years or more, it&#8217;s fascinating to see what has improved and what has not. More to come on my thoughts about these two vehicles.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The understated news of the week came from the <strong>North American Bikeshare and Scootershare Alliance</strong> (NABSA) and its annual conference. One of the many interesting micromobility concepts that was covered during the event was the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/private-and-public-sector-come-together-to-create-privacy-principles-for-mobility-data/">seven privacy principles for mobility data</a>. Created via a collab between mobility companies&#8211; like Uber, Lyft, Spin, Bird and Lime &#8212; cities and other stakeholders, these guidelines at least start the conversation on responsible uses of rider data, both on the city side and the operator side.</p>
<h3>Micromobility operator update</h3>
<p><strong>Spin</strong> and <strong>TransLoc</strong>, a transpo tech and software provider, have announced a five-year agreement with the University of California San Diego to create a mobility ecosystem that will optimize how the school&#8217;s 75,000 students and staff move around campus. Spin will also be expanding its presence at the uni, bringing in 600 e-bikes and e-scooters and a network of Spin Hub charging stations, which will be integrated into TransLoc&#8217;s transit software. Next year, TransLoc will also power the school&#8217;s small buses and electric carts for on-demand services.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong>, which also offers vehicles to the UCSD students, has announced to the world that size does matter. The operator is <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/how-bird-increased-footboard-size-improves-scooter-safety-stability/">expanding the footboards</a> on its Bird Three scooters to sturdy 25 inches, saying a bigger footboard makes for a more stable, more comfortable ride.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/bird-shared-vehicles-now-featured-in-moovit-transit-planning-app/">Bird just integrated</a> with transit planning app <strong>Moovit</strong> in 65 cities across 12 countries. Bird joins the likes of Spin and Lime on the app, all of which will now be able to feature available nearby vehicles, including how long it&#8217;ll take to walk to them and what their charge is like.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more Bird thing. Keep an eye out for the company&#8217;s IPO! Bird goes public via SPAC any day now. Its shareholder vote to approve the SPAC deal is on November 2, and its first Q3 earnings call is scheduled for November 15.</p>
<p><strong>Cake</strong>, the Swedish e-motorbike maker, is launching its first real live store. The CAKEsite, as the company is calling it, is a combo between a showroom, retail, test ride and service center. The site in Stockholm is the first of a planned 25 sites in North America and Europe by 2025.</p>
<h3>When cities do micromobility right</h3>
<p>The <strong>Miami Riders Alliance</strong> announced that its e-scooter program has recorded more than 1.2 million rides in 2021, and is on track to beat the previous ridership record of 1.3 million rides from 2019 before the end of November. The pilot program has generated over $3M in city revenue, which has helped fund new protected bike lanes downtown.</p>
<p><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong> is getting a <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/no-additional-lanes-for-cars-in-64b-wellington-transport-plan/2G3PUMHJ4VCCUZ35S2C7NYB3R4/">second Mt Victoria tunnel</a> per its $6.4 billion transport package, and among the options that are being discussed is one that would convert the tunnel into one dedicated to walking and cycling only. That&#8217;s a big deal in a city that&#8217;s pretty car-centric. There&#8217;s also talk of adding a dedicated bus priority lane to the mix, which would really open up non-car transit options for those in the eastern suburbs of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Paris</strong> wants to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-22/how-paris-will-become-100-cyclable">100% cyclable</a> by 2026 and is planning to throw down $291 million to bulk out its protected bike lane system by 180 miles, build 180,000 new bike parking spots, get rid of 70,000 on-street car parking spots, help businesses get on cargo bikes and raise awareness among school kids about how to bike.</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser started offering free 30-day Capital Bikeshare memberships to all D.C. residents to combat travel disruptions caused by reduced Metrorail service. Now that&#8217;s how you integrate micromobility into public transit!</p>
<h3>Micromobility money</h3>
<p><strong>Tier Mobility</strong> just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tier-scoots-off-with-first-close-of-its-200m-series-d/">snagged $200 million</a> which it says is the &#8220;first close&#8221; of its Series D. The Berlin-based company is going to raise even more, apparently. Tier says the full round will be a mix of debt and equity.</p>
<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>, the fat tire e-bike manufacturer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/rad-power-bikes-raises-154m-series-d/">raised a $154 million</a> Series D from existing institutional investors, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $329 million. The company will spend the money on funding tech and product innovation, building out its distribution centers and expanding its supply chain.</p>
<h3>Fresh swag</h3>
<p>E-bike manufacturer <strong>Tenways</strong> just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/the-tenways-cgo-600-is-a-very-serviceable-urban-belt-drive-e-bike-great-for-commutes/">launched its first model</a>, the CGO 600, on Indiegogo at a price of $1,400. It&#8217;s optimized for the urban environment, with a lightweight frame and a 250W motor for steep hills. And even though its on Indiegogo, which really gives no indication of whether the bike is actually going to make it to your door or not, the company says its bikes are already rolling off the production lines.</p>
<p><strong>Serial 1</strong>, electric bike-spawn of <strong>Harley Davidson</strong>, has unveiled its second single-edition e-bike. The <a href="http://www.serial1.com/bmx">MOSH/BMX</a> is available for auction, which will close on Tuesday, November 2 at 5pm MDT.</p>
<p><strong>Future Motion</strong> is launching <a href="http://onewheel.com/">two new Onewheels</a>: the GT and the Pint X. The GT is Onewheel&#8217;s new flagship product with more power, torque and performance. It&#8217;s got 3hp and gives up to 32 miles of charge. The vehicle is available for pre-order and ships in January, and it&#8217;ll cost $2,200. The Pint X is a compacted model with 18 miles of charge per day and a top speed of 18 mph. This one costs $1,400 and ships now.</p>
<p>E-bike and e-scooter maker <strong>Okai</strong> is launching the Beetle EA10 seated electric scooter and the Neon ES20 portable, smart street scooter, signaling a desire to hit different use cases. The Beetle has a wide cushioned seat and shock absorbers, and can go 16 mph at top speed. The Neon has a 1-click folding design, sweet customizable neon lights on the stem and undercarriage and 25 miles of range.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new deal as much as a new disclosure that gives fresh insight into how closely Rivian&#8217;s future is tied to Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon disclosed Friday that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">owns a 20% stake in Rivian</a>. That&#8217;s notable!</p>
<p>According to a regulatory filing, Amazon held equity investments (as of September 30) including preferred stock of Rivian that represented about 20% ownership interest. That holding had a &#8220;carrying value&#8221; of $3.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Amazon has invested $1.345 billion into Rivian, according to the EV maker&#8217;s initial public offering. Amazon also recently purchased $490 million worth of convertible notes in Rivian that will convert to Class A shares after the IPO, pursuant to certain pricing provisions.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? Amazon stands to gain if Rivian&#8217;s IPO is successful. And Rivian might be an independent company, but Amazon has considerable influence as an investor and customer. Expect Amazon to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> dipped back into its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-2b-climate-fund-invest-three-startups/">$2 billion climate fund</a> and invested in fast-charging technology Resilient Power, CMC Machinery and put additional capital into Infinium, a renewable fuels technology company it previously backed.</p>
<p><strong>Arc</strong>, a startup that launched 10 months ago with ambitions to electrify everything on the water, has brought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/">on several new investors</a>, including funds from Will Smith&#8217;s Dreamers VC, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#8217;s Thirty Five Ventures and Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs&#8217; Combs Enterprises. The new investment, which co-founder and CEO Mitch Lee describes as a strategic round, pushes Arc&#8217;s total funding past $7 million. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz led the company&#8217;s seed round in February. Chris Sacca&#8217;s Lowercarbon Capital and Ramtin Nami&#8217;s Abstract Ventures invested in Arc&#8217;s seed round.</p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong>, the autonomous vehicle startup scheduled to make its debut on Nasdaq in November, snapped up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/self-driving-startup-aurora-taps-pixar-veterans-to-make-a-more-realistic-virtual-world-for-testing/">three-person computer graphic imagery startup</a> Colrspace, which has been operating in stealth. The team of Pixar veterans has technology that Aurora believes can improve the computer simulation tool it uses to test and train its self-driving system more like the real world. Aurora will also own Colrspace&#8217;s IP, specifically technology that combines CGI and machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Autochek</strong>, an African automotive company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tlcom-and-4dx-drive-13-1m-seed-round-to-scale-autocheks-platform-across-africa/">raised $13.1 million</a> in a seed round led by pan-African VC firms TLcom Capital and 4DX Ventures. Existing investors Golden Palm Investments, Enza Capital and Lateral Capital along with new backers ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, the venture capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group, also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Autofleet</strong>, the Israel-based vehicle-as-a-service platform that focuses on fleets, has had a busy week. The startup raised $20 million in Series B funding led by Keyframe Capital and with participation from Goodyear. Mizmaa Ventures, Maniv Mobility and Next Gear Ventures. Autofleet also locked in a partnership with Fujitsu, which also made a strategic investment in  the startup through a corporate venture capital fund managed by its subsidiary Fujitsu Ventures Limited.</p>
<p><strong>ClearFlame Engine Technologies </strong>raised $17 million in Series A round led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from Mercuria, John Deere and Clean Energy Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Gringo</strong>, a Brazilian startup that has built an app aimed at supporting drivers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/gringo-raises-8m-to-help-brazilians-manage-auto-related-documentation-with-its-app/">raised $8 million</a> in a new round of funding led by Kaszek and included participation from GFC and OneVC. Kaszek also led the company&#8217;s seed round in 2020. The latest investment brings its total raised to $10 million since its 2019 inception.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong> has made a strategic investment, which was not disclosed, into solid-state battery technology startup Factorial. Hyundai and Kia have also partnered with Factorial to test its technology. Under the joint development agreement, the companies will integrate Factorial technology at the cell, module, and system levels, perform vehicle-level integration, and co-develop specifications for manufacturing Factorial&#8217;s batteries.</p>
<p><strong>NI</strong> has acquired NH Research, a company provides test instruments and systems for various industries, including electric vehicles and batteries. That transaction, in which the terms were not disclosed, closed October 19, 2021. NI has also agreed to purchase the EV Systems business of Heinzinger GmbH, a European company that makes high-current and high-voltage power systems. This deal is expected to close in Q1 2022.</p>
<p><strong>ProLogium Technology Co.</strong>, the Taiwanese battery maker, raised $326 million in a funding round with backing from dGav Capital, Primavera Capital Group and SB China Venture Capital, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-29/battery-unicorn-prologium-gets-326-million-as-ev-race-heats-up?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>The months-long saga to pass a budget reconciliation bill and an infrastructure bill &#8212; each historic in their own right, each touting trillion dollar price tags &#8212; is far from over.</p>
<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> unveiled his updated Build Back Better budget plan on Thursday, but the big arm of resistance came from his own party &#8212; more specifically, the progressive wing of the Democrats, who remain insistent that both bills move in tandem through the vote. Because no vote went forward, Biden had to leave for the United Nations Climate Change conference in Glasgow without a robust set of provisions on climate to show off to the other world leaders.</p>
<p>While the budget bill saw some heartbreaking changes &#8212; including a provision that would&#8217;ve established a national paid family leave program &#8212; what&#8217;s relevant here at The Station is that the expanded electric vehicle incentive for consumers survived the many rounds of revision. A $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs has been around for a while, but supporters say it&#8217;s high time for it to be updated.</p>
<p>The major changes include:<br />
• Adding an additional $4,500 credit for EVs made in the U.S. and in union shops<br />
• Adding an additional $500 for EVs made with batteries where at least 50% of the components are U.S.-made<br />
• Removing the cap that limits the credit to manufacturers that have sold less than 200,000 EVs<br />
• Limiting the incentive to EVs that cost under $55,000 for sedans; $69,000 for SUVs; and $74,000 for pickups<br />
• Limiting eligibility for individuals that make under $400,000 per year or $800,000 for joint filers</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits for the middle class would come in the form of when the incentive actually kicks in. Right now, consumers must claim the credit on their taxes at the end of the year, but under the new language, the discount would be applied upon purchase. It could open up a new EV purchase for many who otherwise couldn&#8217;t wait for tax time.</p>
<p>The provision has won the support of the Big Three automakers, the United Auto Workers Union, and Sierra Club, amongst others. Opposing the bill are major automakers, including Honda Motor, Hyundai, BMW AG, Volkswagen, Nissan Motor, Tesla and Toyota Motor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hourly workers make up <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2020/home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abut 55% of the working world</a>, yet when it comes to tech built for the world of work, their so-called knowledge worker counterparts dominate the space. Today, an app built specifically to address the needs of the former is announcing a big round of funding &#8212; underscoring both the evolving landscape of business software, and how hourly and shift workers are increasingly coming into their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://wheniwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When I Work</a> &#8212; a popular messaging platform that lets hourly workers employed by a business sign up for shifts, trade shifts with colleagues, and let management and others know when they cannot make it to a shift &#8212; has closed a growth round of $200 million, funding that the company will be using both for business development, and to expand its product.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Bain Capital (specifically its Tech Opportunities fund), and while the pair are not disclosing valuation, it&#8217;s being described as a &#8220;majority growth investment&#8221;, which implies something around $400 million. CEO Martin Hartshorne said in an interview that When I Work is profitable, and it has been since June of last year &#8212; notable considering we were in the depths of pandemic living and economic uncertainty &#8212; and its steady rise was the reason for raising now, after raising just $24 million in the 11 years prior.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have hit a new phase,&#8221; he said, with growth currently &#8220;north of 35%&#8221; and generating a profit. &#8220;The customers love the product and culture is really good. We’ve got something great and it&#8217;s time to go for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previous backers include Arthur Ventures, Drive Capital, Greycroft and High Alpha.</p>
<p>Founded in Minneapolis in 2010, When I Work says its app is already used by some some 10 million hourly workers in the U.S. across some 200,000 businesses, with a focus on smaller businesses and franchises of well-known names (the list includes Dunkin’, Ace Hardware, Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Kenneth Cole). Some of that growth has specifically come from the changing needs of the market: while some retailers were forced to shutter operations, and some closed down altogether, other sectors like healthcare picked up steam.</p>
<p>Hartshorne noted that in Q2 of this year, the company picked up more than 50 customers &#8220;spinning up vaccination operations&#8221; &#8212; that is, building shift-based systems to handle that effort.&nbsp;The plan will be to continue doubling down on the opportunity in the U.S. as well as to start moving into other markets internationally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the app itself, it has mainly made its name around providing tools to make it easier to communicate with shift-based and hourly staff, people whose hours mean that it&#8217;s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/43/3/zsz240/5599823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely that everyone would be at the business at the same time</a> for meetings, and have potentially more variable schedules when they work, schedules that often need shifting depending on customer traffic and the circumstances of workers themselves.</p>
<p>As its name implies, When I Work&#8217;s most-used functions and managing shifts and communicating with the team, addressing what are the biggest and most general productivity challenges for that segment of workers. But over time it has capitalized on the audience and engagement to add in other services like payroll facilitation (interconnecting with more dedicated payroll software), labor reports, and analytics, and the idea is that this part will continue to grow, both organically and likely by way of acquisition.</p>
<p>Software catering to the world of work has largely been focused on so-called knowledge workers over the last decade or two: equipped with computers, smartphones and tied into work that relies on software and apps, that segment was a natural fit for more software tools, which have if anything only become more specialized over time, addressing specific verticals and use cases.</p>
<p>Yet digital transformation, and the rise of smartphone usage among the general population, have presented a host of new opportunities to expand the products and use cases for software in the workplace to touch a much wider swathe of workers. The population at large has shifted to using apps and other digital products in their daily non-work lives, and so they, too, want and are ready for those tools to help them do their work more easily, too.</p>
<p>In the case of When I Work, employees install it on their own smartphones, a signal of how bring-your-own-device has been an even stronger trend in this category of workers than it has been among knowledge workers. (They log in much as you might on any other work-based app, based on the company you work for and your mobile number or email.) Hartshorne said that a good part of its growth has been from word-of-mouth, with employees asking for it from new employers, having used it at a previous job.</p>
<p>But given that wider trend, it&#8217;s no surprise that company is not without competitors, as well as others addressing the same segment of workers that could potentially also become competitors, if not already. They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pro&#8217;s; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/fountain-a-platform-for-recruiting-gig-and-hourly-workers-raises-23m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fountain</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonolo</a> (both currently aimed more at recruiting and signing less-than-full-time people up to shifts); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a> (more of a productivity platform for frontline workers currently); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a> (which <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> earlier this year); <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/workplace-reaches-7-million-paid-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace</a> (which now has 7 million paying users); and <a href="https://www.justworkshours.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a> (which in September filed to go public). The fact that some of these are addressing the same segment of users, but with different features, also presents something of a roadmap for When I Work and how it might expand, too.</p>
<p>Phil Meicler, an MD at Bain Capital Tech Opportunities, said that the engagement on When I Work &#8212; 85% of its users log in an use it at least once a week &#8212; makes the app one of the more compelling in that bigger field.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today’s modern workforce, having a solution that yields such clear productivity gains and strong employee engagement are unique,&#8221; he said, noting that the labor shortage among the hourly working sector has become even more acute in recent times. &#8220;Doing what it does at scale and efficiently is difficult to execute. The combination of growth and profitability was a core part of why we were excited about When I Work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Bain &#8220;shares Martin&#8217;s vision&#8221; to continue to expand the HR suite. &#8220;Building out the product through the eyes of the employees what else they use, how we could extend to make their lives easier, is the aim, and it has a terrific foundation in scheduling. It has a unique opportunity to grow organically and through M&amp;A.&#8221;</p>
