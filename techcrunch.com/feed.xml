										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building credit history can be difficult if you are a consumer that is having trouble getting access to credit in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.tomocredit.com/">TomoCredit</a>, which has developed a credit card focused on building credit history for first-time borrowers. The San Francisco-based startup is announcing today that it has raised $10 million in a Series A funding round co-led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kapor Capital and KB Investment Inc. (KBIC), a subsidiary of South Korea’s leading consumer bank. Lewis &amp; Clark Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Knollwood Investment Advisory, WTI, Bronze and Square co-founder Sam Wen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also participated in the Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital comes just over seven months after TomoCredit raised $7 million in seed funding, and brings its total raised this year to $17 million. The company also announced today it has appointed Ash Gupta, former CRO at American Express, to its board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit co-founder and CEO Kristy Kim came up with the concept for the company after being rejected multiple times for an auto loan while in her early 20s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim, who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea with her family as a child, was disappointed that her lack of credit history proved to be such an obstacle despite the fact she had a job “and positive cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she teamed up with Dmitry Kashlev, a Russian immigrant, in January of 2019 to create a solution for other foreign-born individuals and young adults facing similar credit challenges. That fall, the startup (short for Tomorrow’s Credit) was accepted into the Barclays Accelerator, powered by Techstars.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech offers a credit card aimed at helping first-time borrowers build credit history, based on their cash flow, rather than on their FICO or credit report ratings. Its biggest differentiator, believes Kim, is that it has no fees, no APR and no credit pull. Traditional credit products rely heavily on fees and APR, she said, while TomoCredit makes money through merchant fees.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202808" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202808" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202808 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-team.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202808" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TomoCredit</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit is powered by Finicity (which was acquired by Mastercard last year), and leverages that company’s data network and open banking technology so that it can “securely” access applicants’ bank accounts to obtain financial data for underwriting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once approved, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">applicants receive the</span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005204/en/The-TomoCredit-Mastercard%2525C2%2525AE-Gives-Consumers-Access-to-Credit-Through-High-Limit-Offering-With-No-Fees-and-0-APR"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TomoCredit Mastercard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal is to bring “millions of individuals that lack a credit score into the financial system, allowing a diverse group of consumers the opportunity to better position themselves as qualified candidates for mortgages, auto loans, or other major life purchases,” the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit has already pre-approved more than 300,000 customers and expects to issue a total of 500,000 cards by year’s end, according to Kim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve grown 10x this year from the beginning of 2021,” Kim said. “Still, this round came together earlier than expected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that has been surprising to Kim is the interest from a variety of types of consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the beginning, we thought international students and immigrants would be most interested in our product,” she told TechCrunch. “But after launching, we’ve realized that so many people can benefit &#8212; from gig economy workers to YouTubers to any young person who hasn’t had a chance to build credit yet. The market is way bigger than we even realized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2022, the company plans to roll out the Tomo Black card, a product for some of its existing customers that “are showing good performance.” It’s currently testing it with some of its existing user base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a premium product that can grow with our customers, who we want to retain over the next 10 to 20 years,” Kim said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t want our product to be a stop-gap solution.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202805" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202805" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202805 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg 4501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TomoCredit</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to do more hiring and enhance features such as weekly autopay and high credit limits in an effort to “boost credit scores faster,” she added. Currently, TomoCredit has about 30 employees, up from 10 at the time of its last raise in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y main focus is recruiting top talent,” Kim said, noting that the company had already hired “some senior people from Wells Fargo.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we recruit and hire, we care about diversity,” she added. “We’re building products for people who have been traditionally underserved by major banks. I think to align with our mission, we should embody that in building our team. More than 50% of our execs are female. The entire risk team is female. We are diverse in terms of gender, age and ethnicity because we want to truly understand our customers and build a product that is inclusive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Dixon, partner at Kapor Capital, points out that there</span><span class="s1"> are about 45 million people in the U.S. who should have credit scores, but cannot take out a loan, get a credit card, or apply for a mortgage. And that number is only increasing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;When we learned that Kristy experienced these issues firsthand when she moved to the United States and thoughtfully figured out a way to circumvent the predatory and broken credit card system, it deepened our conviction in her and the product itself,&#8221; he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p>Dixon believes that TomoCredit&#8217;s model of not charging the user makes it a &#8220;<span class="s1">safe and affordable alternative&#8221; to what is in the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Their mission aligns with our thesis of closing gaps of access and opportunity in the credit space at large as well,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In order to support a buildout of renewable energy, which tends to over-generate electricity at certain times of day and under-generate at others, the grid is going to need a lot of batteries. While lithium-ion works fine for consumer electronics and even electric vehicles, battery startup EnerVenue says it developed a breakthrough technology to revolutionize stationary energy storage.</p>
<p>The technology itself – nickel-hydrogen batteries – isn’t actually new. In fact, it’s been used for decades in aerospace applications, to power everything from satellites to the International Space Station and the Hubble Telescope. Nickel-hydrogen had been too expensive to scale for terrestrial applications, until Stanford University professor (and now EnerVenue chairman) Yi Cui determined a way to adapt the materials and bring the costs way, way down.</p>
<p>Nickel-hydrogen has a number of key benefits over lithium-ion, according to EnerVenue: it can withstand super-high and super-low temperatures (so no need for air conditioners or thermal management systems); it requires very little to no maintenance; and it has a far longer lifespan.</p>
<p>The technology has caught the eye of two giants in the oil and gas industry, energy infrastructure company Schlumberger and Saudi Aramco’s VC arm, who together with Stanford University have raised $100 million in Series A funding. The investment comes around a year after EnerVenue raised a $12 million seed. The company is planning on using the funds to scale its nickel-hydrogen battery production, including a Gigafactory in the U.S., and has entered a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Schlumberger for international markets.</p>
<p>“I spent almost three and a half years prior to EnerVenue looking for a battery storage technology that I thought could compete with lithium-ion,” CEO Jorg Heinemann told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “I had essentially given up.” Then he met with Cui, who had managed through his research to bring the cost down from around $20,000 per kilowatt hour to $100 per kilowatt hour within line of sight – a jaw-dropping decrease that puts it on-par with existing energy storage technology today.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202350" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202350" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2202350" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg 4480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EnerVenue-Jorg-Heinemann-Headshot.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202350" class="wp-caption-text">EnerVenue CEO Jorg Heinemann <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://enervenue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EnerVenue <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Think of a nickel-hydrogen battery as a kind of battery-fuel cell hybrid. It charges by building up hydrogen inside a pressure vessel, and when it discharges, that hydrogen gets reabsorbed in water, Heinemann explained. One of the key differences between the batteries in space and the one’s EnerVenue is developing on Earth is the materials. The nickel-hydrogen batteries in orbit use a platinum electrode, which Heinemann said accounts for as much as 70% of the cost of the battery. The legacy technology also uses a ceramic separator, another high cost. EnerVenue’s key innovation is finding new, low-cost and Earth-abundant materials (though the exact materials they aren’t sharing).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Heinemann also hinted that an advanced team within the company is working on a separate technology breakthrough that could bring the cost down even further, to the range of around $30 per kilowatt hour or less.</p>
<p>Those aren’t the only benefits. EnerVenue’s batteries can charge and discharge at different speeds depending on a customer’s needs. It can go from a 10-minute charge or discharge to as slow as a 10-20 hour charge-discharge cycle, though the company is optimizing for a roughly 2 hour charge and 4-8 hour discharge. EnerVenue’s batteries are also designed for 30,000 cycles without experiencing a decline in performance.</p>
<p>“As renewables get cheaper and cheaper, there&#8217;s lots of time of the day where you&#8217;ve got, say, a 1-4-hour window of close to free power that can be used to charge something, and then it has to be dispatched fast or slow depending on when the grid needs it,” he said. “And our battery does that really well.”</p>
<p>It’s notable that this round was funded by two companies that loom large in the oil and gas industry. “I think it&#8217;s nearly 100% of the oil and gas industry is now pivoting to renewables in a huge way,” Heinemann added. “They all see the future as, the energy mix is shifting. We&#8217;re going to be 75% renewable by mid-century, most think it&#8217;s going to happen quicker, and those are based on studies that the oil and gas industry did. They see that and they know they need a new play.”</p>

<p>Don’t expect nickel-hydrogen to start appearing in your iPhone anytime soon. The technology is big and heavy – even scaled down as much as possible, a nickel-hydrogen battery is still around the size of a two-liter water flask, so lithium-ion will definitely still play a major role in the future.</p>
<p>Stationary energy storage may have a different future. EnerVenue is currently in “late-stage” discussions on the site and partner for a United States factory to produce up to one gigawatt-hour of batteries annually, with the goal of eventually scaling even beyond that. Heinemann estimates that the tooling cap-ex per megawatt hour should be just 20% that of lithium ion. Under the partnership with Schlumberger, the infrastructure company will also be separately manufacturing batteries and selling them in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a technology that works today,” Heinemann said. “We&#8217;re not waiting on a technology breakthrough, there&#8217;s no science project in our future that we have to go achieve in order to prove out something. We know it works.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EU will use legislation to push for greater resilience and sovereignty in regional semiconductor supply chains.</p>
<p>The bloc&#8217;s president trailed a forthcoming &#8216;European Chips Act&#8217; in a state of the union <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_4701">speech</a> today. Ursula von der Leyen suggested that gaining greater autonomy in chipmaking is now a key component of the EU&#8217;s overarching digital strategy.</p>
<p>She flagged the global shortage of semiconductors, which has led to slow downs in production for a range of products that rely on chips to drive data processing &#8212; from cars and trains to smartphones and other consumer electronics &#8212; as driving EU lawmakers&#8217; concern about European capacity in this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no digital without chips,&#8221; said von der Leyen. &#8220;While we speak, whole production lines are already working at reduced speed &#8212; despite growing demand &#8212; because of a shortage of semi-conductors.</p>
<p>&#8220;But while global demand has exploded, Europe&#8217;s share across the entire value chain, from design to manufacturing capacity has shrunk. We depend on state-of-the-art chips manufactured in Asia. So this is not just a matter of our competitiveness. This is also a matter of tech sovereignty. So let&#8217;s put all of our focus on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chips Act will aim to link together the EU&#8217;s semiconductor research, design and testing capacities, she said, calling for &#8220;coordination&#8221; between EU and national investments in this area to help boost the bloc&#8217;s self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem, including production. That ensures our security of supply and will develop new markets for ground-breaking European tech,&#8221; she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EU president couched the ambition for bolstering European chip capacity as a &#8220;daunting task&#8221; but likened the mission to what the bloc did with its Galileo satellite navigation system two decades ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today European satellites provide the navigation system for more than 2 billion smartphones worldwide. We are world leaders. So let&#8217;s be bold again, this time with semi-conductors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In follow up remarks, the EU&#8217;s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, put a little more meat on the bones of the legislative plan &#8212; saying the Commission wants to integrate Member State efforts into a &#8220;coherent&#8221; pan-EU semiconductor strategy and also create a framework &#8220;to avoid a race to national public subsidies fragmenting the single market&#8221;.</p>
<p>The aim will be to &#8220;set conditions to protect European interests and place Europe firmly in the global geopolitical landscape&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>Per Breton, the Chip Act will comprise three elements: Firstly, a semiconductor research strategy that will aim to build on work being done by institutions such as IMEC in Belgium, LETI/CEA in France and Fraunhofer in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building on the existing research partnership (the KDT Joint Undertaking), we need to up our game, and design a strategy to push the research ambitions of Europe to the next level while preserving our strategic interests,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The second component will consist of a collective plan to boost European chipmaking capacity.</p>
<p>He said the planned legislation will aim to support chip supply chain monitoring and resilience across design, production, packaging, equipment and suppliers (e.g. producers of wafers).</p>
<p>The goal will be to support the development of European &#8220;mega fabs&#8221; that are able to produce high volumes of the most advanced (towards 2nm and below) and energy-efficient semiconductors.</p>
<p>However the EU isn&#8217;t planning for a future when it can make all the chips it needs itself.</p>
<p>The last plank of the European Chip Act will set out a framework for international co-operation and partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is not to produce everything on our own here in Europe. In addition to making our local production more resilient, we need to design a strategy to diversify our supply chains in order to decrease over-dependence on a single country or region,&#8221; Breton went on. &#8220;And while the EU aims to remain the top global destination of foreign investment and we welcome foreign investment to help increase our production capacity especially in high-end technology, through the European Chips Act we will also put the right conditions in place to preserve Europe’s security of supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US are now discussing a massive investment under the American Chips Act designed to finance the creation of an American research centre and to help open up advanced production factories. The objective is clear: to increase the resilience of US semiconductor supply chains,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taiwan is positioning itself to ensure its primacy on semiconductor manufacturing. China, too, is trying to close the technological gap as it is constrained by export control rules to avoid technological transfers. Europe cannot and will not lag behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional documentation released today, the EU said the Chips Act will build on other digital initiatives already presented by the Von der Leyen Commission &#8212; such as moves to contain the power of &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; Internet giants and increase platforms&#8217; accountability (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act</a>); regulate high risk applications of AI (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Artificial Intelligence Act)</a>; tackle online disinformation (via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">beefed up code of practice</a>); and boost investment in regional digital infrastructure and skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce has undoubtedly seen a huge boost in growth in the last year and a half of Covid-19 living, with people turning to the web and apps to shop for essentials and not-so-essentials to keep their social distance, and using delivery services to receive their goods rather than picking things up in person.</p>
<p>Today, a Dutch startup called <a href="https://www.sendcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendcloud</a> that has built a service to help retailers with the latter of these &#8212; providing a cloud-based to easily organize and carry out shipping services by choosing from a wide range of carriers and other options &#8212; is announcing $177 million in funding, a major investment that speaks not just to Sendcloud&#8217;s recent growth, but of the demand in the market for what it does: provide an efficient and viable alternative to simply turning to Amazon for fulfillment, or going through the manual and costly process of sorting out shipping directly with the companies that provide it.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We try to provide Amazon-level logistics to all the other merchants out there,&#8221; Rob van den Heuvel, Sendcloud&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. Pre-lock down, he said the company &#8212; which now has 23,000 customers &#8212; was seeing on average between 70% and 80% growth each year. During lockdown that went up to 120%, with 133% increases in parcel volumes, &#8220;And we have not seen volumes going down since,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Softbank Vision Fund 2 &#8212; a prolific investor in the many parts of the e-commerce ecosystem &#8212; is leading this Series C, with <i>L</i> Catterton and HPE Growth also participating. This by far the biggest investment Sendcloud has ever had: the Eindhoven, Netherlands-based startup has been around since 2012 and before now had raised just over $23 million ($23 million, 23,000 customers has a nice ring to it.)</p>
<p>Van den Heuvel confirmed that the startup is not disclosing its valuation with this round although a source very close to the deal tells us it&#8217;s around $750 million.</p>
<p>As a point of reference, Shippo &#8212; a U.S. company operating in a similar space but with 100,000 customers to Sendcloud&#8217;s 23,000 &#8212; in June raised money at a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2021/shippo-hits-unicorn-status-with-50m-venture-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion valuation</a>. Shippo has, however, also raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/shippo-raises-45m-more-at-495m-valuation-as-ecommerce-booms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more money</a> and will have had its valuation ratcheting up as a result of that, too. On Sendcloud&#8217;s side, our source pointed out that it&#8217;s demonstrated a very strong amount of capital efficiency in its growth.</p>
<p>The gap in the market that Sendcloud (and would-be rivals like Shippo and Stamps.com) is addressing is a very clear one. E-commerce is now a major channel for retailers of all sizes, and as the market continues to mature, customers buying online or in-person but still getting their goods delivered are getting more sophisticated in terms of what they expect in service levels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The issue is that smaller retailers &#8212; realistically, anyone that is not Amazon, but especially those new to the e-commerce arena &#8212; typically don&#8217;t have systems in place to manage that delivery process in an efficient way. The very smallest, Van den Heuvel said, physically go to post offices to mail packages; and the bigger ones may order pick-up and shipping directly from specific carriers but find it costly to scale up from there, and to do so in a flexible way that ensures that they are getting the best prices and the best levels of service and the most options in terms of timings.</p>
<p>Amazon has in many ways set the bar for how shipping and delivery work, and in terms of what customers expect. It makes it easy for customers to expect and get fast and free shipping by way of its Prime membership club. It has a vast network of operations for itself and third parties it works with, and is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55560414#:~:text=Amazon%20has%20bought%20its%20first,customer%20base%22%2C%20it%20said.&amp;text=Experts%20say%20buying%20its%20own,a%20credible%20competitor%20in%20logistics." target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly directly controlling</a> the <a href="https://freightpartner.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different parts of that machine</a>.  And, critically, it already provides shipping as a service, plus a wider range of warehousing and other options &#8212; wrapped up in the company&#8217;s Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) product.</p>
<p>Sendcloud essentially is an aggregator and integrator that brings together the longer tail of e-commerce technology providers used by retailers &#8212; it has over 50 integrations with the likes of Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Amazon and so on &#8212; with the range of companies that carry out shipping and delivery services &#8212; the DHL, UPS, FedEx, DPD and so on, more than 35 in all currently (and growing). It&#8217;s a very fragmented market on both ends of that, and so this is about bringing that together in a seamless way so that retailers can just search for and pick services that work for their needs. And this is all automated and integrated into their check-out: picking shippers and organising it ceases to be a manual effort.</p>
<p>It provides its tools in <a href="https://www.sendcloud.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freemium tiers</a>: a no-cost &#8220;essentials&#8221; for the smallest users, with the next tier at €40 per month, then €89 and €179 per month depending on the size of business.</p>
<p>Sendcloud sits in the same category as startups that have been addressing the physical aspect of e-commerce in other areas like freight forwarding and warehousing, by building cloud-based platforms to knit the many providers of those services together in a way that hadn&#8217;t been digitized previously. Doing so in the area of shipping and delivery, an area that is only getting more ubiquitous and expected by consumers, represents a massive opportunity: the delivery market is expected to grow from $475 billion today to $591 billion in 2024, the company estimates. It may be a pain point that that the average consumer never has to deal with on an organizational level as much as retailers do, but as e-commerce continues to grow, so too will the need for this to work correctly, to keep consumers happy.</p>
<p class="p1">“Growing parcel volume and demand for flexible delivery have increased the need for smart shipping solutions amongst online merchants,” said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Sendcloud has built a leading all-in-one shipping platform that aims to help merchants easily integrate functionalities such as checkout, shipping, tracking, returns, and analytics. We are pleased to partner with Rob and the Sendcloud team to support their mission of fueling the next wave of e-commerce enablement.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Sendcloud’s scalable, intuitive, and highly localized platform is at the forefront of enabling sophisticated shipping for online merchants across Europe,” added Christopher North, managing partner at <i>L</i> Catterton. “We are excited to partner with the exceptional Sendcloud team to leverage our consumer-focused e-commerce experience and deep expertise working with high-growth technology and software businesses to drive continued innovation and position the Company for growth globally.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sendcloud said that SoftBank Investment Advisors&#8217; Neil Cunha-Gomes and Monika Wilk, and <i>L</i> Catterton’s Ido Krakowsky, are all joining its board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cross-border commerce company <a href="http://www.zonos.com">Zonos</a> raised $69 million in a Series A, led by Silversmith Capital Partners, to continue building its APIs that auto classify goods and calculate an accurate total landed cost on international transactions.</p>
<p>St. George, Utah-based Zonos is classifying the round as a minority investment that also included individual investors Eric Rea, CEO of Podium, and Aaron Skonnard, co-founder and CEO of Pluralsight. The Series A is the first outside capital Zonos has raised since it was founded in 2009, Clint Reid, founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As Reid explained it, “total landed cost” refers to the duties, taxes, import and shipping fees someone from another country might pay when purchasing items from the U.S. However, it is often difficult for businesses to figure out the exact cost of those fees.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6BsSecdu4n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/checkout-is-the-key-to-frictionless-b2b-e-commerce/">Checkout is the key to frictionless B2B e-commerce</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Checkout is the key to frictionless B2B e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/checkout-is-the-key-to-frictionless-b2b-e-commerce/embed/#?secret=6BsSecdu4n" data-secret="6BsSecdu4n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://talkinglogistics.com/2021/03/31/future-cross-border-e-commerce/">Global cross-border e-commerce</a> was estimated to be over $400 billion in 2018, but is growing at twice the rate of domestic e-commerce. This is where Zonos comes in: The company’s APIs, apps and plugins simplify cross-border sales by providing an accurate final price a consumer pays for an item on an international purchase. Businesses can choose which one or multiple shipping carriers they want to work with and even enable customers to choose at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>“Businesses can’t know all of a country’s laws,” Reid added. “Our mission is to create trust in global trade. If you are transparent, you bring trust. This was traditionally thought to be a shipping problem, but it is really a technology problem.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment Todd MacLean, managing partner at Silversmith Capital Partners, joined the Zonos board of directors. One of the things that attracted MacLean to the company was that Reid was building a company outside of Silicon Valley and disrupting global trade far from any port.</p>
<p>He says while looking into international commerce, he found people wound up being charged additional fees after they have already purchased the item, leading to bad customer experiences, especially when a merchant is trying to build brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Even if someone chooses not to purchase the item due to the fees being too high, MacLean believes the purchasing experience will be different because the pricing and shipping information was provided up front.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our diligence said Zonos is the only player to take the data that exists out there and make sense of it,” MacLean said. “Customers love it — we got the most impressive customer references because this demand is already out there, and they are seeing more revenue and their customers have more loyalty because it just works.”</p>
<p>In fact, it is common for companies to see 25% to 30% year over year increase in sales, Reid added. He went on to say that due to fees associated with shipping, it doesn’t always mean an increase in revenue for companies. There may be a small decrease, but a longer lifetime value with customers.</p>
<p>Going after venture capital at this time was important to Reid, who saw global trade becoming more complex as countries added new tax laws and stopped using other trade regulations. However, it was not just about getting the funding, but finding the right partner that recognizes that this problem won’t be solved in the next five years, but will need to be in it for the long haul, which Reid said he saw in Silversmith.</p>
<p>The new investment provides fuel for Zonos to grow in product development and go-to-market while also expanding its worldwide team into Europe and Asia Pacific. Eighteen months ago, the company had 30 employees, and now there are over 100. It also has more than 1,500 customers around the world and provides them with millions of landed cost quotes every day.</p>
<p>“Right now, we are the leader for APIs in cross-border e-commerce, but we need to also be the technology leader regardless of the industry,” Reid added. “We can’t just accept that we are good enough, we need to be better at doing this. We are looking at expanding into additional markets because it is more than just servicing U.S. companies, but need to be where our customers are.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart has tapped Argo AI and Ford to launch an autonomous vehicle delivery service in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C., the companies said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The service will allow customers to place online orders for groceries and other items using Walmart&#8217;s ordering platform. Argo&#8217;s cloud-based infrastructure will be integrated with Walmart&#8217;s online platform, routing the orders and scheduling package deliveries to customers homes. Initially, the commercial service will be limited to specific geogrpahic areas in each city and expand over time. The companies will begin testing later this year.</p>
<p>Walmart and Ford have partnered before in a limited test with Postmates in fall 2018. In that pilot program, which focused on Miami-Dade County, they used simulated self-driving vehicles to study the user experience of delivering groceries. Argo was not involved in that study.</p>
<p>This latest collaboration will use Ford vehicles integrated with Argo AI&#8217;s self-driving technology. The aim is to show the potential for for autonomous vehicle delivery services at scale, according to Argo AI CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky.</p>
<p>The announcement illustrates Ford&#8217;s two-track system to launch a commercial service that uses autonomous vehicles to shuttle people and possibly packages. The automaker has been testing the business side of of how a dedicated fleet of autonomous vehicles might operate in the real world. It backed Argo AI in 2016 and tapped the company to develop and test the self-driving system.</p>
<p>It also shows how Austin and Miami have become central to their initials commercialization plans.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, Argo AI and Ford announced plans to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. The first Ford self-driving vehicles equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology are expected to become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.doccla.com/">Doccla</a>, a healthtech startup with a platform that can monitor patients on hospital wards and in the home, has secured a $3.3 million Seed funding round, led by Giant Ventures and Speedinvest. The company allows hospitals to predict when beds will be freed up by monitoring patients remotely via wearable medical devices, thus helping to alleviate bottlenecks in the system.</p>
<p>Founded by health entrepreneur, Martin Ratz, and tech entrepreneur, Dag Larrson, Doccla says it has saved “thousands of bed days for the NHS,” achieving a 29% reduction in Emergency Admissions and a 20% reduction in A&amp;E attendance, the company claimed.</p>
<p>Doccla is similar to competitors Current Health, Huma and Cadence. The latter recently raised $41 million in funding from Thrive and General Catalyst. The company offers a remote patient monitoring platform that enables clinicians to monitor patients at home and provide personalized feedback via texts and &#8216;video visits&#8217;. Doccla says it can also measure patients at home.</p>
<p>The cash raised will be used to invest in its technology, and integrate further with the medical wearables and journal record systems. It also plans to expand into European healthcare markets.<br />
 <br />
Once again, as we have seen with other technologies, Doccla’s development was propelled by the pandemic. It turned out that overwhelmed hospitals needed technologies like this to create ‘virtual wards’ in order to monitor patients’ journey both in the hospital and when they got home.</p>
<p>Dag Larsson, CEO and co-founder of Doccla said. “Our end-to-end virtual ward services are extremely easy for the care provider to take on and extremely hard for them to ignore. The NHS now faces a challenging winter season and we’re evolving our technology to support care providers.”</p>
<p>He added: “We differ a lot from the competition in that we support the entire patient journey (e.g all last-mile activities like logistics, customer service, and even pre-configured mobile phones). This has made us punch substantially over our weight and win contracts with extremely high patient and clinician approval.”</p>
<p>Cameron McLain, Managing Partner &amp; Co-Founder from Giant Ventures added: “Doccla provides a vital solution for a strained healthcare system, delivering a product that improves the patient experience and tackles cost.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Felix Faltin, Principal and Digital Health Lead at Speedinvest said &#8220;Doccla&#8217;s platform is more than a product, it&#8217;s a full-stack solution that makes care delivery more efficient for providers, cheaper for payors and safer for patients, long past COVID-19.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has yet another &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; GDPR probe to add to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">its pile</a>: The regulator <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/dpc-launches-two-inquiries-tiktok-concerning-compliance-gdpr-requirements-relating-processing">said yesterday</a> it has opened two investigations into video sharing platform TikTok.</p>
<p>The first covers how TikTok handles children&#8217;s data, and whether it complies with Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>The DPC also said it will examine TikTok&#8217;s transfers of personal data to China, where its parent entity is based &#8212; looking to see if the company meets requirements set out in the regulation covering personal data transfers to third countries.</p>
<p>TikTok was contacted for comment on the DPC&#8217;s investigation.</p>
<p>A spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The privacy and safety of the TikTok community, particularly our youngest members, is a top priority. We&#8217;ve implemented extensive policies and controls to safeguard user data and rely on approved methods for data being transferred from Europe, such as standard contractual clauses. We intend to fully cooperate with the DPC.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Irish regulator&#8217;s announcement of two &#8220;own volition&#8221; enquiries follows pressure from other EU data protection authorities and consumers protection groups which have raised concerns about how TikTok handles&#8217; user data generally and children&#8217;s information specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Italy this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">January</a>, TikTok was ordered to recheck the age of every user in the country after the data protection watchdog instigated an emergency procedure, using GDPR powers, following child safety concerns.</p>
<p>TikTok went on to comply with the order &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">removing more than half a million accounts</a> where it could not verify the users were not children.</p>
<p>This year European consumer protection groups have also raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">a number of child safety and privacy concerns about the platform</a>. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/eu-to-review-tiktoks-tos-after-child-safety-complaints/">in May</a>, EU lawmakers said they would review the company&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VIaN45n756"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">TikTok hit with consumer, child safety and privacy complaints in Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok hit with consumer, child safety and privacy complaints in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/embed/#?secret=VIaN45n756" data-secret="VIaN45n756" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On children&#8217;s data, the GDPR sets limits on how kids&#8217; information can be processed, putting an age cap on the ability of children to consent to their data being used. The age limit varies per EU Member State but there&#8217;s a hard cap for kids&#8217; ability to consent at 13 years old (some EU countries set the age limit at 16).</p>
<p>In response to the announcement of the DPC&#8217;s enquiry, TikTok pointed to its use of age gating technology and other strategies it said it uses to detect and remove underage users from its platform.</p>
<p>It also flagged a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">recent changes</a> it&#8217;s made around children&#8217;s accounts and data &#8212; such as flipping the default settings to make their accounts privacy by default and limiting their exposure to certain features that intentionally encourage interaction with other TikTok users if those users are over 16.</p>
<p>While on international data transfers it claims to use &#8220;approved methods&#8221;. However the picture is rather more complicated than TikTok&#8217;s statement implies. Transfers of Europeans&#8217; data to China are complicated by there being no EU data adequacy agreement in place with China.</p>
<p>In TikTok&#8217;s case, that means, for any personal data transfers to China to be lawful, it needs to have additional &#8220;appropriate safeguards&#8221; in place to protect the information to the required EU standard.</p>
<p>When there is no adequacy arrangement in place, data controllers can, potentially, rely on mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or binding corporate rules (BCRs) &#8212; and TikTok&#8217;s statement notes it uses SCCs.</p>
<p>But &#8212; crucially &#8212; personal data transfers out of the EU to third countries have faced significant legal uncertainty and added scrutiny since a landmark ruling by the CJEU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">last year</a> which invalidated a flagship data transfer arrangement between the US and the EU and made it clear that DPAs (such as Ireland&#8217;s DPC) have a duty to step in and suspend transfers if they suspect people&#8217;s data is flowing to a third country where it might be at risk.</p>
<p>So while the CJEU did not invalidate mechanisms like SCCs entirely they essentially said all international transfers to third countries must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and, where a DPA has concerns, it must step in and suspend those non-secure data flows.</p>
<p>The CJEU ruling means just the fact of using a mechanism like SCCs doesn&#8217;t mean anything on its own re: the legality of a particular data transfer. It also amps up the pressure on EU agencies like Ireland&#8217;s DPC to be pro-active about assessing risky data flows.</p>
<p>Final guidance put out by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">European Data Protection Board</a>, earlier this year, provides details on the so-called &#8216;special measures&#8217; that a data controller may be able to apply in order to increase the level of protection around their specific transfer so the information can be legally taken to a third country.</p>
<p>But these steps can include technical measures like strong encryption &#8212; and it&#8217;s not clear how a social media company like TikTok would be able to apply such a fix, given how its platform and algorithms are continuously mining users&#8217; data to customize the content they see and in order to keep them engaged with TikTok&#8217;s ad platform.</p>
<p>In another recent development, China has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">passed its first data protection law</a>.</p>
<p>But, again, this is unlikely to change much for EU transfers. The Communist Party regime&#8217;s ongoing appropriation of personal data, through the application of sweeping digital surveillance laws, means it would be all but impossible for China to meet the EU&#8217;s stringent requirements for data adequacy. (And if the US can&#8217;t get EU adequacy it would be &#8216;interesting&#8217; geopolitical optics, to put it politely, were the coveted status to be granted to China&#8230;)</p>
<p>One factor TikTok can take heart from is that it does likely have time on its side when it comes to the&#8217;s EU enforcement of its data protection rules.</p>
<p>The Irish DPC has a huge backlog of cross-border GDPR investigations into a number of tech giants.</p>
<p>It was only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">earlier this month</a> that Irish regulator finally issued its first decision against a Facebook-owned company &#8212; announcing a $267M fine against WhatsApp for breaching GDPR transparency rules (but only doing so years after the first complaints had been lodged).</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s first decision in a cross-border GDPR case pertaining to Big Tech came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">at the end of last year</a> &#8212; when it fined Twitter $550k over a data breach dating back to 2018, the year GDPR technically begun applying.</p>
<p>The Irish regulator still has scores of undecided cases on its desk &#8212; against tech giants including Apple and Facebook. That means that the new TikTok probes join the back of a much criticized bottleneck. And a decision on these probes isn&#8217;t likely for years.</p>
<p>On children&#8217;s data, TikTok may face swifter scrutiny elsewhere in Europe: The UK added some &#8216;gold-plaiting&#8217; to its version of the EU GDPR in the area of children&#8217;s data &#8212; and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">from this month</a>, has said it expects platforms meet its recommended standards.</p>
<p>It has warned that platforms that don&#8217;t fully engage with its Age Appropriate Design Code could face penalties under the UK&#8217;s GDPR. The UK&#8217;s code has been credited with encouraging a number of recent changes by social media platforms over how they handle kids&#8217; data and accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What would happened if your go-to calendar and messaging apps were in fact one and the same thing? That&#8217;s the thinking behind <a href="https://onin.co">Onin</a> &#8212; a UK startup that wants to simplify event planning by, well, making a more organized app for organizing stuff.</p>
<p>If that sounds a little niche, it pays to remember that calendars have been having a bit of a moment (ha!) of late (ho!) &#8212; what with the pandemic parceling our work lives into endless virtual meeting slots. Aka: How many Zoom calls can one human survive in a single day?</p>
<p>Certainly the limitations of digital calendars, these rather unlovely (yet ever more essential) time-management tools, have had faced closer scrutiny since COVID-19 popped up on the scene. Flaws? Yes they have a few.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;ve seen a burst of startup attention to the space in recent years. Think stuff like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">Calendly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/3-lessons-we-learned-after-raising-6-3m-from-50-investors/">Reclaim.ai</a> for more efficiently managing meeting scheduling (aka &#8216;smart calendar assistants&#8217;) &#8212; or, more recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/magical-raises-3-3m-to-modernize-calendars/">Magical</a> &#8212; which is trying to push the (invite) envelope a little further by trying to make calendars more collaborative.</p>
<p><a href="https://onin.co">Onin</a> is taking a similarly collaborative tack &#8212; but with, initially, more of a consumer focus: It wants to be your new go-to app to arrange stuff like drinks or trips with your friends. (If it can take off with twentysomething socialites and worm its way from B2C into work settings via a consumerization backdoor then great, is the founder&#8217;s thinking there.)</p>
<p>But why do you need a whole new app for organizing birthday drinks, I hear you cry!?</p>
<p>Because the experience of using a digital tool to arrange multi-person events is frustratingly un-social and friction-filled is Onin&#8217;s argument.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a typical calendar, an event creator owns the event (and therefore the planning process) so only they can make changes that sync to all participants. Hence those endless emails discussion threads that spring up around nascent group events as people try to hash out the details of a plan &#8212; who&#8217;s free when and which location works for everyone and so on &#8212; and then nag the self appointed organizer to update the invite so everyone stays on the same page.</p>
<p>Onin&#8217;s alternative approach avoids this planning asymmetry by collapsing and combining chat and calendar into a one-stop scheduling dream: &#8220;One place to find time and plan events without leaving the chat.&#8221; Or, well, that&#8217;s the promise.</p>
<p>(And &#8212; yes &#8212; it will still integrate with your existing calendar software so that events planned in Onin get synced back there.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s founder Ryan Brodie laying it out: &#8220;We want to be the aggregation layer for events, contextualising the process &amp; third party integrations so there&#8217;s zero fragmentation between them and the discussion that forms them (right now the event in our diaries is always one step behind the convo and every step is duplicated)</p>
<p>&#8220;To do this we want to replace your calendar app/web app and act as a client for whatever calendar provider you use (&#8216;bring your own calendar&#8217;).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting from the consumer and consumer meet-up side however we strongly believe (and have already proven) Onin&#8217;s usefulness across sectors,&#8221; he also argues. &#8220;The key thing is we&#8217;re chat first not event first; 95% of the planning is happening by chat and not by editing the event&#8217;s details, thus our hard work on bringing the event into the conversation itself (you can @mention the group in any of its sub-groups too making referring to an upcoming event delightful).&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Brodie, the problem Onin is focused on stems from fragmentation related to the long-standing iCalendar standard &#8212;  aka the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification format (RFC 5545), which allows different scheduling services to understand and process calendaring items (and was first created in 1998) &#8212; which is really why, as he tells it, trying to do group scheduling with existing calendar apps is such a frustrating mess.</p>
<p>Onin&#8217;s answer to this legacy fragmentation takes the form of a patent-pending &#8220;architectural solution&#8221; &#8212; which means the software always &#8216;organizes&#8217; the event &#8220;from a calendaring perspective, not a specific user&#8221;, as Brodie puts it. (Or, more simply: &#8220;The organiser is the group email address and we control its sync.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The effect of that is to circumvent the fragmentation between an event and its communication channels &#8212; thereby removing unnecessary friction from the event planning process by letting groups plan stuff together more spontaneously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has solved this problem before,&#8221; claims Brodie (who&#8217;s name may be familiar as he co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/yc-backed-muzmatch-definitely-doesnt-want-to-be-tinder-for-muslims/">YC-backed Muslim dating app Muzmatch</a>, before moving on to his next app challenge).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly hard to as the calendaring standards are decentralised and non-canonical (our tech made our events centralised and canonical). Everything you can do in our native apps you can do with very low friction web experience first (every Onin group is a rapidly shareable link).&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about other software solutions, he suggests Onin is shooting to be &#8220;Microsoft Teams, just done right&#8221;. So, er, touché. (&#8220;An easy to use product and one that&#8217;s simple to understand, isn&#8217;t locked into the Microsoft ecosystem, and yet is incredibly powerful and versatile, scaling from 1:1 conversations to groups of hundreds of people, all the time seamlessly syncing event information into participant&#8217;s diaries,&#8221; is the ambition.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We send the invites to all users vs using their own calendar like say Calendly does,&#8221; Brodie also tells us, going into more detail on how exactly Onin does things differently vs rivals. &#8220;Therefore events are fully collaborative and provide a history of changes inside Onin but in your external calendar all you can do is change your attending status as a regular participant. This makes Onin very sticky!&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, it&#8217;s still super early for the product &#8212; which bagged some attention after launching on Product Hunt in August &#8212; and is just now launching as an MVP. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Onin has already turned investor heads, raising a $1M pre-seed round (&#8220;with just the idea&#8221;) last summer &#8212; which looks like</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a notable vote of confidence at such an early stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Backers in the pre-seed include Entrepreneur First&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Matt Clifford and Hambro Perks (on angel terms), plus a number of others who aren&#8217;t up for going public just yet.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had over 400 people join the early access program in 48 hours which involved an 8-step form detailing their calendar woes, I&#8217;m very confident there is serious demand simply in combining chat and calendar,&#8221; adds Brodie, before segueing into reeling off a list of integrations and features the team is working on adding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have an official Zoom integration and are working on Typeform &amp; Calendly integrations (Notion, Google Workspace, etc. all targeted). We then want to take over the event based discussions you have in other apps as a result, with you thinking of the event as living in Onin (&#8216;zero switching cost&#8217;). For example, when you join the Zoom call a contextual message is sent into the group &#8212; &#8220;[Ryan] joined Zoom&#8221; &#8212; no one has done this before!</p>
<p>&#8220;We own the event that is synced to everyone&#8217;s diaries, it all links back to Onin. We have a unique, patent pending <em>Talk around time</em> chat UI that makes all of this possible. We have a very Notion-y style group/sub-group system, it&#8217;s a) extremely easy to create follow up events and b) easy to create sub-plans too (e.g. a holiday with lots of activities or a product launch with TechCrunch interviews&#8230;).&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distance between their farms and the nearest processor is key for smallholder farmers who need to process their crops. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though Nigeria&#8217;s food processing systems have a keen resemblance to the West with respect to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">big factories and huge economies of scale in high-demand cities, farmers still suffer from poor logistics networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With distance and logistics problems, farmers&#8217; crops can go bad and when factories </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy them, it affects their processing yields and price. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers, witnessing post-harvest loss, also get paid less and miss the opportunity to invest in their crops production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian agritech startup <a href="https://www.releaf.africa/">Releaf</a> is solving this by building proprietary hardware and software solutions to make these farmers and food factories more efficient and profitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $2.7 million in seed towards this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African focused venture capital firms Samurai Incubate Africa, Future Africa and Consonance Investment Managers led the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual investors like Stephen Pagliuca, the chairman of Bain Capital and Justin Kan of Twitch also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the seed round, the agritech startup secured  $1.5 million in grants from The Challenge Fund for Youth Employment (CFYE) and USAID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/inzewi">Ikenna Nzewi</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/uzomabayogu">Uzoma Ayogu</a>, Releaf focuses on value chains where smaller factories are set up near smallholder farmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This allows them to get better processing yields and fewer logistics costs; in the end, the farmer has more money to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pair started the company in 2017, the idea behind Releaf was not concrete yet as the team, based in the U.S., had not figured out product-market fit. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it planned to increase productivity in Nigeria&#8217;s agricultural sector using software. Even</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after graduating from <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/releaf">Y Combinator&#8217;s summer batch</a> that year, Releaf toyed around with ideas around trade finance and a marketplace for buyers and sellers of agricultural products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team would get a clearer picture of what it wanted to build when the founders moved back to Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Americans of Nigerian descent toured across 20 states and studied different value chains for crops spotting inefficiencies that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be solved by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We took a much more broad approach to what the solution would be, but we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanted to decide on a specific crop to work in. And we found that opportunity in the oil palm sector,&#8221; Nzewi said to TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oil palm market in Nigeria is a $3 billion one with over 4 million smallholder farmers cultivating farms where those crops </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are planted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These farmers <a href="https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/x-raying-the-nigeria-palm-oil-sector.pdf">drive 80% of the production</a> of oil palm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the industry is quite fragmented, they have many challenges processing the oil palm because it&#8217;s a crop that requires serious processing power </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extract vegetable oil from it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go through this process by using rocks or inappropriate hardware &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ineffective processes that lead to low-quality oil palm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unfit as input for high-quality vegetable oil manufacturing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nzewi says the team saw an opportunity and set out to build a technology to help farmers crack oil palm nuts. The result was Kraken, a proprietary patent-pending machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here&#8217;s how the company&#8217;s business model works. Releaf buys nuts from the farmers, then uses the Kraken to crack the nuts and crush the kernels into vegetable oil. Releaf then sells the vegetable oil to FMCG processors and local manufacturers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria&#8217;s south-southern region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nigeria has about 60% more demand for vegetable oil than it does supply. And it can not be met due to supply shortfall with imports because the government banned the importation of vegetable oil. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there is a need to take these smallholders who are driving 80% of production and make them more efficient so that we can have a better balance of supply and demand for vegetable oil,&#8221; Nzewi said about the pain point Releaf is addressing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, why does the company think it can break into a competitive Nigerian vegetable oil market with hardly differentiable products?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nzewi explains that the answer lies in the quality of products. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vegetable oil </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is driven by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a free fatty acid (FFA) metric that measures vegetable oil&#8217;s impurity. The CEO claims that while the industry standard is about 5% FFA, Releaf produces at 3.5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having an edge in quality of production, Releaf products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an industry standard. Nzewi says that might not be the case in the future as the company is looking to finally take advantage of its product quality and increase prices to improve its profit margins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, Kraken already processes 500 tonnes of palm nuts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its software connects to over 2,000 smallholder farmers who have supplied over 10 million kilograms of quality palm kernel nuts to food factories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding expansion, Nzewi noted that Releaf has more appetite for moving into new geographies instead of crop offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His argument is that processing oil palm and cultivation style is a straightforward method due to its similarities across West Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for crop expansion, the company may need to find crops that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be planted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside oil palm and practice intercropping or work with crops like soybeans or groundnuts used in the vegetable oil industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202966" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202966" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Releaf" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg 14400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202966" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Uzoma Ayogu (CTO) and Ikenna Nzewi (CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Releaf will use the seed investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to develop technology and deploy it to smallholder farmers, Nzewi tells me. Then the $1.5 million in grants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will focus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on providing working capital financing to these farmers. He adds that Releaf has run financing trials already this year where it has increased smallholder incomes by three to five times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great opportunity to bring both physical technology and financial services to these communities to make them more productive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And it&#8217;s kind of central to our thesis,&#8221; the CEO said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that our smart factories can serve as an economic pillar in these rural communities and make it easier for us to supply these communities with other services that they can find valuable like access to working capital, payment for education, and access to insurance services. So we see the food processing as like the first step it cements us in the value chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, agritech startups like Gro Intelligence and Aerobotics raised huge sums of venture capital and showed the sector&#8217;s promise in Africa. However, venture capital has slowed down over the past few months and Releaf&#8217;s investment brings that spotlight back to the sector, albeit briefly.</p>
<p>Rena Yoneyama, the managing partner at Samurai Incubate Africa, said Releaf&#8217;s novel approach sets it aside from other agritech startups the venture capital firm has engaged with.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the firm’s thesis on decentralizing food processing would have a strong match with Africa’s economic development landscape for the next few decades</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ikenna and Uzo are the perfect founders to disrupt this market in Nigeria and beyond. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back them as they innovate in providing both agro-processing and financial services to rural communities and farmers,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” she added. </span></p>
<p>Speaking on the investment as well, Iyin Aboyeji, general partner at co-lead investor Future Africa said, &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;The team at Releaf is building the agro-allied industry of the future from the ground up, starting with palm oil which they have developed a novel technology to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deshell and process into critical ingredients like vegetable oil and glycerine. Future Africa is delighted to back Releaf to build the future of modern agriculture.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.folk.app">Folk</a> is a new productivity tool started by European startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>. And the startup just raised a $3.3 million seed funding round led by Accel with a big group of business angels.</p>
<p>When you think about managing contacts and relationships in a professional environment, you might think that companies have solved this already. An entire category of products and companies have emerged around this idea with CRMs. Popular CRM platforms include Salesforce and HubSpot and I’m sure your sales team loves their CRM.</p>
<p>But what does CRM mean exactly? Customer relationship management. If you work for a team that doesn’t have <em>customers</em>, then CRMs aren’t the most appropriate tools. For instance, PR teams work with journalists, logistics teams work with suppliers, events teams work with multiple kinds of partners, etc.</p>
<p>Folk wants to be the relationship management tool for the rest of the company. Chances are those teams don’t use a CRM. Instead, they often rely on shared spreadsheets or information remains siloed.</p>
<p>The company is even trying to give this new category of contact tools a name and calls is the xRM for extended relationships manager. “In xRM, the &#8216;x&#8217; stands for anyone: you can use it not only for managing clients but also for journalists, suppliers, partners, for example,” Folk CEO Thibaud Elziere said in a statement.</p>

<p>Visually, Folk looks like a spreadsheet. You can add columns with specific information. You can also track your progress around a project with tags. Like with Airtable, Folk lets you filter your view, rearrange data and sort the table in different ways.</p>
<p>When you click on a contact, you open a dedicated contact page. It lets you change data more comfortably and view more information. In particular, you can add comments, assign contacts to your coworkers and view interactions with these contacts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201712" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201712" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png" alt="" width="1024" height="594" class="size-full wp-image-2201712" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Folk</p></div></p>
<p>You don’t have to enter meetings in Folk or copy and paste email conversations in the service. Folk automatically pulls up data from your Gmail and Google Calendar accounts. This way, the entire team can see if someone is staying in touch more closely with a partner. You can choose to share some contacts with the rest of the team but keep your personal contacts to yourself.</p>
<p>In addition to Accel, 35 investors who tend to be operators in their companies are also participating. It’s a big group of investors and you can view the table of these investors at the end of the post.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Thibaud Elziere, the CEO of Folk, is also a co-founder at eFounders, the startup studio where some popular SaaS tools originally started, such as <a href="https://front.com">Front</a>, <a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> and <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>. And I’m sure he has a wide network of contacts in Folk that he can leverage to turn Folk into a commercial success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Truecaller, which operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/truecaller-tops-250-million-users/">eponymous caller-identification service</a>, said on Wednesday it is looking to raise $116 million in an initial public offering on Nasdaq Stockholm.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old Stockholm-headquartered firm, which counts India as its biggest market by users, is aiming for a valuation of about $3 billion in the IPO, according to earlier local media reports. The company <a href="https://corporate.truecaller.com/newsroom/press-release/truecaller-intends-to-list-its-class-b-shares-on-nasdaq-stockholm?releaseId=A87EB7F62AE2A786">said</a> it plans to do its listing by fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The firm, which has amassed 278 million monthly active users, has been working on its initial public offering for at least two years, according to TechCrunch&#8217;s past conversations with Truecaller co-founder and chief executive Alan Mamedi.</p>
<p>The firm counts Sequoia Capital and Atomico among its earlier investors. It has raised over $95 million over the years, according to Crunchbase. Six years ago, the firm engaged with some investors to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/29/truecaller-calling/">raise an additional $100 million at a valuation of $1 billion</a>, TechCrunch reported, but the deal never materialized.</p>
<p>“One of our objectives this year has been to prepare Truecaller for an IPO. Thanks to the strong feedback that we’ve received from potential investors, it feels very exciting to take the next step in this process. A listing of Truecaller is not only a milestone for Nami [the other co-founder], myself and all of our employees who have contributed to building Truecaller to the fantastic platform that it is today, but also to the growing Swedish tech ecosystem,” he said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Even though we are twelve years into our incredible journey, we believe that this is just the beginning and we have a clear strategy to continue to grow and develop our services and products. I look forward to welcoming existing and new shareholders on this journey.”</p>
<p>Truecaller’s service allows users to avoid spam calls by identifying the callers, and also filters similar texts. The service is popular in many parts of the world, but India, where everyone receives dozens of such calls each month, is Truecaller’s biggest market by users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as Apple and Google have improved the caller ID feature in their mobile operating systems in recent years, and taken several other steps to curb spam calls, Truecaller’s offerings remain unmatched.</p>
<p>The firm &#8212; which reported an operating revenue of $57 million in 2020, up from $22 million in 2018 &#8212; has expanded to additional categories such as financial services in recent years in India.</p>
<p>Truecaller will be the latest public exit for Sequoia Capital India this year. The venture fund, the most prolific investor in Indian startups, has seen five exits this year including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">food delivery startup Zomato</a>, and Indigo Paints.</p>
<p>“Truecaller has made communication smarter, safer and more efficient across the world. As smartphone usage increases globally, fraud and unwanted communication has followed, and Truecaller has turned into an indispensable platform for consumers and businesses. With a clear focus on innovation and growth, Truecaller is on an exciting journey to reach even more users with even better products,” said Shailesh Lakhani, Managing Director at Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2013, Bangladesh’s <a href="https://chaldal.com/">Chaldal</a> was one of the first grocery delivery startups in the world to use the “dark&#8221; store model, picking up orders from its own warehouses instead of retail stores. Now the company says it is the country’s second-largest grocery player and the largest grocery e-commerce platform, with 27 warehouses located in four cities. Chaldal plans to expand into 15 new cities with a recently-closed $10 million Series C. The round was led by Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of Wise; Topia chief product officer Sten Tamkivi; and Xploration Capital, with participation from Mir Group.</p>
<p>When Chaldal launched in Dhaka eight years ago, it first picked up orders from local grocery stores. But most retailers in the city are very small and Chaldal was unable to guarantee items would be available for its customers. As a result, it decided to start building its own network of warehouses.</p>
<p>“When we started, Instacart was still the dominant model, but we took a different stand and said we want to deliver from our own warehouses because that leads to better inventory management,” co-founder and chief executive officer Waseem Alim told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Now the company, a Y Combinator alum, has 27 warehouses located in four cities (Dhaka, Naryanganj, Chattogram and Jashore). It will expand to 15 new cities and plans to open 50 warehouses by the end of this year. In addition to its flagship grocery deliveries, Chaldal will expand GoGo Bangla, its on-demand logistics service for small e-commerce businesses, and the Chaldal Vegetable Network, which connects farmers directly to retailers. It also has plans to launch a direct-to-consumer pharmacy.</p>
<p>Chaldal claims that has generated $40 million in revenue and performed 2.5 million orders over the past 12 months, growing about 120% year-over-year. It currently sells about 8,500 kinds of products and wants to expand that to 30,000 SKUs by December.</p>

<p>Alim says Chaldal’s core grocery operations have been profitable for a while now, and it only invests cash in building its technology or launching new verticals. One of the reasons it is able to make money is because Chaldal began batching deliveries early on, sending out riders from its full-time fleet with several orders at a time (it recently launched a part-time driver program). Batching also means Chaldal is able to offer deliveries in as little as 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Chaldal also worked closely with suppliers and manufacturers. “We are one of the most efficient online grocery retailers in the world in terms of amount of capital that has been invested in us versus our size, and that’s mainly because we have been really working with our supply chain and all those details,” Alim said.</p>
<p>For example, it sources produce directly from farms, and partners with large manufacturers like Unilever. “Walmart and stores like that don’t exist here, it’s mostly small retailers, so we’ve been able to have a huge impact on the supply chain side of things,” said Alim. “We are continuing to expand our micro-warehouse model and have started supporting, as part of the delivery mechanism we have built, a lot of small merchants,” including many sellers who signed up for GoGo Bangla during the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Groww, an Indian startup that is helping millennials invest in mutual funds and stocks, is in advanced stages of talks to raise a new financing round at a $3 billion valuation, according to six people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup is negotiating to close a $250 million round, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. The round could close within weeks, they said.</p>
<p>Usual caveats apply: The terms of the deal may change. The startup has received several termsheets &#8212; with similar terms &#8212; in recent days. Tiger Global, Coatue, and TCV have held conversations to lead or co-lead the round, people said. And many including Insight Partners have also explored investment, the people said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Coatue declined to comment. Groww chief executive did not respond to a request for comment. Indian news outlet CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/09/startup-funding-record-velocity-100-million-bubble-india/">first reported</a> about Groww’s upcoming financing round.</p>
<p>Groww is tapping into a huge market. More than 200 million people in India transact money digitally, but fewer than 30 million invest in mutual funds and stocks. The startup allows users to invest in mutual funds, including systematic investment planning (SIP) and equity-linked savings, gold, as well as stocks, including those listed at U.S. exchanges. The app offers every fund that is currently available in India.</p>
<p>Investors’ growing push to back &#8212; or double down on &#8212; Groww follows several months of strong growth. The Indian startup is currently on track to clock about $35 million in ARR, two people briefed on the figure said. Groww, which counts Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India among its existing investors, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">valued at $1 billion in April</a> this year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/groww-an-investment-app-for-millennials-in-india-raises-30m-led-by-yc-continuity/">$250 million last September</a>.</p>
<p>The startup is also internally exploring expansion into the crypto space, but hasn’t made a firm decision on when it plans to offer such trading, one person said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment talks &#8212; and the surge in proposed valuation &#8212; also illustrate the level of excitement Indian startups have produced in recent quarters. More than two dozen startups in India have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year.</p>
<p>And that list continues to expand. Indian esports firm Mobile Premier League said on Wednesday it has raised new funds at a valuation of $2.3 billion. And Apna &#8212; which helps low-skilled workers learn and find new opportunities &#8212; and crypto trading app CoinSwitch Kuber are also in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/indian-crypto-exchange-coinswitch-kuber-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-unicorn-valuation/">raise new rounds at unicorn valuations</a>, TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">previously reported</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chains can be a complex logistical challenge. But they pose an even greater environmental challenge. And it&#8217;s that latter problem &#8212; global supply-chain sustainability &#8212; where UK startup <a href="https://www.sourceful.io">Sourceful</a> is fully focused, although it argues its approach can boost efficiency as well as shrink environmental impact. So it&#8217;s a win-win, per the pitch.</p>
<p>Early investors look impressed: Sourceful is announcing a $12.2 million seed funding round today, led by Europe&#8217;s Index Ventures (partner, Danny Rimer, is joining the board). Eka Ventures, Venrex and Dylan Field (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Figma</a> founder), also participated in the chunky raise.</p>
<p>The June 2020-founded startup says it will use the new funding to scale its operations and build out its platform for sustainable sourcing, with a plan to hire more staff across technology, sustainability, marketing and ops.</p>
<p>Its team has already grown fivefold since the start of 2021 &#8212; and it&#8217;s now aiming to reach 60 employees by the end of the year.</p>
<p>And all this is ahead of a public launch that&#8217;s programmed for early next year.</p>
<p>Sourceful&#8217;s platform is in pre-launch beta for now, with around 20 customers across a number of categories &#8212; such as food &amp; beverages (Foundation Coffee House), fashion and accessories (Fenton), healthcare (Elder), and online marketplaces (Floom and Stitched) &#8212; kicking the tyres in the hopes of making better supply chain decisions.</p>
<p>Startup watchers will know that supply chain logistics and freight forwarding has been a hotbed of activity &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/flexport/">entrepreneurs making waves for years now</a>, promising efficiency gains by digitizing legacy (and often still pretty manual) legacy processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sustainability-focused supply chain startups are a bit more of a recent development (with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/fairphone-takes-7-7m-to-push-for-change-across-the-electronics-value-chain/">category-pioneering exceptions</a>) but could be set for major uplift as the world&#8217;s attention spins toward decarbonizing. (Just this month we&#8217;ve also covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/portcast-gets-3-2m-to-create-more-transparent-and-sustainable-supply-chains/">Portcast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/danish-startups-responsibly-raises-2m-to-benchmark-supply-chains-on-climate-diversity/">Responsibly</a>, for example.)</p>
<p>Sourceful joins the fray with a dual-sided promise to tackle sustainability and efficiency by mapping client requirements to vetted suppliers on its marketplace &#8212; handling the buying and shipping logistics piece (including a little warehousing) &#8212; and taking a commission on the overall price as its cut of the action.</p>
<p>At first glance it&#8217;s a curious choice of name for a sustainability startup, given the fact that sourcing (a whole lot) less is what&#8217;s ultimately going to be needed for humanity to cut its global carbon emissions enough to avert climate disaster. But maybe the intended wordplay here is &#8216;full&#8217; &#8212; in the sense of &#8216;fully optimized&#8217;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The UK startup is attacking the supply chain sustainability problem from the perspective of doing <em>something</em> right now, </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">arguing that making a dent in consumer-driven environmental impacts of sourcing stuff (packaging, merchansize, components etc) is a lot better than letting the same old polluting status quo roll on. </span></p>
<p>However, given all the unverifiable &#8216;eco&#8217; marketing claims being attached to products nowadays &#8212; or, indeed, other forms of flagrant &#8216;greenwashing&#8217; (like bogus carbon offsets) that are cynically trying to convince consumers it&#8217;s okay to keep consuming as much as ever &#8212; there are clearly pitfalls to avoid too.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking about packaging &#8212; which is one of the products that Sourceful is deeply focused on, with a forthcoming design capability offering that will help businesses to customize packaging designs, pick materials, size etc based on real-time data, all with the goal of encouraging &#8216;greener&#8217; choices &#8212; less really is more.</p>
<p>Ideally, zero packaging is what your business should be aiming for (where practical, ofc). Yet Sourceful&#8217;s service will, inevitably, support demand for packaging supply and manufacture. At least in the first blush. So there&#8217;s a bit of a conundrum.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put a carbon footprint score on packaging in general. So you could say packaging overall is this amount so the best thing you could do is not use any packaging. But the reality is, for most brands right now, especially for ecommerce, if you&#8217;re trying to deliver your product to the customer there needs to be some packaging &#8212; and so if packaging is unavoidable in its current form or in another form then the best thing you can then do is optimize that packaging,&#8221; argues CEO and co-founder Wing Chan, when we make the point that zero packaging is the most sustainable option.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we think the best solution is to help you optimize your packaging &#8212; the next wave will be around circular forms of packaging. Packaging that you can return back to your courier, packaging that you can reuse in another form. But we wanted to start with what is the current pain point. And the pain point is: I&#8217;m buying packaging, it&#8217;s very expensive, it&#8217;s very time-consuming and if I try and get it to be &#8216;green&#8217; I either put a marketing spin on it or I don&#8217;t know how to actually make it more sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I definitely agree with you that long term we&#8217;ve got to think about how do I get the supply chain number as close to zero and then offset whatever&#8217;s remaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, then, Sourceful is <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">using data &#8212; combined with its marketplace of vetted suppliers (~40 at this stage) in the UK and China &#8212; to help companies optimize sourcing logistics and shrink their supply chains&#8217; environmental impact. </span></p>
<p>It does this by putting a &#8220;carbon footprint score&#8221; on the product choices its brand clients are making.</p>
<p>This means that instead of only being able to claim &#8220;qualitative things&#8221; &#8212; such as that a product uses less plastic or a different type of plastic &#8212; Sourceful&#8217;s customers can display an actual benchmarked carbon footprint score (in the form of a number), based on its lifecycle assessment of the stuff involved in making up the finished product.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lifecycle view,&#8221; says Chan. &#8220;For example if you take packaging we look at the box, we look at what is the cardboard material, where does it come from, how far has it travelled, what type of material is it, how much material gets used, how is then transported &#8212; for example is it a manufacturer in Asia all the way to the UK &#8212; so we get an overall score. So rather than it just being comparing paper and plastic we actually help the brands to see an overall quantitive outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built the [software] engine that allows you to make choices and see the actual output &#8212; so, for example, if you make your box bigger what does that actually do to your carbon footprint score?&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Sourceful has an internal climate science team to do this work. It is also building on publicly available data sources, per Chan &#8212; such as <a href="https://www.ecoinvent.org">ecoinvent</a> (&#8220;the market standard based data&#8221;) &#8212; but he says the public data available isn&#8217;t up-to-date, saying it&#8217;s also therefore working with researchers to update these key sources with the last five years of data.</p>
<p>It wants the protocol it&#8217;s devised for scoring carbon footprint via this lifecycle assessment to become a universal standard. Hence it&#8217;s currently going through an ISO certification process &#8212; hoping to have that in place before the planned public launch of its platform in Q1 next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two ISO standards for doing a lifecycle assessment and normally you&#8217;d get ISO approval for a specific product but we&#8217;re getting ISO approval for the whole methodology &#8212; essentially the platform that we&#8217;ve built,&#8221; explains Chan. &#8220;There&#8217;s an independent panel of people, from universities, from other consultancies, who will be reviewing this as part of that ISO review &#8212; that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to us that we&#8217;re doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vetting of the suppliers on its marketplace is something Sourceful is doing entirely by itself, though &#8212; without any outside help. So its customers still need to trust that it&#8217;s doing a proper job of monitoring all the third parties on its marketplace.</p>
<p>But, on this, Chan argues that&#8217;s since sustainability is core to its value proposition it is incentivized to do the vetting in a more thorough and comprehensive way than any other individual player would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key thing for us is we combine both the data capture you would do when you&#8217;re understanding a supplier &#8212; asking all the questions about how their supply chain works and all of the laws entered by the new country &#8212; but we&#8217;re coupling that with a human visit as well. So we have a team in the UK as well as a team in Asia who actually go and visit the manufacturers. So it&#8217;s an extra layer of comfort for the brands that we&#8217;ve actually spent the time to go and meet them,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second thing is, as part of our marketplace build, we&#8217;re understanding how their supply chain works &#8212; in order to build the lifecycle assessment we actually understand each stage of their manufacturing process. So we have a much deeper understanding of their way of operating than all of the other platforms would have. So, yes it&#8217;s more involved, but we think that gives better accountability and a more accurate outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking [the vetting process] to another level,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t find anyone that was going into the same level of depth as us &#8212; so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve done it ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pressed a little more, Chan also tells TechCrunch: &#8220;Supply chain risks never disappear but the thing is how much investment are you making to learn more about it? And for us because we&#8217;re capturing this data on lifecycle assessment it&#8217;s part of that process of understanding the supplier. So rather than it being another cost that we pay to go visit the manufacturer, we see it as part of our data gathering &#8212; a key part of the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;So rather than it being a cost to minimize, which is why a lot of companies end up in trouble because they don&#8217;t visit [their suppliers] enough, we&#8217;re invested in making sure that data is as accurate and up-to-date as possible. And the manufacturers see that because they want to have a score that&#8217;s good, they also want to understand where their footprint could be improved. So it&#8217;s a partnership, rather than it just being a bunch of tick boxes to check &#8212; which is what a lot of the audits are&#8230; We&#8217;re here to try and understand their process better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming out to look at the driving forces pressing for supply chain sustainability, Chan suggests demand for greener sourcing by businesses is being driven by consumers themselves &#8212; who are certainly more aware than ever of environmental concerns. And can, to a degree, vote with their wallet by choosing more eco products (and/or by putting direct reputational pressure on businesses, such as via social media channels).</p>
<p>There is some regulatory pressure, too &#8212; such as existing sustainability and carbon reporting requirements (typically for larger businesses). Along with the overarching &#8216;net zero&#8217; targets which governments in Europe and elsewhere have signed up for. So there should be increasing &#8216;top down&#8217; pressure on businesses to decarbonize.</p>
<p>Chan also points to another swathe of environmental laws coming in &#8212; such as those banning things like single use plastics &#8212; which he says are creating further momentum for businesses to re-evaluate their supply chains.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he believes the biggest source of pressure for companies to decarbonize is coming from consumers themselves. So &#8212; the premise is &#8212; brands that can present the strongest story to people about what they&#8217;re doing to reduce their environmental impact &#8212; backed up by a certified lifecycle assessment (assuming Sourceful gets its ISO stamp) &#8212; stand to win the business of growing numbers of eco-minded buyers, at the same time as netting cost efficiencies by optimizing their supply chains.</p>
<p>(And, indeed, part of the team&#8217;s inspiration for Sourceful&#8217;s business was to challenge the idea that consumers are to blame for the world&#8217;s environmental problems &#8212; given the lack of choice people so often have over what they can buy, not to mention the paucity of information to inform purchasing choices.)</p>
<p>&#8220;In the absence of government regulation on [lifecycle assessment] we&#8217;re actually saying to the brand, you&#8217;ve got existing products, we&#8217;ve measured the material, production, transport, all of these things &#8212; given you a carbon footprint score, and actually when you go and look at alternatives we can quantitatively assess the difference between those options. So rather than just pandering to the latest marketing buzzword you get a quantitive view on that,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what we&#8217;ve been showing is you can move to a more sustainable outcome &#8212; from a quantitative point of view &#8212; but also save money. So we&#8217;re tackling both problems. The supply chain itself is not very efficient so we can save money and the supply chain is not very transparent so we can give them better visibility into their actual carbon footprint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every brand that we&#8217;ve met that has been started in the last two years, their founder or their premise of the brand had sustainability involved &#8212; it&#8217;s such a hot topic that if you start a fashion brand or a beauty brand or food brand you have to have somewhere in your mission statement/founder story about your commitment to sustainability. So we thought that&#8217;s where the market is going to be. But actually we saw more established companies had the same view &#8212; that their consumers are also asking for there to be change in how they talk about their products, how they understand their lifecycle journey. So actually I think the government drive on regulation is of course important but it&#8217;s still far behind and actually consumers are driving more of a change,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Sourceful&#8217;s offering includes a warehousing &#8216;managed service&#8217; component &#8212; where it&#8217;s using a predictive algorithm to power auto-stocking so that brands can store (non-current) inventory in its warehouses (to save space etc) and have the goods shipped to them as they need them.</p>
<p>Being able to source supplies like components or packaging in bulk obviously reduces purchasing costs. But depending on how it&#8217;s done, it may also mean you can optimize things like transportation requirements, which could limit shipping emissions, so there are potentially efficiency and sustainability strands here too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sea freight is several times more energy efficient than air freight so if we can organize more shipments to go via sea freight than air then that&#8217;s a major win. The[n] if we can fill the container up with different client orders so that you end up with one very full container, rather than lots of containers with half of it empty, you&#8217;re also going to save a lot of energy too. And so that&#8217;s another part of the journey that we do,&#8221; says Chan. &#8220;The other thing is because were aggregating orders with the manufacturer &#8212; they actually have better utilization as well, which is more efficient for them. So all of these things are really important to driving the overall cost as well sustainability score down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The more we thought about it, the more there are so many parts of the supply chain which haven&#8217;t been optimzied,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;So many times you order 2,000 boxes it comes in these air freight shipments and someone has to courier it to you in one trip &#8212; there&#8217;s so many places where aggregating and being smarter about data you can save so much footprint.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While LinkedIn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubles down on creators</a> to bring a more human, less manicured element to its networking platform for professionals, a company that has built a reputation for publishing <em>primarily</em> the more messy and human impressions of work life has made an acquisition that might help it compete better with LinkedIn.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glassdoor</a>, the platform that lets people post anonymous and candid feedback about the organizations they work for, has acquired <a href="https://www.fishbowlapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fishbowl</a> &#8212; an app that gives users an anonymous option also to provide frank employee feedback, as well as join interest-based conversation groups to chat about work, and search for jobs. Glassdoor, which has 55 million users, is already integrating Fishbowl content into its main platform, although Fishbowl, with its 1 million users, will also continue for now to operate as a standalone app, too.</p>
<p>Christian Sutherland-Wong, the CEO of Glassdoor, said that he sees Fishbowl as the logical evolution of how Glassdoor is already being used. Similarly, since people are already seeking out feedback on prospective employers, it makes sense to bring recruitment and reviews closer together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve always been about workplace transparency,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We expect in the future that jobseekers will use Glassdoor reviews, and also look to existing professionals in their fields to get answers from each other.&#8221; Fishbowl has seen a lot of traction during the Covid-19 pandemic, growing its user base threefold in the last year.</p>
<p>The acquisition is technically being made by Recruit Holdings, the Japanese employment listings and tech giant that <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Glassdoor for $1.2 billion in 2018, and the companies are not disclosing any financial terms. San Francisco-based Fishbowl &#8212; founded in 2016 by Matt Sunbulli and Loren Appin &#8212; had raised less than $8 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/156222-37/company/profile#industry-vertical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data, from a pretty impressive set of investors, including Binary Capital, GGV, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, and Scott Belsky.</p>
<p>Microsoft-owned LinkedIn towers over the likes of Glassdoor in terms of size. It now has more than 774 million users, making it by far the biggest social media platform targeting professionals and their work-related content. But for many, even some of those who use it, the platform leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is a reliable go-to for putting out a profile of yourself, for the public, for those in your professional life, or for recruiters, to find. But what LinkedIn largely lacks are normal people talking about work in an honest way. To read about other&#8217;s often self-congratulatory professional developments, or to see motivational words on professional development from already hugely successful personalities, or to browse developments relative to your industry that probably have already seen elsewhere is not everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. It&#8217;s anodyne. Sometimes people just <em>want</em> tea to be spilled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where something like Glassdoor comes into the picture: the format of making comments anonymous on there turns it into something of the anti-LinkedIn. It is caustic, perhaps sometimes bitter, talk about the workplace, balanced out with positive words seem to get <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977" target="_blank" rel="noopener">periodically suspected</a> of being seeded by the companies themselves. Motivational, inspirational and aspirational are generally not part of the Glassdoor lexicon; honest, illuminating, and sobering perhaps are.</p>
<p>Fishbowl will be used to augment this and give Glassdoor another set of tools now to see how it might build out its platform beyond workplace reviews. The idea is to target people who come to Glassdoor to read about what people think of a company, or to put in their own comments: they can now also jump into conversations with others; and if they are coming to complain about their employer, now they can also look for a new one!</p>
<p>In the meantime, it feels like the swing to more authenticity is also a result of the shift we&#8217;ve seen in the world of work.</p>
<p>Covid-19 mandated office closures and social distancing have meant that many professionals have been working at home for the majority of the last year and a half (and many continue to do so). That has changed how we &#8220;come to work&#8221;, with many of our traditional divides between work and non-work personas and time management blurring. That has had an inevitable impact on how we see ourselves at work, and what we seek to get out of that engagement. And it also has led many people to feel isolated and in need of more ways to connect with colleagues.</p>
<p>Glassdoor&#8217;s acquisition, it said, was in part to meet this demand. A Harris Poll commissioned by Glassdoor found that 48% of employees felt isolated from coworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 42% of employees felt their career stall due to the lack of in-person connection; and 45% of employees expect to work hybrid or full-time remotely going forward &#8212; all areas that Glassdoor believes can be addressed with better tools (like Fishbowl) for people to communicate.</p>
<p>Of course, it will remain to be seen whether Glassdoor can convert its visitors to use the new Fishbowl-powered tools, but if there really is a population of users out there looking for a new kind of LinkedIn &#8212; there certainly are enough who love to complain about it &#8212; then maybe this cold be one version of that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian vehicles have received certifications from three agencies, the final hurdle that allows the electric automaker to sell and deliver its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV in all 50 U.S. states.</p>
<p>Rivian confirmed to TechCrunch in an email that the vehicles are fully certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/rivian-gets-u-s-regulatory-go-ahead-to-deliver-evs-to-customers?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg also reported</a> that Rivian has received regulatory approval to deliver vehicles to customers.</p>
<p>Rivian has a direct sales model, in which customers can order its vehicles online. Dealer protection laws in many states prohibit companies like Rivian from having its own stores, where customers can take test drives and learn about financing options. However, there are no restrictions from customers ordering online from those states.</p>
<p>Today, 22 states allow for all vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles to customers, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/kathy-harris/why-we-support-ev-direct-sales-or-let-drivers-buy-cars">according to the NRDC</a>. In those states, Rivian can set up stores, display vehicles, offer test rides and importantly discuss financing. Another 11 states allow for only Tesla, which also has a direct sales model, to sell vehicles, often in a limited number of locations throughout the state.</p>
<p>Rivian plans to begin deliveries of the R1T launch edition this month. Deliveries of the R1S SUV are expected to follow this year.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the certifications from the state and two federal agencies followed a trio of announcements in the past several weeks that , including the first production Rivian R1T electric pickup truck in &#8220;Rivian blue&#8221; rolling off the assembly line Tuesday morning at the company&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois. The company&#8217;s two vehicles also received official EPA ranges of 314 miles for the first edition version of its all-electric R1T pickup truck and 316 miles for the R1T SUV.</p>
<p>All of this follows Rivian confidentially filing paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. The company, backed by a host of institutional and strategic investors including Ford and Amazon, has not size and price range for the proposed offering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sources familiar with Rivian&#8217;s IPO plans said the company has not yet started the &#8220;roadshow,&#8221; a process in which an underwriting firm and company management make a series of presentations to potential investors before going public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Casper has laid off dozens of employees, including three C-Level executives: its chief marketing officer, chief technology officer and chief operating officer, sources say. The mattress company declined to comment.</p>
<p>The round of layoffs, communicated to employees on Friday, largely impacted retail and operations teams, signaling that the business may be undergoing a broader restructuring. Laid-off employees were offered severance packages.</p>
<p>Notably, the impacted executives were all fairly recent additions to the team. CTO Ben Clark has been with the company since July 2019, while former CMO Lisa Pillette joined Casper in March 2020. Casper COO Charles Liu had only been at the company for eight months before this round of layoffs.</p>
<p>Casper’s CFO remains at the startup, but that role has had some significant turnover as well. In an April 2020 business update, Casper announced that Gregory Macfarlane, its CFO and COO at the time, was leaving the company. Interim CFO Stuart Brown eventually took the role, and three months later resigned. The latest CFO, Michael Monahan, took the position effective August 31, 2021.</p>
<p>Over a year ago, Casper announced it was shutting down its European operations, cutting 21% of its global workforce. The move was then attributed to Casper’s new goal of  “achieving profitability,” which included a focus on North American operations.</p>
<p>The business hinted then that the temporary closure of its retail stores impacted its overall direct-to-consumer channel, forcing it to take steps to minimize operating costs. Now, the startup is going one step further by eliminating roles within its retail and operations teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One founder in the direct-to-consumer space, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to her lack of direct knowledge with the company, said that Casper’s layoffs could also be a response to iOS 14.5, Apple’s latest software that will crack down on apps that track users’ data without permission. The setting restricts the advertising data that companies can access, making it harder to justify budget and understand the efficacy of their sales strategy.</p>
<p>“Performance marketing through paid channels, specifically Facebook and Instagram, is wonky right now,” the person said. “So, if they were really reliant on that channel that could be something that is affecting their sales.”</p>
<p>Casper priced its IPO shares at $12 and debuted at $14.50 a share just as the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining momentum in February 2020. The company dove nearly 72% from its opening price before recovering, reaching a more recent peak of nearly $11 in February 2021. Today, the company trades at just above $5, a decline of more than half from its opening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first production Rivian R1T electric pickup truck in &#8220;Rivian blue&#8221; rolled off the assembly line Tuesday morning at the company&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois, marking a milestone more than a decade in the making for the automaker and its founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe.</p>
<p>The company, which started in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later, has undergone explosive growth in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years. Today, Scaringe tweeted the news and a photo of the first production truck painted in Rivian Blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;After months of building pre-production vehicles, this morning our first customer vehicle drove off our production line in Normal,!&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Our team&#8217;s collective efforts have made this moment possible. Can&#8217;t wait to get these into the hands of our customers!&#8221;</p>
<p>What isn&#8217;t clear is who will get this first customer vehicle.</p>

<p>Rivian operated in relative obscurity, aka stealth mode, for years before it revealed prototypes of its all-electric R1T truck and R1S SUV at the LA Auto Show in late 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, Rivian has raised billions of dollars ($10.5 billion since 2019); expanded its Normal, Illinois, factory; hired thousands of employees; landed Amazon as a commercial customer; and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">filed confidentially for an IPO</a>. Today, in addition to its Illinois factory, Rivian has facilities in Palo Alto and Irvine, California; and Plymouth, Michigan; and an office in the U.K.</p>

<p>When it first revealed the two electric vehicles in 2018, Rivian had about 600 employees. Today, it has 8,000.</p>
<p>Scaringe&#8217;s announcement Tuesday, which marks the official beginning of R1T production for customers, comes after at least two delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and global chip shortage. Earlier this summer, Scaringe wrote in a letter to customers that R1T deliveries would begin in September, with the R1S to follow “shortly.”</p>
<p>Rivian has been juggling the dueling priorities of prepping and eventually producing the R1T and R1S for consumers and commercial delivery vans for Amazon. The Illinois factory has two separate production lines producing vehicles. One is dedicated to the R1 vehicles and the other line is for its commercial vans.</p>
<p>Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021. Earlier this year, Amazon began testing the electric delivery van in several cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Rivian announced that the first edition version of the R1T pickup truck has an official EPA range of 314 miles, while its R1T SUV comes in at 316 miles.</p>
<p>The official range and fuel economy values posted on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website align with Rivian&#8217;s previous estimates, which it advertised as 300 miles.</p>
<p>The moment is also important because it means Rivian has the benefit of being the first electric truck on the market. Ford&#8217;s F-150 Lightning, which isn&#8217;t expected to come on the market until spring 2022, has a targeted range of 230 miles in the standard and up to 300 miles in the extended version. The EPA has not issued official ranges for the Ford Lightning.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s &#8220;Launch Edition&#8221; R1T truck and R1S SUV come equipped with a 135 kWh battery pack that is branded as the &#8220;large pack.&#8221; Deliveries of the Launch Edition vehicles are slated to begin this month.</p>
<p><em>Clarification: Rivian has raised $10.5 billion since 2019, not in total. Rivian has not shared the total amount but sources have said it is around $11 billion. </em></p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 14, 2021. It was an Apple day on the internets, so we’ve all spent the afternoon trying to figure out if we need a new smartphone. Answer?

A few rounds focused on the same space is signal!</li>

At this point, we reckon that every time Tiger’s managing partners go to dinner they tip $150 million. It’s the only number that they know! Regardless, the Jakarta-based fintech with a payments focus has big expansion plans that are now well financed.</li>

<h2>Is it so bad to take money from Chinese venture funds?</h2>
<p>Are founders in fundraising mode short-sighted when it comes to working with Chinese investors?</p>
<p>Asia Business development manager for Runa Capital Denis Kalinin studied data from iTjuzi, a database of Chinese venture capitalists and found:</p>
<blockquote><p> … Chinese funds invested around $250 billion in 2020 (three times higher than the figure reported in Crunchbase). This figure puts Chinese VC investments only 30% lower than investments by U.S. funds, but three times that of U.K. funds and 12.5 times more than German funds.</p></blockquote>
<p>The pandemic, geopolitical tensions and other factors led many Chinese venture funds to reduce their international investments, but that&#8217;s largely &#8220;because during COVID, China’s economy recovered much faster than other countries,&#8221; writes Kalinin.</p>
<p>His analysis covers multiple angles: Chinese investments in Europe are catching up with those in Asia and the United States, half of China&#8217;s top cross-border investors are CVCs, and investors are particularly interested in fintech, deep tech and digital health at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese investors can bring value to foreign startups, but you need to study their expertise and how it can be useful for you.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Andrew Race, <a href="https://www.thinkjuice.com/">Juice</a></p>
<p><strong>Recommended by: </strong>Orin Singh, <a href="https://www.merchantindustry.com/">Merchant Industry</a></p>
<p><strong>Testimonial: </strong>“We were referred to Juice by a family friend of my company&#8217;s owner, and as a personal courtesy, they said they were giving us their best guy. Naturally, we thought that is what everyone says, but they were not kidding. Andrew was singularly leagues above our previous marketing company. Having someone so knowledgeable and willing to learn a new industry proved to be the turning point for us.”</p>
