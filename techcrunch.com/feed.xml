										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The music streaming arm of Tencent is further tightening its ties with the &#8220;big three&#8221; record label companies, its major licensing partners. Tencent Music Entertainment announced Tuesday that it has formed a new joint label with Warner Music Group, following similar deals with Universal Music Group in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/">August 2020</a> and Sony Music Entertainment<a href="https://sonymusic.me/news/sony-music-entertainment-tencent-music-entertainment-group-announce-new-label-liquid-state-east-meets-west-dancefloor/"> in early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The collaboration will take advantage of &#8220;Warner Music&#8217;s global resources and experience in supporting artists&#8217; careers, as well as TME&#8217;s massive influence in mainland China&#8217;s music and entertainment market,&#8221; TME says in an <a href="https://ir.tencentmusic.com/2021-03-22-Tencent-Music-Entertainment-Group-And-Warner-Music-Sign-Multi-Year-Strategic-Licensing-Agreement-And-Agree-to-Establish-a-Joint-Venture-Music-Label-in-China">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The joint label<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/"> established with UMG</a> similarly aims to bring international artists to China, one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing music markets, and take Chinese musicians abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the label deal, TME and WMG have signed a multi-year licensing agreement, an extension of their decade-long collaboration.</p>
<p>TME has ongoing licensing relationships with all three major record labels and some have manifested in equity relationships. In January, a Tencent-led consortium increased its total stake in UMG to 20%.</p>
<p>TME also operates some of China&#8217;s most popular online music services. Through its family of music streaming apps including QQ Music, Kugou Music and Kuwo Music, TME collectively commands 622 mobile monthly active users as of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Paying ratio remains relatively low, however, with 9% of the users paying in the quarter, up from 6.2% in the previous year.</p>
<p>But TME has another major revenue stream that distinguishes it from Western streaming services like Spotify: social entertainment. This category includes the karaoke app WeSing which monetizes through the sales of virtual gifts, which are bought by users and sent to performers they appreciate. It mirrors real-life fan-idol interaction.</p>
<p>The segment contributed $854 million to Q4 revenue, compared to $423 million generated from user subscription and digital music sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Purplle, an e-commerce platform for beauty products in India, said on Monday it has raised $45 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series D, was financed by Sequoia Capital India and existing investors Verlinvest, Blume Ventures, and JSW Ventures. The new round values the Indian startup &#8212; which has raised $95 million to date &#8212; at about $300 million, up from $150 million in its 2019 Series C round, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round gave partial exit to IvyCap Ventures, which had invested about $2 million in <a href="https://www.purplle.com">Purplle</a> in 2015. The venture firm said in a statement that Purplle delivered a 22X return and 1.35x of its entire Fund 1.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We continue to believe in the growth of the company and therefore we have retained our stake for Fund 2,” said Vikram Gupta, Founder and Managing Partner of IvyCap Ventures.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old Purplle.com, which counts Goldman Sachs among its investors, says it sells nearly 50,000 products from over 1,000 brands. The startup said it has amassed 7 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>“Purplle has been on a robust growth trajectory. Even with a Covid year, we have delivered &gt;90% GMV CAGR for the last 3 years. This, while scaling our private brands successfully; Good Vibes is already an INR 150 Cr [$20.7 million] brand. The investment will help to shape Purplle into a multibillion-dollar, digital-first, beauty and personal care enterprise,” said Manish Taneja (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive of Purplle, in a statement late Monday.</p>
<p>The growth of Purplle is indicative of the growing e-commerce space in India, where users are beginning to purchase fashion and beauty products online. MyGlamm, an omnichannel direct-to-consumer Indian brand, last week raised $24.2 million in a round co-led by Amazon.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Purplle as we believe they have cracked the beauty playbook of value retailing with 3 key tenets – a business built on high retention and low customer acquisition cost (CAC), a wide assortment of brands offering quality at best prices, and an attractive private label portfolio mix. We see Purplle emerging as a dominant beauty destination as the online beauty penetration grows from 10% to 25%+ over the next decade,” said Sakshi Chopra, Principal, Sequoia India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare tech startup <a href="https://ro.co">Ro</a> has raised $500 million to help fuel continued growth of its hybrid telehealth/in-home primary care platform, which also includes a growing pharmacy business as the company pursues a strategy of vertical integration to optimize delivery and reduce costs for clients. The company&#8217;s latest raise is a Series D round, and means it has now raised over $876 million since its 2017 founding.</p>
<p>That may seem like a lot of money, but as Ro co-founder and CEO Zachariah Reitano told me in an interview, it&#8217;s actually &#8220;peanuts&#8221; when it comes to the healthcare industry – which is part of why they founded the company in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes people talk about how great it is to be in the healthcare arena, in tech circles,&#8221; Reitano said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;Oh, healthcare is a $4 trillion market – it&#8217;s so massive.&#8217;  But that&#8217;s the worst thing in the entire world; it&#8217;s awful how large it is. And I think what we have the opportunity to cut it in half with technology.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what Reitano says will be the primary focus of this round of funding: Fueling its efforts around vertical integration of healthcare services and technology, to further the eventual end goal of reducing costs to patients through the efficiencies realized in that process.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, what I&#8217;m really excited about is being able to continue to invest in that infrastructure and add even more,&#8221; Reitano told me. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to invest in telemedicine, we&#8217;ll continue to invest in our logistics and pharmacy, and continue to invest in in-home care, as well as the connection between the three, and then we&#8217;ll also invest in additional diagnostics, remote patient monitoring – so collecting and distributing devices to patients to go from reactive to proactive care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ro&#8217;s model focuses on primary care delivered direct to consumer, without involving any payer or employer-funded and guided care programs. The idea is to reduce costs through vertical integration and other efficiency engineering efforts in order to get them to the point where they&#8217;re effectively on par with your out-of-pocket expense with co-pays anyway. Reitano explained that the insurance system as it exists in the U.S. now only effectively masks individual costs, making it less clear that much of what a person pays out in healthcare costs comes out of their pocket anyway, whether it&#8217;s through taxation, or employers allocating more of the funds they have available for compensation to healthcare, vs. take-home pay.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128686" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128686" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-5-–-Ro-Pharmacy.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ro</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s behind Ro&#8217;s recent push into operating its own pharmacies, and growing that footprint to include more all the time. Reitano told me that the company will have 10 pharmacies by the end o this year, and 15 by the end of next, all placed strategically around the country to ensure that it can provide next-day shipping to patients at ground shipping rates pretty much anywhere in the U.S.</p>
<p>Doing that kind of vertical optimization has enabled Ro to offer 500 common drugs at $5 per month, including treatments for heart disease, anxiety, depression and diabetes — with a plan to ramp it to 1,000 drugs available at that price by year&#8217;s end. That&#8217;s roughly equal to the co-pay required for many insurers for the same treatments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reitano says Ro has seen big changes in the healthcare system generally that favor its model and accelerate its hybrid care plans owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that there are two most profound impacts of the pandemic on the healthcare system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One is that it simultaneously shed light on all of the inequities for the entire country to see, right at the same time where we all cared about it. So those things were sort of known for the people impacted day to day — the geographic inequity, the financial inequity, the racial inequity. If someone felt that that inequity, then they would talk about it, but it wasn&#8217;t something everyone cared about at the same time. So this massive spotlight was shed on the healthcare system. And the second was that everyone&#8217;s healthcare journey now starts online, even if it is going to end in person, it will still start online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ro&#8217;s model all along has espoused this time of healthcare delivery, with remote care and telehealth appointments handling most day-to-day needs, and follow-up in person care delivered to the home when required. That obviously generate a lot of efficiencies, while ensuring that older patients and those with mobility issues also don&#8217;t need to leave the house and make a regular trip into their physician&#8217;s office for what amounts to a 15-minute visit that could&#8217;ve been handled over video.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128687" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg" alt="Ro co-founders Rob Schutz, Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian (left to right)" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Press-Kit-7-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128687" class="wp-caption-text">Ro co-founders Rob Schutz, Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian (left to right)</p></div></p>
<p>According to most industry observers, Reitano is likely right that healthcare probably won&#8217;t go back to the old, inefficient model of favoring primarily in-person care after the pandemic ends. One of the positive outcomes of the COVID-19 situation has been proving that telehealth is more than capable of handling a lot of the primary care needs of a lot of people, particularly when supplemented with remote monitoring and ongoing proactive health measures, too.</p>
<p>While Ro doesn&#8217;t work with insurance currently, Reitano points out that he&#8217;s not against the concept entirely – he just says that health insurance as it exists now doesn&#8217;t actual work as intended, since it&#8217;s meant to pool risk against an, expensive, uncertain and rare outcome. Eventually, he believes there&#8217;s a place for insurance in the overall healthcare mix, but first the industry needs to face a reckoning wherein its incentive structure is realigned to its actual core customer – patients themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Teamflow, founded by ex-Uber manager Flo Crivello, has raised an $11 million Series A just three months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">raising a $3.9 million seed f</a>or its virtual HQ platform. The latest round in the startup was led by Battery Ventures, with Menlo Ventures leading its previous financing event.</p>
<p>Teamflow’s raise comes just days after competitor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/"> Gather announced a $26 million Series A round led by Sequoia Capital.</a> Another company, Branch, has raised a $1.5 million seed round from investors such as Homebrew and Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia and is currently raising its Series A.</p>
<p>All these startups want to bring into the mainstream a game-like interface for people to toggle through during their work day. The reality is, all three companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">(and dozens of others)</a> likely can’t win. The winning difference lies in strategy, Teamflow’s Crivello tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think in the early days, the biggest differentiator is going to be UX and our aesthetic,” he said. “A lot of the other players have a very gamified approach, and we&#8217;re big fans of that, but we think that people don’t want to have their [work] meetings in a Pokémon game.”</p>
<p>A tour through Teamflow’s office shows that the company is more focused on productivity than gamification. Integrations include a Slack-like chat feature as well as file and image sharing. It is working on an in-platform app store so users can download the integrations that work best with their team, Crivello said. There are games too.</p>

<p>This focus has helped Teamflow gain traction with employers instead of event organizers, a more stable source of revenue per the founder. The company currently hosts thousands of teams within startups on its platform, wracking in “hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue.” Gather, a competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">recently told TechCrunch</a> that it gets the majority of its revenue from one-off events. Gather’s monthly revenue is currently $400,000, according to founder Philip Wang.</p>
<p>Gather, alternatively, looks and feels very different from Teamflow in that it is closer to the feel of Sims.</p>

<p>Branch&#8217;s Dayton Mills said that it has been able to stay competitive through becoming &#8220;much more gamified.&#8221; It has added levels, in-game currencies and XP to encourage employees to customize their office space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity isn’t broken, but culture, fun and social interaction is,&#8221; Mills told TechCrunch. &#8220;So when it comes to work and play we’re aiming to fix the play part, not the work. Work comes as a side effect.&#8221; Branch has not made revenue yet.</p>

<p>The next ambition for Teamflow is expanding its customer base beyond the hip experimental team at startups. Crivello noted that Zoom brings in about 40% of its revenue through enterprise sales, and Teamflow is resultedly “doubling down on enterprise readiness.”</p>
<p>The company will work on being compliant and upholding privacy standards so it can onboard healthcare and biotech companies, what it views as “buttoned up verticals” that might not want the other gamified approaches.</p>
<p>Crivello is clear about his vision for the startup: He wants to make it harder to move out of a virtual office than a physical office. If Teamflow can become an operating system of sorts long-term, adding on applications and bringing in a high quality of standards, it might be able to bring on a broader set of clients.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At its most generous share count and highest projected price, Coursera's valuation could reach $5.56 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001651562/000119312521089500/d65490ds1a.htm">new S-1/A filing</a>, Coursera set an initial IPO price range between $30 and $33 a share, signaling the market views its edtech business warmly ahead of its impending public offering.</p>
<p>Coursera will have 130,271,466 shares outstanding after its IPO, or 132,630,966 including its underwriters’ option. At $30 per share, the low end of the company’s IPO range and a share count inclusive of 2,359,500 shares reserved for its underwriting banks, the firm would be worth $3.98 billion. That number rises to $4.38 billion at $33 per share.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Coursera is being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This is a solid increase from Coursera’s last private-market valuation, which was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/07/17/online-learning-platform-coursera-raises-130-million-at-reported-25-billion-valuation/?sh=306e1d2f688f">around $2.4 billion</a> when it raised a Series F round in October 2020.</p>
<p>For the bulls in the room, there’s a bigger valuation if you tinker with the numbers. In a fully diluted accounting, including in our calculation, shares that are issuable upon vested options and RSUs, Coursera’s share count rises to 166,006,474, or 168,365,974 if we count its underwriters’ option. At its most generous share count and highest projected price, Coursera&#8217;s valuation could reach $5.56 billion.</p>
<p>However, IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79790/Online-education-platform-Coursera-sets-terms-for-$495-million-IPO">comes to</a> a smaller $5.1 billion figure for a midpoint-range, fully diluted valuation. That result excludes shares reserved for underwriters and equity currently present in vested RSUs.</p>
<p>Using the more modest $5.1 billion midpoint figure, Coursera would be worth around 17.5 times its 2020 revenue of $293.5 million. Using a run-rate figure calculated from the company’s Q4 2020 results, its multiple falls to just over 15x.</p>
<p>Coursera is therefore being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether.</p>
<p>The valuation is also a vote of confidence that Coursera’s rising deficits are not even a valuation risk, let alone an existential threat to its business. In the four quarters of 2020, the edtech giant lost $14.3 million, $13.9 million, $11.9 million and $26.7 million, the final Q4 net loss being the largest among the time interval for which we have data.</p>
<p>From all appearances, investors are valuing Coursera on its growth, not its profitability — or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Helping push its losses higher are rising sales and marketing costs, something<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/"> TechCrunch has written about in the past</a>. In Q4 2019, for example, the company spent $16.7 million on sales and marketing activities. That figure rose to $35 million in Q4 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of <a href="http://box.com">Box</a>, a well-known content-and-collaboration company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">went public in 2015</a>, rose today after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-m-a-exclusive-idUSKBN2BE28W">Reuters reported</a> that the company is exploring a sale. TechCrunch previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">discussed rising investor pressure</a> for Box to ignite its share price after years in the public-market wilderness.</p>
<p>At the close today Box’s equity was worth $23.65 per share, up around 5% from its opening value, but lower than its intraday peak of $26.47, reached after the news broke. The company went public a little over five years ago at $14 per share, only to see its share price rise to around the same level it returned today during its first day’s trading.</p>
<p>Box, famous during its startup phase thanks in part to its ubiquitous CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie, has continued to grow while public, albeit at a declining pace. Dropbox, a long-term rival, has also seen its growth rate decline since going public. Both have stressed rising profitability over revenue expansion in recent quarters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GbPPMSEOmo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/embed/#?secret=GbPPMSEOmo" data-secret="GbPPMSEOmo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the problem that Box has encountered while public, namely hyper-scale platform companies with competing offerings, could also prove a lifeline; Google and Microsoft could be a future home for Levie’s company, after years of the duo challenging Box for deals.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, Box announced a deal for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005272/en/Box-Announces-Deeper-Integrations-With-Microsoft-365-to-Power-Secure-Collaboration-in-the-Cloud">tighter integration with Microsoft Office 365</a>. Given the timing of the release, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1372569232664375297">it was easy to speculate</a> the news could be landing ahead of a potential deal. The Reuters article adds fuel to the possibility.</p>
<p>While we can’t know for sure if the Reuters article is accurate, the possible sale of Box makes sense.</p>
<p>The article indicated that one of the possible acquisition options for Box could be taking it private again via private equity. Perhaps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">a firm like Vista or Thoma Bravo</a>, two firms that tend to like mature SaaS companies with decent revenue and some issues, could swoop in to buy the struggling SaaS company. By taking companies off the market, reducing investor pressure and giving them room to maneuver, software companies can at times find new vigor.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Marketo, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/vista-equity-partners-buys-marketo-for-1-8b-in-cash/">Vista purchased in 2016 for $1.6 billion</a> before turning it around and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/adobe-gets-its-company-snaring-marketo-for-4-75-billion/">selling to Adobe in 2018 for $4.75 billion</a>. The end result generated a strong profit for Vista, and a final landing for Marketo as part of a company with a broader platform of marketing tools.</p>
<p>If there are expenses at Box that could be trimmed, or a sales process that could be improved, is not clear. But Box’s market value of $3.78 billion could put it within grasp of larger private-equity funds. Or well within the reaches of a host of larger enterprise software companies that might covet its list of business customers, technology or both.</p>
<p>If the rumors are true, it could be a startling fall from grace for the company, moving from Silicon Valley startup darling to IPO to sold entity in just six years. While it’s important to note these are just rumors, the writing could be on the wall for the company, and it could just be a matter of when and not if.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden didn&#8217;t campaign on getting tough against Big Tech, but his early actions are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">speaking louder than his words</a>.</p>
<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/">confirmed</a> its intentions to nominate Lina Khan to the FTC Monday, sending a clear signal that his administration will break from the Silicon Valley-friendly precedents of the Obama era. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/09/biden-taps-lina-khan-for-ftc-commissioner-793869">first reported</a> Biden&#8217;s planned nomination of Khan, which will be subject to Senate confirmation, earlier this month.</p>
<p>Lina Khan is a star of the antitrust movement, insofar as a topic like regulating big business can produce one. Khan is best known for a paper she published as a law student in 2017 called <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox.&#8221;</a> The paper argues that thinking about what qualifies as monopolistic behavior hasn&#8217;t kept pace with how modern businesses operate, particularly within the tech sector.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She believes that a modernized approach to antitrust must look at market forces in a big picture way instead of only examining traditional measures like <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-competitors/price-fixing">price and output</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My argument is that gauging real competition in the 21st century marketplace — especially in the case of online platforms — requires analyzing the underlying structure and dynamics of markets. Rather than pegging competition to a narrow set of outcomes, this approach would examine the competitive process itself. Animating this framework is the idea that a company’s power and the potential anticompetitive nature of that power cannot be fully understood without looking to the structure of a business and the structural role it plays in markets. Applying this idea involves, for example, assessing whether a company’s structure creates certain anticompetitive conflicts of interest; whether it can cross-leverage market advantages across distinct lines of business; and whether the structure of the market incentivizes and permits predatory conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As associate law professor at Columbia, Khan also contributed to a comprehensive <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">report from the House&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee</a> last year that set the stage for major antitrust reform that could trim back Big Tech&#8217;s considerable overgrowth.</p>
<p>Khan isn&#8217;t the only high-profile tech antitrust crusader in the Biden administration&#8217;s orbit. In early March, Biden named Columbia law&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-staff/biden-adds-big-tech-critic-tim-wu-to-his-economic-staff-idUSKBN2AX1LS">Tim Wu</a> to shape technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Wu came up with the term &#8220;net neutrality&#8221; and is well known as an advocate for an open internet. In 2018, Wu authored &#8220;The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,&#8221; a treatise calling out corporate consolidation in tech as a looming political and economic threat.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is leading tech-focused antitrust reform efforts through the Senate&#8217;s own antitrust subcommittee, praised Khan&#8217;s nomination. &#8220;We need all hands on deck as we work to take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world, and President Biden is making his commitment to competition policy clear,&#8221; Klobuchar said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lina’s experience working both in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission and as an advocate for competitive markets will be vital as we advance efforts to strengthen enforcement and protect consumers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There has been a growing industry trend in recent years for large-scale companies to build their own chips. As part of that, Google announced today that it has hired long-time Intel executive Uri Frank as vice president to run its custom chip division.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of cloud infrastructure is bright, and it’s changing fast. As we continue to work to meet computing demands from around the world, today we are thrilled to welcome Uri Frank as our VP of Engineering for server chip design,&#8221; Amin Vahdat, Google Fellow and VP of systems infrastructure wrote in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google">a blog post</a> announcing the hire.</p>
<p>With Frank, Google gets an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uri-frank-95ab5330/">experienced chip industry executive</a>, who spent more than two decades at Intel rising from engineering roles to corporate vice president at the Design Engineering Group, his final role before leaving the company earlier this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Frank will lead the custom chip division in Israel as part of Google. As he said in his announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/uri-frank-95ab5330_build-for-everyone-google-careers-activity-6779764218351771648-dm7L">on LinkedIn</a>, this was a big step to join a company with a long history of building custom silicon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google has designed and built some of the world’s largest and most efficient computing systems. For a long time, custom chips have been an important part of this strategy. I look forward to growing a team here in Israel while accelerating Google Cloud&#8217;s innovations in compute infrastructure,&#8221; Frank wrote.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google launches OpenTitan, an open-source secure chip design project&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/google-opentitan-secure-chip/embed/#?secret=ajF9hhpqRj" data-secret="ajF9hhpqRj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s history of building its own chips dates back to 2015 when it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/google-is-making-a-fast-specialized-tpu-chip-for-edge-devices-and-a-suite-of-services-to-support-it/">the first TensorFlow chips</a>. It moved into video processing chips in 2018 and added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/google-opentitan-secure-chip/">OpenTitan </a>, an open-source chip with a security angle in 2019.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s job will be to continue to build on this previous experience to work with customers and partners to build new custom chip architectures. The company wants to move away from buying motherboard components from different vendors to building its own &#8220;system on a chip&#8221; or SoC, which it says will be drastically more efficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of integrating components on a motherboard where they are separated by inches of wires, we are turning to “Systems on Chip” (SoC) designs where multiple functions sit on the same chip, or on multiple chips inside one package. In other words, the SoC is the new motherboard,&#8221; Vahdat wrote.</p>
<p>While Google was early to the &#8220;Build Your Own Chip&#8221; movement, we&#8217;ve seen other large scale companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft begin building their own custom chips in recent years to meet each company&#8217;s unique needs and give more precise control over the relationship between the hardware and software.</p>
<p>It will be Frank&#8217;s job to lead Google&#8217;s custom chip unit and help bring it to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/nyc">Techstars NYC</a> just announced the 10 startups participating in this year&#8217;s program, making up what Managing Director Jenny Fielding described as the accelerator&#8217;s most global class yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had applications from around the world and I was always able to take companies from anywhere,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;But the truth is, when you run Techstars New York, if you don&#8217;t have five companies from New York, there&#8217;s a feeling that you&#8217;re letting the ecosystem down a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the program is almost entirely virtual, Fielding said she felt free to &#8220;open up the geos.&#8221; In fact, not a single one of the startups is based in New York — instead, there are multiple San Francisco and Washington, D.C. companies, as well as others based in the France, Israel, Kenya, Portugal and the United Kingdom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fielding argued that even without New York startups, the accelerator still has a New York identity, because it connects global startups with the New York ecosystem.</p>
<p>After conducting last year&#8217;s accelerator virtually, Fielding said the hardest element to recreate has been the in-person camaraderie between the founders. So she&#8217;s hoping to have an in-person meetup here at the end of May, although the logistics of that meetup will depend on what&#8217;s safe and legal at that time (and what the entrepreneurs are comfortable with).</p>
<p>Other aspects of the virtual experience are likely to stick around post-pandemic. After all, Techstars hosts around 200 mentors per class, and Fielding said the virtual program marked the first time &#8220;nobody was late.&#8221; Similarly, she suggested that demo day remains an &#8220;open question,&#8221; as an extended period of investor meetings seems to be driving more fundraising for the startups.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are the startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spektra.co">Dash</a> (Nairobi, Kenya) — An alternative, cross-currency payment network for African consumers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.detech.ai">Detach.ai</a> (Lisbon, Portugal) — An AI operations platform focused on resolving issues proactively.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elanzawellness.com">Elanza Wellness</a> (San Francisco and London, U.K.) — A fertility platform that brings together medical, lifestyle and mental health data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gable.to">Gable</a> (San Francisco and Tel Aviv, Israel) — A &#8220;workspace as a service&#8221; company helping businesses find neighborhood workspaces for their employees.</li>
<li><a href="https://hiitide.com">Hiitide</a> (Chicago) — A marketplace that turns books into virtual book clubs and courses.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.onevillage.io/">OneVillage</a> (Washington, D.C.) — An online wishlist, planning tool and retailer for cancer patients and their supporters.</li>
<li><a href="https://paerpay.com">Paerpay</a> (Boston) — A contactless payment platform that doesn&#8217;t require additional hardware or app downloads.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phalanx.io">Phalanx</a> (Washington, D.C.) — A company that secures AI systems using data, model validation and vulnerability scanning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.phood.co">Phood</a> (Boulder) — A startup digitizing university student cards so they can be used payments in various online services.</li>
<li><a href="https://prediko.io">Prediko</a> (London, U.K. and Paris, France) — A startup focused on e-commerce inventory planning.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-induced growth of e-commerce is, by now, now well documented.</p>
<p>What is happening in the app ecosystem that supports e-commerce? Is it growing? Are we likely to see consolidations or IPOs? Are there superapps that will emerge?</p>
<p>This post is less about conclusions and more about taking you along while I go through the rabbit hole to satiate my own curiosity.</p>
<p>I see all three trends forming:</p>
<ol>
<li>Superapps are likely to emerge. I think companies like <a href="https://boldcommerce.com/">Bold Commerce</a> will be among the earliest superapps.</li>
<li>There will be consolidations anchored around large SaaS players and roll-ups powered by private equity funds.</li>
<li>There are players like Tiny that acquire early-stage firms and let them run independently.</li>
</ol>
<p>The closest match to the growing e-commerce stack is the marketing automation stack. While there are significant overlaps, it&#8217;s fascinating to compare and contrast the growth of these ecosystems and what drives consolidation.</p>

<p>Between 2015 and 2021, the martech stack grew from 1,800 to 8,000, meaning it roughly doubles every three years.</p>
<p>The explosion of the martech stack is common knowledge and is well documented by Scott Brinker and his <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/">famous supergraphics</a>. What&#8217;s worth noting is that the consolidation we expected to happen is happening, and yet the pace of new companies coming up in the space makes up for the consolidation — and some more.</p>
<p><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/">According to Brinker</a>, the martech landscape grew 5,233% between 2011 and 2020. The fastest-growing category within martech in 2020 is data and governance, which grew in numbers by 25%. The martech app ecosystem more than tripled between 2015 to 2018, powered by the growth of SaaS and e-commerce industries.</p>
<p>I am an avid tracker of this space, but I am also interested in how we can apply martech’s evolution to the e-commerce stack. The e-commerce stack also grew 3.5 times between 2017 and 2020. But much of the growth is ahead, and so is the upcoming consolidation.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s plain to see that electric vehicles are the future, but there&#8217;s more to making that change happen than swapping out a gas motor for a battery-powered one — especially in aircraft. <a href="https://www.h3x.tech/">H3X</a> is a startup that aims to accelerate that future with a reimagined, completely integrated electric motor that it claims outperforms everything on the market.</p>
<p>The small founding team — CEO Jason Sylvestre, CTO Max Liben, and COO Eric Maciolek — met in college while participating in an electric vehicle building and racing program. After stints in the tech and automobile industry (including at Tesla), the crew came back together when they saw that the Department of Energy was offering a bounty for improved high power density electric motors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem was uniquely suited to our abilities, and passions too — we&#8217;re excited about this stuff. We care about decarbonization of the different transit sectors, and aviation is going to become a growing part of the global carbon footprint over the next few decades as electric improves ground vehicles,&#8221; said Liben. &#8220;We just kinda decided to take a leap of faith, and applied to Y Combinator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Electric flight isn&#8217;t so much a wild idea as one that&#8217;s in its early, awkward stages. Lightweight craft like drones can do a great deal with the batteries and motors that are available, and <a href="https://www.harbourair.com/harbour-air-and-magnix-announce-successful-flight-of-worlds-first-commercial-electric-airplane/">converted small aircraft</a> like seaplanes are able to make short flights, but that&#8217;s about the limit with the way things are today.</p>
<p>The problem is primarily a simple lack of power: The energy required to propel an aircraft fast enough to generate lift grows exponentially as the size and mass of the plane increase. A handful of kilowatt-hours will serve for a drone, and a few EV-scale batteries will work for a light aircraft, but beyond that the energy required to take flight requires batteries the bulk and weight of which make flight impractical.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127737" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127737" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png" alt="The H3x lab with someone working on a motor the size of a toaster." width="450" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png 682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=680,577 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to be like that. And there are two general avenues for improvement: better batteries or better motors. So either you can fit more energy in the same mass or use what energy you have more efficiently. Both are being pursued by many companies, but H3X claims to have made a huge leap forward in power density that could unlock new industries overnight. While even an improvement of 10% or 20% in power per kilogram (e.g., a 50-pound motor putting out 120 horsepower rather than 100) would be notable, H3X says its motor is performing at around 300% of the competition&#8217;s output.</p>
<p>How? It&#8217;s all about integration, Liben explained. While the pieces are similar in some ways to motors and power assemblies out there now, the team basically started from scratch with the idea of maximizing efficiency and minimizing size.</p>
<p>Electric motors generally have three main sections: the motor itself, a power delivery system and a gearbox, each of which may have its own housing and be sold and mounted separately from one another. One reason why these aren&#8217;t all one big machine is temperature: The parts and coolant systems of the gearbox, for instance, might not be able to operate at the temperatures generated by the motor or the power system, or vice versa. Put them together and one may cause the other to seize up or otherwise fail. The different sections just have different requirements, which seems natural.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127750" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-xray.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127750" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127750" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-xray.gif" alt="Animated image of an electric motor rendered to be see-through." width="640" height="406" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>H3X challenges this paradigm with a novel integrated design, but Liben was careful to clarify what that means.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just taking the inverter box and slapping it on top and calling it <em>integrated</em>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All the components are all intimately connected to the same housing and motor. We&#8217;re making a truly integrated design that&#8217;s one of the first of its kind at this power level.&#8221;</p>
<p>And by &#8220;one of the first&#8221; he doesn&#8217;t mean that Airbus has one in some powertrains, but rather that there have been research projects along these lines — nothing intended for production.</p>
<p>The idea that no one else has gone this far in putting everything in the same box at scales that could be used commercially may sound suspicious to some. One would think that the existing players in aerospace would have been barking up this tree for years, but Liben said large companies are too slow to innovate and too invested in other methods, while smaller ones tend to avoid risk by improving incrementally on successful existing designs and competing among themselves. &#8220;No one is targeting the level of performance we&#8217;re looking at right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127738" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127738" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127738 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=1536,966 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127738" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t like H3X stumbled over a single advance that magically tripled the performance of electric motors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not relying on one big tech or something — there&#8217;s no magic bullet,&#8221; Liben said. &#8220;There are a few improvements that have very significant gains, like 50% better than the state of the art, and lots of areas that add 10%-20%. It&#8217;s good from the technical risk side.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went into considerable detail on a lot of those improvements, but the less technical-minded among our readers, if they&#8217;ve even read this far, might close the tab if I tried to recount the whole conversation. To be brief, it amounts to combining advances in materials, manufacturing and electric components so that they act synergistically, each enabling the other to be used to best effect.</p>
<p>For instance, recently improved power switching hardware can be run at hotter temperatures and handle higher loads — this raises performance but also allows for shared cooling infrastructure. The shared infrastructure can itself be improved by using new pure-copper 3D-printing techniques, which allow more cooling to fit inside the housing. Using 3D printing means custom internal geometries so that the motor, gearbox and power delivery can all be mounted in optimal positions to one another instead of bolted on where existing methods allow.</p>
<p>The result is an all-in-one motor, the HPDM-250, that&#8217;s smaller than a lot of the competition, yet produces far more power. The best production motors out there are around 3-4 kilowatts per kilogram of continuous power. H3X&#8217;s prototype produces 13 — coincidentally, just above the theoretical power density that would enable midrange passenger aircraft.</p>

<p>There is the risk that stacking cutting-edge techniques like this makes the cost rise faster than the performance. Liben said that while it&#8217;s definitely more expensive in some ways, the smaller size and integrated design also lead to new savings in cost, time or material.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think, &#8216;3D-printing copper, that&#8217;s expensive!&#8217; But when you compare it to the super high-performance windings you&#8217;d need otherwise, and the different ways that you manufacture them, that can require a lot of manual steps and people involved … it can be a lot simpler printing something,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It can be counterintuitive, but at least from my BOM [bill of materials] cost, when you&#8217;re selling something three times smaller than the other guy, even if it&#8217;s high-performance materials, it&#8217;s actually not as expensive as you&#8217;d think. Based on the customers we&#8217;ve talked to so far, we think we&#8217;re in a good spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Servicing a fully integrated motor is also fundamentally more complex than doing so for an off-the-shelf one, but Liben noted that they were careful to think about maintenance from the start — and also that, while it may be a little harder to service their motor than an ordinary electric one, it&#8217;s much, much simpler than servicing even the most reliable and well-known gas-powered motors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127739" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2127739 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg 1477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3X</p></div></p>
<p>Despite the huge gains H3X claims, the target market of passenger aircraft is hardly one that they, or anyone, can just jump into. Heavily regulated industries like air travel require years of work and technology proving to change a fastener style, let alone the method of propulsion.</p>
<p>So H3X is focusing on the numerous smaller, less regulated industries that could use vastly improved electric propulsion. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">Cargo drones</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/">electric boats</a> and air taxis might still be rare sights on this planet, but a big bump to motor power and efficiency might be what helps tip them from niche (or vaporware) to mainstream. Certainly all three of those applications could benefit hugely from improved range or payload capacity.</p>

<p>Graduating to passenger flights isn&#8217;t a distant dream, exactly, suggested Liben: &#8220;We&#8217;re already on our way — this isn&#8217;t 20-years-out type stuff. In the last few years the timelines have shrunk drastically. You could have a full-battery electric vehicle soon, but it isn&#8217;t going to cut it for longer flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a role for motors like H3X&#8217;s in hybrid aircraft that use jet fuel, batteries and perhaps even hydrogen fuel cells interchangeably. Like the switch to electric cars, it doesn&#8217;t happen all at once and it doesn&#8217;t need to for the purposes of their business. &#8220;That&#8217;s the great thing about motors,&#8221; Liben said. &#8220;They&#8217;re so ubiquitous.&#8221;</p>
<p>H3X declined to disclose any funding or partners, although it&#8217;s hard to believe that the team could have gotten as far as it has without some kind of significant capital and facilities — this sort of project outgrows the garage workbench pretty fast. But with Y Combinator&#8217;s demo day happening tomorrow, it seems likely that they&#8217;ll be receiving a lot of calls over the next few weeks, after which it may be reasonable to expect a seed round to come together.</p>
<p>If H3X&#8217;s prototypes perform as well in the wild as they do on the bench, they may very well enable a host of new electric transportation applications. We&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how the startup&#8217;s play affects the future of electric mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW Group and California utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are rolling out the next phase of a pilot that aims to test — and learn — how electric vehicles could support the integration of renewable energy on the electric grid.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ChargeForward program, now entering its third phase, is open to PG&amp;E customers who drive a BMW electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Around 3,000 drivers can sign up to voluntarily allow their vehicle to be “smart charged” when electricity demand is low and renewable energy availability is high. Drivers will earn incentives for participating in the program, including $150 at sign-up and an additional $250 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is one of the longest-running partnerships between an electric utility and an automaker. The first two phases had only 100 and 400 participants respectively, so this latest phase presents a marked expansion for the collaboration. It’s a sensible alliance for two industries that are preparing for the gradual decline in sales of internal combustion engines. For electric utilities, this means planning for a drastic increase in customer demand on a grid that is increasingly powered by renewable resources like solar and wind.   </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2128487" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128487" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2128487 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?w=314" alt="bmw chargeforward electric" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s assume someone plugs in at home on a Saturday morning at 9 a.m. and sets their departure time for 4 p.m. that day,&#8221; Adam Langton, BMW’s Energy Services manager who oversees the ChargeForward program, explained. &#8220;The ChargeForward software system communicates with the vehicle and determines that the vehicle is more than half full, needing two hours of charging to fill up the battery. The system then evaluates the person’s home electricity rate, renewable energy availability and congestion on the grid in their neighborhood. On this day, there is no congestion on the grid and solar energy will be very high in the afternoon. The ChargeForward system directs the vehicle to start charging at 1 p.m. and complete charging by 3 p.m. This allows the driver to get a full battery prior to their departure time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electricity demand tends to follow a “duck curve” shape, peaking in the early evening as people return home from work — right as solar energy resources go offline. And people tend to charge their EVs overnight. To meet this demand, fossil-fuel-emitting resources like natural gas ramp up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? More greenhouse gas emissions. A</span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02312"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by MIT researchers in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Science and Technology&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that in California overnight EV charging produces around 74% more GHGs than midday charging. (Variations in the grid mix matter here — in wind-heavy regions in the Midwest or Texas, overnight EV charging may make the most sense as lots of wind tend to be generated overnight.)  </span></p>
<p>The ChargeForward program aims to take advantage of the ample renewable resources available during the day and reduce GHG emissions in the process. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating customers will enter their charging preferences and departure times on a BMW ChargeForward mobile app. BMW will also receive real-time information about the grid, such as the availability of renewable energy relative to the customer’s location, and it will use this data to calculate an optimal charging window and send it automatically to the vehicle. Customers will be able to opt-out of the charging shift at any point through the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While California is known for pursuing ambitious clean energy goals — including codifying into law a landmark target of achieving 100% renewable and zero-carbon electricity by 2045 — the state has also set a goal of getting 5 million EVs on the road by 2030. And that’s no surprise, considering that transportation is the single largest source of GHG emissions in the state.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW and PG&amp;E will also collaborate in a lab setting to explore vehicle-to-grid technologies that enable EVs to discharge electricity to the power grid. Such bidirectional functionality could allow EVs to be used as big backup generators in the case of emergencies or as distributed nano power plants to help balance the grid throughout the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third phase of the ChargeForward program begins in mid-April and runs through March 2023. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social audio app Clubhouse has now promised a time frame of sorts for the launch of its anticipated Android version, following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/clubhouse-hires-android-developer-work-on-android-app-has-begun.html">its recent hire</a> of an Android software developer last month. In its weekly Townhall event on Sunday, Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison remarked that the company was working &#8220;really hard&#8221; to come to Android, but said it&#8217;s going to take a &#8220;couple of months&#8221; to make that happen. That seems to indicate a time frame that&#8217;s closer to late spring or summer 2021.</p>
<p>Clubhouse had previously said <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices">in a late January blog post</a> that it would begin work on its Android version &#8220;soon,&#8221; but had not yet promised any sort of time frame as to when it would be able to bring that version to the public. Instead, most of its statements about Android have been vague mentions of the importance of supporting the Android user base and making its app more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Clubhouse&#8217;s biggest rival, Twitter Spaces, has been taking advantage of Clubhouse&#8217;s delay to address the sizable Android user base by rapidly rolling out support to more people across platforms. This month, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter Spaces opened up to Android users</a>, allowing anyone on Android to join and talk inside its live audio rooms. Shortly thereafter, Twitter said that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/">plans to publicly launch Twitter Spaces</a> to the general public in April. That would be well ahead of Clubhouse, unless the latter rapidly speeds up development and drops its invite-only status in the weeks ahead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzOsJxnLeI8">Sunday&#8217;s Clubhouse Townhall,</a> co-founder Davison explained the company&#8217;s approach to scaling to a larger market &#8212; like one where Android users participate &#8212; as an effort that requires a slower pace, when it comes to opening up access to more users. He noted that when Clubhouse grows, the discovery experience inside the app can be negatively impacted as a result. Users today are seeing more foreign language groups in their feeds, for instance, and are having a harder time finding friends and some of the best content, he said.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Clubhouse plans to make several changes, including tweaks to the app&#8217;s Activity feed, tools to give users more control over their push notifications, and the launch of more personalization features &#8212; like showing users a personalized list of suggested rooms that appear on screen when you first open the app. These sorts of improvements are necessary to make Clubhouse succeed even as it scales its app to a larger user base, the company believes.</p>
<p>That said, Davison also spoke of dropping Clubhouse&#8217;s invite-only status as something it hopes to do &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221; He noted that he wants the app to open up to everyone, because there are &#8220;so many incredible creators not yet on Clubhouse, who have an audience elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be really important that we just open up to everyone,&#8221; Davison said. &#8220;Android&#8217;s going to be really important. Localization is obviously going to be very important.&#8221; Plus, making Clubhouse more accessible was important, too, he said.</p>
<p>The lack of an Android version of Clubhouse has already caused some complications for the company.</p>
<p>A number of Android app developers have taken advantage of the hole left in the market to hawk their &#8220;Clubhouse guides,&#8221; which intentionally aim to confuse Android users looking for Clubhouse by using the same app icon. (Google apparently doesn&#8217;t bother to weed out low-value and/or infringing content like this from the Play Store.)</p>

<p>More recently,<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fraudsters-jump-on-clubhouse-hype-to-push-malicious-android-app/"> cybercriminals have gotten in on the action</a>, too. They&#8217;ve created fake versions of Clubhouse that even pointed to a well-executed copy of the Clubhouse website in order to trick users into downloading their malicious app. One of these apps has been <a href="https://threatpost.com/android-clubhouse-app-malware/164915/">found to be spreading BlackRock malware</a>, which steals users&#8217; login credentials for over 450 services, including Facebook, Twitter and Amazon.</p>
<p>Davison addressed this issue during the Townhall, warning users that if they see anyone trying to impersonate Clubhouse on Android, not to use that app because &#8220;it could be harmful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly not the real Clubhouse. Same thing with PC. There&#8217;s no PC app for Clubhouse,&#8221; he said, adding that a desktop version of Clubhouse is not a high priority for the company.</p>
<p>The company made a number of other announcements, as well, the most notable being its plans for more creator tools. These will be focused on helping creators grow their own audiences for their shows, and even monetize their events, if they choose, through things like direct payments, subscriptions, brand sponsorships and even &#8220;paid events.&#8221; Clubhouse will also offer tools for managing memberships and tracking metrics around listeners and retention, but overall, details were light on what specific tools would be available or when they would roll out.</p>
<p>Clubhouse hasn&#8217;t responded to a request for further comment on the statements made during its Townhall event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Y Combinator Demo Day kicking off tomorrow morning, startups in the current batch are hurrying to make a little news before they show off their recent growth to investors. The list includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/rent-the-runways-first-ios-team-launches-runway-an-easier-way-to-coordinate-app-releases/">Runway</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Mono</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">Pangea</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/">Flux</a>.</p>
<p>Add <a href="https://www.chums.co/">Chums</a> to the mix. Chums is a social shopping service that helps friends suggest products to their pals. And the startup has put together a total of $3.5 million across two pre-seed investments.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-elion-338579100/">Noah Elion</a>, one of Chums&#8217; founders, about the round. He said that his company closed $1 million in December, later looking to raise another $1.5 million. Interest ran high for shares in the startup, so Chums wound up raising $1 million more than its latter target, for a combined total of $3.5 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="R4R9tMxJUo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/">These undergraduates left university to build Flux, a payments startup now in YC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;These undergraduates left university to build Flux, a payments startup now in YC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/embed/#?secret=R4R9tMxJUo" data-secret="R4R9tMxJUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company declined to share the cap at which the funds, raised via a SAFE, were secured.</p>
<p>The $1.5 million target was based on the amount of capital that his company would need for the next 18 months, Elion said. The final sum came from Ludlow, Shrug, Contrary Capital and Fuel Capital, among other firms and individuals. <em><strong>Update:</strong> BoxGroup wrote the second-largest check in the round, it&#8217;s worth noting.</em></p>
<p>How did a company in the midst of Y Combinator manage to raise an old-school Series A round of capital despite launching its product just a few weeks ago? The background of its founding team helps some. Co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dick-fickling-580b1842/">Dick Fickling</a> was an early engineer at Honey, for example, another shopping-focused startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">had a material exit</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pregame Y Combinator with Equity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pregame-y-combinator-with-equity/embed/#?secret=d1bapSH2u6" data-secret="d1bapSH2u6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s service is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chums-get-the-right-stuff/id1548842488">mobile app</a> that allows users to follow product-types that they may want to purchase, and suggest goods to one another that might fit their friends&#8217; needs. It made its way to market three weeks ago, or as Elion explained, right before his company went out fundraising. TechCrunch asked about early traction, to which Elion said that it was too soon to say much, though his team has seen &#8220;encouraging&#8221; levels of engagement thus far.</p>
<p>The startup is four people today, which its website describes as a group of friends. This is mostly true. Elion and Fickling teamed up after the former built a predecessor to Chums &#8212; called <a href="https://chumsreferral.com/">Chums Referral</a> &#8212; becoming friends in the process. Fickling was previously colleagues and friends with the folks who comprise the rest of the team, namely <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-williams-72a83968/">Lauren Williams</a> (director of engineering) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenagasilina/">Lena Gasilina</a> (product).</p>
<p>The team is looking for a designer and a front-end developer, but after that is done hiring. It intends to stay at six people until its next round. Why? It wants to reach product-market fit with a half-dozen staff. If it does, it should be able to raise more money at a comfortable valuation. There&#8217;s some sense in the idea, though it was slightly odd to hear a startup plan measured growth to preserve capital in 2021.</p>
<p>Chums makes money on commissions from recommended products, splitting the revenue with users. Elion declined to share the network, or networks, his company is working with to secure commercial ties with retailers, but did note that in time Chums will go direct to secure better deals.</p>
<p>With a closed round, most of its team in place and an app in the market, it&#8217;s now up to Chums to prove Elion&#8217;s view Google is overly gamed and Amazon is best when you know what you are looking for. In the co-founder&#8217;s view, people liked malls for their &#8220;diversity of content&#8221; and as a space for &#8220;spontaneous shopping.&#8221; Perhaps Chums can fit that niche, and, in the process, generate some serious coin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After Spark Capital announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/?tpcc=ECTW2020">&#8220;sever all ties&#8221;</a> with Dispo following <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">allegations</a> around co-creator and famous YouTuber David Dobrik, two of the app&#8217;s earliest investors have similarly backed away from the company. Seven Seven Six and Unshackled followed suit this morning, releasing subsequent statements that they plan to donate any potential profits from investments to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spark Capital decides to “sever all ties” with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/embed/#?secret=VaCOICb40b" data-secret="VaCOICb40b" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Seven Seven Six, an early-stage venture capital firm founded by Reddit&#8217;s Alexis Ohanian, released a statement on Monday morning saying that the allegations against Dobrik are &#8220;extremely troubling&#8221; and are &#8220;directly at odds&#8221; with the firm&#8217;s core values.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have made the decision to donate any profits from our investment in Dispo to an organization working with survivors of sexual assault. We have believed in Dispo’s mission since the beginning and will continue to support the hardworking team bringing it to life,&#8221; according to the firm&#8217;s statement. Ohanian has retweeted the statement from his personal account but has offered no separate statement.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s language suggests that it will still support Dispo, unlike Spark, which has left its board position at the company.</p>
<p>Unshackled Ventures similarly tells TechCrunch that the firm will donate any profits from the investment in Dispo to organizations focused on survivors of sexual assault. The firm pointed to <a href="https://maitri.org/new-page-3">Maitri</a>, an organization that supports women survivors, as one place it plans to donate to.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a female majority team that does not take this lightly. We are in full support of their decision to part ways with David,&#8221; per the statement. The firm did not say whether it would continue supporting Dispo as a company beyond Dobrik.</p>

<p>It is unclear how Spark Capital, which similarly is in the process of making sure it doesn&#8217;t profit from Dispo, will be handling its financial stake as well. Spark was unable to be reached for clarification.</p>
<p>The company was last valued at $200 million with Spark Capital-led $20 million Series A financing just weeks ago. Dispo released a statement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/?tpcc=ECTW2020">last night stating</a> that Dobrik has stepped down from the board of Dispo and left the company. It is unclear if Dobrik still has a financial stake in the company through ownership and if he plans to divest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sideinc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, announced Monday that it has raised $150 million in Series D funding.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coatue.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the round, which brings San Francisco-based Side’s valuation to $1 billion and total funding raised to over $200 million since its 2017 inception. Existing backers Matrix Partners, Trinity Ventures and Sapphire Ventures also participated in the new financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is notable in that the amount raised is significantly higher than the $35 million Side raised in a Series C round in November 2019. Valuation too increased nearly 7x compared to the $150 million valuation at the time of its Series C. Sapphire Ventures led that investment and managing director </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Levine, who was previously president and COO of Trulia (through its IPO and multibillion-dollar acquisition by Zillow), joined the company’s board of directors at that time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup pulled in between $30 million and $50 million in revenue in 2020, and expects to double revenue this year. In 2019, Side represented over $5 billion in annual home sales across all of its partners. Today, the company&#8217;s community of agent partners represents over $15 billion in annual production volum<i>e.</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side was founded by Guy Gal, Edward Wu and Hilary Saunders on the premise that most real estate agents are “underserved and underappreciated” by traditional brokerage models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Gal said existing brokerages are designed to support “average” agents and as such, the top-producing agents end up having to do “all of the heavy lifting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side’s white label model works with agents and teams by exclusively marketing their boutique brand, while also providing the required technology and support needed on the back end. The goal is to help partner agents &#8220;predictably grow&#8221; their businesses and improve their productivity.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The way to think about Side is the way you think about what Shopify does for e-commerce&#8230;When partnering with Side, top-producing agents, teams and independent brokerages, for the first time in history, gain full ownership of their own brand and business without having to operate a brokerage,&#8221; Gal said. &#8220;When you spend years solving the problems of this very specific community of agents, you are able to use software to drive enormous efficiency for them in a way that has never been done before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Existing brokerages, he argues, actively discourage agents from becoming top producers and teams, because agents who serve fewer clients can be forced into paying much higher commission fees on every transaction, which means the incentives between brokerages and top agents and teams are misaligned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Top producers want to grow and differentiate, and brokerages want them to do less business at higher fees and be one more of the same under the same brand,&#8221; Gal said. &#8220;Side, rather than discouraging and competing with top producing agents and teams, enables them to grow and scale their own business and brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Side supports more than 1,500 partner agents across California, Texas and Florida.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to spend its new capital on “significant hiring” and toward an expansion outside of California, Texas and Florida &#8212; the three markets in which it currently operates. It also plans to boost its 300-plus headcount by another 200 employees. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's rewind back through TechCrunch's ironSource coverage during its life as a private company and then examine its financial results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.is.com/?referrer=ironsrc.com">ironSource</a>, an app-monetization startup, is going public via a SPAC.</p>
<p>But before you tune out to avoid reading about yet another blank-check company taking a private company public, you&#8217;ll want to pay attention to this one.</p>
<p>For starters, this is the second SPAC-led debut from an Israeli company in recent weeks worth more than $10 billion. And secondly, ironSource is actually a pretty darn interesting company from a financial perspective.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/what-etoros-investor-presentation-and-10b-valuation-tells-us-about-robinhood/">follows eToro in announcing its combination</a> with a public entity designed to help startups get over the private-public divide. Valued at just over $11 billion by <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ironsource-announces-combination-with-thoma-bravo-advantage-to-create-a-publicly-traded-business-platform-for-the-app-economy-301252534.html">the deal</a>, it will best eToro&#8217;s valuation by several hundred million. Combined, both companies will bring more than $20 billion in liquidity to their founders, backers, ecosystems, employees and SPAC teams associated with their impending debuts.</p>

At the end, we&#8217;ll ask ourselves whether its new valuation makes any damn sense.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Monday, and that means it&#8217;s time to strap in and get to work. Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
<h2>ironSource&#8217;s past, performance and future</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has covered ironSource for years, including a piece on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/ironsource/">its 2014-era $85 million investment</a>. At the time, we noted that the company &#8220;support[s] about 5 million installs per day and [has] more than 50,000 applications using [its] SDK.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2019, ironSource raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/ironsource-a-mobile-adtech-startup-confirms-400m-raise-at-1-valuation/">more than $400 million</a> at a valuation of more than $1 billion, though details were fuzzy at the time. TechCrunch wrote about the company <em>last month</em> when it announced its <em>second</em> acquisition of the year; ironSource <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/ironsource-acquires-ad-measurement-firm-soomla/">bought Soomla</a> &#8212;  app monetization tracking &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ironsource-acquires-luna-labs/">and Luna Labs</a> &#8212; video ad tooling &#8212; toward the end of its path to a public debut.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a> indicates that the company was worth an estimated $1.56 billion when it closed its 2019-era round. That ironSource intends to go public with a valuation of $11.1 billion means that it is shooting for a commanding increase in value in just a few short years.</p>
<p>Is the company worth the new number? Let&#8217;s find out, starting with a look at its revenue growth over time:</p>

<p>First, observe ironSource&#8217;s historical performance in 2020 compared to 2019; posting 83% revenue growth from a nine-figure base is impressive. The company only expects to grow a hair over 37% in 2021, however, though it doesn&#8217;t anticipate further revenue growth deceleration in percentage terms the following year.</p>
<p>The chart on the right is useful as well. Note how the company&#8217;s 2019 saw strong growth from its Q1 to its Q4. But also note its flat summer, in which sequential growth came to a near halt. Comparing that lackluster middle period with the rapid growth ironSource posted in every quarter of 2020 is stark. Sure, the pandemic boosted screen time for all of us, but my gosh, did ironSource have a great year on the back of the pandemic.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of another big tech versus Congress &#8220;grab your popcorn&#8221; grilling session, scheduled for March 25 &#8212; when U.S. lawmakers will once again question the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter on the unlovely topic of misinformation &#8212; a coalition of organizations across the privacy, antitrust, consumer protection and civil rights spaces has <a href="https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com">called for a ban on &#8220;surveillance advertising&#8221;</a>, further amplifying the argument that &#8220;big tech&#8217;s toxic business model is undermining democracy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The close to 40-strong coalition behind this latest call to ban &#8220;creepy ads&#8221; which rely on the mass tracking and profiling of web users in order to target them with behavioral ads includes the American Economic Liberties Project, the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, the Center for Digital Democracy, the Center for Humane Technology, Epic.org, Fair Vote, Media Matters for America, the Tech Transparency Project and The Real Facebook Oversight Board, to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As leaders across a broad range of issues and industries, we are united in our concern for the safety of </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">our communities and the health of democracy,&#8221; they write in the </span><a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6037bac32729e03c425791a6/605789d32e8de8a73441e1a7_Coalition%20Letter.pdf">open letter</a>. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Social media giants are eroding our consensus reality and threatening public safety in service of a toxic, extractive business model. That’s why we’re joining forces in an effort to ban surveillance advertising.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The coalition is keen to point out that less toxic non-tracking alternatives (like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">contextual ads) exist, while arguing that greater transparency and oversight of adtech infrastructure could help clean up a range of linked problems, from junk content and rising conspiracism to ad fraud and denuded digital innovation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is no silver bullet to remedy this crisis &#8212; and the members of this coalition will continue to pursue a range of different policy approaches, from comprehensive privacy legislation to reforming our antitrust laws and liability standards,&#8221; they write. &#8220;But here’s one thing we all agree on: It’s time to ban surveillance advertising.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="c5EZXpW3ja"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">EU parliament backs tighter rules on behavioural ads</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU parliament backs tighter rules on behavioural ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/embed/#?secret=c5EZXpW3ja" data-secret="c5EZXpW3ja" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;Big Tech platforms amplify hate, illegal activities, and conspiracism &#8212; and feed users increasingly extreme content &#8212; because that’s what generates the most engagement and profit,&#8221; they warn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their own algorithmic tools have boosted everything from white supremacist groups and Holocaust denialism to COVID-19 hoaxes, counterfeit opioids and fake cancer cures. Echo chambers, radicalization, and viral lies are features of these platforms, not bugs &#8212; central to the business model.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coalition also warns over surveillance advertising&#8217;s impact on the traditional news business, noting that shrinking revenues for professional journalism is raining more harm down upon the (genuine) information ecosystem democracies need to thrive.</p>
<p>The potshots are well-rehearsed at this point, although it&#8217;s an oversimplification to blame the demise of traditional news on tech giants so much as &#8220;giant tech&#8221;: aka the industrial disruption wrought by the internet making so much information freely available. But dominance of the programmatic adtech pipeline by a couple of platform giants clearly doesn&#8217;t help. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">Australia&#8217;s recent legislative answer to this problem</a> is still too new to assess for impacts but there&#8217;s a risk its news media bargaining code will merely benefit big media <em>and</em> big tech while doing nothing about the harms of either industry profiting off of outrage.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook and Google’s monopoly power and data harvesting practices have given them an unfair advantage, allowing them to dominate the digital advertising market, siphoning up revenue that once kept local newspapers afloat. So while Big Tech CEOs get richer, journalists get laid off,&#8221; the coalition warns, adding: &#8220;Big Tech will continue to stoke discrimination, division, and delusion &#8212; even if it fuels targeted violence or lays the groundwork for an insurrection &#8212; so long as it’s in their financial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among a <a href="https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com/real-costs-of-the-business">laundry list of harms</a> the coalition is linking to the dominant ad-based online business models of tech giants Facebook and Google is the funding of what they describe as &#8220;insidious misinformation sites that promote medical hoaxes, conspiracy theories, extremist content, and foreign propaganda&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning surveillance advertising would restore transparency and accountability to digital ad placements, and substantially defund junk sites that serve as critical infrastructure in the disinformation pipeline,&#8221; they argue, adding: &#8220;These sites produce an endless drumbeat of made-to-go-viral conspiracy theories that are then boosted by bad-faith social media influencers and the platforms’ engagement-hungry algorithms &#8212; a toxic feedback loop fueled and financed by surveillance advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other harms they point to are the risks posed to public health by platforms&#8217; amplification of junk/bogus content such as COVID-19 conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation; the risk of discrimination through unfairly selective and/or biased ad targeting, such as job ads that illegally exclude women or ethnic minorities; and the perverse economic incentives for ad platforms to amplify extremist/outrageous content in order to boost user engagement with content and ads, thereby fuelling societal division and driving partisanship as a byproduct of the fact platforms benefit financially from more content being spread.</p>
<p>The coalition also argues that the surveillance advertising system is &#8220;rigging the game against small businesses&#8221; because it embeds platform monopolies &#8212; which is a neat counterpoint to tech giants&#8217; defensive claim that creepy ads somehow level the playing field for SMEs versus larger brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Facebook and Google portray themselves as lifelines for small businesses, the truth is they’re simply charging monopoly rents for access to the digital economy,&#8221; they write, arguing that the duopoly&#8217;s &#8220;surveillance-driven stranglehold over the ad market leaves the little guys with no leverage or choice&#8221; &#8212; opening them up to exploitation by big tech.</p>
<p>The current market structure &#8212; with Facebook and Google controlling close to 60% of the U.S. ad market &#8212; is thus stifling innovation and competition, they further assert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of being a boon for online publishers, surveillance advertising disproportionately benefits Big Tech platforms,&#8221; they go on, noting that Facebook made $84.2 billion in 2020 ad revenue and Google made $134.8 billlion off advertising &#8220;while the surveillance ad industry ran rife with allegations of fraud&#8221;.</p>
<p>The campaign being kicked off is by no means the first call for a ban on behavioral advertising but given how many signatories are backing this one it&#8217;s a sign of the scale of the momentum building against a data-harvesting business model that has shaped the modern era and allowed a couple of startups to metamorphosize into society- and democracy-denting giants.</p>
<p>That looks important as U.S. lawmakers are now paying close attention to big tech impacts &#8212; and have a number of big tech antitrust cases actively on the table. Although it was European privacy regulators that were among the first to sound the alarm over microtargeting&#8217;s abusive impacts and risks for democratic societies.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">2018</a>, in the wake of the Facebook data misuse and voter targeting scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, the U.K.&#8217;s ICO called for an ethical pause on the use of online ad tools for political campaigning &#8212; penning a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2259369/democracy-disrupted-110718.pdf">report </a>entitled &#8220;Democracy Disrupted? Personal information and political influence&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no small irony that the self-same regulator has so far <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">declined to take any action</a> against the adtech industry&#8217;s unlawful use of people&#8217;s data &#8212; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">warning in 2019</a> that behavioral advertising is out of control.</p>
<p>The ICO&#8217;s ongoing inaction seems likely to have fed into the U.K. government&#8217;s decision that a dedicated unit is required to oversee big tech.</p>
<p>In recent years the U.K. has singled out the online ad space for antitrust concern &#8212; saying it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">establish a pro-competition regulator</a> to tackle big tech&#8217;s dominance, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">a market study of the digital advertising sector</a> carried out in 2019 by its Competition and Markets Authority, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">reported</a> substantial concerns over the power of the adtech duopoly.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, the European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor urged not a pause but a ban on targeted advertising based on tracking internet users’ digital activity &#8212; calling on regional lawmakers&#8217; to incorporate the lever into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">major reform of digital services rules</a> which is intended to boost operators’ accountability, among other goals.</p>

<p>The European Commission&#8217;s proposal had avoided going so far. But negotiations over the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are ongoing.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">Last year</a> the European Parliament also backed a tougher stance on creepy ads. Again, though, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Commission&#8217;s framework for tackling online political ads</a> does not suggest anything so radical &#8212; with EU lawmakers pushing for greater transparency instead.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what U.S. lawmakers will do, but with U.S. civil society organizations joining forces to amplify an anti-ad-targeting message there&#8217;s rising pressure to clean up the toxic adtech in its own backyard.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement on the <a href="https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com/what-people-are-saying">coalition&#8217;s website</a>, Zephyr Teachout, an associate professor of law at Fordham Law School, said: &#8220;Facebook and Google possess enormous monopoly power, combined with the surveillance regimes of authoritarian states and the addiction business model of cigarettes. Congress has broad authority to regulate their business models and should use it to ban them from engaging in surveillance advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surveillance advertising has robbed newspapers, magazines, and independent writers of their livelihoods and commoditized their work &#8212; and all we got in return were a couple of abusive monopolists,&#8221; added David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Ruby on Rails, in another supporting statement. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a good bargain for society. By banning this practice, we will return the unique value of writing, audio, and video to the people who make it rather than those who aggregate it.”</p>
<p>With U.S. policymakers paying increasingly close attention to adtech, it&#8217;s interesting to see Google is <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1373972755360649217">accelerating</a> its efforts to replace support for individual-level tracking with what it&#8217;s branded as a &#8220;privacy-safe&#8221; alternative (FLoC).</p>
<p>Yet the tech it&#8217;s proposed via its Privacy Sandbox will still enable groups (cohorts) of web users to be targeted by advertisers, with ongoing risks for discrimination, the targeting of vulnerable groups of people and societal-scale manipulation &#8212; so lawmakers will need to pay close attention to the detail of the &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; rather than Google&#8217;s branding.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, in a word, <i>bad</i> for privacy,&#8221; warned the EFF, writing about the proposal back in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1">2019</a>. &#8220;A flock name would essentially be a behavioral credit score: a tattoo on your digital forehead that gives a succinct summary of who you are, what you like, where you go, what you buy, and with whom you associate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;FLoC is the opposite of privacy-preserving technology,&#8221; it added. &#8220;Today, trackers follow you around the web, skulking in the digital shadows in order to guess at what kind of person you might be. In Google’s future, they will sit back, relax, and let your browser do the work for them.&#8221;</p>
