</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities traditionally have been bustling hubs where people live, work and play. When the pandemic hit, some people fled major metropolitan markets for smaller towns — raising questions about the future validity of cities. It’s true that we’re still months away from broader reopenings and herd immunity via current vaccination efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those who predicted that COVID-19 would destroy major urban communities might want to stop shorting the resilience of these municipalities and start going long on what the post-pandemic future looks like.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.N. </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/40b530ac84ab4931874e1f7efb4f1a22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s population will reside in cities, communities that are the epicenters of culture, innovation, wealth, education and tourism, to mention just a few benefits. They are not only worth saving — they’re also ripe for rebirth, precisely why many municipal leaders in the U.S. anticipate the Biden administration will allocate substantial monetary resources to rebuilding legacy infrastructure (and doing so in a way that prioritizes equitable access). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this emphasis on inclusivity and social innovation, the tech community has the ability to address a range of lifestyle and well-being issues: infrastructure, transportation and mobility, law enforcement, environmental monitoring, and energy allocation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this time of reset for cities, what smart city technologies will transform how we live our lives? What kinds of technology will make the biggest impact on cities in the next 12 months? Which smart cities are ahead of the curve? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To unpack these questions and more, we conducted the SmartCityX Survey of industry experts — including smart city investors, corporate and municipal thought leaders, members of academia, and startups on the front lines of urban innovation — to help provide valuable insights into where we’re heading. Below you’ll find some key takeaways:</span></p>
<h2><b>Infrastructure is the most crucial issue for cities</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical infrastructure topped the list of most prominent issues facing today’s cities, followed closely by traffic and transportation. Cisco may have </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cisco-turns-off-lights-on-smart-city-push-11609178895"><span style="font-weight: 400;">left the party too soon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but others, including countless startups, are lining up and capitalizing on future growth opportunities in the space. A couple of recent data points that support this trend — particularly as it relates to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure rebuilding, IoT and open toolkits to connect fragmented technologies — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">include the following:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley Systems, fresh off a September IPO, </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/bentley-systems-touchdown-ventures-set-up-100m-corporate-venture-capital-fund-61222293"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a $100 million corporate venture capital fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2020/12/09/qualcomm-announces-qualcomm-iot-services-suite-aimed-enable-digital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualcomm announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its IoT Services Suite, comprising leading solutions ranging from wireless connectivity, hardware, software and data analytics to platform integration.   </span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Smart Infrastructure is paramount to Smart City success. It&#8217;s crucial that this infrastructure be ‘architected’ as opposed to just connected. This is the only way to truly achieve seamless interoperability while ensuring scalability, reliability, security and privacy. Technology companies that offer robust architectural components and/or platforms stand to deliver tremendous stakeholder value and outsized returns to investors.&#8221; &#8211; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sue Stash, &#8211; &#8212; <em>General Partner, Pandemic Impact Fund</em></span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>What’s driving change in cities?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what will accelerate innovation and change in cities, an overwhelming majority cited COVID-19 as the primary factor, followed by remote work, which has accelerated the adoption of online collaboration tools and forced legacy companies to complete multi-year digital transformation projects in a matter of months. The biggest opportunity is to build cities back better and smarter, focusing on new infrastructures that do more with less, and for most of us, that begins and ends at home.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are trending hotter than pogs right now, and the number of articles published on the subject in the last few weeks has ballooned into the thousands. So a pardon must be begged at the outset here, but the overlooked potential of token economies is simply too important to let slip away.</p>
<p>NFTs are but one small <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">part of a much larger development</a> in the world of finance capital. What leaves some scratching their heads and chuckling could, within a decade, completely transform the model of investment that has been in place since the rise of Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2>Non-fungible what?</h2>
<p>NFTs have had a strange first step into the spotlight, bringing wealth to a very small group of people and making most people simply perplexed. Before NFTs are written off as a flash in the pan, it might be worth considering that NFTs were never designed to be very useful in traditional investment frameworks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It can be hard to imagine how this might all play out, but we are already seeing the outlines of this new economy begin to poke through the dried-out skin of the old model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>An auction house selling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/daily-crunch-nft-artwork-sells-for-69m/">$69 million JPEG</a> is akin to a horse-and-buggy driver strapping a small nuclear reactor to the top of the cab and declaring, “This is an <em>atomic </em>buggy!” as the horse continues to chug along, doing all the work. You’ll get the attention of bystanders, but nothing has fundamentally changed here.</p>
<p>Each of the headline-grabbing NFT sales seen recently are instances of exactly this kind of backward thinking. And the bystanders criticizing the buggy driver and saying, “nuclear reactors are hype,” are not really seeing the long-term implications, or they just don’t like horses.</p>
<h2>Whales, dogs and unicorns</h2>
<p>From early conceptions of investment as a way to fund transoceanic ship voyages, to the rise of venture capital as we know it today, the entire cosmos of finance capital has remained an elite sport. This is because the current model is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">big investors getting big wins</a>.</p>
<p>Almost the entire world of finance capital is structured on big whales and unicorns, mythical creatures that mere mortals consider themselves lucky to have glimpsed. The word “structured” is chosen here carefully, as the “big-dog” theory of capital is literally built on powerful intermediaries that facilitate the will of these top investors.</p>
<p>The invention of bitcoin is an epochal event in the development of finance. Bitcoin itself has crystallized into merely another playground of power, but the technological tremors it left in its wake are starting to emerge as the real game-changers. Primarily, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) &#8212; of which blockchain is but one instance &#8212; are a breakthrough on par with being able to send a message instantaneously to a person on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>DLTs mean that finance capital no longer has a need for powerful intermediaries &#8212; or intermediaries of any kind. Middlemen are currently very necessary in order for parties to establish trust in transactions, trades contracts or investments. Paying for the services of these middlemen can be written off as the cost of doing business for large companies and wealthy individuals, but these expenses remain prohibitive barriers for many.</p>
<p>DLTs break down these barriers because trust is established by and built into the very architecture of the network itself. With DLTs, anybody with an internet connection can do big-dog-style business deals at whatever level they can afford, and the way that these deals are transacted is through tokens.</p>
<h2>Token economies will be transformative</h2>
<p>DLT economies are going to be adopted by all of the major investment players in the next few years as the advantages of decentralizing investment are too numerous to ignore &#8212; lower friction for transactions due to automation, much quicker (real-time) results and analysis of market conditions, greater security through transparency, and a higher level of customization for financial products and services. The adoption of decentralized finance by major players will have a net-positive impact for everyone else.</p>
<p>Tokens are the lifeblood of this new system, and non-fungible tokens are just one type of token. In this emerging model, there are payment tokens that behave like money, security tokens that are comparable to stocks, utility tokens that provide functions like space or bandwidth and hybrid tokens that mix these tokens into new forms. If it sounds a bit confusing and exciting, that’s because it is.</p>
<p>The main takeaway to understand here is that tokens are going to replace not just stocks and other investment products but also the entire idea of having middlemen between you and your purchases, whether that middleman is an investment broker, a credit card company, a platform provider or a bank. The decentralized economy is going to be a much more open and direct kind of market.</p>
<h2>The rubber hits the road like this</h2>
<p>It can be hard to imagine how this might all play out, but we are already seeing the outlines of this new economy begin to poke through the dried-out skin of the old model. These protrusions are most apparent where economic reality doesn’t really make sense.</p>
<p>Think of the emerging gig economy, where nobody really seems to have a steady job anymore, where each of us is some kind of professional mercenary, moving from gig to gig. Think of the huge number of subscriptions that most of us carry like millstones around our necks. Think of the paradoxically frustrating relationship of musicians to streaming platforms, or artists to galleries. Think about the amount of crushing poverty that still remains on our planet.</p>
<p>These are all instances of models of living and working not really fitting into old containers. We can all sense that these aspects of our lives aren’t really functioning optimally, but we can’t quite say why and we certainly don’t know what the solution might look like. Decentralized, tokenized economies have the potential to erase all of these pain points, paradoxes and kludges and replace them with something much more intuitive and elegant.</p>
<p>This new reality is easy to imagine in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/why-the-next-cryptokitties-mania-wont-be-about-collectables/">some of its attributes</a>: Instead of nine different subscriptions, you can just pay directly for the content that you want, when you want it. Instead of artists giving up half of their earnings to galleries or musicians giving, well, all of their earnings to streaming platforms, they now just take direct payment for their work through fluid networks built by and for this type of content. Instead of paying brokers to facilitate your investments, you can now just invest directly in the enterprises that interest you, including formerly out-of-reach sectors like real estate investment. Instead of crushing poverty and fiercely protected borders between classes, we break down barriers and give everyone access to value.</p>
<p>Many of the other developments in a token economy have yet to be imagined, and this is probably the most exciting aspect of all. When we distribute the economy globally, in a way that allows anyone with an internet connection the ability to interact and contribute in a meaningful way, we are unlocking the value of untapped assets that are worth literally trillions of dollars. So what is holding us back, and how do we get there as soon as possible?</p>
<h2>The work ahead is very clear</h2>
<p>The hardest part of unlocking this new economy has already been achieved &#8212; we have the technological understanding of how to distribute and decentralize a system of consensus that combines with a system of digitizing assets for trade and investment.</p>
<p>The remaining work that will actually bring this system online is fairly obvious &#8212; first and foremost, we need to take a look at the ecological impacts that this new system has had in its infancy. We should absolutely outlaw mining farms or set the strictest limits for how much of their energy comes from nonrenewables. If the backbone of this new economy is destroying the planet, we need to shut it down before it grows, full stop. The system needs to be ecologically sustainable.</p>
<p>The second most immediate concern is that there are currently no standards, no common network, that the multitude of different cryptocurrencies and tokens agree on. It’s astounding and absolutely frustrating that the various cryptos are hardly even talking about this.</p>
<p>It’s as if we have a bunch of different companies not only inventing the light bulb but also inventing their own light sockets and wiring protocols, and each one is insisting that they are the best and they will win out in the end. Light bulbs are great, but can we please agree on one socket? This beautiful new economy will never get off the ground unless we build a neutral, interoperable network, and this network needs to be feeless and scalable.</p>
<p>The last cause of immediate concern is regulation and legal frameworks. There are too many people still in crypto that have some kind of anarchist’s deathwish to just be completely left outside, and this is not serving the long-term goals of our communities.</p>
<p>I’m all for knocking intermediaries out of the value chain, but this doesn’t automatically entail the establishment of a never-never land that no regulatory agencies are invited to. Legal frameworks for decentralized economies go hand in hand with our ethos of open-source, community-building, transparent operations. We all need to be advocates for thorough and precise regulation of our nascent technology.</p>
<p>With ecology, interoperability and regulation as our watchwords, we can begin work on building the actual apps and other infrastructure that will allow users to leverage the power of a new economy. The uses are limitless, from selling excess electricity to your regional smart power grid, to investing in your favorite artists’ network, to accepting direct payment for your own labor, to &#8212; yes &#8212; buying NFTs, which will make a lot more sense in the new economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/">The non-fungible token (NFT) mania</a> has inspired Ethereum fans to spend more than <a href="https://www.duneanalytics.com/rchen8/opensea">$224 million</a> on crypto collectibles so far in 2021 through marketplaces OpenSea and Rarible, but many buyers may not understand what they actually own.</p>
<p>“An NFT is not that different from any other crypto purchase in that you are buying control over information in an entry in a ledger,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, one of the founders of <a href="https://smoroslaw.com/">Smolinski Rosario Law</a>.</p>
<p>NFT buyers don’t actually own the media files associated with their blockchain receipts, whether those files are JPEGs or GIFS or MP3s. The best way to know which aspects of the NFT craze will outlast this trendy boom is to look at the history of comparable assets. As it turns out, people have been making crypto collectibles for nearly seven years.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zebedeeio">Zebedee </a>co-founder Christian Moss, who has been working on blockchain-based games since 2014, said he stopped making Bitcoin-based collectibles because transaction fees shot up. To make matters worse, some buyers viewed tokens as investments instead of as toys.</p>
<p>“They were tokens on Bitcoin,” Moss said. “A lot of developers ended up trying to pump their tokens and prices. &#8230; It felt like people who played those games felt like they were investors on the board. I don’t want my game to be an investment vehicle. Then players might try to sue me if they lost their tokens. It changed the dynamic of the game.”</p>
<p>These days, Moss helps people earn small amounts of bitcoin by playing mainstream video games like &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/zebedeeio/status/1371136734965215232">Counter-Strike</a>.&#8221; That way, there’s no confusion about how to value virtual assets; cryptocurrency is money and in-game assets are toys.</p>
<p>“NFTs aren’t game items at all; they are receipts,” Moss said. “If you have the receipt, you might be able to get an item in a game, but they can’t allow a Zelda sword NFT [in &#8220;Counter-Strike&#8221;], for example, because that might be copyright infringement. There are legal implications there.”</p>
<p>Indeed, legal implications are the crux of the NFT trend. Whether a court would protect the receipt-holder&#8217;s ownership over a given file depends on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s great if the artist intends to transfer any copyright for a work of art to an NFT purchaser, but can that be perfected to the point where a court of law or copyright office would recognize that transfer? That gets into additional questions of jurisdiction,&#8221; Rosario said. “Brands and platforms need to make sure they have the right agreements in place to govern these relationships.”</p>
<p>With regard to NFT sellers who take screenshots of other people’s content and profit from a corresponding NFT, Rosario said it’s hard to say whether that violates any laws.</p>
<p>“You probably start by looking at Twitter’s terms of service and begin the investigation there. It really depends,” he said, adding that impersonation or stealing someone’s passwords are different issues entirely.</p>
<p>And there are still open questions beyond copyright issues and fraud, such as <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cryptocurrency-and-ofac-beware-of-the-34002/">sanctions</a> and porn regulations.</p>
<h2><b>Finding a space for adult content</b></h2>
<p>A growing number of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/">adult content creators</a> are selling erotic NFTs on platforms like Rarible, often earning <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/aella">hundreds of dollars</a> per photo. One such artist, <a href="https://rarible.com/polyannie">PolyAnnie</a>, said she has earned more from selling NFTs on Rarible alone than her average annual earnings <a href="https://allmylinks.com/polyannie01">across platforms</a> like OnlyFans, Patreon and ManyVids combined.</p>
<p>“I sold 90 NFTs, bringing in 10.11 ETH in 5 months,” she said. “I purchased 18 NFTs from other creators, too.”</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/french-parliament-passes-porn-age-verification-legislation/">age-verification requirements</a> for platforms with adult content, while other jurisdictions make platforms <a href="https://www.rstreet.org/2020/04/08/the-lessons-of-fosta-sesta-from-a-former-content-moderator/">potentially liable</a> for child porn or revenge porn if the platforms don’t heavily moderate explicit content. As such, platform providers tend to be conservative about their terms of service.</p>
<p>“A lot of these NFT platforms don’t want to deal with the risks of sexually oriented content,” PolyAnnie said.</p>
<p>That’s why some <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/42525">sex workers</a> have had their content <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:42525">censored </a>by platforms like Rarible. As for the most popular NFT platform, OpenSea, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">which raised a Series A round from a16z earlier this month</a>, CEO Devin Finzer said his team moderates the platform and limits search results for adult content, so those NFTs can only be found by someone going directly to the creator’s profile.</p>
<p>“We haven’t exactly nailed it down, but one option is a separate section of our site for that type of content,” Finzer said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coming wave of electric vehicles will require more than thousands of charging stations. In addition to being installed, they also need to work — and today, that isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>If a station doesn&#8217;t send out an error or a driver doesn&#8217;t report it, network providers might never know there&#8217;s even a problem. Kameale C. Terry, who co-founded <a href="https://www.chargerhelp.com">ChargerHelp!</a>, an on-demand repair app for electric vehicle charging stations, has seen these issues firsthand.</p>
<p>One customer assumed that poor usage rates at a particular station was due to a lack of EVs in the area, Terry recalled in a recent interview. That wasn&#8217;t the problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There was an abandoned vehicle parked there and the station was surrounded by mud,&#8221; said Terry who is CEO and co-founded the company with Evette Ellis.</p>
<p>Demand for ChargerHelp&#8217;s service has attracted customers and investors. The company said it has raised $2.75 million from investors Trucks VC, Kapor Capital, JFF, Energy Impact Partners and The Fund. This round values the startup, which was founded in January 2020, at $11 million post-money.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build out its platform, hire beyond its 27-person workforce and expand its service area. ChargerHelp works directly with the charging manufacturers and network providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today when a station goes down there&#8217;s really no troubleshooting guidance,&#8221; said Terry, noting that it takes getting someone out into the field to run diagnostics on the station to understand the specific problem. After an onsite visit, a technician then typically shares data with the customer, and then steps are taken to order the correct and specific part — a practice that often doesn&#8217;t happen today.</p>
<p>While ChargerHelp is couched as an on-demand repair app, it is also acts as a preventative maintenance service for its customers.</p>
<h2>Powering up</h2>
<p>The idea for ChargerHelp came from Terry&#8217;s experience working at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/electric-vehicle-charging-software-ev-connect-raises-12-million/">EV Connect</a>, where she held a number of roles, including head of customer experience and director of programs. During her time there, she worked with 12 manufacturers, which gave her knowledge into inner workings and common problems with the chargers.</p>
<p>It was here that she spotted a gap in the EV charging market.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the stations went down we really couldn&#8217;t get anyone on site because most of the issues were communication issues, vandalism, firmware updates or swapping out a part — all things that were not electrical,&#8221; Terry said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YvX6vjL7uC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=YvX6vjL7uC" data-secret="YvX6vjL7uC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And yet, the general practice was to use electrical contractors to fix issues at the charging stations. Terry said it could take as long as 30 days to get an electrical contractor on site to repair these non-electrical problems.</p>
<p>Terry often took matters in her own hands if issues arose with stations located in Los Angeles, where she is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was a part that needed to be swapped out, I would just go do it myself,&#8221; Terry said, adding she didn&#8217;t have a background in software or repairs. &#8220;I thought, if I can figure this stuff out, then anyone can.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January 2020, Terry quit her job and started ChargerHelp. The newly minted founder joined the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/los-angeles-cleantech-incubator-reboots-its-incubation-program-with-16-member-cohort/"> Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator</a>, where she developed a curriculum to teach people how to repair EV chargers. It was here that she met Ellis, a career coach at LACI who also worked at the Long Beach Job Corp Center. Ellis is now the chief workforce officer at ChargerHelp.</p>
<p>Since then, Terry and Ellis were accepted into Elemental Excelerator&#8217;s <a href="https://elementalexcelerator.com/">startup incubator</a>, raised about $400,000 in grant money, launched a pilot program with Tellus Power focused on preventative maintenance and landed contracts with EV charging networks and manufacturers such as EV Connect, ABB and SparkCharge. Terry said they have also hired their core team of seven employees and trained their first tranche of technicians.</p>
<h2>Hiring approach</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2131300" style="width: 7962px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131300" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2131300 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg" alt="ChargerHelp-07886" width="7952" height="5304" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 7952px) 100vw, 7952px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ChargerHelp</p></div></p>
<p>ChargerHelp takes a workforce-development approach to finding employees. The company only hires in cohorts, or groups, of employees.</p>
<p>The company received more than 1,600 applications in its first recruitment round for electric vehicle service technicians, according to Terry. Of those, 20 were picked to go through training and 18 were ultimately hired to service contracts across six states, including California, Oregon, Washington, New York and Texas. Everyone picked to go through training is paid a stipend and earn two safety licenses.</p>
<p>The startup will begin its second recruitment round in April. All workers are full-time with a guaranteed wage of $30 an hour and are being given shares in the startup, Terry said. The company is working directly with workforce development centers in the areas where ChargerHelp needs technicians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://bunch.ai/">Bunch</a> announced that it has closed a total of $4.4 million in seed capital, including a new $1 million infusion this week. The company&#8217;s product, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1500872908?mt=8">a mobile app</a>, focuses on teaching leadership skills to the younger generations more accustomed to learning in smaller chunks, often on the go.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t roll your eyes, all ye who attended business school. The concept has traction.</p>
<p>Earlier this month TechCrunch covered <a href="https://www.arist.co/">Arist</a>, for example, a startup that provides corporate training delivered to end-users via text. That company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/">added $2 million to its prior raise</a>, bringing its round to a total of $3.9 million. To see Bunch pick up some extra cash is therefore not too surprising.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Bunch CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/darjagutnick">Darja Gutnick</a> and M13 partner and Bunch-backer <a href="https://twitter.com/kalomarnyc?lang=en">Karl Alomar</a> to chat about the round and what the startup is up to.</p>
<p>Bunch claims to be an &#8220;AI coach&#8221; that provides users with daily, short-form tips and tricks to become a better leader. Given that we have all either worked for a manager who could have used some more training, or been that manager ourselves, the idea isn&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P47LQW60We"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/">Arist adds $2M to its seed round to grow its SMS-based training service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Arist adds $2M to its seed round to grow its SMS-based training service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/embed/#?secret=P47LQW60We" data-secret="P47LQW60We" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you would expect, Bunch tailors itself to individual users. Gutnick told TechCrunch that her company has partnered with academics to detail different leadership style &#8220;archetypes&#8221; as part of its foundation. The Bunch system also molds its out to a user&#8217;s style and leadership goals.</p>
<p>Notably when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunch-ai/">last covered Bunch</a>, it was working on something a bit different. Back in 2017, the company was building what we described as &#8220;Google Analytics for company culture.&#8221; Since then the startup has shifted its focus to individuals instead of companies.</p>
<p>Bunch&#8217;s service launched in November, leading to around 13,000 signups by the start of the year. The startup now claims nearly 20,000. And it has big product plans for the next few months. That&#8217;s why the company raised more money, and why Alomar and his firm were willing to put more capital into the startup.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead that got M13 sufficiently excited that it put more capital into Bunch? Alomar said that community and peer-review features are coming. It was a good time, he explained, to put more money into Gutnick&#8217;s company so that it can build, and then raise more capital later on after it gets some more work done.</p>
<p>The company plans to make money via a freemium offering. Gutnick told TechCrunch that related apps in her category tend to struggle with retention, so they charge up front and then don&#8217;t mind limited usage later on. She wants to flip that.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s more to come from Bunch, like other categories of content. But the startup wants to focus and get its first niche done right. It now has another million dollars to prove that its early traction isn&#8217;t just that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://eqtventures.com/">EQT Ventures</a>, an investment firm based in Europe that has raised more than €1.2 billion ($1.4 billion USD), announced that it has promoted Laura Yao to partner. At the same time, the firm announced it recently hired Anne Raimondi, former SVP of Operations at Zendesk, as operating partner.</p>
<p>The company is based in Stockholm, with offices in London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Luxembourg. Yao is based in the U.S. office in San Francisco, where she has been working for three years prior to her recent promotion to partner. She says that the company tends to hire people with operator experience because they relate well to the founders of startups in which they invest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to partner with the most ambitious and boldest founders in Europe and the U.S. and kind of be the investors that we all wish we&#8217;d had when we were on the other side of the table,&#8221; Yao told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yao&#8217;s background includes co-founding a startup called The PhenomList in 2011.</p>
<p>While she is responsible for looking for new investments, Raimondi works with the existing portfolio of companies, particularly B2B SaaS companies, helping them with practical aspects of building a startup like go-to-market strategy, organizational design, hiring executives and other components of company building.</p>
<p>&#8220;I joined earlier this year as an operating partner, so I&#8217;m not on the investing side but actually focused on working with existing portfolio company founders as they grow and scale,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, female partners like Yao and Raimondi remain a rarity in most venture firms with a <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/business-investment-to-women/#:~:text=Only%2012%20percent%20of%20venture,t%20have%20any%20female%20partners.">Crunchbase report</a> from last April finding that just 3% of investors are women, and that over two-thirds of firms don&#8217;t have a single woman as a partner.</p>
<p>EQT has a 50/50 male to female employee ratio, although the partners were all male until Yao was promoted and Raimondi hired. That makes two of six as the company attempts to make the investment team reflect the rest of the company and the population at large.</p>
<p>Part of Raimondi&#8217;s job is talking to startups about building diverse and equitable organizations and she and Yao know the company needs to model that. She says that thriving startups understand on the product side that to build a successful product, they start with a hypothesis, then develop targets and metrics to test, learn and then iterate.</p>

<p>She says that they need to do the same thing to build a diverse and inclusive company. That starts with defining what diversity and inclusion looks like and setting up metrics to measure their progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;You evaluate [your diversity goals] and hold [the company] accountable to what you&#8217;ve signed up for. If you don&#8217;t meet them, [you look at] what can you do to improve them. Then you look at how you keep iterating, and then constantly measuring the employee experience across many dimensions, including not only diversity, but the important part of belonging,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>
<p>Both women say their company does a good job at this, and their hiring/promotion proves that. Yao says that the organization as a whole has created a comfortable and inclusive culture. &#8220;It&#8217;s very collaborative and egalitarian. Anyone can say whatever&#8217;s on their mind. It&#8217;s very non-hierarchical and a comfortable place for a woman to work. I felt immediately welcomed and that my ideas were welcome immediately,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company portfolio includes startups in the U.S. and Europe and the firm sees itself as a bridge between the two locations. Among the companies EQT has invested in include bug bounty startup HackerOne, website building technology Netlify and quantum computing startup Seeqc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the fact that capital is abundant and dozens of startups get funding every day, the process of raising institutional capital is anything but simple.</p>
<p>From getting an investor&#8217;s attention to nailing your virtual pitch meeting to the legal aspects of your term sheet, there is plenty to navigate.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> is bringing together some of the biggest VCs to share how to manage the process proactively and successfully secure capital from the right VCs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3>How to Nail Your Virtual Pitch Meeting &#8211; Melissa Bradley, Ureeka</h3>

Entrepreneur and VC Melissa Bradley will outline how to make the most of that half hour on Zoom and lock in the next one.</em></p>
<h3>How to Kick the 10 Worst Startup Habits &#8211; Leah Solivan, Fuel Capital</h3>
<p><em>With voices across the internet giving their two-cents on how to run a great business, Fuel Capital&#8217;s Leah Solivan will share a list of things that a founder should NOT do.

<h3>Fundraising Terms That Affect Your Business &#8211; Dawn Belt, Fenwick &amp; West</h3>
<p><em>With each funding round, there is an exciting opportunity for growth, but it’s important to fully understand the implications of those terms. Fenwick partner Dawn Belt will discuss the key legal terms to focus on in your seed and Series A rounds and how they affect the control and operational freedom of your company.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a> takes place on April 1 &#8211; 2 and is jam-packed with breakout sessions led by tech leaders, from VCs to operators.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payment card network Visa <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005171/en/Visa-Becomes-First-Major-Payments-Network-to-Settle-Transactions-in-USD-Coin-USDC">has announced</a> that transactions can be settled using USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin powered by the Ethereum blockchain. <a href="https://crypto.com/cards">Crypto.com</a> is the first company to test the new capability with its own Visa-branded cards.</p>
<p>USDC is a stablecoin co-founded by Circle and Coinbase and by managed the <a href="https://www.centre.io">Centre</a> consortium. As the name suggests, USDC is a cryptocurrency that follows the value of USD. One USDC is always worth one USD — hence the name stablecoin.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the value of USDC remains stable, USDC partners keep USD on bank accounts every time they issue new tokens. Those accounts are audited to make sure that there are as many USDC in circulation as there are USD in those accounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So why do stablecoins exist even though money is mostly digital these days? Like other crypto assets, stablecoins present some flexibility when it comes to sending, receiving and storing value. You don’t need a bank account and everything can be easily programmable. And you don’t need to support legacy systems, integrate with banks and pay transaction fees to other financial institutions.</p>
<p>While USDC originally started as a token on top of the Ethereum blockchain, USDC also supports two other blockchains — Algorand and Stellar. Visa has chosen to focus on the Ethereum variant of USDC for now.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto company Anchorage raises $80 million after getting federal banking charter&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-80-million-after-getting-federal-banking-charter/embed/#?secret=eRisAcXSob" data-secret="eRisAcXSob" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The payment company already supports 160 currencies across the globe. That’s why you can seamlessly use your Visa card when you travel abroad. You’ll see a card transaction in your home currency on your card statement, but the merchant gets paid in their own local currency.</p>
<p>Thanks to a partnership with <a href="https://anchorage.com">Anchorage</a>, Visa is adding support for its first digital currency. Anchorage recently received a federal banking charter and is positioning itself as a digital asset bank. Visa was probably looking for a trustworthy partner for this program. As Anchorage got a thumbs-up from regulators, the partnership makes sense.</p>
<p>For Crypto.com, it means that it can send USDC directly to Visa. For instance, if a Crypto.com customer holds USDC in their wallet and makes a card transaction, Crypto.com doesn’t have to first convert USDC tokens to USD.</p>
<p>It can send USDC to Visa’s Ethereum wallet address at Anchorage to settle the transaction. The merchant then gets paid by Visa in their own currency. Visa says there will be more partners down the road in addition to Crypto.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government has cut trade ties to Myanmar, two months after the country&#8217;s military staged a coup overthrowing the country&#8217;s president and also its de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and killed at least 200 protesters resulting from its offensive.</p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the trade suspension would be &#8220;effective immediately&#8221; and will remain in place &#8220;until the return of a democratically elected government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States supports the people of Burma in their efforts to restore a democratically elected government, which has been the foundation of Burma’s economic growth and reform,&#8221; said Tai. &#8220;The United States strongly condemns the Burmese security forces&#8217; brutal violence against civilians. The killing of peaceful protestors, students, workers, labor leaders, medics, and children has shocked the conscience of the international community. These actions are a direct assault on the country&#8217;s transition to democracy and the efforts of the Burmese people to achieve a peaceful and prosperous future,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>Myanmar (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16000467">also known as Burma</a>) and the U.S. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16000467">began trading in 2013</a> following the easing of U.S. sanctions a year earlier after elections saw Suu Kyi&#8217;s party win by a landslide.</p>
<p>The trade suspension is designed to target the ruling military junta, but leaves millions of internet users across Myanmar in uncertainty as U.S. cloud and internet companies wrangle with the U.S. government order, at a time where protesters are struggling to stay online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/myanmar-military-government-is-now-blocking-twitter/">amid government-ordered internet shutdowns</a> across the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Can the market hold up the optimism that many SPAC-led debuts are implying in their pricing? I do not know. But there are a lot of wagers being made in the market today that are giving me pause.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that U.K.-based used car seller Cazoo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/">intends to list</a> in the United States via a SPAC is not surprising. After all, the SPAC boom we&#8217;ve seen in recent quarters means that there are a host of American blank-check companies in the market looking for deals &#8212; why would they stop at domestic borders?</p>
<p>But the Cazoo deal is not a surprise for other reasons as well. We&#8217;ve seen the value of related American company Carvana spike in recent years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/auto-site-carvana-tumbles-26-in-stock-market-debut/">its 2017 IPO</a>, for example. And Carvana has shown the sort of gross-margin improvement that Cazoo intends to manage in the coming years, so there&#8217;s precedent for its sales model to show economic improvements over time.</p>

<p>But coming at the same time as a <a href="https://www.cazoo.co.uk/static/docs/Cazoo%20-%20Investor%20Presentation.pdf">sunny investor deck</a> detailing why the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210328005028/en/Cazoo-to-Become-Listed-on-NYSE-through-7.0-Billion-Business-Combination-with-AJAX-I">Cazoo-AJAX I deal</a> is a good idea are a number of public-market trembles that could indicate uncertain risk tolerance among public investors. We can see this in the slack debut of several Chinese companies, as well as the downward pressure on the public offering for Deliveroo, a food-delivery platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cazoo is picking up significant capital today</a> by teaming up with a SPAC in the U.S. at a $7 billion valuation, but another big used-car play is consolidating operations. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Berlin-based <a href="https://www.frontiercargroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontier Car Group</a>, which builds used-car marketplaces with a focus on emerging markets, is shutting down its operations in the city. The move will see 100 jobs transferred from Berlin to India, the company said.</p>
<p>Its majority owner OLX Group, a division of Prosus (the tech holdings of Naspers that is now listed as a separate entity), said that it wants to refocus on more local operations in Latin America and Asia under its OLX Autos brand, into which it will fold in the remaining FCG operations. OLX Autos&#8217; CEO Gautam Thakar, who was <a href="https://www.olxgroup.com/press/olx-group-appoints-gautam-thakar-global-ceo-olx-autos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed in February</a>, is based out of Gurgaon, India.</p>
<p>The company currently has operations in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru. OLX Autos independently also had three other brands: CarFirst brand in Pakistan, Cars45 in Nigeria, and <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webuyanycarusa.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Csarah.ryan%40prosus.com%7Cfbe9858e65f94e04f30008d8f2c11c5d%7Ccefec05ccd1a44f38657e7e2744d40b0%7C1%7C0%7C637526258510352630%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=pu5japuZ7trycEJyn5SPaO3TtUj%2BfvOKpfrCikhVI1I%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.webuyanycarusa.com%252F%26data%3D04%257C01%257Csarah.ryan%2540prosus.com%257Cfbe9858e65f94e04f30008d8f2c11c5d%257Ccefec05ccd1a44f38657e7e2744d40b0%257C1%257C0%257C637526258510352630%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%253D%257C1000%26sdata%3Dpu5japuZ7trycEJyn5SPaO3TtUj%252BfvOKpfrCikhVI1I%253D%26reserved%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617115809061000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCPEQI03owkuFWtV3CdnoCwyj1dQ">webuyanycar.com</a> in the US.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OLX took a controlling stake in Frontier as a result of an investment of about $400 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/olx-group-invests-up-to-400m-in-used-car-marketplace-frontier-car-group-at-700m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 2019</a>, valuing Frontier at around $700 million at the time. There was no official announcement of the move, but we saw the news in passing on Twitter, and a Prosus spokesperson confirmed the details to TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;OLX Group can confirm the closure of the FCG Germany GmbH entity based in Berlin over the coming months,&#8221; said the spokesperson. &#8220;This entity represents a subset of the OLX Group workforce in Berlin &#8211; other OLX Group employees in Berlin were not impacted by this entity closure, and those operations are ongoing. This decision to close FCG Germany GmbH was not taken lightly. The decision reflects the evolution of the OLX Autos strategy to focus more strongly on the LatAm and Asia markets. In order to have our development teams closer to our customers, we will shift core product development operations to India, a key market for OLX Autos. OLX Group is committed to taking care of our people in such a difficult situation and has offered a financial runway beyond what is compulsory, to allow time and flexibility to find new roles. Effected employees are being encouraged to apply for open roles within our other entities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>About 100 people are being impacted by the news &#8212; jobs that were based in Berlin that are being relocated to India. No other operations were active in other markets in Europe. If you navigate to FCG&#8217;s site, it automatically redirects to OLX.</p>
<p>Although it was founded and headquartered in Berlin, Frontier Car Group had always focused on emerging markets and taking the used-car marketplace model to those countries.</p>
<p>Inspired by Cazoo rival Auto1 &#8212; another Berlin-based used-car marketplace that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/auto1-ipo-idUSL8N2KA2LE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public via a listing in Germany in February</a> and is now valued at $12.6 billion (likely an encouraging comparison for Cazoo investors) &#8212; Frontier founders Sujay Tyle, Peter Lindholm and André Kussmann thought they could take that model to less developed markets for a bigger opportunity.</p>
<p>“I fell in love with the Auto1 model,” Tyle told TechCrunch back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/frontier-car-group-raises-another-58m-for-its-used-car-marketplace-for-emerging-economies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>. “I could see how it could be applied to emerging markets. Emerging markets represent nascency.” Tyle himself is a whizz-kid who hails from the U.S. and was in his early 20s when he co-founded Frontier. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">He left it in August 2020 and now lives in Mexico City, building a new e-commerce investor there called Merama.</span></p>
<p>Frontier, in part because of the success of Auto1 (which took hundreds of millions of dollars in investment from the likes of Sequoia, SoftBank and others), became a part of the guard of exciting new tech startups building businesses out of Berlin.</p>
<p>That focus on emerging markets linked up Naspers&#8217; global expansion strategy, and so OLX, a classifieds operation that had an interest in automotive marketplaces, became a strategic investor in Frontier, first with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/frontier-car-group-raises-another-58m-for-its-used-car-marketplace-for-emerging-economies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smaller stake</a>, and eventually taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/olx-group-invests-up-to-400m-in-used-car-marketplace-frontier-car-group-at-700m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority ownership and control of the operation</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why OLX decided to wind down the Frontier brand and to double down OLX Autos but notably, over the last year it looks like OLX was restructuring in other markets, including with the <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/olx-india-lays-off-250-employees-set-to-renew-focus-on-2-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoff of 250 people in its operations in India</a> after shutting down marketplaces focused on real estate and used goods.</p>
<p>While some companies like Cazoo have apparently seen a strong surge of business in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the health crisis has hit a number of economies, economic sectors and specific companies harder than others, leading to tightening costs. Overall, we&#8217;ve seen big slumps in new car sales in different markets around the world.</p>
<p>A Prosus spokesperson said that both OLX and OLX Autos were<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> impacted at the start of Covid-19 but have since recovered. </span>Prosus has <a href="https://www.prosus.com/getattachment/Investors/Overview/Prosus-press-statement,-Sep20.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remained</a> profitable in what has been a turbulent year, but <a href="https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/retail/ams-prx/prosus-shares/news/were-not-counting-on-prosus-amsprx-to-sustain-its-statutory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> have pointed out that those profits have declined. (It will next update its financials in June.)</p>
<p>Updated to make clear that OLX is folding FCG&#8217;s remaining operations into its OLX Autos business, not shutting it down altogether.</p>

<p>This morning was a fun mix of news, including some early-stage and late-stage startups entries, along with the latest from the public markets and the great IPO game. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceTitan&#8217;s vertical SaaS success was enshrined in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/">recent funding round and valuation</a>. Both of which were predicated on its revenue growth. The software market is just gigantic. It&#8217;s kinda crazy.</li>
<li>Deliveroo&#8217;s IPO has hit market chop as it looks to price. Governance and how it treats workers were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/deliveroo-cuts-ipo-share-price-range-after-investor-backlash.html">among the concerns</a> that investors have raised.</li>
<li>And then Chinese company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bilibili-drops-hong-kong-debut-015115171.html">BiliBili struggled</a> during its Hong Kong IPO, while Chinese company <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zhihu-ipo/chinas-zhihu-raises-523-million-in-u-s-ipo-despite-uneasy-ties-idUSKBN2BI0L6">Zhihu fell</a> after debuting in the United States &#8212; could the public markets be ratcheting back their interest in tech stocks?</span></li>
<li>On the funding round side of things, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib extended its Series A</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/singular-is-a-new-paris-based-vc-firm-with-265-million/">Singular announced its fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/">Cazoo is going public via a SPAC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a lot, but when have we started the week anything less than fully behind? Chat Wednesday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM today <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2021/03/quantum-developer-certification/">announced</a> the launch of its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/certify/exam?id=C1000-112">first developer certification</a> for programming quantum computers.</p>
<p>While quantum computing may still be in its infancy, most pundits in the industry will tell you that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/why-now-is-the-time-to-get-ready-for-quantum-computing/">now is the time to learn the basic concepts</a>. And while there is little that&#8217;s immediately intuitive on the hardware side of quantum computing, the actual software tools that most players in the industry are developing today should feel somewhat familiar to virtually any developer.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &#8220;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/certify/exam?id=C1000-112">IBM Quantum Developer Certification</a>,&#8221; as it&#8217;s officially called, focuses on IBM&#8217;s own software tools and especially <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, its SDK for working with quantum computers. Qiskit has already proven quite popular, with more than 600,000 installs, and when IBM Quantum and the Qiskit team hosted a quantum summer school last year, almost 5,000 developers participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But on top of knowing their way around the basics of Qiskit (think defining and executing quantum circuits) developers also need to learn some of the basics of quantum computing itself. Once you know your way around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere">Bloch spheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices">Pauli matrices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">Bell states</a>, you&#8217;ll probably be in good shape for taking the certification exam, which will be administered on the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/ibm">Pearson VUE platform</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why now is the time to get ready for quantum computing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/why-now-is-the-time-to-get-ready-for-quantum-computing/embed/#?secret=4OLnSxMVKZ" data-secret="4OLnSxMVKZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Abe Asfaw, the global lead for Quantum Education and Open Science at IBM, told me that this is just the first of a series of planned quantum certifications.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve built is a multi-tiered developer certification,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;The first tier is what we&#8217;re releasing in this announcement and that tier gets developers introduced to how to work with quantum circuits. How do you use Qiskit [&#8230;] to build out a quantum circuit and how do you run it on a quantum computer? And once you run it on a quantum computer, how do you look at the results and how do you interpret the results? This sets the stage for the next series of certifications that we&#8217;re developing, which are then going to be attached to use cases that are being explored in optimization, chemistry and finance. All of these can now be sort of integrated into the developer workflow once we have enabled someone to show that they can work with quantum circuits.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131113" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131113" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png" alt="" width="637" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IBM</p></div></p>
<p>Asfaw stressed that IBM has focused on educating developers about quantum computing for quite a while now, in part because it takes some time to develop the skills and intuition to build quantum circuits. He also noted that the open-source Qiskit SDK has integrated a lot of the tools that developers need to work at both the circuit level &#8212; which is a bit closer to writing in C or maybe even assembly in the classical computing world &#8212; and at the application level, where a lot of that is abstracted away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to make it easy for someone who is currently developing, whether it&#8217;s in the cloud, whether it&#8217;s using Python, to be able to run these tools and integrate quantum computing into their workflow,&#8221; Asfaw said. &#8220;I think the hardest part, to be very honest, is just giving someone the comfort to know that quantum computing is real today and that you can work with quantum computers. It&#8217;s as easy as opening up a Jupyter notebook and writing some code in Python.&#8221;</p>
<div>He noted that IBM already often helps upskill developers (from its partner companies) who are interested in quantum computing. So far, though, this has been a very ad hoc process. With the new certification program, developers can now formally demonstrate their skills and show that they are in a position to utilize quantum computing in their workflow.</div>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome to The Station. A few items before we jump into the news.</p>
<p>Rebecca Bellan, who started writing for TechCrunch earlier this month, is going to be contributing to the micromobbin&#8217; section as part of her focus on e-bikes, scooters and other personal mobility vehicles. Reach out to her at <a href="mailto:rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com">rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> if you want to share some micro news or offer up a tip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<hr />
<p>Last week, I promised a new market maps article — those deep dives into slices of the transportation sector. The latest, written by Abigail Bassett, examines the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/automakers-suppliers-and-startups-see-growing-market-for-in-vehicle-ar-vr-applications/">business of augmented and virtual reality in vehicles</a>. This is an Extra Crunch story, which requires a subscription.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve shared here before, we&#8217;re bringing more transportation analysis to Extra Crunch. So far, we&#8217;ve had Mark Harris&#8217; article on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">solid state batteries</a> and Jason Plautz&#8217;s piece on the business of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/">MaaS transit</a>. This coming week we&#8217;ll have analysis on the market for second-life batteries.</p>

<p><strong>Lime</strong> rolled out several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/lime-launches-app-less-rides-and-no-fee-reservations-to-get-more-people-riding/">new app features</a> designed to get more people riding their ever-growing fleet of e-scooters. The micromobility company will make e-scooter rides available to new users who don&#8217;t have the app and aren&#8217;t particularly fussed to download it — whether it&#8217;s for personal reasons, commitment issues or lack of phone space. Instead, customers can just scan the QR code on the scooter and let Apple&#8217;s App Clips or Android&#8217;s Instant App do the work of payment. Lime says they&#8217;re already seeing impressive conversion rates for new riders coming to the scooters slowly through this coy method.</p>
<p>Lime also decided to do away with the fee for reserving vehicles for up to 10 minutes, a cost that developers say was not only unnecessary, but also restrictive &#8212; apparently, during tests, the percentage of people who used the reservation feature increased once the price dropped. And to make it just that much more convenient to hop off the subway and step onto a scooter, the Lime app will also highlight a path to the rider&#8217;s nearest scooter. Finally, riders now can go into dark mode on the app if they feel like it. Lime says this makes viewing the app at night easier on the eyes. And besides, all the other apps are doing it!</p>
<p><strong>Some other micromobility tidbits &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>British Columbia</strong> has approved <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bc-electric-scooter-e-scooter-pilot-project-vancouver">e-scooter pilot projects</a> in four cities within Metro Vancouver, as well as Kelowna and Vernon. Municipal governments put a call out for interested local jurisdictions last year, and these localities were among those that raised their hands. It&#8217;s still not clear which companies will be dropping their dockless e-scooters on the Canadian streets, but something tells me we&#8217;ll see many of the usual players.</p>
<p>In other policy-related news, Washington state is thinking about installing an <a href="https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2021/03/23/washington-legislature-holds-hearing-e-bike-tax-break-tuesday#.YF9IjrRKjeQ">e-bike tax break</a>. A state Senate committee will be holding a hearing this week on a bill that would make e-bikes exempt from the state&#8217;s 6.5% sales tax.</p>

<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">filed an IPO</a>, putting to rest months of speculation that the autonomous vehicle startup was going to take the trendy route to the public exchanges and merge with a special purpose acquisition company. The company did not SPAC, but instead took the traditional IPO route.</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s S-1 is a page turner. I&#8217;ll list a few of the items that popped out.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> TuSimple&#8217;s shares are largely held by Chinese investors. The company’s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc. with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group’s The Traton Group. TuSimple’s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.</p>
<p>Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.</p>
<p>While TuSimple has a large U.S. presence and a number of partnerships with U.S. companies, there&#8217;s no denying its Chinese ties.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ss5iYyGUej"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">Self-driving truck startup TuSimple files to go public</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Self-driving truck startup TuSimple files to go public&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/embed/#?secret=Ss5iYyGUej" data-secret="Ss5iYyGUej" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>2.</strong> At least one of TuSimple&#8217;s investors has caught the attention of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. TuSimple reveals in its S-1 that CFIUS is reviewing shares held by Sun Dream, which as I mentioned above is an affiliate of Sina Corporation. CFIUS will have 45 days to conduct a review of the Investment.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double the loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 million in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier. The company&#8217;s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.</p>
<p>The upshot: TuSimple has lost more than $307 million in the past three years, a figure that illustrates the kind of capital that the larger, well-funded autonomous vehicle companies are pouring through to try to commercialize the technology.</p>
<p>It makes me more confident than ever that other AV companies like Aurora will soon file to go public as well, either via the traditional path or through a SPAC merger.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Automotus</strong>, a curb management startup that uses video analytics, raised $1.2 million in a seed round last month led by Quake Capital, Techstars Ventures, Kevin Uhlenhaker (the co-founder and CEO at NuPark, which was acquired by Passport) and Baron Davis. More investors, including Ben Bear, Derrick Ko and Zaizhuang Cheng of micromobility company Spin, have piled on, bringing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/investors-feed-the-meter-for-curb-management-startup-automotus/">total raise to $2.3 million</a>, CEO Jordan Justus told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><strong>Baraja</strong>, Australian lidar maker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/australian-lidar-maker-baraja-collects-31m-b-round-to-illuminate-the-future-of-autonomy/">raised $31 million</a> in a Series B round led by Blackbird Ventures. Main Sequence Ventures, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Regal Funds Management, Perennial Value Management and InterValley Ventures also joined the round.</p>
<p>The company said the funds will be used to continue the deployment and development of its &#8220;unique and ingenious&#8221; imaging system. As Devin Coldewey explains in his article, Baraja&#8217;s lidar uses what the company calls Spectrum-Scan, letting physics do the hard work of directing the light. By passing its laser through a prism, different wavelengths of light go in different directions &#8212; and when it comes back, it takes the same path. Check his coverage of the company from CES last year, which lays it out in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Baton</strong>, a San Francisco-based startup that wants to set up drop zones for long-haul trucking companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/baton-raises-10-5m-to-create-drop-zones-where-truckers-can-hand-off-freight/">raised $10.5 million</a> in a Series A funding round, co-led by 8VC and Maersk Growth, the corporate venture arm of logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk. The company now has a post-money valuation of $50 million, co-founders Nate Robert and Andrew Berberick told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Prologis, Ryder, Lineage Logistics, Project44 CEO Jett McCandless, KeepTruckin&#8217; CEO Shoaib Makani, Clarendon Capital operating partner John Larkin, ISG founder Trace Haggard and Cooley LLC all participated in the round.</p>

<p><strong> Blacklane</strong>, the Berlin startup that provides on-demand black-car chauffeur service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/berlins-blacklane-raises-26m-to-expand-its-high-end-chauffeur-driven-sustainable-car-service/">closed a round of €22 million</a> ($26 million at current rates). Blacklane, which took a majority stake in Havn in February, said that it will be using this latest round of funding to continue expanding sustainable travel initiatives, and to continue expanding its existing business with more flexible options for riding.</p>
<p><strong>Flapper</strong>, an on-demand private aviation company based in Brazil, raised $2 million in a Series A round led by the aerospace-focused fund, Confrapar. Crowdfunding platform SMU and angel investor group Investidores.VC also participated, along with a number of foreign and local investors, including three undisclosed air taxi companies. The company has previously raised $1 million seed funding, led by Confrapar and ACE, Brazil&#8217;s largest accelerator.</p>
<p><strong>Gorillas</strong>, the Berlin-based grocery delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">raised $290 million</a> in Series B funding, at a valuation that surpasses $1 billion. The round was led by Coatue Management, DST Global and Tencent, with participation from Green Oaks, Fifth Wall and Dragoneer. Previous backer Atlantic Food Labs also followed on.</p>
<p><strong>Hoppin</strong>, the Canadian travel startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/hopper-raises-170m-and-partners-with-capital-one-on-a-new-cardholder-travel-booking-portal/">raised a $170 million</a> in a Series F round led by Capital One. The U.S. banks and credit card company is also coming on board as a strategic partner, to launch Capital One Travel, which is the first instantiation of Hopper&#8217;s new B2B platform, Hopper Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Woven Capital</strong>, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, kicked off its new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/">$800 million strategic fund</a> with an investment in autonomous delivery startup Nuro. Neither company shared the amount of the investment. We do know that Woven Capital&#8217;s contribution was part of Nuro&#8217;s $500 million Series C funding round, which was announced last November. Chipotle also invested in the round, which included funds managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., with participation from new investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC and Baillie Gifford.</p>

<p>Whew, the newsletter is a bit long already, so I&#8217;ll just mention a few other items worth noting this week.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM, seems to be trying to appeal to the youths by creating an influencer-esque personality out of one of its vehicles. &#8220;Poppy,&#8221; who identifies with she/her pronouns <a href="https://twitter.com/poppytheav/status/1374787346395058178">according to her Twitter bio</a>, debuted her first post Wednesday, sharing a TikTok video that shows her riding around the streets of San Francisco. Cruise began testing its self-driving car on the Bay Area streets in December.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is how much fun weeee have driving in San Francisco. <a href="https://t.co/3lpWC66PSB">pic.twitter.com/3lpWC66PSB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Poppy the AV (@poppytheav) <a href="https://twitter.com/poppytheav/status/1374787346395058178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><strong> Plus</strong> will be part of a pilot project with SF Express that aims to demonstrate how trucks with an automated driving system can improve logistics operations. Plus is running its supervised autonomous trucks on two long-haul routes in China.</p>
<p><strong>Yandex</strong> published <a href="https://medium.com/yandex-self-driving-car/10-million-kilometers-in-challenging-conditions-d1d0045e5df0">a blog post</a> with details on its autonomous vehicles development in Russia. The company said it recently passed 6 million miles of testing, with one-third of that mileage driven in Russian winter conditions. The blog describes how it uses neural networks to filter snow out of the lidar point cloud and handle condensation clouds created by car exhaust and heating vents, among other challenges.</p>
<h3>Electric</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>BMW Group</strong> and California utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are rolling out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/bmw-and-pge-team-up-to-prepare-the-electric-grid-for-millions-of-evs/">next phase of a pilot</a> that aims to test — and learn — how electric vehicles could support the integration of renewable energy on the electric grid.</p>
<p><strong>Electric vehicle manufacturers</strong> are pushing back against a decision by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/ev-makers-oppose-delay-to-automotive-emissions-penalty-increase/">delay penalty increases</a> for automakers who fail to meet fuel efficiency standards. Tesla has taken the most active role and petitioned the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to review the ruling, saying that the delay &#8220;inflicts ongoing, irreparable injury&#8221; on the company and creates an &#8220;uneven playing field&#8221; by reducing the consequences of nonadherence.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HgY06sYLuv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/ev-makers-oppose-delay-to-automotive-emissions-penalty-increase/">EV makers oppose delay to automotive emissions penalty increase</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Geely Automobile Holdings</strong> is launching a new brand of premium electric vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/chinese-automaker-geely-launches-luxury-ev-brand-zeekr/">called Zeekr</a>. The vehicles will be manufactured by parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. The first Zeekr vehicles are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Jeep</strong> has partnered with Electrify America to create the Jeep 4xe Charging Network. Jeep-branded EV charging stations will be installed at or near the trailheads of Jeep Badge of Honor off-road trails over the next year. Jeep 4xe charging stations are scheduled to open this spring at three of the most-popular off-road sites and icons for the Jeep brand: Moab, Utah as well as the Rubicon Trail and Big Bear, both of which are in California. (Sorta reminds me of the Rivian adventure network.)</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> has been <a href="https://www.autonews.com/legal-file/illinois-dealers-sue-rivian-lucid-motors-and-state-over-direct-sales">sued by Illinois car dealers</a> over its direct-to-consumer sales model.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">accepting bitcoin</a> (at least for customers in the U.S.).</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing and sharing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> is being challenged in the U.K. for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/">using facial recognition technology</a> for a driver identity system. The App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union and the Worker Info Exchange have called for Microsoft to suspend the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s use of B2B facial recognition after finding multiple cases where drivers were misidentified and went on to have their license to operate revoked by Transport for London.</p>
<p><strong>Via</strong> partnered with southeast Michigan&#8217;s public transit authority (known as SMART) to launch an on-demand public transit service in the Detroit Metro area. The on-demand public transit service, called SMART Flex, will act as a complement and extension to the existing transit system in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;There is no doubt that over time, people are going to rely less and less on passwords&#8230; they just don&#8217;t meet the challenge for anything you really want to secure,&#8221; said Bill Gates.</p>
<p>That was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gates-the-password-is-dead/">17 years ago</a>. Although passwords have lost some of their charm, they have so far survived many attempts to kill them for good.</p>
<p>The perception of high cost and tricky implementations has stalled some smaller businesses from ditching passwords. But alternatives to passwords are affordable, easy to implement and safer, show industry insights gathered by Extra Crunch. The move to zero trust systems is acting as a catalyst.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, a primer. Zero trust focuses on who you are, not where you are. Zero trust models require companies to never trust any attempt to access its network, and must verify every single time — even from logins from inside the network. Passwordless tech is a key part of zero trust models.</p>
<p>There are several alternatives for passwords, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biometric authentication:</strong> widely used as fingerprint readers in smartphones and physical verification points at buildings;</li>
<li><strong>Social media authentication:</strong> where you use your Google or Facebook IDs to authenticate you with a third-party service;</li>
<li><strong>Multi-factor authentication:</strong> where more layers of authentication are added using devices or services, such as token authentication using a trusted device;</li>
<li><strong>Grid authentication cards:</strong> which provide access while using a combination PIN;</li>
<li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> which are usually sent to the user’s smartphones or encrypted devices;</li>
<li><strong>Digital certificates:</strong> cryptographic files stored locally on the machine or device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wolt, a Finnish food-delivery site, is just one example of going passwordless.</p>
<p>“The user registers by entering their email address or a phone number. Login to the app takes place by clicking the temporary link in the user’s inbox. The app on the user’s mobile phone places an authentication cookie, which enables the user to continue from that device without having to go through any further authentication,&#8221; said Erka Koivunen, CISO at F-Secure.</p>
<p>In this case, the service provider is in full control of the authentication, allowing it to set expiration time, revoke service and detect fraud. The service provider does not need to count on the user’s commitment to keep track of their passwords.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Axis Security raises $32M to help companies stay secure while working from home&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/axis-security-raises-32m-to-help-companies-stay-secure-while-working-from-home/embed/#?secret=NHRbJnB2bK" data-secret="NHRbJnB2bK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Passwordless tech is not inherently costly but may take some adjustment, explained <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ryan Weeks, CISO at managed service provider Datto.</span></p>
<p>“It is not necessarily costly in terms of monetary investment, because there are a lot of easily accessible open-source alternatives for multi-factor authentication that don’t require any sort of investment,&#8221; said Weeks. But some companies believe passwordless tech may cause friction to their employees&#8217; productivity.</p>
<p>Koivunen also dismissed that zero trust models are unaffordable for startups.</p>
<p>“Zero trust recognises the futility of forcing users to authenticate themselves by presenting something they should keep as secret. Instead, it prefers to establish the user’s identity using some context-aware method,” he said.</p>
<p>Zero trust goes further than authenticating users; it also includes the device and the user.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a zero trust perspective, there is an idea that there is a continuous authentication or revalidation of trust occurring. Therefore, passwordless in a zero trust model is potentially easier for the user and more secure as the combination of the &#8216;something you have&#8217; and &#8216;something you are&#8217; factors are more difficult to attack,&#8221; said Datto&#8217;s Weeks.</p>
<p>Larger companies, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/windows-10-will-soon-get-passwordless-logins-with-yubicos-security-key/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/google-cloud-unveils-new-identity-tools-based-on-zero-trust-framework/">Google</a>, already offer zero trust technologies. But investors are also eyeing smaller companies that offer zero trust for growing companies.</p>
<p>Axis Security, a zero trust provider that allows remote employees to access their company&#8217;s network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/axis-security-raises-32m-to-help-companies-stay-secure-while-working-from-home/">raised $32 million</a> last year. Beyond Identity <a href="https://www.beyondidentity.com/news/beyond-identity-raises-75-million">raised $75 million</a> in funding in December. And Israel identity validation startup Identiq <a href="https://www.identiq.com/blog/identiq-series-a-funding-round">raised $47 million</a> in Series A funding in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese ride-hailing company DiDi Chuxing has started operations in South Africa today, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-didi-chuxing-south-africa-idUSKBN2BL08X">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the Beijing based company operates in more than 400 cities in China. It claims to serve over 550 million users in 16 countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Australia.</p>
<p>This South African expansion (first launch in Cape Town) marks its first presence in Africa and seventeenth active country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the company&#8217;s <a href="https://za.didiglobal.com/about-us/">website</a> announcing the launch:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DiDi South Africa understands the challenges communities and the transportation industry face with the evolution of urban mobility (rideshare) and as a result is committed to creating the freedom and convenience to go places, open up horizons and give access to new experiences through our platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our mission is driven by a dedicated team who understand the operational landscapes of the rideshare industry. DiDi exists to help South Africans move freely and to unlock their potential and that of the cities they live in.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Although the nine-year-old company claims to understand how the ride-sharing industry works, the South African market, despite being a relatively stable environment with high economic potential compared to the rest of Africa, is a different ball game entirely.</p>
<p>While Uber and Bolt dominate with a few million users, they regularly face regulatory challenges from the government, which feels the need to protect traditional metered taxis in the country. DiDi wouldn&#8217;t be exempt from this, but the timing to expand to South Africa suggests the company is looking to explore the present challenges facing Uber as its drivers push for worker rights.</p>
<p>After Uber announced that it would concede employment rights to its U.K. drivers, SA drivers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/some-uber-and-bolt-drivers-have-embarked-on-a-two-day-strike-over-fees-and-safety-2021-3">trying to get the same treatment</a> by filing a class-action suit against the U.S. company in collaboration with British law firm Leigh Day and Johannesburg-based Mbuyisa Moleele Attorneys.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber says it will treat UK drivers as workers in wake of Supreme Court ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/embed/#?secret=zmoynggrlF" data-secret="zmoynggrlF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With South Africa, DiDi currently has interests either by expansion or investments all over the world.</p>
<p>In 2018, DiDi acquired Brazilian ride-hailing company 99 and now claims to have 50% of the ride-hailing market share in South America. In its most dominant market, China, DiDi has almost 80% market share after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">buying out Uber China</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>The company, whose backers <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-dache#/entity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Alibaba, Apple, DST, SoftBank and Tencent, also has its claws in different ride-hailing companies in markets where it doesn&#8217;t operate &#8212; Grab (Southeast Asia), Lyft (U.S.) and Ola (India). All these companies compete with Uber in their respective markets.</p>
<p>But having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/chinas-didi-invests-in-taxify/">invested in Bolt</a> as well, South Africa represents the second market after Russia, where DiDi will be going head to head with the Estonian-based company. The pair will also compete against one another when DiDi <a href="https://uk.didiglobal.com/">begins operations in the U.K.</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/chinese-ride-sharing-giant-didi-plans-entry-into-western-europe">Bloomberg</a> in February.</p>
<p>These expansion plans are geared toward increasing the SoftBank-backed company&#8217;s value (currently at $62 billion) for a potential mega-IPO of $100 billion later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston Dynamics’ transition from a decades-long research robotics firm to a company that productizes and sells hardware has been a fascinating one to watch. There have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/mschf-mounted-a-remote-control-paintball-gun-to-spot/">some tough lessons along the way</a>, including the very real lesson that at the end of the day, most robots in the world will be deployed for mundane tasks.</p>
<p>Sure, the company will continue to court the public with fun viral videos of its technology dancing to the oldies, but when it comes to actually selling robotics, the targets continue to be the dull, dirty and dangerous jobs we humans just don’t want to do. Or, as I’ve been putting it for a while now, robotics are &#8212; more often than not &#8212; cool technology performing decidedly uncool tasks.</p>
<p>Spot has found most of its success as an inspection robot. The quadruped has been deployed to oil rigs, nuclear plants and other places where most people would rather limit their time, given a choice. That takes care of the dangerous part of the three Ds, and you could make a reasonable argument that the company’s second commercially available robot is going after the dull bit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2130946" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130946" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2130946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/STRETCH-TRUCK-UNLOAD_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.2021-03-26-16_47_15.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>I’m guessing you don’t need me to cite a bunch of statistics about how massive an industry shipping and logistics is. And with so many orders moving online, things are only growing. There’s a reason, after all, so many robotics companies &#8212; including Locus, Fetch and Berkshire Grey &#8212; are devoting their entire operation to this sort of automation. As the CEO of Locus told me recently, everyone is looking for the technology that will help them compete with Amazon and its massive robotics army.</p>
<p>Stretch (currently a prototype) is the long-promised commercial version of Handle, a robot the company introduced via viral YouTube video a little over four years ago. In its earliest form, the wheeled robot was an extremely versatile robot with an impressive ability to maintain balance while gliding and taking on different obstacles. The robot also picked up a 100-pound crate. Little did we realize at the time that would become the foundational element of its future evolution.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYUuWWnfRsk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In fact, Handle’s box lifting dates back even further, to a video featuring the company’s humanoid robot, Atlas. “We showed some box moving, among other things. And it got a lot of interest from people in warehouses,” Boston Dynamics VP of Product Engineering Kevin Blankespoor tells TechCrunch. “They actually wanted Atlas to come work for them. We really thought we could design a much more simple robot that could tackle a warehouse task. There’s where Handle was born. It really split off of the Atlas project at that point.”</p>
<p>Blankespoor says Handle was born out of the company’s long-standing desire to combine wheels with legs, forming the basis of some early experimentation with designing a robot that could help move objects in a warehouse setting.</p>

<p>“We started experimenting with customers with Handle in warehouses. He did a couple of different tasks. The first was unloading pallets, which was pretty good. The second application was unloading trucks. Handle could do that, but it did it pretty slowly. It’s a tight space, it had to maneuver a lot and it was too slow.”</p>
<p>A 2019 video titled, “Handle Robot Reimagined for Logistics,” shows the wheeled robot outfitted with a large top-mounted arm and a gripper comprised of a series of suction cups. In the video, a pair of robots work in tandem, moving boxes from one pallet to another. But images of Stretch showcase how dramatically Boston Dynamics has rethought the robot in order to make it commercially viable.</p>

<p>Most immediately apparent is the loss of Handle’s two large wheels. In their place is a large black platform. “The mobile base is in the bottom,” Blankespoor says. “It is designed to be the size of a pallet, so it can maneuver wherever a pallet can in the warehouse.”</p>
<p>The unit still has wheels, though they’re far less prominent. The two wheels are now four, hidden under the corners of the base. They move in any direction, allowing for a broad range of movement and relatively tight turns for a robot of its size. Also included is a “perception mast” to the side of the arm, effectively serving as the unit’s eyes for autonomous movement and picking.</p>

<p>The robot was designed by Boston Dynamics’ warehouse division &#8212; now numbering around 100 people. That includes those employees the company picked up as part of its Kinema Systems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/boston-dynamics-acquires-a-3d-vision-startup-in-bid-to-put-its-robots-to-work/">acquisition</a>, back in 2019. The San Francisco-based company’s 3D vision technology has been incorporated here, as well, to improve Stretch’s picking.</p>
<p>Early applications include truck unloading and order building (effectively combining goods onto a single pallet). Future applications include truck loading, as well, though this is still early stages for the tech. The nature of the system is more plug and play than ground-up automation from companies like Berkshire-Grey. The company is also working to make it compatible with other warehouse systems.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics plans to build the first units over the summer and will make Stretch available for sale next year. The company’s not ready to talk pricing yet, but Blankespoor says it will be “comparable to a traditional robotic system that you see in factories where you have the robot bolted to the floor.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, a new VC firm based in Paris that just finished raising its initial fund. The firm was founded by two former Alven partners — Raffi Kamber and Jérémy Uzan. They have some ambitious goals and an interesting investment model that could help them remain involved even during late-stage rounds. Overall, the firm raised €225 million, or $265 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>
<p>If you browse Singular’s website, you’re not going to find a lot of information. Here’s what it looked like last week before the team added a list of portfolio companies:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130898" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130898" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2130898" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png" alt="" width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png 2200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=1536,965 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=2048,1287 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Singular</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Singular team doesn’t want to be secretive. But they don’t like talking about themselves. That’s why you may have seen Singular’s name in a few articles I wrote over the past few months. But now it’s time to talk a bit about what the firm has in mind when it comes to startup investment.</p>
<p>Jérémy Uzan and Raffi Kamber spent 11 and eight years at Alven, respectively. They’ve been behind some of the firm’s most successful investments, such as <a href="https://www.dataiku.com">Dataiku</a> (with Nicolas Celier, who sourced the deal then handed over Alven&#8217;s board seat to Raffi Kamber) and <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/">OpenClassrooms</a>. “But every time you raise another fund, you sign up for a long time,” Uzan told me.</p>
<p>The duo left Alven quite naturally as they felt it was time in their careers to take their destiny in their own hands. There’s no hard feeling with their previous fund.</p>
<p>It was the right timing personally, but also the right timing for the tech ecosystem. While Singular is based in Paris, the firm plans to build a true European VC firm with its headquarters in Paris. Singular doesn’t think London should be the center of gravity for European tech investment.</p>
<p>Singular started fundraising in late 2019 and early 2020. Kamber and Uzan didn’t know anything about raising a fund and didn’t work with an external financial firm to handle the fundraising effort.</p>
<p>When asked about the coronavirus pandemic and the impact on the process, they both said the lockdown actually helped, as everyone was stuck at home. Around two-thirds of the limited partners that invested in Singular are based outside of France.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8lehi9xZqh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/does-your-vc-have-an-investment-thesis-or-a-hypothesis/">Does your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Does your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/does-your-vc-have-an-investment-thesis-or-a-hypothesis/embed/#?secret=8lehi9xZqh" data-secret="8lehi9xZqh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“These are historic VC investors. They really believe in tech — and Europe too. They have seen that Europe has been taking off for the past two or three years,” Kamber told me.</p>
<p>Just like a startup, Singular wanted to be backed by some well-known investors. And some of those investors are injecting money in a French VC fund for the first time. Limited partners include a mix of pension funds, funds of funds, sovereign funds and family offices.</p>
<p>Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Bpifrance, Vintage Investment Partners, Axa Venture Partners, Sofina, MACSF and Mubadala Capital are some of Singular’s backers. Unless you’ve raised a VC fund in the past, you may discover some of those names for the first time. And yet, these investors are significant. For instance, while you might not be familiar with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, they have over $200 billion in net assets.</p>
<p>Singular started closing investment deals around October 2020. So far, the company has invested in six different startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">Series B round</a> in Gtmhub, an OKR management service</li>
<li>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/accounting-automation-startup-geroges-raises-42-4-million-and-rebrands-to-indy/">Series B round</a> in Indy, an accounting automation software suite</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soda-raises-11-5m-series-a-funding-to-bring-everyone-closer-to-data-301219427.html">Series A round</a> in <a href="https://www.soda.io">Soda</a>, an enterprise-grade data monitoring platform</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soda-raises-11-5m-series-a-funding-to-bring-everyone-closer-to-data-301219427.html">seed round</a> in Moka.care, a mental health solution for employees</li>
<li>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/resilience-is-an-ambitious-bet-to-improve-cancer-treatment/">seed round</a> in Resilience, a full-stack software approach to improve cancer treatment</li>
<li>Another undisclosed Series A round</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to find some common trends around this list of investments, but I’m going to help you. First, let’s start with the average check size.</p>
<p>“We are mostly focused on Series A/B because we think there’s a lot of room to grow at that stage,” Kamber said. And Singular can invest as much as €20 million in a single round ($23.6 million at today’s exchange rate).</p>
<p>When it comes to verticals, Singular openly says that it doesn’t want to focus on a specific area in particular. “We are a generalist fund and we are quite opportunistic,” Uzan said. Singular doesn’t want to choose between B2B and consumer, between AI and e-commerce, etc.</p>
<p>Where Singular stands out is that it has a unique approach to late-stage rounds. When a portfolio company reaches the Series C or Series D stage, Singular might not have enough money under management for infinite follow-on investments.</p>
<p>The VC firm didn’t want to raise its own late-stage fund. So Singular will be able to structure special-purpose investment vehicles with its limited partners. A few limited partners could put some money in this investment vehicle directly and the startup could accept to raise a new round with this new investment vehicle instead of a late-stage fund.</p>
<p>This way, Singular remains very much involved with the portfolio company in question. It could keep a board seat and have a say when it comes to the startup’s next phases.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to see how it would work in real life and it’s going to happen on a case-by-case basis. But the fact that Singular can offer that kind of investment is significant — it could be appealing for some entrepreneurs. You don’t have to accept it and you’re not tied with Singular forever, but the offer is on the table.</p>
<p>So that’s Singular — Eva Mayoud, Alexandre Flamant and Sonia Pélisson also joined the team. It’s not that often that a French VC firm starts from zero and raises a €225 million fund in a year. It’s going to be interesting to track the firm’s upcoming investments. In the meantime, here’s some TechCrunch coverage of Singular’s past deals:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cazoo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cazoo</a>, the UK used-car sales portal that has been on a major fundraising tear in the last year, will be next company to pursue more growth by way of a SPAC: the company today announced that it will list on the NYSE by way of a business combination with AJAX I, a special purpose acquisition vehicle founded by hedge fund supremo Dan Och in partnership with Glenn Fuhrman and others.</p>
<p>The deal values Cazoo at $7 billion and will also include an extra $1.6 billion in new financing: $805 million cash from AJAX I itself and an $800 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investment_in_public_equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIPE</a> led by the AJAX sponsors and Cazoo backer D1 Capital Partners, with a mix of new and previous investors also participating, including Altimeter, BlackRock, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Fidelity Management, Marcho Partners, Mubadala Capital, Pelham Capital, Senator Investment Group and Spruce House Partnership. The deal has already been approved by the boards of Cazoo and AJAX I.</p>
<p>&#8220;This announcement is another major milestone in our continued drive to transform the way people buy cars across Europe,&#8221; said Alex Chesterman OBE, Cazoo&#8217;s founder and CEO in a statement. “We have created the most comprehensive and fully integrated offering in the largest retail sector which currently has very low digital penetration. This deal will provide us with almost $1 billion of further funds to fuel our growth and I am delighted to be partnering with Dan and his team at AJAX to rapidly expand and deliver the best car buying experience to consumers across Europe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chesterman &#8212; who already had a high profile before founding Cazoo (he had also founded LoveFilm, acquired by Amazon and used as the first step in its move into building its Netflix competitor, Amazon Prime Video; and the property sales site Zoopla) &#8212; will remain CEO of the company.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds of this to continue expanding across Europe after a bumper year. It said it saw sales grow by over 300% and is on track for 2021 revenues to approach $1 billion, with annual run rate revenues of $600 million in the first quarter with a business model based mostly around used-car sales but also diversifying, for example with a car subscription service.</p>
<p>Cazoo&#8217;s deal is a clear marker of how ubiquitous SPACs have become as an option for privately-held companies with a lot of money already on their cap tables to take the next step short of a more classic IPO on their own steam &#8212; a lengthy process that might not fit their financials or time constraints &#8212; or getting acquired. It&#8217;s also a sign of how companies based outside of the U.S. are also taking this route to list in on the country&#8217;s public markets, which in the case of Cazoo will give it access to a wider group of investors than listing in the U.K. would have done.</p>
<p>It shows some leverage on the part of investors to bring in their own financing and strategic control to direct the companies as more than just financial backers, and indeed Dan Och will be joining Cazoo&#8217;s board.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to partner with Alex and the exceptional team at Cazoo. Alex has proven to be one of Europe’s most successful serial entrepreneurs and we are proud to be supporting the growth of this world-class team, brand and platform,&#8221; said Ochs in a statement. &#8220;With their constant focus on innovation, data and customer satisfaction, I have no doubt that Cazoo is going to continue to lead the way in this massive, untapped market opportunity and am looking forward to joining the Board of Cazoo and working with Alex and his team.”</span></p>
<p>But it also represents another way for them to get in on what appear to be strong businesses in the long term, at a time when technology continues to be a huge business opportunity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a long-term investor in Cazoo and believer in its leadership team, we are pleased to continue supporting Cazoo&#8217;s growth as a public company,&#8221; said Daniel Sundheim, the founder of D1 Capital Partners, in a statement. &#8220;While Cazoo had many options for funding its strategy, its decision to merge with AJAX and join with Dan Och and other renowned partners was a good one that will have positive implications for the company and its future.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of Cazoo, the company has been in the right place at the right time, it seems.</p>
<p>In a Covid-19 pandemic year where people stayed away from in-person shopping in the the UK &#8212; and, also to reduce contact with others, opted to use their own private vehicles rather than public or liveried transportation to get around &#8212; Cazoo sold and delivered 20,000 cars over its digital platform.</p>
<p>Cazoo plans to expand both that sales portal and other businesses lines, such as a car subscription service it runs, which currently has 6,000+ subscribers in the UK, Germany and France. The company was founded in 2018 and in the midst of the pandemic last year raised $427 million in funding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/cazoo-the-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-116m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first $116 million in March 2020</a> and then a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further $311 million in October</a>. The latter round valued Cazoo at just over $2.5 billion, meaning that this latest SPAC represents a big price hike.</p>
<p>SPACs have quickly become a well-trodden alternative as the number of startups that have already raised a lot of money from private backers continues to multiply. In a few cases SPACs have come after testing the waters for IPOs did not go anywhere fast: witness WeWork last week announcing a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-agrees-to-spac-deal-that-would-take-startup-public-11616752804?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9 billion SPAC</a> last week, coming on the heels of a major restructuring after its attempt to IPO in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/wework-files-confidentially-for-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> valued at $47 billion ended up in flames.</p>
<p>Others represent exit options for companies that have been around for years but haven&#8217;t fit the bill for a more traditional IPO. eToro, a 14 year-old Israeli trading platform that has been doubling down on digital and crypto currencies, earlier this month also announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merger with a SPAC valuing it at $10.4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Others (and it seems Cazoo falls into this third category) are using them as a faster way of listing publicly and fundraising through those channels to bypass some of the longer and expensive processes of a more standard IPO. Grab, southeast Asia&#8217;s big on-demand rides provider that has expanded into a plethora of other services as a &#8220;super app&#8221;, is also reportedly <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2021/southeast-asias-grab-mulls-public-filing-in-us-via-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering a SPAC</a> to speed up its plans to publicly list in the U.S.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while billions in valuations continue to be created through these and many more SPACs that have hit the market, it remains to be seen how SPAC&#8217;d companies will fare longer term on the public markets, and specifically whether those public market investors prove to be as as interested in backing these highly-scaling but perhaps not profitable (yet?) models longer term, as those private investors were when they put in hundreds of millions for shorter-term gains. (And of course it also remains to be seen what direction these companies will now take as public entities.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week the Canadian Supreme Court<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56526115"> ruled that the national government&#8217;s plan to tax carbon emissions was legal</a> in a decision that could have significant implications for the nation&#8217;s climate-focused startup companies.</p>
<p>The ruling put an end to roughly two years of legal challenges and could set the stage for a boom in funding and commercial support for Canadian startup companies developing technologies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, according to investors and entrepreneurs representing some of the world&#8217;s largest utilities and petrochemical companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high price on carbon has the potential to make Canada a powerhouse for scaling up breakthrough decarbonization technologies and for deploying solutions like carbon capture, industrial electrification, and hydrogen electrolysis,&#8221; said one investor who works with a fund that backs startups on behalf of large energy businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This 2018 Greenhouse Gas Pricing Act is the cornerstone of the Canadian climate policy pushed through by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It establishes minimum pricing standards that all provinces have to meet but gives the provinces the ability to set higher prices. So far, seven of the nation&#8217;s 13 provinces are currently paying the &#8220;backstop&#8221; rate set by the national government.</p>
<p>That price is C$30 per tonne of carbon dioxide released, but is set to rise to C$170 per tonne by 2030. That figure is just a bit higher than the current prices that Californians are charged under the state&#8217;s carbon pricing plan and roughly four times the price on carbon set by the Northeastern Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>

<p>Under the plan, much of the money raised through the tax levied by the Canadian government would be used to support projects and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or create more sustainable approaches to industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Climate change is real. It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, and it poses a grave threat to humanity&#8217;s future,&#8221; Chief Justice Richard Wagner wrote, on behalf of the majority, in the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<div class="ssrcss-1pzprxn-BulletListContainer e5tfeyi3">
<p>Three provinces &#8212; Alberta, Ontario, and Saskatchewan challenged the legality of the greenhouse gas policy, and Alberta&#8217;s challenge was allowed to proceed to the high court &#8212; holding up the national implementation of the pricing scheme.</p>
<p>With the roadblocks removed, entrepreneurs and investors around the world expect the carbon scheme to quickly boost the prospects of Canadian startups.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This represents underlying government support and a huge pot of money. If you wanted macro support for an underlying shift in sectoral developments that could substantiate and support tech companies working on climate change mitigation what better then when the government has told you that we care about this and money is free?&#8221; said BeZero Carbon founder, Tommy Ricketts. &#8220;There couldn’t be a better condition for startups in Canada.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Companies that stand to directly benefit from a carbon tax in Canada include businesses like Kanin Energy, which develops decarbonization projects, including waste heat to power; CERT, which is currently competing in the carbon Xprize and is working on a way to convert carbon dioxide to ethylene; and SeeO2, a company also working on carbon dioxide conversion technologies.</p>
<p>Geothermal technologies like Quaise and Eavor could also see a boost as will companies that focus on the electrification of the transportation industry in Canada.</p>
<p>Farther afield are the companies like Planetary Hydrogen, which combines hydrogen production and carbon capture in a way that also contributes to ocean de-acidification.</p>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Think about the gas at the pump. That is going to get charged extra,&#8221; said one investor who works for the venture arm of one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, who was not authorized to speak to the press.  &#8220;For cleaner energy the price will definitely be reduced. And think about where this tax is going. Most of the tax is going to go to government funding into cleantech or climate-tech companies. So you have a double boost for startups in the carbon footprint reduction area.&#8221;</span></p>
