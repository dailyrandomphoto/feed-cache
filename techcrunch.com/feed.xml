										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch will start holding its streamers to a higher standard. The company just expanded its hate and harassment policy, specifying more kinds of bad behavior that break its rules and could result in a ban from the streaming service.</p>
<p>The news comes as Twitch continues to grapple with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">reports of abusive behavior and sexual harassment,</a> both on the platform and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">within the company itself</a>. In December, Twitch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/"> released an updated set of rules</a> designed to take harassment and abuse more seriously, admitting that women, people of color the and LGBTQ community were impacted by a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; amount of that toxic behavior on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s policies now include serious offenses that could pose a safety threat, even when they happen entirely away from the streaming service. Those threats include violent extremism, terrorism, threats of mass violence, sexual assault and ties to known hate groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also continue to evaluate off-platform behavior in cases that happen on Twitch, like an on-stream situation that leads to harassment on Twitter or Facebook.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/embed/#?secret=UAdcAuoydV" data-secret="UAdcAuoydV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;While this policy is new, we have taken action historically against serious, clear misconduct that took place off service, but until now, we didn’t have an approach that scaled,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, adding that investigating off-platform behavior requires additional resources to address the complexity inherent in those cases.</p>
<p>To handle reports for its broadened rules, Twitch created a dedicated email address (OSIT@twitch.tv) to handle reports about off-service behavior. The company says it has partnered with a third party investigative law firm to vet the reports it receives.</p>
<p>Twitch cites its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/"> actions against former President Donald Trump</a> as the most high profile instance of off-platform behavior resulting in enforcement. The company disabled Trump&#8217;s account following the attack on the U.S. Capitol and later suspended him indefinitely, citing fears that he could use the service to incite violence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to have a higher profile than the president, but Trump isn&#8217;t the only big time banned Twitch user. Last June, Twitch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">kicked one of its biggest streamers off of the platform</a> without providing an explanation for the decision.</p>
<p>Going on a year later, no one seems to know why Dr. Disrespect got the boot from Twitch, though the company&#8217;s insistence that it only acts in cases with a &#8220;preponderance of evidence&#8221; suggests his violations were serious and well-corroborated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> today announced it was expanding its platform into a couple of new areas. Up to this point, the company has been known for its identity access management product, giving companies the ability to sign onto multiple cloud products with a single sign on. Today, the company is moving into two new areas: privileged access and identity governance</p>
<p>Privileged access gives companies the ability to provide access on an as-needed basis to a limited number of people to key administrative services inside a company. This could be your database or your servers or any part of your technology stack that is highly sensitive and where you want to tightly control who can access these systems.</p>
<p>Okta CEO Todd McKinnon says that Okta has always been good at locking down the general user population access to cloud services like Salesforce, Office 365 and Gmail. What these cloud services have in common is you access them via a web interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Administrators access the speciality accounts using different protocols. &#8220;It&#8217;s something like secure shell, or you&#8217;re using a terminal on your computer to connect to a server in the cloud, or it&#8217;s a database connection where you&#8217;re actually logging in with a SQL connection, or you&#8217;re connecting to a container which is the Kubernetes protocol to actually manage the container,&#8221; McKinnon explained.</p>
<p>Privileged access offers a couple of key features including the ability to limit access to a given time window and to record a video of the session so there is an audit trail of exactly what happened while someone was accessing the system. McKinnon says that these features provide additional layers of protection for these sensitive accounts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LMl67AHZcj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/okta-covid-19-app-usage-report-finds-its-not-just-collaboration-seeing-a-huge-uptick/">Okta COVID-19 app usage report finds it&#8217;s not just collaboration seeing a huge uptick</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta COVID-19 app usage report finds it&#8217;s not just collaboration seeing a huge uptick&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/okta-covid-19-app-usage-report-finds-its-not-just-collaboration-seeing-a-huge-uptick/embed/#?secret=LMl67AHZcj" data-secret="LMl67AHZcj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He says that it will be fairly trivial to carve out these accounts because Okta already has divided users into groups and can give these special privileges to only those people in the administrative access group. The challenge was figuring out how to get access to these other kinds of protocols.</p>
<p>The governance piece provides a way for security operations teams to run detailed reports and look for issues related to identity. &#8220;Governance provides exception reporting so you can give that to your auditors, and more importantly you can give that to your security team to make sure that you figure out what&#8217;s going on and why there is this deviation from your stated policy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All of this when combined with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">the $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0 last month</a> is part of a larger plan by the company to be what McKinnon calls the identity cloud. He sees a market with several strategic clouds and he believes identity is going to be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because identity is so strategic for everything, it&#8217;s unlocking your customer, access, it&#8217;s unlocking your employee access, it&#8217;s keeping everything secure. And so this expansion, whether it&#8217;s customer identity with zero trust or whether it&#8217;s doing more on the workforce identity with not just access, but privileged access and identity governance. It&#8217;s about identity evolving in this primary cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While both of these new products were announced today at the company&#8217;s virtual Oktane customer conference, they won&#8217;t be generally available until the first quarter of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">Early Stage</a>, TechCrunch spoke with Zoom Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanazus/">Ryan Azus</a> about building an early-stage sales team. Azus is perhaps best known for leading the video-calling giant&#8217;s income arm during COVID-19, but his experience building RingCentral&#8217;s North American sales organization from the ground up made him the perfect guest to chat with about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>We asked him about when founders should step aside from leading their startup&#8217;s sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely, how to pick customer segments and how to build a playbook.</p>
<p>Below, TechCrunch has compiled a number of key comments from Azus, and afterward we&#8217;ve included the full video from the interview as well as a transcript. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<hr />
<h2>When should founders let others run sales?</h2>
<p>Nearly every startup leans on its CEO as its first salesperson. After all, who else knows the product and can talk it up like the startup&#8217;s leader? But having the CEO as point-person for sales scales poorly. So, when is the right time to have someone else step in?</p>
<blockquote><p>Fairly early on. First off, CEOs need to solve customer needs. And so it&#8217;s important to be very hands-on for a while to really understand while you&#8217;re trying to figure out product-market fit. And then bringing in some of those sales people as you start seeing something [good].</p>
<p>Part of it is also knowing what type of salesperson you need. [ … ] Who is your core audience? What persona are you going after? And trying to find people that know and understand selling something that&#8217;s primarily very transactional to small businesses, [or] e-commerce lead, or selling something that&#8217;s more enterprise &#8212; those are different animals, different segments that you&#8217;re going after. One mistake [startups make] is hiring the wrong type of salesperson.<em><strong> (Time stamp: 5:29)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2>How much product-market fit is enough?</h2>

<p>At the top of the list are a pair of e-bikes, produced by VanMoof. The S3 and X3 will sport tracking functionality, along with a “Locate with Apple Find My” logo located on the bottom side of the crossbar. Belkin’s Soundform Freedom earbuds, meanwhile, will join Apple’s iPods in sporting the feature, while the Chipolo ONE Spot will beat the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">long-rumored AirTags</a> to the punch.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the new products are set to hit the market next week. There are a bunch of different privacy concerns laid out by Apple in the white papers, along with other specifications companies will have to adhere to. Interestingly, among the prerequisites is that a device needs to be able to emit sound in order to use the functionality. That&#8217;s pretty straightforward for things like earbuds, but the also means that things like the e-bikes need to make a sounds specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Draft specs for chip makers will also be released in the spring, so companies can utilize the Ultra Wideband tech on Apple devices sporting a U1 chip. That should improve directional tracking, among other potential benefits. Approved products will be able to display the aforementioned “Works with Apple Find My” badge.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Eghosa Omoigui explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skillset that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building and maintaining a successful startup requires founders to see the entire playing field. Without that clear view, founders risk missteps when it comes to hiring, raising funds, launching a product or making an acquisition.</p>
<p>Essentially, any big decision can end in disaster if a founder loses perspective or lacks situational and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of <a href="http://www.echovc.com/">EchoVC Partners</a>, a seed and early-stage venture capital firm that serves underrepresented founders and underserved markets, has helped entrepreneurs navigate the first steps of starting a company and laying the right foundation early on.</p>
<p>Omoigui, who was previously director of consumer internet and semantic technologies at Intel Capital, advocates for founders to develop their own All-22 tape — a tool used by professional football coaches that allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach’s line of sight and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event.</p>
<p>Omoigui explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skillset that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>Before getting into the steps, it&#8217;s important to understand what the aim is. The upshot? For founders to have the best and most complete view of their company, team, investors, product and competitors.</p>
<p>For founders, that means being able to zoom out and see each of their employees’ points of view and being inclusive. Without an All-22 tape, founders can mistakenly spend too much on engineering while ignoring the product rollout strategy or forget to communicate with employees outside of their bubble of interest. A company can become fragmented as more blind spots emerge, which can ultimately lead to oversights that damage its reputation, operations or even its ability to raise money from investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>For operators and investors, what we see is usually very driven by where we stand, or where we sit. And what you have to discover really is: How can I get much better views? And the best view is always the plan view, you&#8217;re looking from the top down, you&#8217;re watching the movement, and you have line of sight, you know, that&#8217;s essentially 360 degrees. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 3:40)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Situational and self-awareness</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, has today launched its latest experiment, <a href="https://hotline.co/">Hotline</a>, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only.</p>
<p>Real estate investor <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup">Nick Huber</a> is the first to <a href="https://hotline.co/nick-huber-ama">publicly try out the product</a> with a livestream today that began at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET). Huber represents the sort of creator Facebook wants to work with for Hotline, Facebook told us, which is someone who helps people expand their professional skills or their finances. In Huber&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s talking about investing in industrial real estate as a second income stream.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Nick Huber (@sweatystartup) <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1379841706112253959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At Facebook, Hotline is being led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-hazzard-4013038/">Eric Hazzard</a>, who joined Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/">when it acquired his app tbh</a>, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app that grew to 2.5 million daily active users in nine weeks and saw over 1 billion poll answers before exiting. With Hotline, Hazzard is once again developing a product in the Q&amp;A space.</p>
<p>But this time, the new app is taking inspiration from an up-and-coming social network, Clubhouse. In fact, Hotline&#8217;s user interface will look familiar to anyone who&#8217;s already used Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces or any of the other audio-only social networks, when it&#8217;s viewed on mobile. At the top on mobile (or to the left side on desktop), there&#8217;s a speaker section where the event host is featured in a round profile icon or live video stream. Below (or to the side on desktop) are the event&#8217;s listeners.</p>
<p>But there are also several differences between Hotline and existing apps, like Clubhouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135237" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135237" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hotline-GIF.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>For starters, the app today has users sign in with Twitter then verify their identity via SMS.</p>
<p>The listeners&#8217; section, for example, is divided up between those who are just watching the event, as represented by their profile icons, and those who are asking questions. At the top of this section, you&#8217;re presented with the lists of questions that users have asked, which others can upvote or downvote accordingly. The creator can then look to this section to find out which questions to answer next and can pull listeners onto the stage area with them for a conversation.</p>
<p>At present, users can type in their questions, then join the host &#8220;on stage,&#8221; when it&#8217;s their turn. Currently, guests are represented by their profile icon and are audio only when on stage. But in the settings, there&#8217;s an option for the listener to toggle on video that&#8217;s not yet functional for today&#8217;s test.</p>
<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up.</p>

<p>Hosts have full control over the experience, and can remove inappropriate questions from the queue or remove people from their Hotline session. For the initial tests, Facebook employees will moderate events and remove anyone that violates Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJ30EgMPODDC-Aups2x0mJy8U5dg">Community Standards</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/terms.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsHqb8hN2BzLuSbS6bA7tB-ox1vA">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://m.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.facebook.com/policy.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHccirPpdR5TwwMLBGTxi7WDlHh4A">Data Policy</a> or the <a href="https://npe.facebook.com/supplement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://npe.facebook.com/supplement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETZ0N-JaxiACdVeb5ehVcPtC4FCg">NPE Team&#8217;s Supplemental Terms.</a></p>
<p>Another notable difference between Hotline and Clubhouse is that Hotline events are recorded.</p>
<p>Today, Clubhouse favors more casual chats where people understand there&#8217;s no transcript or recording taking place (unless indicated by the host in the room&#8217;s title). This, Clubhouse believes, allows participants to speak more freely and with less fear. But Hotline automatically produces recordings. After the event, the host will receive two recordings of the session &#8212; one as an mp3 and another as an mp4. The creator can then upload these to other networks, like YouTube or Facebook, edit them into short-form content for apps like TikTok or turn the audio recording into a podcast, or anything else.</p>
<p>At launch, anyone can join a Hotline for free and there&#8217;s no limit on audience size, though this could change as the experiment progresses.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities with Clubhouse, Hotline has a different vibe because of its use of video, text-based questions, upvoting and because it&#8217;s recorded. This makes it feel less like a casual hangout and more like a professional event where an expert is leading a session and inviting an audience to ask questions.</p>

<p>Hotline <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is now one of several apps that Facebook&#8217;s NPE team has launched in the creator space to experiment with different ideas around audio and video. The group is continuing to test </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/facebook-building-tool-to-let-fans-pay-celebrities-for-face-time">a creator app called Super</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, similar to Cameo, which is web-based and entirely video. It also previously tested </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-launches-catchup-an-audio-only-group-calling-app-that-shows-whos-ready-to-chat-now/">an audio-only calling app, CatchUp</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which shut down last year, as well as </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/facebook-takes-on-twitter-with-venue-a-second-screen-companion-for-live-events/">another Q&amp;A product known as Venue</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which is more of a Twitter-like companion for live events. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More recently, it has launched TikTok-esque video apps </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">Collab</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">BARS</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which focused on collaborative music and raps, respectively.  </span></p>
<p>Over time, the goal of NPE projects isn&#8217;t necessarily to stand them up on their own as individual apps &#8212; though that could happen, if they gained enough traction. More broadly, the learnings from the tests and experiments can help inform future Facebook product development, as it builds out new features for existing products, like Messenger Rooms or Facebook Live, among other things.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t make an official announcement about Hotline&#8217;s launch, but offered a statement about today&#8217;s test.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Hotline, we’re hoping to understand how interactive, live multimedia Q&amp;As can help people learn from experts in areas like professional skills, just as it helps those experts build their businesses,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;New Product Experimentation has been testing multimedia products like CatchUp, Venue, Collab, and BARS, and we’re encouraged to see the formats continue to help people connect and build community,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Hotline isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s only attempt to challenge Clubhouse. The company is also in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">developing a Clubhouse rival</a> within the Messenger Rooms product experience, Facebook recently confirmed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.kavak.com/">Kavak</a>, the Mexican startup that’s disrupted the used car market in Mexico and Argentina, today announced its Series D of $485 million, which now values the company at $4 billion. This round more than triples their previous valuation of $1.15 billion, which established them as a unicorn just a couple of months ago in October of 2020. Kavak is now one of the top five highest-valued startups in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by D1 Capital Partners, Founders Fund, Ribbit, and BOND, and brings Kavak’s total capital raised to date to more than $900 million. Kavak recently soft-launched in Brazil, and this new round of funding will be used to build out the Brazilian market and beyond, said Carlos García Ottati, Kavak’s CEO and Co-Founder. The company plans to do a full launch in Brazil in the next 60 days, García said, and we can expect to see Kavak in markets outside Latin America in the next 24 months, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were built to solve emerging market problems,” García said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak, which was founded in 2016, is an online marketplace that aims to bring transparency, security, and access to financing to the used car market. The company also offers its own financing through its fintech arm, Kavak Capital, and counts more than 2,500 employees and 20 logistics and reconditioning hubs in Mexico and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Latin America, 90% of the [used car] transactions are informal, which leads to a 40% fraud rate,” said García, who experienced these challenges first-hand when he moved to Mexico from Colombia a couple of years ago and bought a used car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My budget allowed me to buy a used car, but there was no infrastructure around it. It took me 6 months to buy the car, and then the car had legal and mechanical issues and I lost most of my money,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak buys cars from individuals, refurbishes them, and offers warranties to buyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of buying a new car, they can buy a better car that still has all the warranties. It’s a really aspirational process,” said García. The company, which really amounts to four companies in one given its areas of focus, was built to be comprehensive by design in order to meet the various gaps in the market, García said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re building a business here [Latin America], you need to build several businesses because so many things are broken,” he said. That&#8217;s why the financing option, for example, has been a key to their success, according to García.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financing has traditionally been hard to come by in Brazil, and as García said, the used car market lacks infrastructure there, too. That being said, Brazil is Latin America’s fintech hub, and the space has made leaps and bounds over the last 7-10 years with companies such as Nubank, PagSeguro, Creditas, PicPay, and others leading the way. As a result, credit cards and loans are more widely available today in the region, offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competition for Kavak Capital. While Kavak has localized some of its product for the Brazilian market — namely building out a Portuguese language version of the app and website — García said the markets are very similar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Brazil, you still have the same problems that you have in Mexico, but Brazil is a little more developed, especially in fintech, which is light years ahead of Mexico,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Brazilian product heading to the races, García said they already have plans for other regions, though he declined to name them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“80% of people in emerging markets don’t have access to a car,” García said of the global market size. “We want to go into big markets where customers are facing similar problems and where Kavak can really change their lives,” he added.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>My startup registered two H-1B candidates in this year’s lottery. Sadly, neither was selected. </strong></p>
<p><strong>One is my co-founder, the other is on OPT. Help! We can’t afford for them to have to leave the U.S. What are our options?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Lost in Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p>Dear Lost:</p>
<p>Take a deep breath; I’ve got your back. There are many creative immigration pathways for you, your co-founder and your <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/opt-optional-practical-training/">F-1 OPT</a> employee to explore. We’ll take a look at several options, and you can also check out my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/065-selected-or-not-selected-in-the-h-1b-lottery-now-what/">podcast</a> in which my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-zaidi-b3a40414/">Nadia Zaidi</a> and I explain them in greater depth.</p>
<p>I hope the below ideas inspire you and fill you with a sense of hope and possibility. As always, I suggest consulting with an experienced immigration attorney who can help you identify the strongest path forward, as well as backup options for your co-founder and employee. The particular immigration strategy that’s best for you is always an individual determination. It’s best identified through a personal consultation with an attorney such as myself based on a variety of factors, including each person’s immigration history and your particular startup’s goals.</p>
<h2>Co-founder immigration options</h2>
<p>For a funded startup, there’s a great H-1B Plan B: the Cap-Exempt H-1B. Especially if your co-founder has a STEM background (and possibly even for some founders who don’t have this), there’s a wonderful new triple-win option that supports startups, international candidates and even diverse U.S. STEM college students seeking better project-based learning opportunities.</p>
<p>What is this magical rainbow-striped unicorn option, you ask? Well, here’s the legal background: Some employers qualify to petition for an H-1B visa at any time without going through the lottery. These employers — called cap-exempt employers because they are not subject to the annual H-1B cap of 85,000 visas available to for-profit employers — include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Nonprofits tied to institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Nonprofit research organizations.</li>
<li>Government research organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your co-founder can get a part-time H-1B visa through one of these cap-exempt employers, your startup can concurrently sponsor your co-founder for an H-1B regardless of the recent lottery results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>To take advantage of this special law, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/">Open Avenues Foundation</a>, which offers a <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/global-talent">Global Talent Fellowship</a>. In this program, international talent can receive cap-exempt H-1B visas by leading university students for about five hours a week in real-world, project-based work within their field of expertise for the startup that nominated them for the fellowship. The candidate gets to stay in (or come to) the U.S., your startup gets a team of students working on a group project that benefits your company and increases diversity in your hiring pipeline, and U.S. students get the benefit of hands-on high quality STEM learning.</p>
<p>Once your candidate’s first cap-exempt H-1B is in place, your startup can petition for a second, concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1B for direct startup employment.</p>
<p>Interested in variations? If you’re not in STEM but have a university that would host you (free to the university), you can potentially partner with OAF. In addition, many universities in the U.S have <a href="https://www.globaleir.org/">global entrepreneur-in-residence programs</a> that can help international co-founders qualify for concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1Bs. Your startup should also consider sponsoring your co-founder for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A visa</a> or change of status.</p>
<p>Another option to consider is for your co-founder to apply for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP), a new 30-month immigration status in the U.S. The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) was created by President Barack Obama and is the closest thing the U.S. has right now to a startup visa. The Trump administration tried to eliminate it, but the <a href="https://nvca.org/immigration/">National Venture Capital Association</a>, led by Jeff Farrah, successfully challenged the administration’s effort in federal court, so IEP remains on the books.</p>
<p>A lot of folks don’t believe it’s an option yet, so I’m currently looking for international startup founders with a strong case to file for IEP to test out this new program and demonstrate its existence to the world. We’re currently seeking global startup founders holding at least 15% equity in a U.S. startup that’s less than five years old and has raised at least $250,000 from U.S. investors. If you want to be on our free interest list, you can fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmpTCXBjdaZkGF_fMlEnDVdmD114lm8pH9R24iOKaE1znwEQ/viewform">form</a>. If we think you have a strong application, we’ll reach out.</p>
<p>If your co-founder wants to remain permanently in the U.S., consider starting a green card now such as the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-1A</a> green card for individuals of extraordinary ability or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-2 NIW</a> (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals of exceptional ability. Of these, the EB-1A is the quickest option, but its qualification requirements are tougher than for the EB-2 NIW.</p>
<h2>F-1 OPT employee immigration options</h2>
<p>If your F-1 OPT employee graduated with a qualified STEM degree, that employee can apply for a 24-month work extension, known as <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/stem-opt-extension/">STEM OPT</a>. That will allow the employee to remain in the U.S. to continue working for you. In the meantime, you can register them again next year for the H-1B lottery. If there’s no possibility for STEM, please check out the Cap-Exempt H-1B option explained above.</p>
<p>If your F-1 OPT employee only has a bachelor’s degree, they might want to consider pursuing an advanced degree. Individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university have better odds of being selected in the annual H-1B lottery. That’s because 20,000 of the 85,000 H-1B visas available each year are earmarked for individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that next year’s H-1B lottery will likely shift from the current random selection process to one based on the highest wages. Unless the Biden administration changes the policy, which was devised by the previous administration, employers who pay their H-1B candidates a Level III wage or higher have the best chance of getting selected to file for an H-1B visa.</p>
<p>As you know, sponsoring employers must agree to pay an H-1B candidate the higher of either the actual wage paid for the job or the prevailing wage, which is broken down into four levels based on experience required for the position and location of the position. Level I wage is basically for an entry-level position, while a Level IV wage is for a position requiring the most experience. While this will add greater predictability to the annual H-1B “lottery,” early-stage startups and small businesses may have a difficult time competing against more established companies on salary, particularly because stock options and equity are not included in the salary calculation.</p>
<p>If you need to find alternative visa solutions, you can always consult with an attorney. I hope all of these options help you realize the control and agency you have in this situation. You have choices!</p>
<p>All my best,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic arrived in the U.S. early last year, companies scrambled to figure out what to do with their long-standing, in-person developer events. For Apple and Microsoft, that meant going virtual – something companies have done with mixed results.</p>
<p>For Google, it meant calling off I/O all together. The company canceled the developer conference traditionally held each May at Mountain View, California’s Shoreline Amphitheater.</p>
<p>“Out of concern for the health and safety of our developers, employees, and local communities — and in line with recent ‘shelter in place’ orders by the local Bay Area counties — we sadly will not be holding I/O in any capacity this year,” the company wrote at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After a year off, the show is set to return in virtual form. Google sent out its customary puzzle invites today, noting that the event will be held May 18-20. (Props <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-2021-announced/">to 9 to 5 Google for solving.</a>) Like other online-only events of a recent vintage, this version of the developer&#8217;s conference will be free to attend and open to all. (Live, we assume, and not &#8220;Olive,&#8221; but it&#8217;s hard to say for sure, based on the graphic below.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135252" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135252" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2135252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=1536,941 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google joins a number of companies continuing to hold virtual events in 2021. While an aggressive vaccine rollout has begun here in the States, there&#8217;s still plenty of questions and concerns surround the virus&#8217;s spread at large gatherings &#8212; even ones like I/O, which are traditionally held outdoors. Apple recently announced a second virtual version of WWDC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/apples-wwdc-stays-online-only-kicking-off-june-7/">set for June</a>, while Microsoft&#8217;s<a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/"> Build runs May 25-27</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The question of whether Facebook will face any regulatory sanction over the latest massive historical platform privacy fail to come to light remains unclear. But the timeline of the incident looks increasingly awkward for the tech giant.</p>
<p>While it initially sought to play down the data breach revelations published by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">Business Insider</a> at the weekend by suggesting that information like people&#8217;s birth dates and phone numbers was &#8220;old&#8221;, in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/facts-on-news-reports-about-facebook-data/">blog post</a> late yesterday the tech giant finally revealed that the data in question had in fact been scraped from its platform by malicious actors &#8220;in 2019&#8221; and &#8220;prior to September 2019&#8221;.</p>
<p>That new detail about the timing of this incident raises the issue of compliance with Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which came into application in May 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the EU regulation data controllers can face fines of up to 2% of their global annual turnover for failures to notify breaches, and up to 4% of annual turnover for more serious compliance violations.</p>
<p>The European framework looks important because Facebook indemnified itself against historical privacy issues in the US when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/">settled with the FTC for $5BN back in July 2019</a> &#8212; although that does still mean there&#8217;s a period of several months (June to September 2019) which could fall outside that settlement.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/">Yesterday</a>, in its own statement responding to the breach revelations, Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU said the provenance of the newly published dataset wasn&#8217;t entirely clear, writing that it &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset&#8221; &#8212; referring to an earlier breach incident Facebook disclosed in 2018 which related to a vulnerability in its phone lookup functionality that it had said occurred between June 2017 and April 2018 &#8212; but also writing that the newly published dataset also looked to have been &#8220;combined with additional records, which may be from a later period&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Facebook followed up the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC)&#8217;s statement by confirming that suspicion &#8212; admitting that the data had been extracted from its platform in 2019, up until September of that year.</p>
<p>Another new detail that emerged in Facebook&#8217;s blog post yesterday was the fact users&#8217; data was scraped not via the aforementioned phone lookup vulnerability &#8212; but via another method altogether: A contact importer tool vulnerability.</p>
<p>This route allowed an unknown number of &#8220;malicious actors&#8221; to use software to imitate Facebook&#8217;s app and upload large sets of phone numbers to see which ones matched Facebook users.</p>
<p>In this way a spammer (for example), could upload a database of potential phone numbers and link them to not only names but other data like birth date, email address, location &#8212; all the better to phish you with.</p>
<p>In its PR response to the breach, Facebook quickly claimed it had fixed this vulnerability in August 2019. But, again, that timing places the incident squarely in the period of GDPR being active.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Europe&#8217;s data protection framework bakes in a data breach notification regime that requires data controllers to notify a relevant supervisory authority if they believe a loss of personal data is likely to constitute a risk to users&#8217; rights and freedoms &#8212; and to do so without undue delay (ideally within 72 hours of becoming aware of it).</p>
<p>Yet Facebook made <em>no disclosure at all of this incident to the DPC</em>. Indeed, the regulator made it clear yesterday that it had to <em>proactively</em> <em>seek information from Facebook</em> in the wake of BI&#8217;s report. That&#8217;s the opposite of how EU lawmakers intended the regulation to function.</p>
<p>Data breaches, meanwhile, are broadly defined under the GDPR. It could mean personal data being lost or stolen and/or accessed by unauthorized third parties. It can also relate to deliberate or accidental action or inaction by a data controller which exposes personal data.</p>
<p>Legal risk attached to the breach likely explains why Facebook has studiously avoided describing this latest data protection failure, in which the personal information of more than half a billion users was posted for free download on an online forum, as a &#8216;breach&#8217;.</p>
<p>And, indeed, why it&#8217;s sought to downplay the significance of the leaked information &#8212; dubbing people&#8217;s personal information &#8220;old data&#8221;. (Even as few people regularly change their mobile numbers, email address, full names and biographical information and so on, and no one (legally) gets a new birth date&#8230; )</p>
<p>Its blog post instead refers to data being scraped; and to scraping being &#8220;a common tactic that often relies on automated software to lift public information from the internet that can end up being distributed in online forums&#8221; &#8212; tacitly implying that the personal information leaked via its contact importer tool was somehow <em>public</em>.</p>
<p>The self-serving suggestion being peddled here by Facebook is that hundreds of millions of users had both published sensitive stuff like their mobile phone numbers on their Facebook profiles <em>and</em> left default settings on their accounts &#8212; thereby making this personal information &#8216;publicly available for scraping/no longer private/uncovered by data protection legislation&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is an argument as obviously absurd as it is viciously hostile to people&#8217;s rights and privacy. It&#8217;s also an argument that EU data protection regulators must quickly and definitively reject or be complicit in allowing Facebook (ab)use its market power to torch the very fundamental rights that regulators&#8217; sole purpose is to defend and uphold.</p>
<p>Even if some Facebook users affected by this breach had their information exposed via the contact importer tool because they had not changed Facebook&#8217;s privacy-hostile defaults that still raises key questions of GPDR compliance &#8212; because the regulation also requires data controllers to adequately secure personal data and apply privacy by design and default.</p>
<p>Facebook allowing hundreds of millions of accounts to have their info freely pillaged by spammers (or whoever) doesn&#8217;t sound like good security or default privacy.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> all over again.</p>
<p>Facebook is trying to get away with continuing to be terrible at privacy and data protection because it&#8217;s been so terrible at it in the past &#8212; and likely feels confident in keeping on with this tactic because it&#8217;s faced relatively little regulatory sanction for an endless parade of data scandals. (A one-time $5BN FTC fine for a company than turns over $85BN+ in annual revenue is just another business expense.)</p>
<p>We asked Facebook why it failed to notify the DPC about this 2019 breach back in 2019, when it realized people&#8217;s information was once again being maliciously extracted from its platform &#8212; or, indeed, why it hasn&#8217;t bothered to tell affected Facebook users themselves &#8212; but the company declined to comment beyond what it said yesterday.</p>
<p>Then it told us it would not be commenting on its communications with regulators.</p>
<p>Under the GDPR, if a breach poses a high risk to users&#8217; rights and freedoms a data controller is required to notify affected individuals &#8212; with the rational being that prompt notification of a threat can help people take steps to protect themselves from the risks of their data being breached, such as fraud and ID theft.</p>
<p>Yesterday Facebook also said it does not have plans to notify users either.</p>
<p>Perhaps the company&#8217;s trademark &#8216;thumbs up&#8217; symbol would be more aptly expressed as a middle finger raised at everyone else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another batch of Starlink satellites, keeping up its rapid pace of launches for the broadband constellation it&#8217;s deploying in low Earth orbit. This now makes 300 Starlink satellites launched since March 4, with 60 on each of five flights between then and now.</p>
<p>The most recent launch before this one happened on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites-making-240-launched-this-month-alone/">March 24</a>, with prior flights on March 14, March 11 and March 4 , respectively. That pace is intentionally fast, since SpaceX has said it aims to launch a total of 1,500 Starlink satellites over the course of this calendar year. Before that especially busy month, SpaceX also flew four other Starlink missions, including a shared ride on SpaceX&#8217;s first dedicated rideshare mission that also carried satellites for other customers.</p>

<p>In total, SpaceX has now launched 1,443 satellites for its Starlink constellation. That doesn&#8217;t reflect the total number of satellites on orbit, however, as a handful of those earlier satellites have been deorbited as planned. In total, the eventual planned sizer fo the constellation is expected to include up to 42,000 spacecraft based on current FCC frequency spectrum filings.</p>
<p>SpaceX recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nasa-and-spacex-sign-a-special-info-sharing-agreement-to-help-avoid-starlink-collisions/">signed a new agreement with NASA</a> that outlines how the two organizations will avoid close approach or collision events between their respective spacecraft. NASA has measures it requires all launchers to follow in order to avoid these kinds of incidents, but the scale and frequency of SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink missions necessitated an additional, more extensive agreement.</p>

<p>This launch also included a landing of the Falcon 9 booster used, its seventh so far. The booster touched down as intended on SpaceX&#8217;s floating landing pad in the Atlantic Ocean, and will be refurbished for another potential reuse. SpaceX is also going to be looking to recover its fairing halves at sea, which are the two cargo covering shields that encase the satellites during take-off. The company actually just decommissioned two ships it had used to try to catch these out of mid-air as they fell slowed by parachutes, but it&#8217;s still looking to retrieve them from the ocean after splashdown for re-use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods flowing across the U.S.-Mexican border each year, the freight industry has remained analog — each side of the border offering up its own maze of bureaucracy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nuvocargo.com/">Nuvocargo</a>, a digital logistics platform for cross-border trade, is trying to modernize the process. The company offers an all-in-one service that rolls freight forwarding, customs brokerage, cargo insurance and even trade financing into one UI-friendly software and app. Housing all of these services under one app makes it easier for companies to track their supply chain and gives customs and logistics teams access to more centralized information, according to Nuvocargo CEO Deepak Chhugani.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you just have one single audit trail in case something goes wrong,” Chhugani told TechCrunch, adding that the process<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> helps reduce or eliminate the extra costs that come with a high administrative overhead. It also lets customers take a high-level look at their operations from within a single interface, he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chhugani likened the experience to something like UberEats, which offers customers the ability to easily track food orders from restaurant to home.</p>
<p>“Just imagine, because you are dealing with so many different parties, you lose visibility on what’s going on. If you want a snapshot of – what did I spend end-to-end? – you actually have to go through all these email chains or faxes or texts with different providers,” Chhugani explained. “Some of them might be in another country. So [Nuvocargo] just creates more visibility throughout the process, from where the goods literally are to visibility around your finances.”</p>
<p>But Nuvocargo is thinking beyond the actual movement of goods. The company is also starting to offer customs brokerage, comprehensive cross-border cargo insurance, and factoring, or short-term account receivable finance. The last of these solves an especially difficult pain point for trucking companies, who sometimes must wait up to net-90 days to be paid.</p>
<p>The approach has caught investors’ eyes: nearly one year after announcing it had raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/nuvocargo-a-trucking-managed-marketplace-raises-5-3m-in-seed-funding/">$5.3 million seed round</a>, the company has closed on a $12 million Series A funding led by QED Investors and with injections from David Velez, Michael Ronen, Raymond Tonsing, FJ Labs and Clocktower. Investors NFX and ALLVP, which participated in the previous round, also participated.</p>
<p>The “holy grail” of their new offerings, as Chhugani called it, is trade financing. Because Nuvocargo will already have a relationship with companies, including an understanding of credit and fraud risk, its hope is that it can offer financial products at a competitive rate.</p>
<p>This is what attracted QED Investors, a firm that typically focuses on financial technology rather than logistics and trucking.</p>
<p>“After speaking with [Deepak] and seeing the connection points and parallels between what we were looking at in e-commerce and the challenges of actually getting goods across border, the fintech spark went off in my own head,” Lauren Connolley Morton, a Partner at QED, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “The opportunities for factoring, for lending, for insuring goods are all very much right up our alley.”</p>
<p>Although Chhugani declined to disclose Nuvocargo’s valuation after this most recent round of funding, it’s clear there is plenty of room to grow into the logistics industry’s huge and seemingly disaggregated value chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blackinnovationalliance.com/">Black Innovation Alliance </a>and <a href="http://www.vilcap.com/">Village Capital</a> today announced Resource, a national initiative aimed at boosting the efforts of entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs) led by, and focused on, founders of color.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The motivation behind the project is straightforward. ESOs “face record demand, declining resources and are chronically underestimated, underappreciated and underfunded,” the organizations say.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource aims to give local accelerators and incubators support in the form of training and community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Resource’s &#8220;ESO Accelerator” will train startup ecosystem leaders on how to build a more financially sustainable organization, as well as help connect them to potential funders. It also will provide milestone-based financial support tied to organizational development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource also plans to build a national community of practice among ESO leaders of color and their funders to share best practices and “develop stronger capital and mentorship pathways&#8221; for Black, Latinx and Indigenous founders across the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Village Capital, says CEO Allie Burns, supports and invest in entrepreneurs “who have been historically sitting in historical blind spots of investors, whether that&#8217;s by the problems they&#8217;re trying to solve, the geography they&#8217;re located in or demographic factors that we have seen lead to capital being concentrated in very few people, places and problems.” Village Capital has worked with more than 100 other ESOs to help grow companies with founders from all backgrounds over the past five years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal with Resource is to help ensure that incubators and accelerators focused on supporting people of color have the resources they need to flourish, she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want to make sure that those accelerators and other ESOs have the financial, social and human capital to keep their doors open and grow,” Burns said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Black Innovation Alliance Executive Director Kelly Burton points out that these Black-led organizations are often the first line of support for Black entrepreneurs yet reap few benefits from their success over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They receive very little support and very little funding,” she said. “It&#8217;s almost like they do all the heavy lifting, they plant seeds and do all the cultivation but they don&#8217;t really get to benefit once that founder and that startup has really taken off. This is an opportunity for us to stabilize these organizations to help them build their own capacities and capabilities so that that organization can be sustainable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource is supported by a national coalition of funders committed to supporting entrepreneurs of color. The initial coalition includes Moody’s, The Sorenson Impact Foundation, Travelers and UBS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In related news, on Tuesday we covered New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/new-jersey-announces-10m-seed-fund-aimed-at-black-and-latinx-founders/">proposal</a> for a $10 million allocation in the state budget to create a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In that piece, we noted that there are a number of organizations out there that are committed to funding diverse founders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In February, several national and Chicago-based organizations banded together to support early-stage Black and Latinx tech entrepreneurs through a new program dubbed <a href="https://techrise.co/">TechRise</a>. The nonprofit P33 launched the program in partnership with Verizon and 1871, a private business incubator and technology hub, among others, with the goals “of narrowing the wealth gap in Chicago, generating thousands of tech-related jobs and giving $5 million in grant funding to Black and Latino entrepreneurs,” according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/25/22301698/techrise-initiative-support-chicago-black-latinx-latino-tech-founders">Chicago Sun Times</a>. (Disclosure: Verizon is TechCrunch’s parent company).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also in Austin, <a href="https://divinc.org/">DivInc</a> is a nonprofit pre-accelerator that holds 12-week programs for underrepresented tech founders.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fuel Capital General Partner Leah Solivan joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021 to talk about how to avoid early mistakes in building your startup. Solivan has ample experience on both sides of the fence, as she founded TaskRabbit and led it to exit through an acquisition by Ikea in 2017. She shared a list of 10 things to avoid in total, but here are some highlights of what to watch out for.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Share your ideas freely</h2>
<p>Solivan urged founders to not be shy about sharing their ideas, as some people can tend to be secretive about their startup concept. The notion that giving up your idea somehow means you&#8217;ll end up with more competition is not a legitimate concern in the end, Solivan said. Instead, sharing that idea with as many people as you can is much more likely to generate positive results than negative.</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I would be giving a presentation. And someone after the presentation would come up to me and say, oh my goodness, I had this same idea for TaskRabbit, like 10 years ago. And I&#8217;d be like, great! What did you do with that idea? And I think the point is, is that the idea itself isn&#8217;t the magic — the magic is in the execution of your idea and actually turning that idea into a business. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 01:42)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Take everyone&#8217;s advice, but make the call</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok today is doubling down on its roots as a music-backed creation app with the launch of a half dozen new music effects for creators. The effects, which offer interactivity, visualizations, animations and more, will roll out over the next few weeks, starting with the launch of <a href="https://m.tiktok.com/share/stickers/detail/1020192/?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfKLdM2nynkSyK7MJw7Qh2G6sw62baODxSxNS48Gmd3%2BLBGY%2FuV9Ve%2B65sOCI%2BmDOGgA%3D&amp;object_id=1020192&amp;schema_type=17&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA2OmHkXmA2XE1HvFfLGsupck6AQrxBOC-wJ1xHnr75_TWmD0o2FgJWos6njYlF3Wi&amp;share_link_id=D870E76A-EDAF-476D-88C2-7BCE3BDAC251&amp;share_sticker_id=1020192&amp;tt_from=more&amp;u_code=d5jje868690fkj&amp;user_id=6680962180727129093&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=more">Music Visualizer</a>. This effect is now available to TikTok&#8217;s global user base and runs real-time beat tracking to animate a retro greenscreen landscape, the company says.</p>
<p>The effect was added to TikTok&#8217;s Creative Effects tray yesterday and there are already over 28,000 videos created using the new feature. The effect results in videos featuring a purple sky with multiple moons (or planets?) in the background, where the grid on the ground pulses up and down with the music.</p>
<p>Music Visualizer works with any sounds in TikTok&#8217;s music library and has also been adopted by the electronic dance music duo AREA21 who used Music Visualizer to tease their <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@area21/video/6948093659246005510?sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6941038004544079365&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;is_copy_url=0">new track &#8220;La La La</a>.&#8221; Unfortunately, their use of the effect hides the animation behind one of their own. But <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe53Yb3c/">several</a> <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe5HWV4H/">other</a> <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe592SKG/">creators</a> showcase the effect better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2135144" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?w=354" alt="" width="354" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg 824w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?resize=156,300 156w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?resize=768,1474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?resize=354,680 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?resize=800,1536 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-11.55.05-AM.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></p>
<p>Other effects on the way include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music Machine</strong>, which offers an interactive set of tools that will allow users to control the real-time rendering of MIDI loops for different music layers. There will also be a BPM slider for real-time adjustments; five, one-shot sound effects; and dynamic visual responses for the video of your recorded music.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed Beats</strong>, which recreates the freeze-frame effect that&#8217;s already popular on TikTok while aligning transitions to the beat of the music</li>
<li><strong>Text Beats,</strong> which allows creators to add animated text overlays to their video that transition in sync with the beat of any sound from TikTok&#8217;s library.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Beats</strong>, which add visual effects that sync to the beat of any song.</li>
<li><strong>Mirror Beats</strong>, which align display transitions with the beat of any song from TikTok&#8217;s library.</li>
</ul>
<p>The launch of the new features follow arrival of several new TikTok competitors from major social networks, including Instagram (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a>), Snapchat (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>), and YouTube (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">Shorts</a>). The additions of the features help to demonstrate how far behind these rivals are in terms of competing on on the product experience. While the newcomers to the short-form video space may have launched their own set of basic creation tools, they&#8217;re lacking the larger libraries of creative effects that make TikTok fun to use, as well as appealing to those who are more specifically interested in its music features.</p>
<p>All the new effects will be rolled out to the dedicated &#8220;Music&#8221; tab within TikTok&#8217;s Creative Effects tray, as they become globally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a company founded by data scientists, <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> may be in a unique position to develop tooling to help companies build machine learning applications. For starters, it developed an open source project, but today the startup announced an expanded beta of a new commercial offering and $35 million Series B funding.</p>
<p>Sequoia led the investment with help from previous investors Gradient Ventures and GGV Capital. Today&#8217;s round brings the total raised to $62 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Data scientists can download the open source project and build a machine learning application, but it requires a certain level of technical aptitude to make all the parts work. Company co-founder and CEO Adrien Treuille  says that so far the company has 20,000 monthly active developers using the open source tooling to develop streaming apps, which have been viewed millions of times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As they have gained that traction, they have customers who would prefer to use a commercial service. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to have something free and that you can use instantly, but not every company is capable of bridging that into a commercial offering,&#8221; Treuille explained.</p>
<p>Company COO and co-founder Amanda Kelly says that the commercial offering called Streamlit for Teams is designed to remove some of the complexity around using the open source application. &#8220;The whole [process of] how do I actually deploy an app, put it in a container, make sure it scales, has the resources and is securely connected to data sources [&#8230;] &#8212; that&#8217;s a whole different skill set. That&#8217;s a DevOps and IT skill set,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>What Streamlit for Teams does is take care of all that in the background for end users, so they can concentrate on the app building part of the equation without help from the technical side of the company to deploy it.</p>

<p>Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia, who is leading the firm&#8217;s investment in Streamlit, says that she was impressed with the company&#8217;s developer focus and sees the new commercial offering as a way to expand usage of the applications that data scientists have been building in the open source project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Streamlit has a chance to define a better interface between data teams and business users by ushering in a new paradigm for interactive, data-rich applications,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>They have data scientists at big-name companies like Uber, Delta Dental and John Deere using the open source product already. They have kept the company fairly lean with 27 employees up until now, but the plan is to double that number in the coming year with the new funding, Kelly says.</p>
<p>She says that the founding team recognizes that it&#8217;s important to build a diverse company. She admits that it&#8217;s not always easy to do in practice when as a young startup, you are just fighting to stay alive, but she says that the funding gives them the luxury to step back and begin to hire more deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Literally right before this call, I was on with a consultant who is going to come in and work with the executive team, so that we&#8217;re all super clear about what we mean [when it comes to] diversity for us and how is this actually a really core part of our company, so that we can flow that into recruiting and people and engineering practices and and make that a lived value within our company,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Streamlit for Teams is available in beta starting today. The company plans to make it generally available some time later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the more tedious aspects of machine learning is providing a set of labels to teach the machine learning model what it needs to know. <a href="http://snorkel.ai">Snorkel AI</a> wants to make it easier for subject matter experts to apply those labels programmatically, and today the startup announced a $35 million Series B.</p>
<p>It also announced a new tool called Applications Studio that provides a way to build common machine learning applications using templates and predefined components.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round with participation from previous investors Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel and Nepenthe Capital. New investors Walden and BlackRock also joined in. The startup reports that it has now raised $50 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Alex Ratner says that data labeling remains a huge challenge and roadblock to moving machine learning and artificial intelligence forward inside a lot of industries because it is costly, labor-intensive and hard for the subject experts to carve out the time to do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The not so hidden secret about AI today is that in spite of all the technological and tooling advancements, roughly 80 to 90% of the cost and time for an average AI project goes into just manually labeling and collecting and relabeling this training data,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that his company has developed a solution to simplify this process to make it easier for subject experts to programmatically add the labels, a process he says decreases the time and effort required to apply labels in a pretty dramatic way from months to hours or days, depending on the complexity of the data.</p>
<p>As the company has developed this methodology, customers have been asking for help in the next step of the machine learning process, which is taking that training data and the model and building an application. That&#8217;s where the Application Studio comes in. It could be a contract classifier at a bank or a network anomaly detector at a telco and it helps companies take that next step after data labeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about how you programmatically label the data, it&#8217;s also about the models, the preprocessors, the post processors, and so we&#8217;ve made this now accessible in a kind of templated and visual no-code interface,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ej7fbJPjg4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/datarobot-to-acquire-data-prep-startup-paxata/">DataRobot is acquiring Paxata to add data prep to machine learning platform</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The company&#8217;s products are based on research that began at the Stanford AI Lab in 2015. The founders spent four years in the research phase before launching Snorkel in 2019. Today, the startup has 40 employees. Ratner recognizes the issues that the technology industry has had from a diversity perspective and says he has made a conscious effort to build a diverse and inclusive company.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I can say is that we tried to prioritize it at a company level, the full team level and at a board level from day one, and to also put action behind that. So we&#8217;ve been working with external firms for internal training and audits and strategy around DEI, and we&#8217;ve made pipeline diversity, a non-negotiable requirement of any of our contracts with recruiting firms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ratner also recognizes that automation can hard code bias into machine learning models, and he&#8217;s hopeful that by simplifying the labeling process, it can make it much easier to detect bias when it happens.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you start with a dozen or two dozen of what we call labeling functions in Snorkel, you still need to be vigilant and proactive about trying to detect bias, but it&#8217;s easier to audit what taught your model to change it by just going back and looking at a couple of hundred lines of code.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hiro.capital/">Hiro Capital</a> has gradually been making a name for itself as an investor in the area know as ‘Digital Sports’ or DSports for short. It’s now led a $2.3m funding round in PlayerData. While the round might sound small, the area it&#8217;s going into is large and growing. Also investing in the round is Sir Terry Leahy, previously the CEO of Tesco, the largest British retailer.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, UK-based PlayerData uses wearable technology and software tracking to give grass-roots and professional sports teams feedback on their training. It can, for instance, allow coaches to replay key moments from a game, even modeling different outcomes based on player positioning.</p>
<p>This is Hiro Capital’s 4th DSports and &#8216;connected fitness&#8217; investment, and it joins Zwift, FitXR and NURVV. Hiro has also invested in eight games startups in the UK, USA and Europe, as befits the heritage of cofounder and partner Ian Livingstone, OBE,CBE, who is the former chairman of Tomb Raider publisher Eidos plc and all-round gaming pioneer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PlayerData says it has captured more than 10,000 team sessions across UK soccer and rugby, and logged over 50 million meters of play. It also has strong network effects, it says. Every time a new team encounters one using Playerdata’s platform, it generates 5 more clubs as users.</p>
<p>Roy Hotrabhvanon is cofounder and CEO of PlayerData, and is a former international-level archer. He’s joined by Hayden Ball, cofounder and CTO, a firmware and cloud infrastructure expert.</p>

<p>In a statement Hotrabhvanon said: “Our mission is to bring fine-grained data and insight to clubs across team sports, helping them supercharge their game-making, improve player performance, and avoid injury… Our ultimate goal is to implement cutting-edge insights from pioneering wearables that are applicable to any team in any discipline at any level.”</p>
<p>Cherry Freeman, co-founding Partner at Hiro says: “PlayerData ticks all of our key boxes: a huge TAM with over 3m grass-roots clubs; a deep moat built on shared player data, machine learning and highly actionable predictive algorithms; compelling customer network effects; and a really impressive yet humble founding team.”</p>

<p>The PlayerData news forms part of a wider growth in digital sports, which includes such breakout names as Peloton, Tonal, Mirror, as well as Hiro’s portfolio investment, Zwift. With the pandemic putting an emphasison both home workouts and general health, the fascination with digital measurement of performance now has a growing grip on the sector.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Freeman added: “We think there are something like 3 million teams that are potential customers for PlayerData. Obviously the number of runners is enormous, and they only need to get a small slice of that market to have a very, very large business. At the end of the day everyone, everyone works out, even if you just go for a walk, so the target market&#8217;s huge and they started with running but their technology is applicable to a whole raft of other sports.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With 17 startups participating, <a href="https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley SkyDeck’s Demo Day</a> isn’t the largest cohort <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/y-combinator/">we’ve seen by any stretch</a>. The collection of companies is, however, defined by a wide range of focuses, from pioneering diabetes treatments to retrofitting autonomous trucking, curated by the SkyDeck&#8217;s small team and a number of advisors.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the accelerator is focused on developing early-stage companies tied to the University of California system. Applicants must be affiliated with either one of the 10 UC schools or their national laboratories in Berkeley, Livermore and Los Alamos. Notable alumni include micromobility unicorn, Lime, and delivery robotics firm, Kiwi.</p>
<p>In 2020, SkyDeck &#8212; along with much of the rest of the world &#8212; went virtual.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“While flight restrictions did cause some international founders to pull crazy hours from our home countries to participate in the sessions, virtual sessions allowed additional members of our teams to participate that would otherwise not have been able to do so,” the accelerator’s organizers said in a TechCrunch post last year. “We are also hearing chatter that Demo Day will be larger than ever before because virtual events are much more scalable.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The 17 startups presenting today were whittled down from 1,850 applicants, according to the accelerator. Being a member of the cohort involves six months of launch  assistance from SkyDeck, coupled with up $105,000. “In six months, you’re going to pitch on stage at demo day, to an institutional investor in your industry,” Executive Director Caroline Winnett tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at six highlights from this Demo Day.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.endocrinebio.com/"><strong style="font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">EndoCrine</strong></a></h2>

<p>Building on technologies developed in the stem cell research labs of UCSF, EndoCrine is looking to commercialize a better way to discover and develop drugs. Specifically, the startup is hoping to improve diabetes treatment beyond standard insulin injections.</p>
<p>“EndoCrine’s proprietary human stem cell-derived islet platform revolutionizes the drug discovery and development process, saving years of time and millions of dollars usually spent by pharma companies,” CEO Gopika Nair said in a statement offered to TechCrunch. “Our innovative solution opens an exciting era of personalized medicine in diabetes.”</p>
<p>The company says SkyDeck helped it take the earliest steps out of the lab and into startup mode.</p>

<p>NuPort Robotics is among the most mature of the 17 startups included here. In fact, in mid-March, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-tire-nuport-robotics-partner-120000898.html">the startup signed a partnership</a> with Canadian Tire and the Ontario government, as part of a $3 million investment in an autonomous middle-mile trucking solution.</p>
<p>Rather than building autonomous trucking from scratch, NuPort’s solution is designed to retrofit semis with autonomous technologies.</p>
<p>“This results in operational cost reduction by eliminating the need to replace their existing fleet and yields a safer, more efficient and sustainable transportation system,” CEO Raghavender Sahdev tells TechCrunch.</p>
<h2><a href="https://thehurdco.com/"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 15.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Hurd Co.</span></a></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2134880" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134880" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2134880" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="905" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png 1252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-7.44.22-PM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134880" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Hurd Co.</p></div></p>
<p>The Hurd Co.’s goal is simple: reduce the environmental impact of clothing companies by helping to remove trees from the process. Specifically, the company creates cellulosic fiber pulp from agricultural byproducts. This is designed to bypass tree-based agrilose, which is used in the production of a wide variety of fabrics, including rayon.</p>
<p>“Apparel brands are scrambling for new, low-impact fabric that will allow them to meet their ambitious sustainability goals,” CEO Taylor Heisley-Cook tells TechCrunch. “We completely eliminate trees from the supply chain with a hyper-efficient process that dramatically reduces brands’ impact on the environment.”</p>
<p>The company says its process uses half the water and significantly less energy than standard processes. The technology was developed by Hurd&#8217;s CTO, Charles Cai.</p>
<h2><a href="https://thinkhumm.com/"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 15.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Humm</span></a></h2>

<p>I won’t lie, this is the one in the batch I have the most questions about, having seen a number of companies claim their wearables can increase memory.</p>
<p>Here’s what CEO Iain McIntyre has to say: “It’s ideal for activities that depend on memory, like reading, problem solving or multi-tasking. The Humm patch uses tACS (transcranial alternating stimulation) and in clinical research studies, the Humm patch saw a measurable (+~20%) improvement against placebo.”</p>
<p>It’s an interesting underlying technology, and the advisors &#8212; which include a number of university professors in the sciences &#8212; certainly see commercial potential. There are some lingering questions around tACS.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electrical-brain-stimulation-may-alleviate-obsessive-compulsive-behaviors1/">Scientific American from January</a>: “The potential therapeutic effects of tACS on memory, food craving and other neural processes have been tested in dozens of studies in the past. Questions have been raised about whether this method actually exerts any meaningful changes in the brain, however.”</p>
<p>Definitely interested in seeing more about this one and perhaps taking it for a spin when the product ships, later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://publica.la/"><span style="font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">Publica</span></a></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULZaZTvsUQs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As far as elevator pitches go, Publica may have the best one of the show. “Publica is Shopify for Digital Content.” Essentially, the company wants to be a direct conduit between content creators and consumers.</p>
<p>“Publica is a service that enables authors and content creators to have their own custom storefront to share, market and sell e-books, audiobooks and any other types of digital content with no intermediaries,” CEO Pablo Laurino tells TechCrunch. “In the era of D2C and marketplaces, Publica helps authors and content to achieve that on their own storefront, offering authors complete control over their brand and ownership of the relationships.”</p>
<p>The system helps creators make their own own digital storefront to sell a wide variety of products, including audiobooks and e-books. The site is already up and running, with more than 1,200 stores created by 250 clients.</p>

<p>Serinus is developing a warning system for detecting failure in lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Per CEO, Hossain Fahad, &#8220;Battery safety is the biggest challenge in the EV industry today. Serinus Labs&#8217; proprietary LiCANS technology provides early warning signals to prevent catastrophic battery failure in electric vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tech uses gas sensing to detect early traces of vented gases that occur prior to battery failure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://captivateiq.com">CaptivateIQ</a>, which has developed a no-code platform to help companies design customized sales commission plans, has raised $46 million in a Series B round led by Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Amity, S28 Capital, Sequoia, and Y Combinator also participated in the financing, which brings the San Francisco-based company’s total raised to $63 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CaptivateIQ must be doing something right. While it is not yet profitable, the startup&#8217;s revenue has grown 600% year-over-year. To date, it has processed over $2 billion in commissions on its platform across hundreds of enterprise customers including Affirm, TripActions, Udemy, Intercom, Newfront Insurance and JMAC Lending.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A big part of our growth is that we can help any company that offers a performance-based compensation plan, so we don’t have any restrictions with the types of businesses we work with,” said co-CEO Mark Schopmeyer. “We typically see conversations start with teams that have a minimum of 25 sales people, though we easily serve enterprises and public companies as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of payees &#8212; defined as someone receiving a payout in CapitvateIQ’s system &#8212; was up four times in December 2020 from the year prior. Plus, the company had “back-to-back record months” from September through the end of the year in 2020, according to Schopmeyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He, co-CEO Conway Teng and CTO Hubert Wong founded CaptivateIQ after coming out of Y Combinator’s Winter 2017 cohort. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135068" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135068" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?w=561" alt="Left to right: CaptivateIQ co-founders Hubert Wong, Mark Schopmeyer and Conway Teng" width="561" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=248,300 248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=768,931 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=561,680 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=1268,1536 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CaptivateIQ.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2135068" class="wp-caption-text">Left to right: CaptivateIQ co-founders Hubert Wong, Mark Schopmeyer and Conway Teng.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company touts its SaaS platform as a combination of the familiarity of spreadsheets, with the scalability and performance of software, so that users can configure any commission plan “entirely on their own,” according to Teng. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Calculating commissions is really complicated and mission critical &#8211; think of it like a very complicated form of payroll &#8211; each company has a unique commission plan that involves a lot more calculations and data than your typical salary payroll math,” Teng said. “Also, in recent years, companies have access to more data than ever, giving them room to incentive employees on more performance metrics.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, CaptivateIQ has 90 employees, more than triple what it did one year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the startup saw a bump in the number of non-high technology companies buying its software, and as a result, CaptivateIQ is going to increase its efforts into those other verticals, according to Teng. So far, it has found success in particular in financial services, manufacturing, and business services, among other sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic served as a tailwind to its business. Sales teams generally rely on in-person interactions to stay productive, Schopmeyer points out. Without those activities over the past year, “having the right incentives in place became ever more critical as companies required new ways to motivate teams during the shift to remote work.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The No-Code Generation is arriving&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/the-no-code-generation-is-arriving/embed/#?secret=Whki1VJgrk" data-secret="Whki1VJgrk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw our product usage skyrocket at the beginning of the pandemic as businesses quickly adjusted incentives, team quotas, SPIFs, and other components of their comp plans to stay competitive,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to improve upon the user experience. Specifically, Teng said, it plans to introduce “more powerful data transformations, a richer set of formulas, and off-the-shelf templates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another goal is to automate and streamline the commissions process from beginning to end, he added. The startup is expanding its data integrations to support “all major data systems” and introducing new dashboarding capabilities. It’s also enhancing existing collaboration workflows around approvals, inquiries and contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, CaptivateIQ is exploring the potential of applying its technology to solve for use cases outside the world of commissions &#8212; something that it says its customers are already doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s exciting to see what people have been building, and we’re looking forward to enabling new solutions as we continue to release more of our core technology platform,” Teng said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner Ben Fletcher said the pain point of calculating and reporting sales commissions kept coming up among portfolio companies, with CaptivateIQ frequently referenced. Those </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies, he said, tried more enterprise-grade solutions &#8212; “spending hundreds of thousands on implementation to ultimately find that their products did not work.” They also tried other newer tools that also just didn’t work well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we dug in and talked with more and more customers, it was abundantly clear &#8212; CaptivateIQ was the best product in the space,” Fletcher said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides ease of use, the fact that CaptivateIQ is a no-code tool, is a big deal to Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Similar to UIPath, Webflow, and Ada, CaptivateIQ is able to bring the power of customer development and automation to an easy to use, drag-and-drop product,” Fletcher said. </span></p>
