										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">US/Israeli startup, <a href="http://www.getsorbet.com/">Sorbet</a> &#8211; which helps companies de-risk themselves against accrued paid time off (PTO) by employees — has raised another $15M, in a round led By Dovi Frances’ Group 11, not long after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/sorbet-raises-6m-seed-led-by-viola-ventures-to-tackle-the-thorny-financials-of-paid-time-off/">a $6 million seed round</a> only last April.</p>
<p>Sorbet says it removes the burden of PTO from employers, allowing employees to ‘spend&#8217; it in offers and other types of deals, giving employers far more control over the whole process and the ability to forecast ahead. It does this by buying out PTO liabilities from employees and loading the cash value of the PTO on prepaid Credit Cards. It then refinances these liabilities for employers, hence the forecasting advantage.</p>
<p>Veetahl Eilat-Raichel, founder and CEO, said: “It&#8217;s clear that we’re in the midst of a tectonic shift in employer-employee dynamics and with inbound global interest exceeding our wildest expectations, I had the great privilege of picking and choosing the best investors to help us expand and accelerate. I can think of no better partner than Dovi and the entire Group 11 team to join us, and am thrilled and humbled to have them alongside our already stellar group of investors.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dovi Frances, Founding Partner, Group 11 said: “At Group 11 we pride ourselves in our unique ability to uncover the unicorns of tomorrow. Veetahl and the team did something exceedingly difficult which is to uncover a massive market inefficiency hiding in plain sight. With a $270B market opportunity, it was crystal clear to me this was the time to push forward and not look back.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Wise&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/wise-announces-plans-to-go-public-via-direct-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> that it planned to go public by way of a direct listing on the LSE, today the company made the news formal with a <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/intention-to-float/15030546?showDisclaimer=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a>. The London-based company &#8212; formerly known as TransferWise and primarily in the business of transferring money across different currencies &#8212; with 10 million users said it plans to list in &#8220;early July 2021&#8221; but did not provide further details on pricing of its class A shares, in keeping with how direct listings work. It&#8217;s been reported, however, that the plan is for the valuation to be in the range of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wise-ipo-idUSKBN2BO69F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 billion to $7 billion</a> with the listing.</p>
<p>(Overall, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wise has put in place a dual-class share structure in place with two classes of shares in issue, class A shares and class B shares, in order to support Wise’s focus on its mission as it transitions into the public markets, it noted. Class B shares are not tradeable.)</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Company will not set a price in respect of the class A shares or offer any class A shares in connection with the direct listing,&#8221; it noted in the statement. &#8220;The opening price of the class A shares will be determined in the opening auction on the date of Admission.&#8221; While direct listings have somewhat taken off as a route for tech companies to go public in the U.S. &#8212; a trend spearheaded by another European juggernaut, Spotify &#8212; this is a new turn for the LSE, which <a href="https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/live_cds_-_001_-_17062021_-_revised_initial_opening_auction_arrangements_for_new_admission_-_wise_gb00bl9yr756.pdf." target="_blank" rel="noopener">published its own new rules</a> on the process the same day that Wise announced its plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the meantime, we can watch for more details around the public offering, and updates about the company&#8217;s business, will be coming out in a prospectus and other related statements in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Bypassing the big investment banks and the related roadshow of a more conventional listing can be a bold move, one that companies who want to avoid the volatility and commitment of that process might opt to take if they feel they have enough momentum to hit the market directly. Wise in its statement today hinted that there has been some early interest, based on its share <a href="https://wise.com/owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering to Wise customers</a>.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to confirm our plans for a direct listing in London. This process will broaden the ownership of Wise, in support of our mission to move money around the world faster, cheaper and more conveniently,&#8221; said Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, in a note in the statement. &#8220;Since announcing our expected intention to float last week, we’ve had over 60,000 expressions of interest in our customer shareholder programme, OwnWise, which is designed to reward customers who buy Wise shares and stick with us for the longer-term. This direct listing is about further aligning our mission and our shareholder base and I’m enormously proud that customers want to be a part of that.”</p>
<p>Wise has been one of the huge success stories for fintech coming out of Europe, and London &#8212; founded by Estonians Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus, the company&#8217;s been based out of London and has stuck with that even through all the financial turmoil of Brexit. Its 10 million customers currently process around $7 billion (£5 billion) in cross-border transactions every month, which remains its primary business even as it diversifies into newer, related areas of financial services. In its most recent financial year, Wise&#8217;s revenue grew to $586 million, up from $422 million. That represents $57 million (£41 million) in profit before tax, and the company says it has been profitable since 2017.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Class B shares will hold 9 votes per share, are strictly non-transferable and, amongst other voting right cancellation events, expire on the fifth anniversary of any listing, the company confirmed. Wise’s shareholders and holders of vested options as at 23 May 2021 are entitled to elect to receive 50% of their class A share holding in the Company with additional corresponding class B shares on a 1:1 basis (save for Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, who is entitled to elect to receive 100% of his class A share holding in the Company with additional corresponding class B shares on a 1:1 basis), it added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The voting rights attaching to the class B shares are, subject to certain regulatory approvals, capped so that no shareholder can, by virtue of the class B shares they hold, cast more than one vote less than 35% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision (save for Kristo Käärmann who, for so long as he is CEO of the Company, will be capped in respect of his class B shares at one vote less than 50% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision and if, at any time, he is not CEO of the Company he will be capped at one below 35% of the eligible votes in respect of any shareholder decision). The class B shares are non-tradeable and will not be listed.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/apple-to-introduce-search-ads-on-app-store-along-with-changes-to-app-review-discovery-and-splits/">launching five years ago</a> in the United States, Apple&#8217;s search advertising service finally arrived in mainland China this week.</p>
<p>The feature, called Apple Search Ads, lets developers bid on an advertising slot based on users&#8217; keyword search in the App Store, similar to how Google search ads work. JPMorgan previously estimated the giant&#8217;s annual ad revenue could <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-advertising/apple-could-raise-annual-ad-income-to-11-billion-by-2025-jpmorgan-idUSKBN1XP17L?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">top $11 billion by 2025</a>, though the forecast didn&#8217;t have a breakdown for the search ad business.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“It’s likely that the long delay in launching Search Ads in China was due to Chinese government restrictions on the operation of advertising business in China. It seems that Apple has found a way around this, but at the cost of having to accept payments in foreign currencies and not being able to provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">Search Tab ads</a>,” says Rich Bishop, founder and CEO of AppInChina, a publisher that helps international apps launch in China.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple has itself been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">reining in on personalized advertising</a>, letting users turn off data tracking by apps, a move that will inevitably roil the business models of Facebook and others dependent on third-party data to target ads.</p>
<p>China has historically been a strong market for Apple, but iPhones are increasingly losing their luster as a status symbol in the country with the rise of local offerings like Huawei. In the first quarter, however, Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/">smartphone shipment saw a rebound</a> thanks to Huawei&#8217;s slipping sales and the launch of the iPhone 12 family. The Chinese App Store is another important source of income for Apple.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/v/help/b/docs/apple-advertising-guidelines-for-mainland-china.pdf">five-page guideline</a>, Apple outlines the qualifications for developers targeting ads at mainland Chinese users. There is a stack of industry-specific licenses that advertisers must obtain, which practically excludes most foreign entities from directly advertising in mainland China, as noted in a blog post by <a href="https://www.appinchina.co/apple-search-ads-in-mainland-china">AppInChina.</a></p>
<p>To bid for search ads in China, apps would have to find local partners with all the government approvals in place.</p>
<p>The requirements for apps importing goods into China, for example, include not just a general license to run value-added internet businesses but also registrations with the relevant trade and customs authorities. Apple may even start asking for these permits from apps that simply want to <em>publish </em>in China, wrote AppInChina, as Apple continues to enforce rules set by the Chinese government as evident from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/china-roundup-apple-closes-app-store-loophole/">crackdown on gaming apps</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industries like real estate, automotive, and financial services have long and offline sales cycles and digital advertising tends not to perform well in these areas. The conversion rates are low and because the real-world assets are offline the temptation of advertisers is to buy leads and clicks, which can inflate customer acquisition costs. People are browsing but they end up buying offline, basically.</p>
<p>A new startup, <a href="http://Tomi.ai">Tomi</a> plans to address this issue by processing a user’s behavior on a company&#8217;s website (using a tracking pixel, combined with ad APIs and CRMs) to help companies reach customers more in the way an ecommerce business would.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $1M seed round from investors including Begin Capital and Phystech Leadership Fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Konstantin Bayandin — a former senior director of digital marketing and technology at Compass and chief marketing officer at Ozon, ‘Russia’s Amazon’ —  Tomi competes against similar AdTech companies such as Anytrack, Sociaro, Meetotis, Alytics and Postclick.</p>
<p>However, the difference, Bayandin says, is that Tomi &#8220;focuses on offline conversions and  works with multiple ad channels, such as Facebook, Instagram and Google.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bayandin says: &#8220;Real-estate companies would love to leverage online ads in order to sell their inventory but it turns out to be too expensive and difficult. People like to browse but rarely convert and most of these transactions happen offline. So real-estate clients don’t know how to optimize for their real buyers. Tomi uses machine learning to analyze the way real buyers browse the website and optimize ad campaigns towards conversions.”</p>
<p>The background to all this is that with Apple closing down IDFA, Google planning to remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, and the latest iOS 14.5 update allowing users opt out of “personalized ads”, the entire ad business is in flux, so new tools are going to be required. Bayandin says Tomi is part of this new wave of AdTech.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 23, 2021. The value of leading cryptocurrencies has rebounded some in the last day or so. Congrats to the hodlrs out there. If you are a nocoiner, don’t worry; stocks are also up. If you want more on the topic, the TechCrunch crew held a Twitter Space recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/how-many-lives-does-bitcoin-have/">on the current state of crypto</a>. Now, the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/"><strong>Robotaxis are coming (slowly)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Alphabet’s self-driving unit, Waymo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/the-station-waymo-nabs-more-capital-cruise-taps-a-5b-credit-line-and-hints-about-argos-future/">has been busy lately</a>, but it’s not the only company in its market generating headlines. Chinese robotaxi player WeRide bagged $600 million in less than half a year, TechCrunch reports. The company is now worth $3.3 billion. Let’s hope that all the capital and activity in this particular market works out when<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span>the rubber hits the road.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/">Soon, even regular folks can get in on the autonomous action</a></strong><strong>: </strong>Love the idea of self-driving cars, but don’t have $100 million or more to pour into one of the industry’s leading private players? Good news! You can put your $100 into Embark soon, as the self-driving truck company is going public via a SPAC. You are welcome for this PSA.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/edtech-culture-memo/">Tech’s cultural discussion continues</a></strong><strong>: </strong>If you follow the tech industry, you’ve seen news about its evolving cultural discussion. From <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">banning “politics”</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/basecamp-employees-quit-ceo-letter/">public culture memos</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">private missives that became public</a>, there’s a lot going on at both startups and public companies alike. A new document from the edtech sector takes a rather pointed stand in the larger conversation in favor of not backing down from controversial topics, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> wrote for the site. It won’t be the last memo we see on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/investors-thirst-for-growth-could-bode-well-for-sentinelones-ipo/"><strong>The exit market for growth-focused startups is still hot</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s the lesson from recent IPO filings in the tech space. If you are an investor or startup employee, it’s good news. If you are a wealthy tech company looking to buy smaller firms, the news is less good because you will probably have to pay a large premium to snag startups.</li>

Sometimes startups build businesses to solve human problems. PairTree is one such company. Per Devin, it wants to make part of the adoption process easier with an “online matching platform where expectant mothers and hopeful adopters can find each other without the facilitation of an agency or other organization.” I love it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/drata-raises-25m-series-a-to-expand-its-security-compliance-platform/"><strong>Drata raises $25M to make security compliance easier</strong></a><strong>: </strong>If you run a company, you have to deal with security compliance. Drata wants to make securing SOC 2 compliance easier. That way, your startup won’t lose a deal over lack of compliance certification, a situation that might lead to you exclaiming “drata!” while smacking your own forehead.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform/">Vercel raises $102M for its next.js service</a>: </strong>You’ve probably heard of next.js, a React framework for front-end development work. Vercel built it with Facebook and Google. Now the company has $102 million more in the bank thanks to a Series C that valued the company at more than $1 billion. Per TechCrunch, traffic to apps and websites on Vercel’s network doubled since October of last year. That’s the sort of usage growth that investors love to see.</li>

<h2>Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein</h2>
<p>In the last year, online apparel shopping app Shein grew active daily users by 130%, reports Apptopia.</p>
<p>Each day, thousands of new products arrive on the app&#8217;s virtual shelves. Items are rapidly designed and prototyped before Shein&#8217;s contractors put them into production in Guangzhou factories — two weeks later, those SKUs arrive in fulfillment centers around the globe.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Rita Liao examined how the company&#8217;s agile supply chain has become hot talk among e-commerce experts, but beyond a strong logistics game and data-driven product development, Shein&#8217;s close relationships with suppliers are integral to its success.</p>
<p>She also tried to answer a question many are asking: Is Shein a Chinese company?</p>
<p>“It’s hard to pin down where Shein is from,&#8221; answered Richard Xu from Grand View Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a company with operations and supply chains in China targeting the global market, with nearly no business in China.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>We’re taking a break from politics today, so if you wanted even more updates about how India is taking on one American tech company or another, we are sorry. A lot of other stuff happened, however, that is pretty neat:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/ford-micromobility-subsidiary-spin-launches-first-in-house-built-e-scooter/"><strong>Ford is keeping scooter dreams alive</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Remember when Ford bought Spin? It was a great moment for the micromobility space. Today, Spin launched its first in-house scooter. So, if you need two small wheels and a battery pack, Ford has you covered. Recall that Ford is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">investing heavily</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">electric cars</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">trucks</a> as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/salesforce-aws-announce-extended-partnership-with-further-two-way-integration/">Amazon and Salesforce buddy up even more</a>: </strong>The growing partnership between Amazon and Salesforce took a new step today, with the two major American tech companies announcing “a new set of integration capabilities to make it easier to share data and build applications that cross the two platforms.” Amazon competes with Microsoft in the public cloud world, and Salesforce competes with Microsoft in the CRM space. So to see the pair of them hold hands is not a huge surprise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide/">TikTok has real competition</a>: </strong>TikTok’s chief rival in China just hit the 1 billion monthly active user (MAU) mark. That’s a real accomplishment, given that the world only has 8 billion or so folks in it. Kuaishou, the app in question, has only 150 million non-Chinese MAUs, for what it’s worth, making it more of a giant domestic player in China than an international heavyweight. That may change, of course, if it keeps growing as it has been.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a little thing, but one worth savoring.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re tired of your Instagram feed mostly being a chaotic mashup of screencapped tweets and reshared TikToks, well, those things probably aren&#8217;t going away but one is about to look a lot better.</p>
<p>Twitter just added the capability to share a tweet directly to Instagram Stories, letting you port over your clever cross-platform moments properly. You can&#8217;t tap the tweets to hop back to Twitter, but they look nice now. Unfortunately for Android users, it&#8217;s iOS-only for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Skip the screenshots –– sharing Tweets to Instagram Stories right from the share menu is now rolling out to everyone on iOS!</p>
<p>Tap the share icon on a Tweet and select “Instagram Stories”. Once your Instagram app opens, you can resize/reposition the Tweet sticker before posting. <a href="https://t.co/R1qayqMwYl">https://t.co/R1qayqMwYl</a> <a href="https://t.co/yp82IH5Tuk">pic.twitter.com/yp82IH5Tuk</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The new cross-platform feature is just a tiny sample of Twitter&#8217;s refreshing recent flurry of product activity — a result of mounting pressure from investors who accused the company of stagnating and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/twitter-elliott-silver-lake/">planned to oust its CEO, Jack Dorsey</a>. The company also just added two more major features to empower users to monetize their tweets:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/"> paid subscriptions known as &#8220;Super Follows&#8221; and ticketed events</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter users have long waited for a laundry list of small quality-of-life tweaks to manifest, a phenomenon that often materializes as an entire cohort of journalists complaining about how you still can&#8217;t edit tweets. But if it can keep the pace, Twitter might finally be ready to deliver.</p>
<p>See, doesn&#8217;t that look nice?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird has announced the launch of shared e-bikes to its fleet of e-scooters, which it says can be found in over 250 cities around the world. The shared micromobility provider is also launching a so-called ‘Smart Bikeshare’ platform that allows local shared bike and e-moped providers and transit apps to integrate with Bird’s app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shared e-scooters catapulted shared micromobility to the center stage of eco-friendly</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transportation in cities by providing more than 150 million zero-emission trips globally,” said</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement. “We are launching our shared Bird Bike and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Bikeshare platform to meet fast-growing demand from cities and riders for more</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainable transportation options while expanding our serviceable addressable market by 5</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">billion trips per year.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement comes just a month after Bird dropped</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/next-gen-bird-three-scooter-comes-with-bigger-battery-and-better-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its new Bird Three scooter with better battery life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The micromobility giant&#8217;s shared e-bike will roll out later this year, with Cleveland, Ohio, being one of the first markets, according to a spokesperson for the company. In a statement, Bird said the bike will be available in select cities throughout North America, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland and France this year. Bird did not say how many e-bikes it would be launching or give a more specific launch date.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird also did not respond to whether or not the e-bike is designed or manufactured by the company, and if not, which manufacturer the company is working with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bird Bike is built on a 75-pound frame with a step-through design that can drive riders up hills with as much as a 20% grade, according to the company. It’ll have a front basket, large pneumatic tires and all the on-board geofencing and diagnostics that you’d expect from a Bird vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bird Bike is not Bird’s first bike. In the summer of 2019, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/bird-is-launching-a-two-seater-electric-vehicle-to-become-more-than-a-kick-scooter-startup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company unveiled its Bird Cruiser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electric cross between a bike and a moped that could seat up to two people. But they decided to pause the pilot last year at the onset of the pandemic, according to a spokesperson for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird’s bikeshare platform has already kicked off in Italy with local e-moped company <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/italy-bird-zig-zag-local-multimodal-mobility/">Zig Zag</a>, displaying the Italian company’s vehicles alongside its own in the Bird app. Bird says it wants to collaborate with other micromobility companies around the world and is in talks with groups like the North American Bikeshare Association to do so in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird did not answer questions about whether it would receive a cut of local operators’ profits if booked through the Bird app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement from the company, Bird’s bikeshare platform makes the company “the first scooter operator to integrate with local shared bike and e-moped providers.” Bird does not currently have plans to integrate third party, e-scooter providers into their app, according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Bird isn’t collaborating with local e-scooter providers, sharing its platform with e-bike and e-moped providers allows it the chance to have more of a multi-modal presence without doing the heavy lifting of actually launching multi-modal fleets. At the very least, these collaborations will also give Bird a better idea of where and how riders are using different vehicles, which could help the company decide on new mobility modes to invest in, while also informing its own expansion plans, especially in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird did not confirm whether this is a part of its bikeshare platform strategy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI has been filling in the gaps for illustrators and photographers for years now — literally, it intelligently fills gaps with visual content. But the latest tools are aimed at letting an AI give artists a hand from the earliest, blank-canvas stages of a piece. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/23/studio-canvas-app/">Nvidia&#8217;s new Canvas tool</a> lets the creator rough in a landscape like paint-by-numbers blobs, then fills it in with convincingly photorealistic (if not quite gallery-ready) content.</p>
<p>Each distinct color represents a different type of feature: mountains, water, grass, ruins, etc. When colors are blobbed onto the canvas, the crude sketch is passed to a generative adversarial network. GANs essentially pass content back and forth between a creator AI that tries to make (in this case) a realistic image and a detector AI that evaluates how realistic that image is. These work together to make what they think is a fairly realistic depiction of what&#8217;s been suggested.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty much a more user-friendly version of the prototype <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/nvidia-ai-turns-sketches-into-photorealistic-landscapes-in-seconds/">GauGAN</a> (get it?) shown at CVPR in 2019. This one is much smoother around the edges, produces better imagery, and can run on any Windows computer with a decent Nvidia graphics card.</p>
<p>This method has been used to create very realistic faces, animals and landscapes, though there&#8217;s usually some kind of &#8220;tell&#8221; that a human can spot. But the Canvas app isn&#8217;t trying to make something indistinguishable from reality — as concept artist Jama Jurabaev explains in the video below, it&#8217;s more about being able to experiment freely with imagery more detailed than a doodle.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlZYRwJ2oJg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For instance, if you want to have a moldering ruin in a field with a river off to one side, a quick pencil sketch can only tell you so much about what the final piece might look like. What if you have it one way in your head, and then two hours of painting and coloring later you realize that because the sun is setting on the left side of the painting, it makes the shadows awkward in the foreground?</p>
<p>If instead you just scribbled these features into Canvas, you might see that this was the case right away, and move on to the next idea. There are even ways to quickly change the time of day, palette, and other high-level parameters so they can quickly be evaluated as options.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169471" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/canvas-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169471" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169471" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/canvas-1.gif" alt="Animation of an artist sketching while an AI interprets his strokes as photorealistic features." width="700" height="337" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169471" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of blank canvas any more,&#8221; said Jurabaev. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to make very big changes, because I know there&#8217;s always AI helping me out with details&#8230; I can put all my effort into the creative side of things, and I&#8217;ll let Canvas handle the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/google-has-created-an-ai-powered-nightmare-creature-generator/">Google&#8217;s Chimera Painter</a>, if you remember that particular nightmare fuel, in which an almost identical process was used to create fantastic animals. Instead of snow, rock and bushes, it had hind leg, fur, teeth and so on, which made it rather more complicated to use and easy to go wrong with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075466" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075466" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2075466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg 1525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chimera.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2075466" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / Google</p></div></p>
<p>Still, it may be better than the alternative, for certainly an amateur like myself could never draw even the weird tube-like animals that resulted from basic blob painting.</p>
<p>Unlike the Chimera Creator, however, this app is run locally, and requires a beefy Nvidia video card to do it. GPUs have long been the hardware of choice for machine learning applications, and something like a real-time GAN definitely needs a chunky one. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/">You can download the app for free here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;ve likely seen the headlines surrounding the pretty major decline in NFT sales from the market&#8217;s recent peak, with some reports indicating as much as a 90 percent decline in recent weeks. And while plenty of crypto speculators are on the losing end of that rapid decline, others see a future where digital collectible and digital goods take over the internet.</p>
<p>NFT marketplace <a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a> announced Wednesday that they&#8217;ve closed a $14.2 million Series A from Venrock Capital, CoinFund and 01 Advisors. The startup allows users to buy and auction off digital art. The firm also has its own Rarible governance token which allows users to make and vote on proposals around the platform&#8217;s features and fees.</p>
<p>The startup says it has reached $150 million in sales on the platform since launching 18 months ago.</p>
<p>NFT startups have raised major sums in recent months as investors coalesced around backing early players in the digital collectibles space. OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT hubs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">raised a $23 million funding round</a> in early spring from Andreessen Horowitz and Naval Ravikant. In March, invite-only NFT marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nft-art-marketplace-superrare-closes-9-million-series-a/">SuperRare raised a $9 million Series A</a>. Last month,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/bitski-raises-19-million-from-a16z-to-become-the-shopify-for-nfts/"> Bitski raised $19 million</a> in bid to become the &#8220;Shopify of NFTs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alongside the funding announcement, Rarible shared that they&#8217;ve officially partnered with NBA Top Shot maker Dapper Labs to bring their NFT marketplace to Dapper&#8217;s Flow blockchain. Dapper Labs has begun building out a wider coalition of NFT platforms on its proprietary blockchain which is more energy efficient and less costly than transactions on the Ethereum network, though it is also much more centralized. Rarible says they will make this transition in the &#8220;next couple of months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup has broad goals for making the NFT space more approachable to everyday web users, saying in a a <a href="https://rarible.medium.com/nfts-for-everyone-rarible-raises-14-2-million-88abee23b764">blog post</a> that they hope to use this funding to explore more user-friendly developments like accepting credit card payments. &#8220;We need a world where an indie creator can effortlessly create an NFT and sell it for $5 to his community of supporters, as well as where a pop icon can use NFTs to establish close contact with her multi-million audience in a sustainable way,&#8221; the post reads.</p>

		Ken Fine is the CEO of<a href="https://heap.io/"> Heap</a>, a digital insights platform on a mission to power business decisions with truth. 
	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I firmly believe that principles as much as products drive a company’s success. A startup may have a persuasive brand story and good public relations, but if it’s internally inconsistent &#8212; if its employees and executives cannot identify its central values &#8212; sooner or later there will be trouble.</p>
<p>At Heap, the analytics solution provider I lead, a defining principle is that good ideas should not be lost to top-down dictates and overrigid hierarchies. Although I’m the CEO, I recognize that I don’t always have the best view simply because I’m on top of (the) Heap. The best results come when you approach leadership like you would create a great product — you hypothesize, you test and iterate, and once you get it right, you grow it.</p>

			Most of us have had the experience of receiving a sudden decree “from above” that makes little consideration for the actual, as opposed to the theoretical, situation of people on the ground.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>One-and-done decrees versus agile, iterative change</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve used this method in the businesses I’ve managed. The scientific method, with its cycle of observation, reporting, hypothesizing, experimenting, analyzing and reporting, is a powerful tool for product and process development.</p>
<p>While my process isn’t <em>quite </em>as rigorous as the scientific method and tends to sprint where science slowly marches, it’s based on similar principles. Before I describe the system, a warning: Although it&#8217;s a simple way to iterate new concepts and evaluate new designs, my method requires a genuine commitment to the principles of cooperation and collaboration. In an organization predicated on hierarchy and strict structure, it could be a recipe for groupthink and unearned consensus. Iteration is not, however, a justification for delay: There may be several iterations of a project, but those iterations follow each other quickly.</p>
<p>Most of us have had the experience of receiving a sudden decree “from above” that makes little consideration for the actual, as opposed to the theoretical, situation of people on the ground. You know the kind of thing I mean: The sales team in the saturated territory is told they must increase revenue by 20%, the already lean division is told to cut costs by 10%. Moves like this are bad for morale; they inspire resentment and cut corners. It’s precisely to avoid this kind of top-down debacle that Heap takes a collaborative and iterative approach to change.</p>
<h2>Passing ideas back and forth</h2>
<p>We put our business’ best minds to work to devise an initial prototype of whatever our business may need. That prototype might be a minimum viable product for commercial release, polished messaging for our forthcoming releases, or even a compendium of internal workflows.</p>
<p>But we can’t consider a project perfect if it’s never been exposed to the world outside the office. Whether we’re crafting a project, tweaking our messaging or establishing pricing tiers, we test in the real world. We show products to consumers, prospects and advisers, who invariably have needs that we hadn’t anticipated. The testers’ concerns may send us rushing back to the drawing board, but that’s accepted and expected. It’s the testing and refining that leads to the best product. While some businesses prefer a rush to market, we’ve observed that doesn’t work. A rushed product will frustrate users, lose word-of-mouth enthusiasm and provide an opportunity to our competitors.</p>
<p>But this isn’t just for product releases; we adopt a similar strategy for determining changes inside the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon revolutionized one-click shopping, and it has a nearly $2 trillion market cap to show for the effort.</p>
<p>Now, a 10-person startup founded by JD Maresco, who previously cofounded the public safety app Citizen, says it plans to make it a lot easier for retailers who sell directly to their customers to make re-ordering their products just as fast and simple through its QR codes. Indeed, Maresco&#8217;s new startup, <a href="https://www.getbatch.com/">Batch</a>, is already working with numerous products and brands that use Shopify, promising their customers &#8220;one-tap checkout&#8221; when it&#8217;s time to reorder an item as long as the retailer has slapped one of Batch&#8217;s codes on their items or incorporated the codes directly into their packaging.</p>
<p>For the moment, New York-based Batch is wholly reliant on Apple&#8217;s App Clip technology, which produces a lightweight version of an app to save people from having to download and install it before using it. (Users can instead load just a small part of an app on demand, and when they’re done, the App Clip disappears.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Maresco &#8212; whose company just raised $5 million in seed funding co-led by Coatue and Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six, with participation from Weekend Fund, Shrug Capital, and the Chainsmokers, among others &#8212; says Batch will eventually work on both iOS and Android phones. We talked with him yesterday to learn more about Batch&#8217;s ambitions to make the physical world &#8220;instantly shoppable.&#8221; Our chat has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Citizen and Batch are very different companies. Is there a unifying thread?</strong></p>
<p>JM: I&#8217;ve spent a good portion of my career, trying to change the way people think about and interact with their physical environment. With Citizen, we were questioning why everyone doesn&#8217;t have immediate access to information about what the police are doing in our neighborhoods. With Batch, we&#8217;re asking a simpler question but something that matters to me as a consumer: Why isn&#8217;t it easier for me to get more of a product I love and use?</p>
<p>With subscriptions in general, I&#8217;ve found myself constantly frustrated because every few weeks I&#8217;m emailing to either pause a subscription,  or restart it. I wanted an easier way to use my phone to reorder in 10 seconds on the spot. Our phones are capable of much more than we put them to use for and, so we set out to tackle that problem.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Right now, Batch integrates with Shopify alone, correct?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We have a Shopify plugin that brands can connect into the Batch platform, and then we integrate the experience, all the way from the physical world wherever this QR code lives, through the purchase experience on the mobile side of things into their fulfillment on the back end. But we&#8217;re also expanding to other e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And Batch takes a per-transaction fee from every item that&#8217;s purchased using your codes?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We&#8217;re developing our pricing model over time, but currently we&#8217;re taking a service percentage-based fee.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How are you getting brands to partner with you?</strong></p>
<p>JM: Brands are starting to wake up to this idea that they can actually create a new retail channel off their physical packaging, where a customer can effectively shop throughout their home or their place of work or anywhere where they interact with these products the moment they run out of an item. So we&#8217;ve been able to spend time with dozens of brands now, and work with them to actually reengineer their packaging and say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s put QR codes front and center and figure out how to make this a really important customer touchpoint.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many brands are using the codes currently?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We&#8217;re launching dozens of brands this summer. We&#8217;ve had overwhelming demand, to be honest, and we haven&#8217;t really even fully launched yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: These are physical codes that you&#8217;re sending off to your retail partners &#8212; stickers, magnets. Are you also creating digital QR codes?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We have customers that are integrating QR codes into out-of-home advertisements, into direct mail, into T shirts, into promotional vans, so we&#8217;re not just limited to packaging. There&#8217;s a wide range of places that you can integrate QR codes for your customers.</p>

<p><strong>TC: It&#8217;s interesting that Coatue led your round. We&#8217;ve seen the firm delve more into early-stage deals but a seed round seems anomalous. How did you connect?</strong></p>
<p>JM: We met during the seed process. They reached out to me and I developed a relationship with Andy Chen and Matt Mazzeo and it was a great opportunity to work with their platform &#8212; the way they support the go-to-market motion around B2B companies; they have a great data platform.</p>
<p>Alexis [Ohanian&#8217;s] experience in the consumer space was really appealing, too.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your company makes sense, but I wonder what&#8217;s special about these codes. What&#8217;s to prevent countless other startups from doing what you&#8217;re doing?</strong></p>
<p>JM: QR codes are all over the place. The product we&#8217;re building makes it really easy for brands to create high converting shopping experiences and a native mobile interface. It&#8217;s a combination of our Shopify integration and our native product design experience and the relationships we have with these brands and how we help them with their packaging that&#8217;s not something you can spin up overnight.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I have to ask about Citizen, which was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">in the headlines</a> recently for all the wrong reasons. Is there anything you want to say about the company or the app or some of that recent coverage?</strong></p>
<p>JM:  I&#8217;m not going to comment on the recent press, but I continue to be proud of what the company is continuing to do to help communities stay safe and understand what police and first responders are doing in their neighborhoods.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For many companies in the United States, a board of directors is a fact of doing business. While sole proprietorships and LLCs are not obligated to have one, C and S corporations must. The board’s goal is to ensure the best is done for the company and its shareholders. While many entrepreneurs see board meetings as a chore, they can be a powerful tool if used well.</p>
<h2>Communicate often</h2>
<p>While board meetings usually happen quarterly, it’s good practice to keep the conversation going in between them. Sending a monthly email update to the board offers multiple advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shorter updates</strong>: Business professionals’ attention spans are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/infographic-shrinking-attention-span-n110801">shrinking</a>. Shorter content is easier to digest, and therefore more likely to be read.</li>
<li><strong>Timely feedback</strong>: A quarter can be a long time, especially for young startups or during challenging times. The monthly format allows the company to receive help or feedback from the board earlier. In business, speed of iteration is key!</li>
<li><strong>Keep them posted</strong>: Keeping directors up to date will avoid lengthy updates during board meetings, ensuring focus remains on strategic conversations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reach out when in need</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When meeting online, founders should pause often and regularly ask if there are questions — even if moments of silence feel awkward at times — to give directors a better opportunity to speak up.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Board members can also be solicited on an ad-hoc basis &#8212; founders should keep in mind that board members are here to help the company. If you have doubts about a project decision or want a second, informed opinion, reach out to a board member. This is especially true of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/the-hidden-benefits-of-adding-a-cto-to-your-board/">directors</a> who have expertise on a specific topic. A quick five-minute call can be a game changer.</p>
<p>Being a founder can be a lonely experience because it can be difficult to discuss sensitive matters with the team. Board members should sign nondisclosure agreements, allowing entrepreneurs to share confidential information and get a different perspective on things.</p>
<h2>Discuss goals for the next fundraising event</h2>
<p>Founders should make sure to regularly discuss business goals to ensure they reach their next round of funding. Because the industry landscape or economy evolved or the competition stepped up, investors may reconsider their expectations to further fund the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a Battery Ventures associate in 1999, I used to spend my nights highlighting actual magazines called Red Herring, InfoWorld and The Industry Standard, plus my personal favorites StorageWorld and Mass High Tech (because the other VC associates rarely scanned these).</p>
<p>As a 23-year-old, I’d circle the names of much older CEOs who worked at companies like IBM, EMC, Alcatel or Nortel to learn more about what they were doing. The companies were building mainframe-to-server replication technologies, IP switches and nascent web/security services on top.</p>
<p>Flash forward 22 years and, in a way, nothing has changed. We have gone from command line to GUI to now API as the interface innovation. But humans still need an interface, one that works for more types of people on more types of devices. We no longer talk about the OSI stack &#8212; we talk about the decentralized blockchain stack. We no longer talk about compute, data storage and analysis on a mainframe, but rather on the cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problems and opportunities have stayed quite similar, but the markets and opportunities have gotten much larger. AWS and Azure cloud businesses alone added $23 billion of run-rate revenue in the last year, growing at 32% and 50%, respectively &#8212; high growth on an already massive base.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The size of the cybersecurity market has gotten infinitely larger as software eats the world and more people are able to sit and feast at the table from anywhere on Earth (and, soon enough, space).					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The size of the cybersecurity market, in particular, has gotten infinitely larger as software eats the world and more people are able to sit and feast at the table from anywhere on Earth (and, soon enough, space).</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, my colleague Spencer Calvert and I released a series of pieces about why this market opportunity is growing so rapidly: <a href="https://ventureinside.com/how-the-shared-responsibility-model-complicates-cloud-security-cb8a7b307195">the rise of multicloud environments</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/">data being generated and stored faster than anyone can keep up with it</a>, <a href="https://ventureinside.com/securing-the-everything-as-a-service-world-eaf5c327c004">SaaS applications powering virtually every function across an organization</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/bring-cisos-into-the-c-suite-to-bake-cybersecurity-into-company-culture/?tpcc=ECTW2020">CISOs’ rise in political power and strategic responsibility.</a></p>
<p>This all ladders up to an estimated &#8212; and we think conservative &#8212; $100 billion of new market value by 2025 alone, putting total market size at close to $280 billion.</p>
<p>In other words, opportunities are ripe for massive business value creation in cybersecurity. We think many unicorns will be built in these spaces, and while we are still in the early innings, there are a few specific areas where we’re looking to make bets (and one big-picture, still-developing area). Specifically, Upfront is actively looking for companies building in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data security and data abstraction.</li>
<li>Zero-trust, broadly applied.</li>
<li>Supply chains.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Data security and abstraction</h2>
<p>Data is not a new thesis, but I am excited to look at the change in data stacks from an initial cybersecurity lens. What set of opportunities can emerge if we view security at the bottom of the stack &#8212; foundational &#8212; rather than as an application at the top or to the side?</p>

<p>For example, data is expanding faster than we can secure it. We need to first know where the (structured and unstructured) data is located, what data is being stored, confirm proper security posture and prioritize fixing the most important issues at the right speed.</p>
<p>Doing this at scale requires smart passive mapping, along with heuristics and rules to pull the signal from the noise in an increasingly data-rich (noisy) world. <a href="https://www.openraven.com/">Open Raven</a>, an Upfront portfolio company, is building a solution to discover and protect structured and unstructured data at scale across cloud environments. New large platform companies will be built in the data security space as the point of control moves from the network layer to the data layer.</p>
<p>We believe Open Raven is poised to be a leader in this space and also will power a new generation of “output” or application companies yet to be funded. These companies could be as big as Salesforce or Workday, built with data abstracted and managed differently from the start.</p>

<p>If we look at security data at the point it is created or discovered, new platforms like Open Raven may lead to the emergence of an entirely new ecosystem of apps, ranging from those Open Raven is most likely to build in-house &#8212; like compliance workflows &#8212; to entirely new companies that rebuild apps we have used since the beginning of time, which includes everything from people management systems to CRMs to product analytics to your marketing attribution tools.</p>
<p>Platforms that lead with a security-first, foundational lens have the potential to power a new generation of applications companies with a laser-focus on the customer engagement layer or the “output” layer, leaving the data cataloging, opinionated data models and data applications to third parties that handle data mapping, security and compliance.</p>

<p>Put simply, if full-stack applications look like layers of the Earth, with UX as the crust, that crust can become better and deeper with foundational horizontal companies underneath meeting all the requirements surrounding personally identifiable information and GDPR, which are foisted upon companies that currently have data <em>everywhere</em>. This can free up time for new application companies to focus their creative talent even more deeply on the human-to-software engagement layer, building superhuman apps for every existing category.</p>
<h2>Zero-trust</h2>
<p>Zero-trust was first coined in 2010, but applications are still being discovered and large businesses are being built around the idea. Zero-trust, for those getting up to speed, is the assumption that anyone accessing your system, devices, etc., is a bad actor.</p>
<p>This could sound paranoid, but think about the last time you visited a Big Tech campus. Could you walk in past reception and security without a guest pass or name badge? Absolutely not. Same with virtual spaces and access. My first in-depth course on zero-trust security was with Fleetsmith. I invested in Fleetsmith in 2017, a young team building software to manage apps, settings and security preferences for organizations powered by Apple devices. Zero-trust in the context of Fleetsmith was about device setup and permissions. Fleetsmith was acquired by Apple in mid-2020.</p>
<p>About the same time as the Fleetsmith acquisition, I met Art Poghosyan and the team at <a href="https://www.britive.com/">Britive</a>. This team is also deploying zero-trust for dynamic permissioning in the cloud. Britive is being built under the premise of zero-trust Just-in-time (JIT) access, whereby users are granted ephemeral access dynamically rather than the legacy process of “checking out” and “checking in” credentials.</p>
<p>By granting temporary privilege access instead of “always-on” credentials, Britive is able to drastically reduce cyber risks associated with over-privileged accounts, the time to manage privilege access and the workflows to streamline privileged access management across multicloud environments.</p>
<p>What’s next in zero-based trust (ZBT)? We see device and access as the new perimeter, as workers flex devices and locations for their work and have invested around this with Fleetsmith and now Britive. But we still think there is more ground to cover for ZBT to permeate more mundane processes. Passwords are an example of something that is, in theory, zero-trust (you must continually prove who you are). But they are woefully inadequate.</p>

<p>Phishing attacks to steal passwords are the most <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/solutions/secure-your-business/business-security-tips/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:security:8003162844&amp;utm_term=verizon%20breach%20report&amp;utm_medium=knc&amp;utm_source=ggl&amp;utm_campaign=security&amp;utm_content=ac:ent:8003162844&amp;utm_term=verizon%20breach%20report&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8cCGBhB6EiwAgORey9NsEHC9r5lkOJjXY3z4hn5kmXuHGwTvd-l4GRA3psPS4cGDhFExrRoCdYoQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">common path to data breaches</a>. But how do you get users to adopt password managers, password rotation, dual-factor authentication or even passwordless solutions? We want to back simple, elegant solutions to instill ZBT elements into common workflows.</p>
<h2>Supply chains</h2>
<p>Modern software is assembled using third-party and open-source components. This assembly line of public code packages and third-party APIs is known as a supply chain. Attacks that target this assembly line are referred to as supply chain attacks.</p>
<p>Some supply chain attacks can be mitigated by existing application-security tools like <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> and other SCA tools for open-source dependencies, such as Bridgecrew to automate security engineering and fix misconfigurations and Veracode for security scanning.</p>
<p>But other vulnerabilities can be extremely challenging to detect. Take the supply chain attack that took center stage &#8212; the SolarWinds hack of 2020 &#8212; in which a small snippet of code was altered in a SolarWinds update before spreading to 18,000 different companies, all of which relied on SolarWinds software for network monitoring or other services.</p>

<p>How do you protect yourself from malicious code hidden in a version update of a trusted vendor that passed all of your security onboarding? How do you maintain visibility over your entire supply chain? Here we have more questions than answers, but securing supply chains is a space we will continue to explore, and we predict large companies will be built to securely vet, onboard, monitor and offboard third-party vendors, modules, APIs and other dependencies.</p>
<p>If you are building in any of the above spaces, or adjacent spaces, <a href="https://twitter.com/karanortman">please reach out</a>. We readily acknowledge that the cybersecurity landscape is rapidly changing, and if you agree or disagree with any of the arguments above, I want to hear from you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While every food delivery company is trying to get an edge on its rivals with discount codes, faster service, and a turn into the realm of spooky with ghost kitchens and dark stores, a startup built on a lighter, social concept &#8212; letting people see what their friends are chomping on, making it possible to order food and drinks for each other and group order, with buyers picking it all up for themselves &#8212; has just raised a substantial Series B and says that it is already profitable in a number of markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.snackpass.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snackpass</a>, which describes itself as a &#8220;food meets friends&#8221; &#8212; essentially a social commerce platform for ordering from restaurants; &#8220;snack,&#8221; the CEO tells me, has a double meaning of eating, and a flirtatious reference to a cutie pie &#8212; has picked up a $70 million, a super-sized Series B that it will be using to continue expanding to more markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>Conceived four years ago while Kevin Tan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Jamie Marshall, was still a student at Yale studying physics, Snackpass has grown by remaining true to its higher-ed roots. The startup now has 500,000 users across 13 college towns, and has seen its growth explode 7x in the last three months alone. This round values the startup at over $400 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest tranche of funding is coming from an interesting group of investors. Led by Craft Ventures, it also includes Andreessen Horowitz (which led its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/snackpass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21 million Series A</a>), General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and a long list of individual backers that speaks to the attention Snackpass is getting and the place it&#8217;s carving out for itself as a go-to food platform for millennials and younger users.</p>
<p>That list includes AirAngels, the Airbnb alumni investor syndicate; Bastian Lehmann of the Uber-acquired delivery giant Postmates (et tu, Bastian?); David Grutman, a hospitality entrepreneur; Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors; Gaingels; HartBeat Ventures, Kevin Hart’s venture fund; musician celebs the Jonas Brothers; Shrug Capital (the VC that says it&#8217;s interested in consumer startups that are actually interesting to &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/@nivo0o0/announcing-shrug-capital-1bfce52fc19c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-tech</a>&#8221; audiences); Pags Group, the family office of the Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca; hip DJ Steve Aoki; Turner Novak of Banana Capital; William Barnes of Moving Capital; and the Uber alumni investor syndicate.</p>
<p>The vast majority of food-ordering platforms these days are focused on delivery and, in many cases, ways of getting an edge over other platforms in executing on that &#8212; a push that often comes at the expense of margins than are thinner than a Roman pizza. Snackpass&#8217;s big breakthrough, if you could call it that, was to simply dial back from that one-upmanship, moving away from that premise altogether, aiming to disrupt something much more prosaic: the queue.</p>
<p>Tan said Snackpass asked its users what they would do if they weren&#8217;t using the app, and they said, &#8220;Oh, I just stand in line to order,&#8221; he told me in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market share right now is owned by people standing in line at the register, and placing their order. Our vision is that in five years that will no longer exist, like, there will be no more registers. We don&#8217;t think it makes any sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>He notes that for those who really want delivery, people can opt for that, too &#8212; Snackpass integrates with delivery services like UberEats to fulfill that &#8212; but 90% of the orders on Snackpass are pickup, meaning that not only does the company then not have to deal with its own fleets of delivery people, and the infrastructure of that, but the operating costs to provide that are also not there.</p>
<p>It turns out that actually a lot of young people seem happy to pop out to get something nice to eat. It means they get to socialise, and take a selfie with their food or drink (boba tea figures strongly) at the venue where it&#8217;s being bought. It becomes an experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also where the market is in another sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;What people don&#8217;t realize is delivery is only 8% of the restaurant industry,&#8221; Tan told me. &#8220;And while it&#8217;s very much competed for by like big companies, and it&#8217;s a huge market, the restaurant industry, is like, much bigger, it&#8217;s $800 billion. And 90% of that purchasing is still offline,&#8221; he continued, referring to the many people who just queue up, order, buy, and leave. &#8220;It&#8217;s anonymous, and it&#8217;s on the verge of disruption. And we&#8217;re focused on that much bigger blue ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its formula seems to be working with its target users. Tan said that the service has 80% penetration with students in the markets where it has launched. The average customer orders four and a half times a month, with some customers ordering every day. &#8220;You can actually see that it&#8217;s like, five to ten times more engagement than the delivery platforms, like UberEats.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A Grubhub-Uber tie-up would remake the food delivery landscape&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/a-grubhub-uber-tie-up-would-remake-the-food-delivery-landscape/embed/#?secret=d1G2ZOiqRw" data-secret="d1G2ZOiqRw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s commissions vary and start at 7% and it&#8217;s current suite includes online ordering, self-service kiosks, digital menus, marketing services, and a customer referral program. It&#8217;s already profitable (in certain markets) but as it continues to grow (and maybe extend to other demographics) you can imagine it adding and expanding on all of these.</p>
<p>There is something about Snackpass that reminds me a lot of Snapchat, not just that the names have a similar ring to them, and not just that they both have resonated with college-aged users (and not just that they both squarely target them). It&#8217;s something of the whimsy of the app, and how it takes a light touch in its approach to do something that might otherwise feel cumbersome, or mundane, or what, basically, older people do.</p>
<p>Right now, there isn&#8217;t much of a social &#8220;user graph&#8221; <em>per se</em> on Snackpass, nor does it integrate particularly deeply with any specific social apps, but you could imagine a partnership there down the line, especially considering how companies like Snap and Facebook are now getting a whole lot more involved with commerce.</p>
<p>“In building a social experience around food through shared rewards, gifting, and a social activity feed, Snackpass has created a dynamic and attractive restaurant ordering system,” says Bryan Rosenblatt, partner, Craft Ventures, in a statement. “The growth of its marketplace and virality of the product coupled with Snackpass’ outstanding  team and vision, make it the ultimate solution for consumers and businesses alike. We are thrilled to help take Snackpass to the next level with this latest round of funding.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to clarify that Snackpass is profitable in some but not all markets; to correct the spelling and names of some of the investors; and to note that Snackpass currently does not work with DoorDash.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to understand just how steeply the cost of launching and operating satellites has dropped, particularly since the introduction of lower cost launch services from a number of commercial players, and the maturation of the smartphone supply chain. Swarm co-founder and CEO realized just how much the cost curve had changed when she and her co-founder Ben Longmeir realized that they could outfit tiny satellites Longmeir had created as a kind of space lover&#8217;s hobby with the equipment needed to provide low-bandwidth connectivity to low-powered devices around the world.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s episode of Found, Sara walks us through how she went from an engineering career that included stints at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Google, to building Swarm as a first-time founder and CEO. We covered a range of topics including how Sara and Ben decided who would be CEO, what it&#8217;s like leading a small but growing team, and how to evaluate your decisions as a founder, and commit to a course of action to move forward.</p>
<p>Sara was extremely candid with us about her experience as a founder and CEO, and this is definitely one of our most open and honest conversations to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Successfully selling a business has much to do with timing. For many entrepreneurs, it’s the high-stakes end game where they cash out and reap the rewards of their efforts. At a certain point, when both buyers and sellers are working hard to close the deal, negotiations can move very quickly. If you’re the seller, this is not the time to discover unanticipated problems in your business.</p>
<p>Distressingly often, these problems are related to employment. Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals — from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Poor compliance, lack of policies or flawed practices mean potential liability exposure or expensive policy revisions and employee retraining — all of which can devalue your business.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance. It&#8217;s important to get your employment ducks in a row long before you start planning your exit.</p>
<p>What follows is an overview of the three main categories of employment issues that can derail or delay a sale. For the most part, these assume an asset sale, but may vary in the case of a stock sale.</p>
<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>By far the most significant problem is general employment law compliance. This means creating strong employment policies and practices that are documented, in place and operating long before you pursue a deal. The key area is wage and hour issues — timekeeping and payroll practices, worker classification issues (employee vs. independent contractor; exempt vs. non-exempt), meal and rest periods, PTO policies and payouts at termination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly Coronary, a company that uses A.I powered imaging to analyze heart scans, announced a $43 million Series B funding this week. The funding comes at a moment when it seems that a new way of screening for heart disease is on its way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly was started in 2017 by James K. Min a cardiologist, and the director of the Dalio Institute for Cardiac Imaging at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College. The company, which uses A.I to analyze detailed CT scans of the heart, has 60 employees, and has raised $54 million in total funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B round was led by Vensana Capital, but also included LVR Health, New Leaf Venture Partners, DigiTx Partners, and Cigna Ventures. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s aim is to provide analysis of detailed pictures of the human heart that have been examined by artificial intelligence. This analysis is based on images taken via Cardiac Computer Tomography Angiogram (CTA), a new, but rapidly growing manner of scanning for plaques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on the entire heart, so every artery, and its branches, and then atherosclerosis characterization and quantification,” says Min. “We look at all of the plaque buildup in the artery, [and] the walls of the artery, which historical and traditional methods that we&#8217;ve used in cardiology have never been able to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly is a web application, and it requires that a CTA image specifically, which the A.I. is trained to analyze, is actually taken when patients go in for a checkup. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a patient goes in for a heart exam after experiencing a symptom like chest pain, there are a few ways they can be screened. They might undergo a stress test, an echocardiogram (ECG), or a coronary angiogram – a catheter and x-ray-based test. CTA is a newer form of imaging in which a scanner takes detailed images of the heart, which is illuminated with an injected dye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleerly’s platform is designed to analyze those CTA images in detail, but they’ve only recently become a first-line test (a go-to, in essence) when patients come in with suspected heart problems. The European Society of Cardiology </span><a href="https://ihsmd.org/coronary-cta-as-first-line-diagnostic-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make CTA a first-line test in evaluating patients with chronic coronary disease. In the UK, it became a first-line test in the evaluation of patients with chest pain </span><a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2020/09/21/19/06/state-of-the-art-review-on-ccta"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA is already used in the US, but guidelines may expand how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">often </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s actually used. A </span><a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2020/09/21/19/06/state-of-the-art-review-on-ccta"><span style="font-weight: 400;">review on CTA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published on the American College of Cardiology website notes that it shows “extraordinary potential.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s movement on the insurance side, too. In 2020, United Healthcare </span><a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/resource-library/news/2020-network-bulletin-featured-articles/0520-coronary-cta-reimbursement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company will now reimburse for CTA scans when they’re ordered to examine low-to medium risk patients with chest pain. Reimbursement qualification is obviously a huge boon to broader adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA imaging might not be great for people who already have stents in their hearts, or, says Min, those who are just in for a routine checkup (there is low-dose radiation associated with a CTA scan). Rather, Cleerly will focus on patients who have shown symptoms or are already at high risk for heart disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC estimates that currently </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18.2 million adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently have coronary artery heart disease (the most common kind), and that </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/risk_factors.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">47 percent of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have one of the three most prominent risk factors for the disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a smoking habit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These shifts (and anticipated shifts) in guidelines suggest that a lot more of these high-risk patients may be getting CTA scans in the future, and Cleerly has been working on mining additional information from them in several large-scale clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of different risk factors that contribute to heart disease, but the most basic understanding is that heart attacks happen when plaques build up in the arteries, which narrows the arteries and constricts the flow of blood. Clinical trials have suggested that the types of plaques inside the body may contain information about how risky certain blockages are compared to others beyond just much of the artery they block. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718343717?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 25,251 patients found that, indeed, the percentage of construction in the arteries increases the risk of heart attack. But the type of plaque in those arteries identified high-risk patients better than other measures. Patients who went on to have sudden heart attacks, for example, tended to have higher levels of fibrofatty or necrotic core plaque in their hearts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results do suggest that it’s worth knowing a bit more detail about plaque in the heart. Note that Min is an author of this study, but it was also conducted at 13 different medical centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with all A.I based diagnostic tools the big question is: How well does it actually recognize features within a scan? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment FDA documents emphasize that it is </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K190868.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not meant to supplant a trained medical professional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who can interpret the results of a scan. But tests have suggested it fares pretty well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A June 2021 </span><a href="https://www.journalofcardiovascularct.com/article/S1934-5925(21)00081-2/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared Cleerly’s A.I analysis of CTA scans to that of three expert readers, and found that the A.I had a diagnostic accuracy of about 99.7 percent when evaluating patients who had severe narrowing in their arteries. Three of nine study authors hold equity in Cleerly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this most recent round of funding, Min says he aims to pursue more commercial partnerships and scale up to meet the existing demand. “We have sort of stayed under the radar, but we came above the radar because now I think we&#8217;re prepared to fulfill demand,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the product itself will continue to be tested and refined. Cleerly is in the midst of seven performance indication studies that will evaluate just how well the software can spot the litany of plaques that can build up in the heart.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making the choice to adopt, or to find an adopting family, is a legally complex, emotionally taxing, expensive and time-consuming process. <a href="https://pairtreefamily.com">PairTree</a> aims to make one part at least considerably easier and faster with its online matching platform where expectant mothers and hopeful adopters can find each other without the facilitation of an agency or other organization. The company has just raised a $2.25 million seed round, a rarity in the industry.</p>
<p>The path to adoption is different for everyone, but there are generally some things they have in common: Once the process is started, it can take upwards of $50,000 and over a year-and-a-half to organize a match. While some of this comprises the ordinary legal hurdles involved in any adoption, a big part of it is simply that there are limited opportunities for adoption, and compatibility isn&#8217;t guaranteed. As many people considering adoption are doing so on the heels of unsuccessful fertility treatment, it can be a lot to take on and a dispiriting wait.</p>
<p>Erin Quick, CEO and co-founder (with CTO Justin Friberg) of PairTree, said that the modern adoption landscape is marked by the fact that nearly 95 percent of adoptions are open, meaning there is ongoing contact between a biological mother and adopting family.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be working together forever, and that makes finding a highly compatible match that much more important,&#8221; Quick, herself a happy adopter, told TechCrunch in an interview. But because of the way adoption is generally done — through agencies licensed by states — there are limitations on how far anyone involved can reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so bound by geography,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s regulated at the state level and has been facilitated by state level, not because of state laws — there&#8217;s no rule saying you can&#8217;t adopt out of state — but because the facilitators are small nonprofits. They bind themselves to their geographic region because that&#8217;s what they can serve. We&#8217;re building a platform that makes what people are already doing much easier and more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>That platform is in many ways very much like a dating app, though of course the comparison is not exact and does not reflect the gravity of choosing to adopt. But like in the dating world, in adoption you have a cloud of people looking to connect over something highly dependent on personality and individual needs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168876" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168876" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="708" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg 1259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/filter-families.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168876" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of the way expectant mothers can filter and search for compatible adopting families.</p></div></p>
<p>PairTree onboards both expectant mothers and adopters with personality tests — not the light-hearted stuff of OkCupid but a broader, more consequential set of Jungian archetypes that signal a person&#8217;s high-level priorities in life. Think &#8220;wants to travel and learn&#8221; versus &#8220;wants to provide and nurture&#8221; (not that these are necessarily incompatible) — they serve as important indicators of preferences that might not be so easily summarized with a series of checkboxes. That&#8217;s not the only criterion, of course. Other demographic and personal details are also collected.</p>
<p>The adopters are added to a pool through which expectant mothers can sift and, if desired, contact (in this, Quick suggested, PairTree mirrors Bumble, where women must message first). PairTree also does basic due diligence stuff like identify verification and confirmation of other important steps like home studies.</p>
<p>If a likely match is found, all the relevant information is passed to the adoption facilitator, who will be coordinating the other legal and financial steps. PairTree isn&#8217;t looking to replace these agencies — in fact Quick said that they have been huge proponents of the platform, since it can shorten wait times and improve outcomes. She said based on their existing successful adoptions that the wait can be cut by half or even two-thirds, and thus the cost (which involves recurring payments as the agency searches and does the legal work) by a similar amount.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are small nonprofits; they don&#8217;t have a lot of tech chops. When we launched we went to attorneys first, actually, and we were surprised when agencies started reaching out,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>Agencies have been referring their adopters to PairTree, which has led to a lot of early traction, Quick said. And importantly, they&#8217;ve seen great diversity in their early success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adoption has historically been denied by faith-based systems — LGBTQ families and single women have been subject to discrimination,&#8221; she noted. And in fact just last week a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/supreme-court-sides-with-catholic-adoption-agency-that-refuses-to-work-with-lgbt-couples.html">Supreme Court decision</a> held up the right of religious adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples. Quick was proud to say that they have already facilitated adoptions by same-sex couples and single parents.</p>
<p>The company will also set aside 5 percent of its net profits, which hopefully will manifest in volume, for the Lifetime Healing Foundation, which offers counseling and support to birth mothers who have gone though the adoption process.</p>
<p>The $2.25 million seed round was led by Urban Innovation Fund, with Founder Collective, Female Founders Alliance and Techstars participating. It will surprise few to hear that adoption is not a particularly hot industry for venture capital, but rising interest and investment in fertility tech may have shed light on opportunities in adjacent spaces. Adoption is one where significant improvements can be enabled by technology, meaning startups can grow fast while having a positive impact.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the money to expand its product portfolio, pursue more partnerships, and perhaps most importantly for its users, build a native mobile app, since 90 percent of the service&#8217;s viewership is mobile.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful to our expert and diverse group of investors who share our vision that adoption should be a viable path to parenting for more people,&#8221; said Quick in the release announcing the raise. &#8220;Like us, our investors believe in the importance of supporting Biological and Adopting Families along with the Adoptees, because adoption is not a single transaction but a journey they’re taking over the course of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a> founder Amir Nathoo has a message to the edtech sector, which recently found itself under a spotlight thanks to the pandemic: Add your voice, and don’t try to always appear neutral.</p>
<p>The founder of the unicorn business penned a statement, co-signed by other edtech leaders, promoting the continuance of teachers being allowed to teach critical race theory in classrooms across the country. The learning framework, which has been the subject <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/22525983/map-critical-race-theory-legislation-teaching-racism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of recent legislative debate,</span></a> covers the acknowledgement of institutional, and systemic racism in the United States. Critics of critical race theory say that CTR can add more divisiveness to an already polarized world, while supporters see the framework as key to understanding the role that racism plays in society and how current systems perpetuate inequality.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we must take a stand that teaching the wrongs of racism is not &#8216;divisive&#8217;; it is imperative,” the statement reads. “Many of these new laws will require teaching &#8216;both sides&#8217; of a lesson about race or current events, if permitted at all,&#8221; a nuance that would make it difficult for teachers to condemn history like lynching or Jim Crow&#8217;s legacy.</p>
<p>It goes on to pledge that, “as CEOs and Board Members of education technology companies, we are taking a stand to say that any new law that restricts teaching racism in a lesson is unacceptable.”</p>
<blockquote><p>We stand with the thousands of teachers who have come together to protest these laws restricting racism lessons.<br />
We stand with the millions of learners they will impact.<br />
We are signing this letter today so that teachers and students can openly discuss the experiences of Black youth today in the context of the George Floyd protests of 2020.<br />
Above all, we are signing this letter today to say racism is wrong and that hatred based on the color of someone’s skin, religious beliefs, gender, or sexual orientation is wrong, unequivocally wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Signatures on the statement include a number of notable founders and investors in edtech, giving weight to the statement: </span></p>

<h2>Mission-oriented politics</h2>
<p>There is a growing perspective in Silicon Valley that companies should only get involved in politics when it is related to their mission and can impact their business.</p>
<p>The conversation began with Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publishing a memo</span></a> that banned the debate of causes and politics internally that are unrelated to work. Coinbase has since been joined by Basecamp, and there’s a pseudonymous Twitter account, Mission Protocol, dedicated to helping other startups adopt a code of conduct that “follows in Brian Armstrong’s footsteps.”</p>
<p>“We started this project because existing codes of conduct and conversations around social responsibility didn&#8217;t have a voice for what is most important: staying focused on the good we actually deliver for society through our missions,” a tweet from the account reads.</p>
<p>In an interview, Nathoo said that critical race theory “is clearly related” to its mission, but that his company is also taking an “expansive view of how our community can be impacted.” The company says it intends to engage, and add their voice, to issues around race and inequality.</p>
<p>“Ideally, companies would stay out of politics but that&#8217;s not the reality that we live in,” he said. “We think it’s an abdication of corporate responsibility to try and pretend that there&#8217;s both sides to every argument. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s right, and we intend to take a different path on corporate responsibility than other startups might have taken.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.allhere.com/">AllHere</a> CEO Joanna Smith, who signed the statement, told TechCrunch that the statement is tied heavily to her mission. Her company developed a 24/7 chatbot to help families and kids that have issues with absenteeism at schools. The company focuses on supporting families, through two-way text and in-person intervention, to get better outcomes and lessen learning gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think every startup has to be aware of the environment within which they operate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think specifically in education technologies, it would be very difficult to scale a company that&#8217;s directly interfacing and interacting with families and kids, if the company itself is not aware of, or reflective of the needs and priorities of those who they are attempting to serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the luxury of putting on blinders to the realities that families and kids live in, which, for AllHere, includes transportation, health care, absenteeism, mental health and, of course, how families see the world,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What the &#8216;nonpolitical&#8217; startup leader teaches us about company culture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/what-the-non-political-startup-leader-teaches-us-about-company-culture/embed/#?secret=SLCj4OuxsF" data-secret="SLCj4OuxsF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The debate is more complex than pro-Coinbase and anti-Coinbase. For example, both companies present an alternative to how startups should address politics: Tie it to the mission, and view the mission as wide-ranging and inclusive.</p>
<p>Nathoo said that a small number of edtech leaders were invited to sign the edtech statement to start. Of those who didn’t sign, the main reasons were disagreement with messaging, or worry about getting involved in politics.</p>
<p>Edtech startups are in a unique spot to address racism because of the content and mission that many have. Quizlet has a number of free, downloadable lessons for educators to address topics like mass incarceration and policing, the fight for women’s suffrage, and the coronavirus in Black America, for example. Outschool has a number of classes offered about anti-racism, including <a href="https://outschool.com/classes/be-the-rainbow-in-somebodys-cloud-anti-racism-and-empathy-for-kids-4-6-dKHKOA7r?sectionUid=5f6da1d2-1582-41d4-b1c1-a99bbfd9a5d4#abkosjggxe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an $11 one-time class for kids ages 4-6. </span></a>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>Nathoo expects that Outschool’s business, which was recently valued at over $1 billion, will benefit from this choice because of “greater trust and connection” with the community and staff. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium, for example, recently lost more employees</span></a> after CEO Ev Williams published a culture memo, in the wake of a failed unionization attempt.</p>
<p>Even with this perspective, Nathoo admits that the company “is not where it wants to be&#8221; on diversity, and thinks that there is work left to be done. It’s up to future employees on if today’s effort, rallying against the diminishment of critical race theory and for more conversations of racism, will either be an attractive, or dissuasive, reason to join the team.</p>
