										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eight years ago, Nike decided it was time to expand the Nike Sports Research Lab (NSRL), which was housed in the Mia Hamm building across company headquarters.</p>
<p>Now a full five times the size of its former self, the NSRL, which occupies the top floor of the brand-new LeBron James Innovation Center, is big enough to allow collaboration among athletes, researchers and innovators as they develop the products we wear every day.</p>
<p>Studying soccer stars like Megan Rapinoe and the world’s fastest marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge &#8212; for everything from the differences in millimeters between each of their feet to the amount of force projected every time their feet touch the ground &#8212; helps researchers develop guidelines that help creators design apparel and footwear to enhance performance. Athletes also train with the support of Nike scientists in order to learn more about themselves and their bodies to benefit their performance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222909" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the NSRL is not just for the world’s elite athletes; it’s for those who play pick-up basketball games on concrete courts in city parks, neighborhood runners and expectant and new parents like those highlighted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-5MGkUwe6w">Nike’s “The Toughest Athlete” film</a>.</p>
<p>Matt Nurse, vice president of the Nike Explore Team Sport Research Lab, says there are times Nike tries to pursue a deeper understanding more quickly.</p>
<p>“The other type of science is this big data, observational stuff using machine learning or AI to start to understand lots of different inventions for movement.”</p>
<p>He says 80% to 85% of the people who come through the lab are everyday athletes from different backgrounds with diverse body types. With a plan to bring thousands of active bodies through the door, Nike can increase the learnings and the speed of development with the new space.</p>
<p>Nike recently invited members of the media to experience firsthand how athletes, researchers and innovators interact to develop Nike products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222915" style="width: 2616px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222915" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2222915 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg" alt="Entrance to the LeBron James Innovation Center" width="2606" height="1466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg 2606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LeBron-James-Center-composite.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2606px) 100vw, 2606px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222915" class="wp-caption-text">Entrance to the LeBron James Innovation Center. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rae Witte / Composite: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The entranceway of the 750,000-square-foot LeBron James Innovation Center sets the tone for Nike’s commitment, nearly a decade in the making, to utilizing data and design for innovation.</p>
<p>Every one of James’ shot attempts that led to his 30,000 professional career points is mapped on the polished concrete floor in front of a golden hoop. Shots are differentiated by golden dots and empty zeros, representative of points made and missed. Milestone moments are highlighted with larger captioned markers on the floor, including his first made shot and his 20,000th point.</p>
<p>Above the main floor are the apparel and footwear prototypes: Designers and creators occupy spaces with robotics and 3D printers, as well as knit, textile and embroidery sections. There is even a replica of the Winnebago that Nike co-founder Phil Knight traveled to track meets in. Once there, he&#8217;d pass out the earliest iterations of Nike footwear in order to get feedback from the athletes.</p>
<p>The 84,000-square-foot NSRL occupies the top floor of the building and is where researchers and athletes come together to develop Nike footwear and attire. The NSRL includes a full-size, NBA regulation court, a 200-meter track, climate chambers and artificial training turf. These areas contain a combination of 92 force plates, 400 motion capture cameras and 80 prototyping machines.</p>
<p>Force plates, which Nurse describes as glorified bathroom scales, are located beneath the surface of the track, turf and basketball courts. Unlike the typical bathroom scale that offers one reading when you step on it, he says, “these measure tens of thousands of times a second in three dimensions. So not just straight up and down but side to side, back and front.”</p>
<p>For example, for a runner on the track, they’d be able to measure the force with which the foot is connecting and pushing off the ground.</p>
<p>The additional space in the NSRL allows for more fluid and less restricted gameplay and movement.</p>
<p>“One of the goals here is to allow athletes to come in full speed, full motion and also [in] continuous play,” Nurse said. “Sometimes in small facilities, the movements become choreographed, and that’s it. Now, we can have people come in and play.”</p>
<h2>Sweating in the lab</h2>
<p>To inform researchers how all of the tools within the space are leveraged for controlled experimentation and observational big data collection, Nurse said they try to understand three pillars of the triangle: “What’s the dose, what’s the behavior and what’s the response. If we have the dose, response and behavior, a prototype has to give us enough information to do that. We think it’s a solution to look for problems.”</p>
<p>On our tour of the lab, we underwent some of the same testing that Nike designed for its athletes, which included work on the basketball court, track and turf and in the treadmill bays.</p>
<p>We started with a collection of baseline data: a full body scan to determine optimal Nike apparel fit; morphological body size tracking and skeletal and muscular asymmetries; a separate, three-dimensional scan of my feet and ankles; and a barefoot walking pressure test before the Applied Performance Innovation Treadmill. I chose a comfortable speed for a jog and was instructed to run for two to three minutes while they recorded it for analysis.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JRnTIUh5Qo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Researchers can provide observations on form, such as whether athletes are too bouncy, run on their toes or lean forward too much.</p>
<p>They can also make functional recommendations. For example, a runner who leans forward too much may need to strengthen their glutes or hamstrings for a more efficient gait.</p>
<p>Based on what they know biomechanically and through their algorithm development to understand products and athletes, using this testing combined with the baseline data, researchers can make footwear recommendations for optimal efficiency &#8212; whether that’s running faster, longer and/or with less stress on the body.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHTkMwqiLmk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2>The track</h2>
<p>The track itself surrounds both the turf and the basketball court, and it features force plates and motion capture cameras that can be utilized for long runs or more segmented testing, such as starts. An LED Rabbit or pacer offers another layer of control to experiments, and there’s a 100-meter concrete strip to simulate running outdoors.</p>
<p>On the track I was able to test out two different footwear options. Their Infinity Reacts are meant for protection, lower stress on the body and stability. I was able to make it around the track at a comfortable rate in front of the Nike Run Club average runner’s mile pace of 11:37 and well behind sub-2-hour marathoner Eliud Kipchoge’s pace, as indicated by a glowing green LED pacer that spun around the track all day.</p>
<p>However, when I attempted to do a lap with the elite runner’s race shoe of choice, the ZoomX Invincible, we discovered that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/how-nike-is-making-footwear-to-improve-athletes-efficiency-for-the-tokyo-olympics/">the cushion system</a> &#8212; made to be super lightweight with a carbon plate within their exaggerated foam and air system sole &#8212; was not a match for the mechanics of my feet.</p>
<p>The construction, which lends optimal efficiency for some, afforded me &#8212; admittedly a non-runner despite finding I have decent form &#8212; and my very narrow feet, previously injured ankle and flexible (or what I think are loose or weak) ankles a very unstable running experience. I didn&#8217;t even complete the 200-meter lap.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222916" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222916" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222916" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg" alt="Athletes run on the track at the Nike Sport Research Lab" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Track-Nike-Sport-Research-Lab.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222916" class="wp-caption-text">Athletes run on the track at the Nike Sport Research Lab. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nike</p></div></p>
<p>This is where the range of athletes is so crucial. Studying a runner like Kipchoge is incredibly valuable. Because he is so physically efficient, he doesn’t need five hours to complete a marathon and so hasn’t ever run that long. But the global average marathon runner clocks in somewhere between 4 hours and 20 minutes to 4 hours and 40 minutes.</p>
<p>This wide range of data collection will inform footwear innovations through multiple sets of shoes, enabling Nike to develop running shoes appropriate for any runner, whether they’re an elite marathoner or a casual jogger.</p>
<h2>The turf</h2>
<p>The Turf Lab boasts the largest data capture volume in the NSRL and what Nike says may be the largest in the world. Here, force plates below the surface monitor game play and more controlled experiments, allowing researchers to collect data on up to 22 players &#8212; the amount on a soccer field during gameplay &#8212; who are moving at different speeds and directions while interacting with each other, the turf, the cleats and the ball. The turf also has a screen where targets can be projected and accuracy can be recorded for shooting and passing.</p>
<p>Two things Nike specifically focuses on for soccer players’ footwear are functionally very different — the sole for traction and the type of movement the upper requires for dribbling, passing and kicking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222913" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222913" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222913" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg" alt="Man simulating a shot at goal in the Nike Sport Research Lab" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Nike-Sport-Research-Lab-turf-kick-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222913" class="wp-caption-text">Simulating a shot at a goal in the Nike Sport Research Lab. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nike</p></div></p>
<p>The 200 cameras surrounding the area capture submillimeter movement, and below the turf are 15 force plates. By measuring an athlete’s movement in a controlled environment, researchers can drill down into the tiniest changes to make for perform<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ance and for protection, and a lot of the findings can apply to other field sports like baseball, football and rugby.</span></p>
<p>During the soccer test, I simulated the opportunity to take a shot on goal. This included a shuttle run as if I were tackling a defender, running around a defender and then taking the shot at a target projected on a screen within the goal.</p>
<p>In this simulation, they captured the forces when I was cutting back, the timing and agility throughout the route, the timing of my decision-making upon the appearance of the target and the accuracy of the ball with respect to the target.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/981RNphxzBo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The results of this test will speak to the size of the athlete, how explosive they are and how quickly they can push off the force plate beneath them. The power, in addition to the traction of the footwear, translates into the speed of their movement. If the traction were to be insufficient, the same level of force would result in a slower speed.</p>
<p>A shoe with really good traction but poor containment, afforded by the shoes’ upper, will result in the foot sliding within the shoe, because while the footwear is interacting with the ground efficiently, the foot is not.</p>
<p>By contrast, an upper providing good containment and poor traction will fit the foot, but will result in the shoe sliding on the ground. The data allows for alterations like these to be made to the footwear.</p>
<h2>The basketball court</h2>
<p>The force plates beneath the neighboring basketball court capture similar data for basketball players.</p>
<p>Fully surrounded by motion capture cameras, players wear sensors that track their heart rates and the speed of their movements on the court, which can be projected in real time on a large screen on the wall. In addition to those, a force plate with a 4K camera below it is under the hoop and can record the way in which a sneaker sole interacts with the floor.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6AGy7fRYNlg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Coupled with the motion sensor tracking data throughout the drill, depending on the stiffness of the sneaker or the thickness of the sole, they can track how speed is affected by the footwear, and observe and see the sole’s connection to the floor all while the sensor tracks the athlete’s heart rate throughout the movements.</p>
<p>Another camera in the hoop records the position of the ball as it goes through. The data collected from these shots provide suggestions on functional adjustments that result in a more consistent and efficient shot going through the hoop.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222918,2222924,2222919,2222920,2222921,2222922,2222923"]</p>
<h2>The climate chambers</h2>
<p>Understanding moisture management needs between different wearers offers designers guidelines to create more functional clothing. We toured two climate chambers, one hot and the other cold, that can regulate temperature from -20 to over 50 degrees Celsius; humidity from 10%-90%; control wind speed; and simulate the radiant heat of the sun using two different types of bulbs that match the spectral outlet of the sun’s rays.</p>
<p>The chambers can be set to such precision that their hot tank on the day we visited was set to 34 degrees Celsius and 70% humidity — the exact weather conditions on August 6 in Tokyo during this summer’s Olympic Games where some staff and athletes had to be treated for heat exhaustion.</p>
<p>Leveraging the climate chambers allows Nike to evaluate how different apparel designs or zoning of features can have the biggest impact on making garments more breathable.</p>
<p>Because sweating helps to regulate body temperature, the hot chamber is used to study sweating responses in consumers and how they vary based on sex, age and body size.</p>
<p>They showed us their Vapor Match Men’s Soccer jersey, pointing out where the changes in the knit were zoned to the most condensed perspiration areas, which can be seen in the third image <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/us-2020-vapor-match-home-mens-soccer-jersey-vXDRHv">here</a>.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Nike NSRL <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/nsrl-womens-transform-jacket-fKht8V/DB0820-010?nikemt=true&amp;cp=96413943330_search_%7cPRODUCT_GROUP%7cGOOGLE%7c71700000041489782%7cAll_X_X_X_X-Device_X_Nike-Clearance_X%7c%7cc&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqeWKBhBFEiwABo_XBk_BWWwhwp6j2ssabp7D6IB_8vMfkX92NE9i43d0_5FSk-a5yLVlDhoCKRYQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Transform Jacket</a> exhibits the manifestation of the different thermal needs for an outside run. Sleeves that zip off and tuck into chambers on the back of the jacket and removable down fill accommodates the transition from stepping outside to plateau. They’ve found that the day-to-day runner averages about 5 kilometers per run, and the biggest shift in their insulation needs is between start and 2.5 to 3 kilometers. After that, it regulates for the remainder of the exercise, which is also the case for those running beyond 5 kilometers.</p>
<p>Finally, they have thermal mannequins — that sweat! — in order to test zoning features without having to put stress on human bodies. Between the climate control and the bodies to test on that never tire, they’re able to give design teams even more to work with.</p>
<h2>The cool down</h2>
<p>We hear a lot about mental toughness in the world of sport, so it makes sense Nike would want to understand the minds of their athletes, too, particularly as they impact performance.</p>
<p>Studies and recovery at NSRL go far beyond massage, acupuncture and other bodily needs of rest and maintenance that are available in the lab. They’re also taking into account their subjects’ mental state.</p>
<p>Mental health has become a factor in discussions about elite athletes in the media, whether it’s Naomi Osaka opting out of press conferences or Simone Biles being open about her need to sit out the women&#8217;s all-around final at the 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Before taking my baseline measurements, they gave me a cognitive assessment, and at the close of the day, we went through the learnings. Surprisingly (and probably by design), the assessment translates easily between both athletes in regard to sports as it does everyday human behavior.</p>
<p>In pointing out how uncertainty is often so much greater than certainty, the team discussed decision-making and how different results could point to whether an athlete is more prone to decision-making from a place of loss prevention or risk aversion.</p>
<p>These findings can similarly be applied to cognitive recommendations, much like the form or functional recommendations other tests offered. Not only are they trying to create better apparel and footwear, the lab is committed to furthering all aspects of athletes&#8217; abilities.</p>
<p>For example, an athlete struggling with a need for control can try to focus less on the outcome itself and more on the fact that the outcome can be leveraged as an opportunity to benefit future competitions or even process. Similarly, rather than dwelling on a moment or missed shot, sport psychologists will recommend employing mental imagery or visualizing the positive outcome for the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new LeBron James Innovation Center will aid in athletes&#8217; well-being and progress as much as it will afford faster innovations of Nike’s apparel and shoes.</p>
<p>As everything is approached with steps to greater opportunities rather than ticking problems off a list with the entire team in one building, it will be incredible to see what the future holds for the space and its output.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is now profitable and grew over 300% in revenue last year. It now serves over 50,000 customers and makes more than 1.5 million deliveries a month.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anyone purchasing something online has had that one instance where the delivery method failed. <a href="https://americasmi.com/insights/latin-america-e-commerce-market-projections-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Across Latin America, e-commerce purchases</a> are expected to grow by double-digits annually by 2024. That means finding trustworthy — and cost effective — ways to deliver those packages will become more important.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.skydropx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skydropx</a>, a Mexico City-based logistics management company that enables businesses to create an end-to-end automated delivery experience for customers that includes over 250 shipping options, track notifications via WhatsApp, estimated delivery times and return management.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223768" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223768" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223768" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?w=680" alt="Skydropx" width="680" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg 2491w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=1536,1050 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1400 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image0-2.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223768" class="wp-caption-text">Skydropx team</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Tavo Zambrano, Armando Solbes, Óscar Victorín and Daniel Alvarado, the company is able to provide up to 70% reduction in logistics expenses, a revenue growth of up to 3 times by being able to displace shipping options and costs in real time and up to 91% optimization of a company’s operations by avoiding data errors, Zambrano told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company started out in food delivery, but pivoted in 2015 when Zambrano saw an opportunity to help businesses decipher which is the best shipping carrier.</p>
<p>“We saw them struggling to understand the hundreds of carriers, which one is the best option, which one is the most cost efficient or which one has the best speed,” he added. “We noticed no one was attacking this problem online.”</p>
<p>Every country has its unique challenges when it comes to shipping, Zambrano said. This is due mainly to delivery carriers being different in each country, meaning Skydropx has to start from the ground up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company intends to expand into other countries where e-commerce is growing, including Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Peru. To do this, the company announced Tuesday $20 million in Series A funding co-led by Base10 Partners, Cometa, and 645 Ventures.</p>
<p>TJ Nahigian, co-founder and managing partner of Base10 Partners, said he met Zambrano and Solbes in 2018 when the ecosystem was still early. He revisited the company as he saw a massive uptick in e-commerce globally, which was also impacting adoption in Latin America, where he said delivery and fulfillment were among the challenges that businesses have to overcome.</p>
<p>“Tavo and Armando are key enablers to grow this ecosystem broadly which is a huge opportunity,” Nahigian said “Skysdropx is at a scale to enable delivery and information to flow through the entire system and in a way that is more efficient. The penetration rate is still small, but we see that significantly change 10 to 100 times over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>This new capital combines with previous raises of $7 million following Skydropx’s participation in Y Combinator in 2018.</p>

<p>Since then, the company became profitable, growing over 300% in 2020 alone. It now serves over 50,000 customers and makes more than 1.5 million deliveries a month. Approximately 6% of package deliveries in Mexico are done through Skydropx, Zambrano said.</p>
<p>In addition to moving into other countries, the company is looking at other verticals in fulfillment, like opening its own fulfillment centers in Mexico and launching its own delivery branches so that in addition to the website, customers can drop off or pick up packages in person. He expects 30 branches to go up in the next two weeks in corner and convenience stores around Mexico.</p>
<p>Aaron Holliday, co-founder and managing partner of 645 Ventures, met the company at Y Combinator, though the firm did not initially invest. He, too, saw the company exceeding its target year over year, and wanted to be involved in the Series A, which is 645 Ventures’ first investment in Latin America.</p>
<p>“In Latin America, e-commerce is undergoing a Renaissance, first around fintech and now with the emergence and surge in e-commerce,” he said. “Customers talked about their product being essential to scale and get to profitability, and Skydropx is emerging as the dominant leader to automate fulfillment.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NYSE-listed e-commerce platform Jumia experienced a shift in shopping habits across its markets in Africa last year, as more shoppers bought everyday products as opposed to electronics. Shopping for essentials such as foodstuff, fashion and beauty products, saw Jumia’s total sales value of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods grow by 13 percentage points last year from 44% [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYSE-listed e-commerce platform</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jumias-q2-results-show-moderate-growth-rising-spend-and-continued-losses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced a shift in shopping habits across its markets in Africa last year, as more shoppers bought everyday products as opposed to electronics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopping for essentials such as foodstuff, fashion and beauty products, saw Jumia’s total sales value of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods grow by 13 percentage points last year from 44% in 2019, according to the newly released Jumia Africa E-commerce Index 2021</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-05cA8GeoxD0pSbiTVD5CSQIe7EjmoyD/view"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jumia report attributed the shift to stay-at-home restrictions that fueled the need for online shopping as well as the youthful population and the increasing smartphone and internet penetration across the continent.  Smartphones contributed 75% of the traffic to the e-commerce site.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By providing consumers with access to essential food and services, we have seen a shift to essential related products from phones and electronics. This goes to show how Covid-19 also reinforced the relevance of e-commerce in the communities we serve,” Jumia Group’s head of communication and public relations, Abdesslam Benzitouni told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia said that more sellers signed up to Jumia Mall – a platform for official brands within the main site – increasing the shopping options and providing a wide variety of products. Jumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform in Africa, leading hundreds others including Chinese-owned Kilimall, Nigeria’s Marketplace Africa and South Africa’s Bidorbuy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The brands (on Jumia Mall) know e-commerce is the future. Having them on Jumia means that consumers have access to their products, and that brands are within their reach. Different sellers on the platform also means that we create transparency and competition between brands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, prepared in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, International Finance Corporation, and Mastercard, also showed that 28 million orders were made on the platform last year. Lagos, Cairo and Nairobi cities accounted for the most orders by volume, respectively. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 35% of orders made through Jumia were paid using the company’s finance arm, Jumia Pay, an app that allows customers to pay utility bills and make orders without leaving the company’s platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popularity of the Jumia brand also grew in all its markets with Uganda, Senegal and Tunisia experiencing the greatest growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia attributed the growth currently happening within the continent’s e-commerce sector to the increasing, albeit sluggish, penetration of the internet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across sub-Saharan Africa 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy</span><a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is expected to grow to about 40% of the population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Jumia. But e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-commerce uptake in Africa remains low, according to a recent International Trade Centre (ITC) report, with only 10 countries accounting for 94% of online business. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya accounted for most online sales in sub-Saharan Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…the digital and economic infrastructure in Africa greatly affects e-commerce and helps explain why the online economy works better in some countries than in others,” said the ITC report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Furthermore, more than half of the people in 60% of African countries live in rural areas. Internet connectivity tends to be poor in these areas, which are also far from distribution centers — meaning that delivery services for goods are either poor, non-existent or costly. All of this creates sizable obstacles for e-commerce,” it said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When compared to cities, rural areas accounted for 22% of the orders lodged on the Jumia site, which Benzitouni attributed to the e-commerce’s growing logistics network. He said that Jumia has over the last nine years built a logistics network that targets to make it possible for people in remote areas to shop on its site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia plans to use its logistics network to tap rural areas – which the firm says has seen a strong demand for its services in those areas. The e-commerce platform opened up its logistics marketplace to third parties, a place that was previously only used by food vendors and for e-commerce.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It now has 300 logistics partners and 1,600 pick-up stations spread across its 11 markets in Africa, including Algeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria and Morocco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By last year Jumia had about 110,000 annual sellers and 6.8 million active customers, a small number when compared to the continent’s population. The growth of e-commerce across the continent, the ITC report said, is hampered by the lack of cross-border opportunities as most platforms operate within national borders. It said that the opportunity exists for a marketplace that can have a significant pan-African presence.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you had asked me the other week which consumer electronics companies have yet to get into the wireless earbud business, I probably would have stared at you blankly for a while. Over the past few years, it seems like everyone has launched at least one pair of Bluetooth buds. There was, however, at least one hold out.</p>
<p>Remember Palm? Or, more specifically, remember when TCL heloed launched a Palm rebrand, back in 2018? It arrived alongside an “ultra-mobile” device that was, at the very least, a novel addition to a world of look-alike phones. And, hey, it won the approval (and funding) of Splash Brother, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/palm-returns-as-an-ultra-mobile-smartphone/">Stephen Curry</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223823" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223823" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223823" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="585" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=2048,1170 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-case_dancing-copy.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223823" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Palm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>No word yet on whether we’ll be getting an update to the Palm PDA (pretty darn adorable), but the brand announced today that it too is getting into the fully wireless earbud game with the Palm Buds Pro.</p>
<p>The $129 buds (with a limited-time $99 price tag) most closely resemble a more aerodynamic pair of black AirPods. As the company notes, the rebranded firm has employed designers from Beats by Dre and Samsung for the new buds, which have “studio grade audio and enhanced bass” along with active noise canceling, per their description.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223824" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223824" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223824" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Copy-of-How-it-works_mobile-copy.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223824" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Palm</p></div></p>
<p>“The Palm Buds Pro&#8217;s biggest differentiator is the emphasis on studio grade audio and enhanced bass. Our engineers have also developed one of the most advanced Active Noise Cancelling and Environmental Noise Cancelling systems on the market,” says co-founder Howard Nuk in a release. “The Palm Buds Pro&#8217;s advanced 6-microphone Active Noise Cancellation system utilizes 3 individual microphones per bud, powering the most immersive sound experience, and providing the clearest calls in windy conditions on the market.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The buds are up for preorder today and will go on sale November 9, along with a $15 silicone case. “The Palm Buds Pro are the go-to for all my training sessions,&#8221; Curry says in the release. And he&#8217;s one of the best at basketball, so make of that what you will.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Medable has grown 300% in the past year and over 800% in the last 18 months, which CEO Michelle Longmire said was proof that a patient-centered approach is taking hold.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.medable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medable</a>, a patient-focused clinical research company offering a cloud offering for adoption of digital and decentralized clinical trials, brought in a new capital infusion of $304 million in Series D funding — its fourth round since 2020 — to give it a valuation of $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>Medable’s software-as-a-service connects patients, trial sites and clinical trial teams to streamline the design, recruitment, retention and data quality of trials in a way that makes them accessible to anyone anywhere.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by new investors Blackstone Growth and Tiger Global and existing investor GSR Ventures. It also included follow-on investment from existing investors Sapphire Ventures and WTI.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223841" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It’s great to see more mainstream investors interested in the space,” Dr. Michelle Longmire, CEO and co-founder of Medable, told TechCrunch. “It adds momentum to what we are going after.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kQWAP4iLbz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/">The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/embed/#?secret=kQWAP4iLbz" data-secret="kQWAP4iLbz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Indeed, part of what the company is going after is a piece of the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-virtual-clinical-trials-market-research-report-2021-301383164.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global virtual clinical trials</a> market, which is forecasted to reach $11.5 billion by 2028.</p>
<p>Medable is already on a fast-growth trajectory. It has grown 300% in the past year and over 800% in the last 18 months, which Longmire said was proof that a patient-centered approach is taking hold. The company’s software is being used in 150 clinical trials taking place across 5,000 clinical sites in 60 countries and has touched tens of thousands of patient lives.</p>
<p>In addition to the patient-focused approach to clinical trials, some of Medable’s success was also driven in part by the global pandemic, Dr. Sunny Kumar, partner at GSR Ventures, said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223889" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223889" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg" alt="Medable" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/medable-founding-team.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223889" class="wp-caption-text">Medable&#8217;s founding team</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to 2020, there was a reluctance to change the way clinical trials were performed and an area where technology had not yet had an impact, he added. However, this is one sector of healthcare where there is strong alignment of incentives across key players of the industry: pharmaceutical companies to get patients engaged, providers to get people through their centers, payers to shift the cost of care onto pharmaceutical companies and patients to have a better experience.</p>
<p>GSR Ventures began looking at clinical trials in 2018, met Longmire in 2019 and made its first investment in Medable in 2020. At the time, the technology was small, and people were trying to work through the regulatory factors. The firm thought that decentralization was likely to be the future and where the industry would be headed, but that it would take another three to five years for mass adoption. Then COVID came along.</p>
<p>“COVID changed the game,” Kumar said. “We initially saw 10% to 12% of trials using any meaningful decentralization to now 60% to 70% having some element of decentralization. Medable has proven it is in a strong position to win outsized market share. It is a competitive market, but Medable is breaking away from the pack.”</p>
<p>It typically takes a good decade and millions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies to see a new drug come to market. The goal of Medable is to decrease costs by half and increase the speed to market by two times, and Kumar says we are now seeing the impact in the decreased cost of trials, but not yet the full realization of a drug trial that started the process this way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new round gives Palo Alto-based Medable a total of $521 million in funding, which includes a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/medable-secures-78m-series-c-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$78 million Series C extension</a> in April that followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/medable-raises-91-million-for-its-clinical-trial-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$91 million round</a> last November. It also raised a $25 million venture round in May 2020.</p>
<p>Longmire says the new capital will enable the company to continue to scale its technology globally so that there is awareness, access and execution of patient-centered trials so that patients can do more in a safe manner and in ways that work better for them. It will also be invested in product development, its partner ecosystem and customer and patient success.</p>
<p>“We are looking to make game-changing progress in a fast way, and the faster we can build the infrastructure, the better,” she added. “We want to make aspects of trials more local, done in the local pharmacy or clinic. There are trials for cutting-edge oncology drugs, and we want everyone to have access to that drug no matter where they are or who they are.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly, a company looking to simplify medical billing, announced a $12m Series A round on Tuesday. Anomaly is a young company – it was only <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anomaly-1c37">founded in 2020</a>. But it has its eye set on an old, gargantuan problem: wasteful spending in the US healthcare system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly&#8217;s platform is designed to detect irregularities in medical bills. It’s A.I.-driven process comes as a result of working with “massive amounts” of claims data from insurance companies and health systems, says Jacob Shiff, co-founder, president and COO of Anomaly. That training allows the software to preemptively flag claims that might be irregular, or identify patterns in billing that end up resulting in wasteful spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our overall goal in our work with insurance companies and providers is to really use technology and deep healthcare domain expertise to remove that friction between providers and payers so that we can pay the right amount the first time,” Shiff told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223682" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round comes after a previously unannounced $5 million seed round which closed earlier this year, bringing the company’s total funding up to $17 million. The Series A round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RRE Ventures and included participation from Link Ventures. Existing investors also include Madrona Venture Group, Declaration Partners and Redesign Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly will use the funds to grow the team (the company currently has 12 employees), and scale up their business by partnering with more insurance companies and healthcare systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional solutions have focused on an outsourced and reactive approach to dealing with improper payments,” said Kyle Tatz, the head of new ventures at Redesign Health. “We felt that Anomaly’s approach from day one to partner with payers and providers to pay the right amount the first time stood out from the industry standard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are inefficiencies in clinical care that cost extra dollars, the bulk of wasteful spending, at least according to one 2019 </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, doesn&#8217;t happen at bedside. Analysis of over 54 publications suggested over $300 billion each year is wasted on inefficiencies related to medical billing. That study was conducted by a team of economists, but William Shrank, the chief medical officer of Humana, an insurance company, is the paper’s lead author.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest category of waste was “administrative complexity” – in other words, the burden of needlessly complex paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tatz calls that $300 billion “an indication of how much white space there is in the market for better solutions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine that, with your credit card, every month you got your statement and 10 percent of your charges were just incorrect,” says Shiff. “That’s the status quo in healthcare.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the question of how to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fix </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the paperwork problem happened to be a blind spot in healthcare research. The paper was unable to find </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies revealing solid ways to save money by reducing administrative complexity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the paper was published, some argued that turning to a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/upshot/health-care-waste-study.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-payer healthcare system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the most expedient way to tackle this category. Others argue other countries with private healthcare systems still manage to spend less on administrative costs than the US does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, take one </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2674671"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2018 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on healthcare spending in the US and 11 other high-income countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark. The US spent about 8 percent of its GDP on “administration and governance.&#8221; The other nations spent an average of three percent on that category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anomaly calls its approach to this financially leaky blindspot in healthcare spending “precision payments.” When a provider files a claim with an insurer, Anomaly can peruse the claim and ensure there are no errors. If there are, the provider would receive a real-time response pointing out the error (that’s the idea behind one of the company’s products: Anomaly Prevent). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s other product, Anomaly recover, identifies </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">past </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">overpayments that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiff would not name which insurance companies or healthcare systems Anomaly is already working with, but the company does have ties to major players in the industry. The chairman of the company’s board is Jeff Alter, the former CEO of United Healthcare’s commercial branch and current executive vice president of IngenioRx and Anthem Health Solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiff did note that Anomaly is working with two “regional payers in the Northeast” and a “healthcare system in Florida.” He also wouldn’t disclose any metrics as to how Anomaly has managed to save these systems money or simplify claims. Instead, he described the results abstractly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re really excited by the results that we&#8217;re seeing. The results are really very meaningful, in terms of the dollars and cents, themselves,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that medical billing is overly complicated and rife with errors isn’t exactly breaking news. Tatz argues that now is the time to tackle the problem because of an “increased recognition among healthcare stakeholders” that AI can reduce waste, and, because healthcare costs are &#8220;reaching a breaking point.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found payers and providers are increasingly seeking solutions like Anomaly that reduce administrative waste and friction, which is the low-hanging cost to cut in the healthcare ecosystem,” he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://pipefy.com/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=press-release-shrm_us_brnd_0_brand_aw_r-ot_pr_use_case_human-resources_process_other_hrpc03%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “low-code” workflow management SaaS startup, announced today that it has raised $75 million in Series C funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Latin America Fund led the financing with a $50 million contribution, bringing Pipefy’s total raised to $138.7 million since its 2015 inception. Steadfast Capital Management, Insight Partners and Redpoint eventures also put money in the round. The San Francisco-based company declined to reveal at what valuation the money was raised, saying only it is “close to unicorn status.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy was originally headquartered in Brazil, and since much of the startup’s R&amp;D is still located in the country, and it has a significant presence there, the company was still considered for the SoftBank Latin America Fund, officials say. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Pipefy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $45 million from Insight Partners, Openview and Trinity Ventures. Insight led that round. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Pipefy aims to redefine workflow management. It has more than 4,000 corporate customers globally, including GE Healthcare, Lacoste, Magalu, electric truck maker Rivian and Nubank, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the startup would not disclose hard revenue figures, CEO and founder Alessio Alionço did say that Pipefy doubled its annual recurring revenue over the past year. It has also doubled its headcount to 500 today, compared to 250 employees in January.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223872" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223872" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223872 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223872" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipefy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it talks about workflow management, the startup says it has the ability to automate “virtually any repeatable process” such as employee onboarding, purchasing/procurement, recruiting, IT service requests and expense reimbursement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Alionço: “Our tool enables citizen developers. These are the professionals who do the work but who do not have IT training. With Pipefy, these citizen developers can independently create shareable, standardized forms to collect data and customize the workflows that they understand as practitioners &#8212; without having to rely on IT to build their applications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy uses if/then conditionals to automate process phases and, in essence, unify a variety of collaboration channels &#8212; such as Slack and spreadsheets &#8212; into one portal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims it can also support more complex operations in which IT teams use its tool to integrate legacy systems, like ERPs or CRMs, to orchestrate operations across multiple systems of record.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Pipefy’s goal is to give companies &#8212; from emerging startups to large multinational companies &#8212; a way to “nimbly” automate and customize their integrated workflows. Describing Pipefy as a horizontal platform, Alionço said that it is “vertical and industry agnostic.” The company touts that a variety of teams within an organization can benefit from its offering, including finance, human resources, customer service, procurement and marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipefy stands out from competitors, Alionço said, because its low-code implementation can “easily scale” from a single team to an entire enterprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic served to increase demand for its offering, according to Alionço, in that it put “severe pressure on IT organizations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As restrictions caused by the virus begin to lift, more and more companies are offering hybrid, remote and in-person, work models,” he said. “This means employees are more dispersed than ever before. Pipefy saw, and continues to see, demand for tools that like ours provide automated processes and visibility over remote employees and projects.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223874" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223874" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223874 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pipefy2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipefy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, more IT leaders and CIOs are becoming customers and implementing Pipefy’s software, noted president and COO Ananth Avva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our low-code approach is meeting the needs of distributed workforces around the world,” Alionço said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to “significantly accelerate” its global expansion. It also plans to continue to hire globally and further develop its product and go-to-market strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it originated in Brazil, it already has strong brand visibility in the country. Pipefy has plans to expand “rapidly” in other LatAm Countries. In 2021, it worked on gaining a strong foothold in the U.S. market. Next year, it plans to focus on growing its customer base in the U.S., and on acquiring new customers in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and in Asia Pacific countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pipefy is a SaaS platform that can be rapidly configured and activated anywhere in the world, and our team is multilingual, so the company does not face many of the typical costs that come with global expansion,” Alionço told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Pieterse, investment leader of SoftBank Latin America Fund, said the rising number and prevalence of SaaS apps, a more distributed workforce and a growing focus on digital transformation have increased the complexity of enterprise software environments and the demand for tools to effectively navigate them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pipefy, led by an exceptional team, has built a powerful, flexible and feature rich low-code solution that allows non-technical users to quickly define, build, and deploy automated workflows &#8212; increasing the speed, visibility, and control of any type of process,” he wrote via email.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.battery.com/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">Devo</a>, a Boston-area startup focused on log management and cybersecurity, announced this morning that it has closed a $250 million round of funding. The new capital values Devo at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Dubbed a Series E by the company, TCV led the new investment, while two other new investors &#8212; General Atlantic and Eurazeo &#8212; also took part. As is common with rounds of this size, a bevy of prior investors kicked in cash as well. The new unicorn told TechCrunch that the round was pre-empted a few months ahead of when it had planned to raise and that it was four times oversubscribed.</p>
<p>How did Devo manage to attract that level of interest? Revenue expansion, we reckon. The company posted solid growth in the last year, according to CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcvanzadelhoff">Marc van Zadelhoff</a>, telling TechCrunch that Devo doubled revenue, employees and customers over the time frame. Van Zadelhoff also said that it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s goal to double again in the coming year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223793" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For startups already at scale, doubling is a common target. So much so, in fact, that 100% growth later in a startup&#8217;s life is <a href="https://www.battery.com/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">part of a well-worn rule of thumb</a> for how to scale toward an IPO.</p>
<p>And the company brought up its future IPO plans unbidden, telling TechCrunch that its new capital will allow it to set up for an IPO in around two years. Given that guidance, we expect Devo to either get to its public offering on this tranche of cash or perhaps with one more slug of funds before it hits go on an S-1 filing.</p>
<p>But all that&#8217;s the financial arcana. What does the company actually <em>do</em>?</p>
<h2>The hell is log management?</h2>
<p>In corporate-speak. Devo sells &#8220;cloud-native logging and security analytics.&#8221; If that doesn&#8217;t help your comprehension much, no worries. We got you.</p>
<p>When you interact with a digital product, it emits exhaust in the form of a log file: <em>User x</em> did <em>y</em> with <em>z</em> <em>product</em> at <em>q</em> <em>time</em>, that sort of thing. Big companies generate a plethora of such files, given that they have many users, and diverse &#8212; perhaps even complex! &#8212; products on offer.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, Devo has built a service that compiles log files from customers into a central repository, storing 400 days&#8217; worth of the data in a quickly retrievable fashion. From there, it offers two products that pull from those stored log files: one focused on cybersecurity and the other focused on IT support. Per van Zadelhoff, the cybersecurity tool is by far the more popular of its two offerings.</p>
<p>The log platform powers both. To help explain what we mean, let&#8217;s use an analogy I ran past Devo&#8217;s CEO during our call that seemed to pass muster: Imagine a company&#8217;s collected log files are a form of broth or stock. From there, Devo&#8217;s cybersecurity and IT-focused products are akin to different soups (services) made from the same base liquid (log data). Same foundation (broth), different focus (soup flavor).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect as far as comparisons go, but we hope that it helps all the same.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about the 400 days figure. Why is that the correct window for keeping log files handy? It&#8217;s a 13-month time frame; in that period, the company will have a full year&#8217;s log data for customers, along with one more month to allow for year-over-year comparisons. That seems pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Why not store even more? Given the sheer amount of data in question, it&#8217;s probably a tale of diminishing returns, though falling storage and compute costs over time, we suppose, could make it economical to expand the window somewhat. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Devo intends to use its new capital to grow its team, as all tech upstarts do when they raise new funds, along with working on allowing other companies to build atop its log platform and international expansion. The company also mentioned the possibility of tuck-in acquisitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon continues to be the 800-pound gorilla in the room for companies in the retail sector. Today, a startup called <a href="https://getfabric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabric</a>, which is building technology to help those other retailers &#8212; big and small &#8212; compete more squarely against that muscle specifically in fulfillment with robotics technology, &#8220;micro-fulfillment&#8221; centers and last-mile operations, is announcing $200 million in funding. It&#8217;s a big round at a big valuation &#8212; over $1 billion, Fabric says. T<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">he round underscores both the demand in the market and opportunity to challenge Amazon.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As it is, we already have more demand than we can serve,&#8221; said <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">Elram Goren, Fabric&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, in an interview, who has his sights set on where it might apply its technology next. &#8220;A</span>t the same time, we are seeing bigger opportunities beyond the proposition beyond our micro-fulfilment centers, how they interact in the network and the supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s Temasek &#8212; which participated in Fabric&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/fabric-raises-110-million-series-b-to-expand-its-network-of-automated-fulfillment-centers-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $110 million Series B in 2019</a> &#8212; led this Series C, with Koch Disruptive Technologies, Union Tech Ventures, Harel Insurance &amp; Finance, Pontifax Global Food and Agriculture Technology Fund (Pontifax AgTech), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), KSH Capital, Princeville Capital, Wharton Equity Ventures, and other unnamed backers also participating. It has raised $336 million to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223992" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">Fabric&#8217;s customers today include the likes of Walmart, Instacart, and FreshDirect, and Goren said the funding will be used both to continue moving deeper into the grocery sector, including helping them built out their own &#8220;marketplace&#8221;-style operations, as well as to bring its robotics and micro-fulfillment technology to other kinds of e-commerce retailers by expanding its network across the U.S. (where it is now based, out of New York) and Israel (where it originally started), and soon other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p3">&#8220;Essentially, we are using the same tech stack for both groceries and e-commerce,&#8221; he said in an interview. Part of that was out of practicality. When Fabric started in 2015, he said a lot of the company&#8217;s thinking was focused around groceries, since e-commerce penetration was very low, at about 1%. Now it&#8217;s a 10%, he added, a $1 trillion business. &#8220;A lot of our thinking is shaped by what we saw as the opportunity. But in time we learned the opportunity was a lot larger and we have relevance in other areas. It&#8217;s retail but more abstractly, we are building a new way to move things so that you can have a faster and more efficient way of getting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>E-commerce has been growing at clip for decades, but the trend accelerated drastically in the last two years, not least due to Covid-19 and the chilling effect that had on in-person retail. Citing figures from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-traps-to-avoid-the-long-game-of-dtc-and-e-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey</a>, Fabric notes that the the 35% penetration that e-commerce had in 2020 (that is, the amount of sales that were transacted online versus in-person) was more than double the year before (16% in 2019), with a chunk of that growth taking place over just a few months (growth that had taken 10 years prior to Covid-19).</p>
<p>But although it&#8217;s easy enough &#8212; and getting easier all the time &#8212; for us consumers to find what we want, click on it and get it delivered to our doors, that flow hides a huge and complex set of processes. One of the less transparent of those processes is fulfillment, which can include receiving goods, inventory storage, pick-and-pack costs, kitting and other sorting services (bringing unrelated items together), customer support and more. Estimates vary widely for how much of a percentage fulfillment is in the total costs for a product sold online rather than in-store, depending on locations of fulfillment centers, size and amount of items, methods used to run operations and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fabric competes against other startups building technology to improve the fulfillment process, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shipbob-nabs-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-help-e-commerce-companies-run-logistics-like-amazons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipBob</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/byrd-raises-19m-to-expand-amazon-style-fulfillment-and-logistics-to-more-e-commerce-merchants-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/final-mile-fulfillment-startup-parcellab-closes-112m-series-c-funding-led-by-insight-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parcelLab</a>, all of which have raised money this year. These newer players in turn are looking to get into a business that has otherwise been dominated by a wide range of third-party logistics and fulfillment (known as 3PL) providers in what is a fragmented and in some ways quite analogue market, relying on warehouses and teams of workers; and of course Amazon, which provides services to hundreds of thousands of third-party merchants through its <a href="https://sell.amazon.co.uk/fulfilment-by-amazon?ld=SEUKFBAAdGog-Top-Kwds_14921146748_128819656312_kwd-295315938919_p_552106322042_c_sig-CjwKCAjwzt6LBhBeEiwAbPGOgU2jZEhpH6DwuRpC8MJc1D1-GP01kOAPiU-qRTNt-oebBzd2rbd97hoChZ8QAvD_BwE_asret_&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwzt6LBhBeEiwAbPGOgU2jZEhpH6DwuRpC8MJc1D1-GP01kOAPiU-qRTNt-oebBzd2rbd97hoChZ8QAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA</a> program.</p>
<p>Fabric&#8217;s robotics solution is key to how it differentiates on this front. It has built a vertically-integrated set of hardware and software that can be implemented in a customer&#8217;s own warehouses, or in its own, to automate the process of selecting, moving around, and packing items. Goren said that it reduces the costs of fulfillment operations by some 75%, meaning that it doesn&#8217;t remove humans from the chain altogether.</p>
<p class="p3">&#8220;There are some things that can only be done by humans,&#8221; he said. The plan is to continue to build its own hardware but also, over time, to explore how and where it might integrate with whatever bigger customers might already be using.</p>
<p>The micro-fulfillment, meanwhile, is a concept that is based around providing space to multiple tenants within a space where Fabric deploys robots to run it; but also potentially involves Fabric itself taking space within larger warehouses that it does not own itself. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/commonsense-robotics-first-automated-fulfillment-center-is-now-live/">typical micro-fulfillment center</a> involves robots and humans at scanning and controlling stations; a 6,000-square-foot station can process up to 600 orders a day, including one-hour deliveries.</p>
<p>One big opportunity in delivery and fulfillment operations has been in better serving dense, urban communities, which represent demographics with disposable income, a regular need for shopping since domestic storage is more limited, and smaller geographic areas to cover more efficiently. This will also be a target for how Fabric expands, Goren said. Economies of scale in these markets also present a compelling case for more efficiency overall that has an impact in other ways, too.</p>
<p class="p3">“We believe the movement to local fulfillment presents an opportunity to make retail and e-commerce more sustainable, and we’re thrilled to partner with the leader in micro-fulfillment to make this vision a reality,” said Eric Kosmowski, Managing Partner at the Princeville Climate Technology Fund, in a statement. “By leveraging existing real estate with a small footprint in close proximity to end consumers, utilizing more sustainable packing materials, and minimizing shrink and waste through smart inventory management, Fabric’s micro-fulfillment centers could lower last-mile emissions significantly.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African automotive company <a href="https://autochek.africa/">Autochek</a> has secured a $13.1 million seed round almost a year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">after raising $3.4 million pre-seed</a> in November 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, led by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/etop-ikpe-38aa8853/">Etop Ikpe</a>, has seen astonishing growth in demand since launching in August last year, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a consumer perspective but also from its business and banking partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who else to lead the seed round other than pan-African VC firms TLcom Capital and 4DX Ventures &#8212; the same investors that had the conviction to lead the startup’s pre-seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other existing investors, such as Golden Palm Investments, Enza Capital and Lateral Capital, invested as well. First-time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investors ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, the venture capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group, also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In total, Autochek has raised $16.5 million in two financing rounds.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ikpe spoke to TechCrunch last month, the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/nigerias-autochek-acquires-cheki-kenya-and-uganda-from-roam-africa/"> finalized the acquisition</a> of Cheki’s businesses in Kenya and Uganda from Ringier One Africa Media (ROAM). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal closed almost a year after Autochek bought Cheki Ghana and Cheki Nigeria to start its business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although acquisitions have made up all the company’s expansion strategy to this point, it did not take that route into the Ivory Coast &#8212; it partnered with CFAO Group to bring its marketplace to the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion takes the number of African markets in which Autochek is present to five. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s used car market is a $45 billion industry, where the vehicle penetration rate stands at a meager 5%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because the market lacks transparency, lenders (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks) have found it challenging to offer loans to individuals, commercial or ride-hailing drivers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek’s platform operates a marketplace-driven model with a focus on financing and after-sales. Its primary customers? Dealerships, banks and the end consumers (those who buy cars on the platform).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a dealership signs up on the platform, Autochek assigns a workshop to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inspections on the vehicles owned by the dealership</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The assessments and some algorithmic checks on Autochek’s system help to give a sense of the status and condition of the car, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">determining whether it is in a state to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be financed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the big risk for the banks because they do not want a situation where they finance a car and the next day, the engine knocks,” said Ikpe explaining why Autochek goes through these processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After inspection, Autochek alerts all the banks on its platform that the vehicle is ready to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be financed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and moves it to the marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Following an extensive review, the banks respond with their offers. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he end-user then has a pool of financing rates from the banks to choose from and can apply to buy the car after Autochek develops a credit profile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The loan application process takes about 48 hours, down from an industry standard of 40-45 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sorted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Autochek supports the banks in disbursement and ensuring that the vehicle </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, insured and tracked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the car gets fed into Autochek’s after-sales network, where it gets maintained for free whenever mechanical issues come up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek makes money by charging customers and banks a fee after a successful disbursement and commissions from dealerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there for the banks and customers at the point of disbursal; we stay with them throughout the lifecycle of the loan,” said Ikpe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We’ve built that ecosystem using technology to stitch all these various verticals together so that at the end of the day, we can create more value with financing being our core driver within the platform.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria’s Autochek raises $3.4M for car sales and service platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/embed/#?secret=BNsKVUyMZT" data-secret="BNsKVUyMZT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when Autochek announced its pre-seed round, it had 12 bank partnerships. That number has increased to about 70 banks, such as Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa and NCBA Bank. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These banks have processed more than 46,000 loan applications to date; this number was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 last November, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Autochek worked with only used cars. But the company has since launched a financing product for trucks and new cars. More than 1,200 dealerships use Autochek’s network and over 15,000 financeable vehicles are on the marketplace across all markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ikpe asserts that introducing these new verticals came from the demand from its partner banks, who have been integral to where the company sets up shop on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in some cases, despite seeming demand and the presence of a partner bank, Ikpe says Autochek has declined to move into new markets where it did not perceive potential at that moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settled in West and East Africa, Autochek has its sights set northward and southward on the continent &#8212; Egypt and South Africa to be precise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are speaking to a few partners around </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how we can make entry and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between now and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Q2 next year, we would have kind of identified the best kind of product-market fit for those markets. But we expect that by Q3, we should have a presence in those markets,” said Ikpe, who was the co-founder and chief executive at Jiji subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/jiji-acquires-cars45-as-it-looks-to-build-a-future-outside-classifieds/">Cars45</a> before <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/12/etop-ikpe-ceo-at-autochek/">starting Autochek</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ikpe’s drive and experience and Autochek’s blitzscaling growth are top of the list on why TLcom Capital re-invested in the one-year-old company, according to partner Andreata Muforo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Walter Baddoo, managing partner at 4DX Ventures, it’s that the team has demonstrated “the talent, ambition, and domain expertise needed to build a complete end-to-end car ownership experience for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, Uber and Bolt dominate the ride-hailing space, leading most mobility startups to tackle vehicle financing and logistics problems instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek and other vehicle financing startups like Moove and FlexClub have raised large sums of money, signifying rising investor interests in the space and a maturing competitive landscape.</span></p>
<p>In Autochek’s case, investors’ interest was such that Autochek closed at twice what it initially intended to raise. Frankly, for a business that deals with automotive tech in Africa, that speaks volumes. But then again, Autochek has a fintech element with its financing model. So, its large seed round does not come as a big surprise, considering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-fintech-and-serial-founders-drove-african-pre-seed-investing-to-new-heights-in-2020/">how fintech dominates the African VC landscape</a> and holds the record for the highest seed-stage investments from PalmPay, Kuda and PawaPay.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any startup, Autochek wants to be a market leader. It plans to inject the new capital into bolstering its auto loan processing platform, deepen its footprint in West Africa and, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leverage Toyota Tsusho’s vast retail network across 54 African countries to deepen its expansion further.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chalo, a startup that is digitizing bus commutes in India and which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">recently raised $40 million in a financing round</a>, has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/shuttl-india-bus-aggregator/">Amazon-backed app-based office commute bus aggregator Shuttl</a> in an all-cash deal, the two said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chalo founder and chief executive Mohit Dubey said the acquisition of Shuttl, which operates thousands of buses aimed at working professionals, will help his startup gain presence in many parts of the country including metro cities, broaden the technology and product offerings, and also supercharge the the firm&#8217;s overseas expansion efforts.</p>
<p>“Shuttl and Chalo, these are the firms that are positioned to become the largest mobility firms in the world. I wish the pandemic had not happened, but it has allowed the two companies with a similar focus to come together,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dubey declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said Shuttl co-founder and chief executive Amit Singh has agreed to continue his journey. Chalo will continue to use Shuttl&#8217;s branding, he said.</p>
<p>“We started out to take the pain away from daily commuters. In the process we ended up building a category, and inspiring others from different parts of the world to do the same. It’s a bittersweet moment for us. We believe the team and legacy of Shuttl will thrive equally well in the new set-up,” said Singh in a statement.</p>
<p>For investors of Shuttl, too, it&#8217;s a bittersweet moment. The startup had been struggling to raise a new financing round and had cut its workforce to address the pandemic. For months, murmurs around Shuttl shutting shops were floating.</p>
<p>Shuttl had raised over $97 million in a series of financing equity and debt rounds, according to data intelligence platform Tracxn. The startup counts Amazon, Times Internet, Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Toyota among its backers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chalo said that the entire current team of Shuttl, including several key executives who have been part of the startup from the beginning, will continue in their roles.</p>
<p>Dubey said he has been engaging with Shuttl&#8217;s Singh for several years, but the two began acquisition talks only two months ago.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s $20 billion bus market, which is almost twice the size of cabs. Bus commutes are more accessible to the broader masses of the country, but currently there are very few buses in India: about three for every 10,000 people.</p>

Lovely. How nice. But no. Ecosia’s founders and the network around it are far more serious about climate change than that superficial assessment might suggest.

<p>So today, <a href="http://worldfund.vc">World Fund</a>, a new Climate Tech VC is launching with a €350 million fund targeting startups building technology that can help decarbonize the planet. World Fund claims its Europe’s largest <em>dedicated</em> climate tech VC.</p>
<p>How did they build that size of a fund that fast? Well, it contains over 60 investors including current and former European tech founders, but also very few institutional LPs, hence why it could raise in such a relatively short time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Incubated by Ecosia, the fund will focus on energy, transport, food and agriculture, manufacturing, and buildings. As we&#8217;ve seen, the built environment is a huge contributor to CO2. Cities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/2150-launches-with-281m-fund-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-worlds-growing-cities/">consume</a> over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>World Fund’s says its mission will be to save 2 gigatons of emissions by 2040 &#8211; the equivalent to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20collectively%20emit%20around,were%20around%2035%20billion%20tonnes">4% of all global emissions</a>. This is pretty good for one single firm, although the scale of the issue is enormous, with the world&#8217;s emissions needing to be halved by 2030 for the planet to have a chance of escaping 1.5 degrees warming.</p>
<p>Key to this is using what it calls the Climate Performance Potential (CPP) as a key leading indicator for funding. Each company World Fund backs will need to be able to demonstrate it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100 megatonnes CO2e every year, said the firm, as “only companies enabling a decarbonized world can become the most valuable companies of the next decade.”</p>
<p>Danijel Višević, General partner, World Fund said: “Europe urgently needs to stop continuing business as usual, relying on the continued use of fossil fuels. This continent has the research, innovation, and political awareness to lead the world in the fight against climate change. However, until now, there hasn’t been the venture support to ensure these solutions go from idea to success. This is why we’re launching the World Fund, to be the ultimate partner to back the tech entrepreneurs of Europe that will create the most valuable companies of the next decade while tackling the climate crisis.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Doubling down on Europe as a place to make climate tech investors would seem to make sense.</p>
<p>50% more climate tech patents have come from Europe than the US and China <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-028-eib-investment-report-20202021-european-union-is-leading-the-way-in-green-technology-investment">between</a> 2019 and 2020,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/publications/state-of-climate-tech-2020.htm">But only €6bn</a> of VC funding went into European companies up to 2013 compared to €25bn and €17bn invested in the US and China respectively.</p>
<p>Plus, according to World Fund’s research, there are 41 funds in North America with more than $100 million assets under management, compared to only six in Europe, and the majority of specific European climate tech VC funds have less than $40m to back disruptive technology. </p>
<p>Furthermore, World Fund says there were more climate tech companies founded in Europe (102) between 2019 and 2021, than the US and China combined (80). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 fund is <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1f107d76-acbe-11eb-9767-01aa75ed71a1">contributing</a> €33bn to climate-relevant R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Making up the fund will be Tim Schumacher, co-founder of domain marketplace Sedo (and investor in Ecosia, Zolar, gridX, Pachama and CarbonCloud); Danijel Visevic, a former journalist who covered climate tech, startups and venture capital; Daria Saharova, worked at SevenVentures and Holtzbrinck. The team also also includes Craig Douglas, formerly with SET Ventures; and Christian Kroll as a venture partner, the founder and CEO of Ecosia. </p>
<p>World Fund has revealed that it has invested in three companies so far: a meat-replacement startup, one in waste reduction, and <a href="https://qoacompany.com/">Qoa Company</a>.</p>
<p>Which replaces Cocoa, a large source of CO2 emissions in agriculture.</p>
<p>Global &#8216;competitors&#8217; (more like fellow travellers) to World Fund include <a href="https://astanor.com/">Astanor</a>, Pale Blue Dot and 2150 VC which this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2/">raised</a> a $312m fund.</p>
<p>The investment team also includes experts such as mechanical and chemical engineers, physicists, and a mathematician. LPs include Trivago co-founder Rolf Schrömgens; Econos, a sustainable investment platform founded by Alexander Samwer; serial female entrepreneur and author Verena Pausder and her husband Philipp Pausder, the founder of Thermondo.</p>
<p>In addition, a leading scientific and advisory board including Max Planck Institute of Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship Professor director Dietmar Harhoff (who is also advising the German government and is a recipient of the Bundesverdienstkreuz &#8211; Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany); academic director and Scientists for Future founder Dr Gregor Hagedorn; and Deputy Head of Responsible Research at Fraunhofer Institute Simone Kaiser help advise World Fund.</p>
<p>Tim Schumacher, General Partner at World Fund, added: “I’ve been investing in technology for over ten years now, both in regular software and in climate tech, and during that time my climate investments outperformed my other investments. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for this is the caliber of people attracted to working on the largest problem humanity faces. At World Fund, we recognize that to tackle climate change, investing in new technology needs to be profitable and scalable.” </p>
<p>Daria Saharova, General Partner at World Fund, said: “There’s a huge opportunity to back the startups helping to roll back the clock on the climate crisis and transform the way whole sectors operate. From farming startups to battery technology, startups addressing climate change need more funds with deep pockets and a commitment to support dynamic companies, to ensure they can fulfill their potential.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marcyvp.com/">Marcy Venture Partners</a>, the venture firm cofounded in 2018 by Shawn Carter (Jay-Z), former Roc Nation CEO Jay Brown, and former Walden VC general partner Larry Marcus, says it has closed its second fund with $325 million in capital commitments. The team, which closed its debut fund with $85 million, is now managing $600 million in assets altogether, says cofounder Marcus.</p>
<p>The firm describes itself as having a &#8220;consumer, culture and positive impact&#8221; investment strategy, and it says the majority of its existing portfolio companies are founded or run by people who identify as women or people of color.</p>
<p>To date, the trio has written checks to at least 21 companies, including in fashion, skin care, and food companies. Among those many bets includes Rihanna&#8217;s lingerie company Savage X Fenty; the sneaker marketplace StockX; Therabody, which makes percussion therapy tools; Simulate, which makes plant-based, chicken-flavored nuggets; and an allergen-free cookie maker called Partake Foods.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Carter and company have also begun investing in crypto projects, supporting Bitski, a San Francisco-based startup NFT marketplace, earlier this year, and investing more recently in spatial LABS (sLABS), a tech incubator that focuses on the metaverse and blockchain-based products.</p>
<p>The San Francisco- and L.A.-based firm, named after the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn where Carter grew up, was initially targeting $200 million for the newest fund, per an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849285/000184928521000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> from April.</p>
<p>The firm is just one of many business interests for Carter. For example, he owns half of the champagne brand Armand de Brignac, known familiarly as Ace of Spades. He acquired the label for an undisclosed sum in 2014; in February of this year, Moet Hennessy bought half the company for terms that were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Carter also owned Tidal, a streaming music service that he&#8217;d bought in 2015 and renamed (and reshaped), before selling a &#8220;significant majority&#8221; of the company to the financial services giant Square for $297 million in cash and stock back in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He launched Monogram, a cannabis brand, last December.</p>
<p>And, of course, he most famously founded Roc Nation, a now 13-year-old, sprawling entertainment company that has its tentacles in everything from artist and athlete management, to labels, publishing, touring, film, and television, among other ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rhinoceros beetles are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263163270_Oryctes_rhinoceros_Beetles_an_Oil_Palm_Pest_in_Malaysia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the greatest threats to oil palm crops</a>, attacking plants while they are young and potentially lowering a farm’s yield for years. They also affect workers’ health, since pesticides need to be sprayed frequently. Based in Kuala Lumpur, <a href="https://www.poladrone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poladrone</a> wants to change the way farms use pesticides with a combination of drones and automation and analytics software.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised a $4.29 million seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, which it says is the largest seed round ever raised in Malaysia, based on data from <a href="http://crunchbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a>. Other participants include the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which is wholly-owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s sovereign wealth fund; ZB Capital Limited; and angel investors.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer. Cheong told TechCrunch that Poladrone is profitable, but decided to seek funding after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and “highlighted the positive impact our technology has on agriculture communities by creating jobs and upskilling opportunities.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223937" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/embed/#?secret=J7XU3wcvkG" data-secret="J7XU3wcvkG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adoption of Poladrone’s drones also increased during labor shortages caused by the pandemic, and the startup grew its team from 20 people to over 80 in less than a year to meet demand. Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts.</p>
<p>Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university.</p>
<p>After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized “the agriculture industry made perfect sense,” because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cheong’s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone’s products.</p>
<p>Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm’s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees’ growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants.</p>
<p>“The issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,” Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors.</p>

<p>In 2020, the company <a href="https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/digital-economy/poladrone-unleashes-oryctes-agricultural-spot-precision-drone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Oryctes</a>, developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas.</p>
<p>Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. “Data analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,” Cheong said. He added that oil palm farms cover 18.7 million hectares around the world, and Poladrone sees a serviceable addressable market of 4.2 million hectares in Malaysia alone, worth over $1.3 billion per year. The company is also planning to expand its reach to other types of crops, like rice, corn and sugarcane.</p>
<p>In addition to selling its products, Poladrone’s Service Centers also provide repairs, training and workshops, with the goal of increasing drone adoption. Cheong said it typically takes one week of training before workers start using Poladrone’s equipment, which can be operated from smartphones.</p>
<p>In statement about investment, Wavemaker Partners general partner Gavin Lee said, “Poladrone now works with eight out of 10 of the biggest palm oil farms in Malaysia—an impressive feat that gives us confidence to back the team and their vision of propelling Southeast Asia’s agriculture industry.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every CISO must face a cold, hard fact: You might not have a seat at the boardroom table or the executive leadership team meeting.</p>
<p>At some organizations, this relatively new role doesn’t get C-level attention yet, and at others, the organizational structure can prevent you from ever getting a permanent seat at the table. Other complexities arise if you report to a CIO or CTO and feel muted by the hierarchy. Or, perhaps your message is diluted by the time it gets up the chain of command.</p>
<p>While lack of access to the highest levels of your organization can be disheartening, remember that you can still have a significant influence on your organization and its security. You may just have to hustle.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Be a translator: When you engage in executive or board communication, speak like a business person and keep your messages brief and engaging.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As an executive, I’d happily meet with a team member (at any level) who wants to run ideas by me. If these ideas are interesting, I’d likely let them marinate for a few weeks before reaching back out to the employee with feedback. Now we’ve started an open dialogue and begun building a rapport. In the course of our conversations, maybe this person continues to present thought-provoking ideas. I might take their suggestions to the board or invite them to present them.</p>
<p>Of course, having a permanent seat at the table is ideal. But, if that’s not realistic, work to get yourself — or at least your ideas — into the boardroom. Just because you don’t have a standing invite doesn’t mean that you can’t have an impact.</p>
<h2>Create relatable and relevant messaging</h2>
<p>To get your message across to time-strapped executives (or just about anyone for that matter), you need to meet them where they are. You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership’s shoes to explain why it’s crucial to theirs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hark, all ye who pay attention to the stock market, for Elon Musk&#8217;s wheels-focused company broached the $1 trillion market cap threshold today.</p>
<p>Yeah, it finally happened, so the Equity team quickly scrambled for the microphones. <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> put together the show, allowing <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten</a> to dive into the matter. Kirsten, in case you aren&#8217;t familiar with her, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/kirsten-korosec/">TechCrunch&#8217;s transportation editor</a> &#8212; her crew handles everything that moves under its own power for the team. She&#8217;s tremendous.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Aside from the obvious market cap point, we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>What news drove Tesla higher today, leading to its new valuation record?</li>
<li>How is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/">Tesla&#8217;s overall financial performance looking</a>?</li>
<li>Has the model mix at the company changed over time?</li>
<li>And, because Alex was curious, why Telsa cars all look the same when will the Cybertruck will come to market?</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it was a very fun Twitter shot. Cheers, and Equity is back Wednesday with our regular programming.</p>

<h2>The next chapter of the new space economy: Destinations</h2>
<p>I spoke with Voyager Space Holdings CEO Dylan Taylor, Nanoracks CEO Jeffrey Manber and Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s VP of commercial civil space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">to discuss the companies&#8217; plans to launch a commercial space station in 2027.</a></p>
<p>“NASA as a customer has unleashed this extraordinary revolution in space transportation,” Manber said. “Building on the success that NASA had with cargo, building on the success of commercial crew, one can anticipate that with the markets interested in space, we&#8217;re going to see the same thing with smaller private space stations.”</p>

<h2>Starship fires up as SpaceX awaits regulatory approval</h2>
<p>For the first time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/">SpaceX completed two test firings</a> of its Raptor vacuum engines while they were attached to a Starship rocket. CEO Elon Musk later said the next-gen, heavy-lift rocket will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending approval from regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship <a href="https://t.co/uCNAt8Kwzo">pic.twitter.com/uCNAt8Kwzo</a></p>
<p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1451350259729420288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>SpaceX still needs approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before it can attempt to send a fully stacked version of its Starship and Super Heavy booster to orbit. This past week, the regulator heard public comment in two separate sessions on its draft environmental assessment of the proposed launch site, a normal part of the licensing process. It&#8217;s unclear when the FAA is likely to release a final decision on the license. The public comment period on the draft EA is open until November 1.</p>
<h2>NASA and Boeing: Starliner grounded until first half of 2022</h2>
<p>The beleaguered Starliner spacecraft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">will not fly until sometime during the first half of next year at the earliest, NASA and Boeing executives confirmed</a>. While Boeing is still unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities, the company is suspecting Florida humidity and corrosion as the main culprit.</p>
<p>Boeing emphasized during a media briefing that it had conducted multiple tests on these valves prior to Starliner making it to the launch pad, and yet it still didn&#8217;t catch the issue. Nevertheless, NASA&#8217;s manager of the Commercial Crew program Steve Stich said the agency maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.”</p>

<h2>Senate committee to NASA: Pick two developers for lunar lander program</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/senate-budget-committee-tells-nasa-to-select-two-developers-for-lunar-lander-program/">Senators have directed NASA to select two teams</a> to develop lunar landers under the Human Landing System program, according to a draft appropriations bill for the agency&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget. The catch? They&#8217;re only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so.</p>
<p>NASA has maintained that it selected SpaceX &#8212; and only SpaceX &#8212; to develop a lander because it submitted the lowest-cost bid: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significant difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program &#8212; which is only $100 million &#8212; will enable NASA to select an additional team.</p>

<h2>News from around the web</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spacenews.com/leolabs-western-australia-radar/">LeoLabs</a>, a startup developing a global tracking network for objects in orbit, has announced the sixth site for its next two ground phased-array radars: Western Australia. The site will help the company track launches from Asia, as well as orbital objects traveling over the southern hemisphere.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/spacex-to-become-more-valuable-than-tesla-morgan-stanley-survey.html">Morgan Stanley Research</a> released a survey showing that institutional investors and industry experts expect SpaceX to hit a higher valuation than Tesla.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 25, 2021. What a <em>day</em>. We kicked off with news that a major, multibillion-dollar tech deal was kaput and closed out the trading day on news that another tech firm had reached the trillion-dollar market cap threshold. Facebook also reported earnings right after the bell, and TechCrunch dropped a host of hardware reviews. Tired yet? It’s <em>Monday</em>. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p><em>P.S. Our </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/announcing-the-final-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas-2021/"><em>SaaS event is in two days</em></a><em>; get hype.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/equity-monday-paypal-punts-on-pinterest-as-facebooks-hell-month-continues/"><strong>PayPal calls off Pinterest deal:</strong></a> So much for the fintech-social media tie-up of the decade. U.S. fintech giant PayPal has killed off its potential buy of Pinterest. Shares of PayPal rose. Shares of Pinterest cratered. I suppose our general skepticism of the deal wasn’t <em>too </em>far off the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tesla-hertz-shares-rise-electric-vehicle-order/"><strong>Tesla reaches $1T market cap:</strong></a> You may have missed it, but Tesla is now worth more than Facebook these days, cresting the $1 billion market cap market today during regular trading, while the social network closed the day worth a few dozen billion less. What drove Tesla’s gains? Hertz, amazingly enough.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/"><strong>Facebook misses revenue expectations, promises reporting changes:</strong></a> After the bell today, Facebook reported its Q3 2021 earnings, including a revenue miss, a per-share profit beat, and news that it intends to break out its AR and VR revenues into a separate category from here on out. The latter is good news, though we’d appreciate more granular financial reporting from across the Empire of Zuck now that we know the company is capable of it. Shares of Facebook are up slightly, if still underwater from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">their Friday declines that came in the wake of Snap’s Q3 report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get truly underway with all of our startup coverage, we have a new item from Unicorn Land: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/braze-set-to-put-points-on-the-board-for-new-yorks-startup-scene-in-impending-ipo/">New York tech company Braze is going public</a>. While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, the company will nearly certainly crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it debuts on the public markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/"><strong>All hail our commercial space future:</strong></a> A consortium of firms are coming together to build a commercial space station. Given how rapidly the ISS is showing its age, this is a good thing. Sierra Space announced that “Blue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the [private space station] to orbit in the second half of the decade.” We are closer and closer to our Bond-villain future that we’ve all long awaited.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/selfbook-raises-25m-at-a-125m-valuation2222709/">Selfbook raises capital, pivots to business focus:</a> </strong>The pandemic shook up quite a lot. Where we work. How we socialize. For hotel-booking company Selfbook, it shook up its business model. Now working for other companies, Selfbook “claims that its software gives hotels a way to accept ‘one-click’ payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.” The startup is now worth $125 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/cameo-represent-acquisition/">Cameo books acquisition:</a> </strong>The celebrity-booking service Cameo has proven to have a popular model. You can pay a fee and have a celebrity or other notable figure record a message for you. I once got one from an Eagles player that a friend commissioned for me. Fun times. Anyhoo, the company has made its first acquisition, picking up Represent, which TechCrunch describes as “a marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts.” You can see the synergies, obviously.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/data-platform-y42-raises-31m/"><strong>Are all the startup names taken?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here at TechCrunch, we joke that there are too many venture capital firms, so much so that they are starting to double-up on names. For Example, <a href="http://shinecap.com/index.html">Shine Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.shine.vc/">Shine Capital</a>.

<h2>Fintech’s growing role in the healthcare revolution</h2>
<p>Health care spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it&#8217;s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment. This year, VCs have flowed $14.7 billion to health tech startups, compared to $14.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>Given the high cost of care in the United States compared to other nations, pairing fintech with health tech is just good business.</p>
<p>Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation, says he&#8217;s paying close attention to these areas of convergence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and the transition to value-based care.</li>
<li>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chicago-based Promus Ventures has closed a €120 million ($139 million) space fund, dubbed Orbital Ventures, focused on early-stage space companies.</p>
<p>The new fund, which will be based in Luxembourg, grew out of a mix of public and private investment. The European Investment Fund, the financing arm of the European Union’s European Investment Bank Group, committed €40 million, with additional participation by Luxembourg’s Ministry of the Economy and the National Credit and Investment Institution.</p>
<p>While Promus Ventures’ invests across a range of industries, its track history in the space sector includes investments in Rocket Lab, Spire and Swift Navigation. Orbital Ventures, which made its first close in January 2020, has also made several investments, including in satellite terminal developer Isotropic Systems, geospatial data company Ellipsis Drive, and Denmark’s Fernride.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223803" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We continue to witness terrific growth and developments in the New Space industry, and we are excited to deploy this new sector-specific space fund,” Promus Ventures partner Pierre Festal said in a statement. “We are thankful to our investors for their trust and support in this endeavor. […] It’s a pivotal time for global space players and the outlook is strong.”</p>
<p>The new fund is just the latest sector-specific space fund to emerge in recent years, as investor interest in the burgeoning orbital market continues to rise. Last week, Space Capital reported that investors – including VCs, angel investors, corporate investors, private equity and others – poured $8.7 billion into the industry in the third quarter of 2021 alone, positioning this year to beat 2020’s investing record.</p>
<p>Much of the capital raised went to space companies that went public via mergers with blank-check firms. These deals accounted for $1.2 billion of the $3.9 billion of venture funding during the third quarter of this year.</p>
