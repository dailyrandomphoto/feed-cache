										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">reported</a> Monday an eye-popping $1.14 billion in net income in the second quarter, results that blew past analyst expectations and marked the first time the company&#8217;s quarterly profit (on a GAAP basis) has passed the three-comma threshold. The results pushed shares up more than 2.2% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Tesla was able to beat expectations and log its eighth straight quarter of profitability even as it grappled with supply chain challenges and losses stemming from its bitcoin investment. Operating income was $1.3 billion, which increased year-over-year from $327 million, due to volume growth and cost reduction, the company said. Those positive results were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, supply chain challenges, lower regulatory credit revenue and a the aforementioned bitccoin-related impairment of $23 million.</p>
<p>Supply chain challenges, notably the global shortage of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports, were two factors that affected its business in the second quarter. Tesla noted that it will continue to impact operations and its rate of delivery growth in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year,&#8221; the company said in its shareholder deck released Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla reported revenue of $11.96 billion, a nearly 100% increase from the $6.04 billion it generated in the second quarter of 2020. Revenue in the second quarter was also higher than last quarter&#8217;s total of $10.39 billion. Analysts surveyed by Factset estimated $11.4 billion in revenue and $600 million in profit.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s automotive revenue was $10.2 billion in the second quarter. Notably, only $354 million of that automotive revenue came from the sale of regulatory credits, 17% lower than last quarter and the lowest in the past four quarters. Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s automotive gross margins popped to 28.4%, a historic high for the metric.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Q2 net income of $1.14 billion compared favorably with the $104 million worth net income in the same period last year, a gain just shy of 1,000%. That record-setting number is nearly three times more its Q1 2021 net income of $438 million. Tesla’s adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $2.24 billion in the quarter, up from $1.21 billion in the same year-ago period, a gain of roughly 100%.</p>
<p>Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents decreased to $16.2 billion in the second quarter, according to Tesla, which said that decrease was driven mainly by net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6 billion, partially offset by free cash flow of $619 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tesla reported its produced 206,421 vehicles in the second quarter. Of those, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, nearly 9% more than the first quarter of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May, the neighborhood crime-watch app Citizen <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">offered its user base $30,000</a> to track down a suspected arsonist on live video, only to discover that they&#8217;d sent a mob of civilians after the wrong guy. Now, Citizen is covertly hiring journalists to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/citizen-pays-new-yorkers-25-an-hour-to-livestream-crime-scenes/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">livestream on the app at crime scenes</a> for $25 per hour through third-party websites. I&#8217;m tired.</p>
<p>When Citizen first hit the App Store in 2016, it was called Vigilante — it marketed itself as a platform to <a href="https://citizen-app.medium.com/vigilante-manifesto-e665696a4ebb#.g2di4nexy">fight injustice with transparency</a>, which might sound good in theory, but in practice, it deliberately encouraged users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store">seek out crime scenes</a> to report them. Vigilante was removed from the App Store for violating a clause in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">Apple&#8217;s App Developer Review Guidelines</a> that an app shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;likely to cause physical harm from its use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely, this would be the end for the nascent platform. But like a cockroach after an apocalypse, the app chugged on. It rebranded itself as Citizen, added disclaimers that no one should interfere with a crime scene, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/?_ga=2.175516256.336873417.1550176258-1373501013.1516818895">reentered the App Store</a>, and continued to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/citizen-app-crime-sequoia-san-francisco-12-million-series-a/">raise VC funding</a>. Now, the app is like a crowd-sourced crime blotter — as its App Store page says, &#8220;Citizen may notify you of a crime in progress before the police have responded.&#8221; But this level of hypervigilance can <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/justinbrannan/nyc-brooklyn-safe-citizen-app-freakout">fuel panic</a>, rather than make people feel safe — not to mention that user-reported crime incidents might be incorrect at best, and racist at worst. The app pulls data from 911 calls, but not all information in those dispatches are verified, which can be cause for false concern.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>But Citizen can only function if it has enough of a user base, and its attempts to corral civilians to use the app have gotten more and more desperate. According to SensorTower, the app hit a monthly download high in June 2020, in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests. (So, as the country protested police brutality, 677,000 people responded by downloading a policing app). But the following month, just 207,000 people downloaded the app. Since then, growth has been pretty stagnant — 292,000 people downloaded Citizen in March 2020, and 283,000 people downloaded it in March 2021.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/citizen-app-landon/">the Daily Dot reported</a> that one specific user named &#8220;Landon&#8221; was livestreaming from multiple crime scenes in one day, attempting to interview witnesses and first responders — given how often he seemed to stumble upon these crime scenes, it seemed unlikely that he was just an enthusiastic app user. Yesterday, the New York Post reported on another user named &#8220;Chris&#8221; who livestreamed on Citizen from <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/citizen-pays-new-yorkers-25-an-hour-to-livestream-crime-scenes/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">six emergencies in one day</a>. Citizen confirmed that both Landon and Chris were working for the app as members of its Street Team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Citizen has teams in place in some of the cities where the app is available to demonstrate how the platform works, and to model responsible broadcasting practices in situations when events are unfolding in real time. We believe these teams will ultimately help guide our users on how to broadcast in an effective, helpful and safe way,&#8221; a Citizen spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Citizen has had Street Teams since the app&#8217;s launch; a spokesperson said that they&#8217;ve never tried to hide this. But these jobs are not listed on the Citizen website. Instead, they&#8217;re listed by a third-party recruiter called Flyover Entertainment on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210722213718/https://www.journalismjobs.com/1666655-field-reporter--street-team-lead-flyover-entertainment">JournalismJobs board</a> without mention of Citizen. An NYU Journalism website shared <a href="https://careerservices.nyujournalism.org/job/2021-07-16/field-reporter-street-team-leads/">a similar listing</a>, which did include the Citizen name. Citizen confirmed to TechCrunch that both of these listings are for the app&#8217;s Street Team. Citizen pays $250 per day for a 10-hour shift in LA, and $200 per day for an 8-hour shift in NYC, which comes out to $25 per hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broadcast journalists have experience in broadcasting safely and responsibly. This is a requisite for our Street Team members,&#8221; said the Citizen spokesperson. When asked why these jobs were posted on third-party job boards, but not Citizen&#8217;s own website, the spokesperson reiterated that it was because Citizen specifically wanted to find journalists. However, it could presumably also find journalists on its own website.</p>
<p>Surveillance state vigilantism concerns aside, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/local-news-is-dying-and-americans-have-no-idea/585772/">local news is dying</a>, and Citizen is not built to be a substitute for neighborhood journalism. Sure, local newspapers report on crime too, and it&#8217;s not as though Citizen is doing something unprecedented by sending reporters to scope out crime scenes. But there&#8217;s a difference between reporting news and livestreaming from a crime scene on a surveillance app that only discloses who is a paid worker and who is an average civilian when directly asked. For an app that is modeled on &#8220;<a href="https://citizen.com/">increasing transparency</a>,&#8221; these covert job postings don&#8217;t feel so transparent. Plus, for an infrequent freelance gig with no benefits or paid time off that requires established broadcasting skills, $25 per hour is a pretty bad rate.</p>
<p>Now, Citizen&#8217;s latest attempt at growth is a paid service for $19.99 per month called Protect, which lets users send their location and a livestream from their camera to a Protect Agent. Citizen says its Protect Agents include former law enforcement officers and 911 operators, who can send an &#8220;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">instant emergency response</a>&#8221; in case of emergency. This sort of seems like paying to get a personal 911 operator, which, again, feels like a poor alternative to policing, an already poor system.</p>
<p>Maybe Silicon Valley-bred tech companies aren&#8217;t the answer to the United States&#8217; centuries-long crises of police brutality, racial profiling and surveillance. Maybe a better way to reduce crime is to ensure that all people have access to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/01/03/new-evidence-that-access-to-health-care-reduces-crime/">health care</a>, <a href="https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/53294/theeffectsofunemploymentoncimerates.pdf">jobs</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/homes/rent-affordability-minimum-wage/index.html">affordable housing</a>. Who knows!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Duolingo is now targeting a $95 to $100 per share IPO price range, up from $85 to $95 per share, or a gain of around 12% at the bottom and 5% at the top.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. edtech company Duolingo released a revised IPO price range this morning, boosting its potential per-share value to $100 after initially targeting a range that topped out at $95 per share.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001562088/000162828021014402/duolingos-1a2upsize_new.htm">unicorn&#8217;s SEC filings</a>, Duolingo is now targeting a $95 to $100 per share IPO price range, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">up from $85 to $95 per share</a>, or a gain of around 12% at the bottom and 5% at the top.</p>
<p>TechCrunch previously called the Duolingo debut a bellwether of sorts for the larger U.S. edtech ecosystem; if Duolingo can price and trade well, investors in private companies may be more willing to invest, given a more proven and attractive exit market. On the other hand, if Duolingo prices weakly or trades poorly, the company could place a wet blanket atop the startup edtech world.</p>
<p>The fact that Duolingo is raising its IPO price range indicates that we are more likely on the path for a strong offering than a weak one.</p>
<p>For edtech companies that have hit unicorn status &#8212; like Masterclass, Course Hero, Quizlet and Outschool &#8212; it&#8217;s good news. For reference, those companies have raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/masterclass">$461.4 million</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursehero">$97.4 million</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quizlet">$62 million</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/outschool">$130 million</a>, respectively, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Duolingo worth?</h2>
<p>The terms of the company&#8217;s IPO have not changed, aside from its proposed price. So, Duolingo is still selling 3.7 million shares in its debut, and some 1.41 million shares will be sold by existing equity holders. The company&#8217;s underwriters also reserved their right to buy 765,916 shares of the company&#8217;s stock at IPO price in the 30 days following its debut.</p>
<p>At the upper and lower bands of the company&#8217;s IPO price, its simple valuation excluding underwriter shares now lands between $3.41 billion and $3.59 billion. Inclusive of its greenshoe offering, those numbers rise to $3.48 billion and $3.67 billion.</p>
<p>Recall that when private, Duolingo&#8217;s November 2020 Series H valued the company at just over $2.4 billion. So long as Duolingo prices in its range, it will provide investors with a nice bump in the value of their investment. Duolingo was valued at just $1.6 billion in mid-2020, indicating that it has more than doubled in value since that investment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Despite the plentiful headlines about mega billion-dollar M&amp;A transactions, record IPOs and the rapid growth of SPACs, small deals will continue to be the most likely exit for the vast majority of tech startups. In the over 30 years I&#8217;ve worked on M&amp;A at White &amp; Case, Barclays and my current firm Ascento Capital, I have seen too many startups that are not prepared for an exit via a merger or sale. This article will provide specific recommendations on how to prepare your startup for M&amp;A.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			While it is good to strive for a billion-dollar-plus sale, a successful IPO or a SPAC deal, it is practical to prepare your startup for a smaller transaction.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Global M&amp;A hit record highs in the second quarter with a total deal value of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/dealmakers-drown-deals-second-quarter-ma-frenzy-2021-07-01/">$1.5 trillion</a>, but smaller transactions vastly outnumber mega billion-dollar deals. The U.S. saw a total of 16,672 deals in the year ended June 31, but only 583, or 3% of that number, were valued at more than a billion dollars (<a href="https://www.factset.com/hubfs/mergerstat_em/monthly/US-Flashwire-Monthly.pdf">FactSet</a>). The IPO market is healthy again, but M&amp;A still represents 88% of exits: So far this year, there were 503 IPOs and 5,203 deals, according to the CB Insights Q2 2021 <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">State of Venture Report</a>. After the SEC announced in early April that it was considering new guidance on SPAC IPOs, the rate of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevindowd/2021/07/04/a-perfect-storm-record-breaking-ma-a-spac-slowdown-antitrust-action-media-mega-mergers-and-more-from-a-frantic-first-half-of-deals-in-2021/?sh=6ebfb01a1dc5">new SPAC issuances fell by around 90%</a>.</p>
<p>While it is good to strive for a billion-dollar-plus sale, a successful IPO or a SPAC deal, it is practical to prepare your startup for a smaller transaction.</p>
<p>Here are a few recommendations that will prepare your startup for an M&amp;A exit:</p>
<h2>Track M&amp;A in your subsector</h2>
<p>Set up an alert on <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> for M&amp;A activity in your subsector. For example, if your startup is in the IoT subsector, search for &#8220;IoT acqui&#8221; and this will pick up news stories on acquisitions in the IoT space. Save the search so you can go to Google News on a regular basis. Also track your closest competitors on Google News, particularly to see who is selling their company.</p>
<h2>Prepare a list of likely acquirers</h2>
<p>Prepare a list of the companies or firms most likely to buy your startup. This list should include domestic and international companies, businesses in non-tech industries, private equity firms and their portfolio companies, as well as VC-backed companies. Track these likely acquirers on Google News as well.</p>
<h2>Consider executing a parallel track</h2>
<p>Consider approaching the top 10 likely acquirers when you are raising the next round of capital. If your startup gets M&amp;A offers and VC term sheets at the same time, this will provide your board of directors choices on the path ahead. Knowing the M&amp;A activity in your startup’s subsector and the 10 most likely acquirers will impress VCs and increase the chances of being funded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The whole human proteome may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">free to browse thanks to DeepMind</a>, but at the bleeding edge of biotech new proteins are made and tested every day, a complex and time-consuming process. <a href="https://glyphic.bio/">Glyphic Biotechnologies</a> accelerates the critical but slow sequencing step, potentially cutting drug development times down by a huge amount, and the startup just raised a $6 million seed to bring its clever solution to market.</p>
<p>Proteins are at the heart of many new treatments and products; the ubiquitous and infinitely varied chains of amino acids twist into shapes that interact with cells, substances in the body, and other proteins, doing everything from interpreting DNA to controlling access to secure areas (&#8220;sorry, no potassium allowed&#8221;).</p>
<p>In the drug discovery and biotech world, proteins represent unlimited possibility — the right one could clamp onto cancer cells, facilitate natural healing processes, or prompt the creation of helpful substances. But finding and testing novel molecules is not easy — and a big part of that is sequencing, which confirms the exact makeup of the protein you&#8217;re trying to test.</p>
<p>Right now there are several large companies doing good business in the protein discovery world, and generally the process involves identifying the amino acid at the end of the protein chain, then snipping it off, identifying the next one, and so on until you&#8217;ve done the whole thing.</p>
<p>The trouble with this approach is that the protein&#8217;s shape or the molecular properties of the next amino acid in line can interfere with the process of binding to and identifying the one on the very end. As a result there&#8217;s a certain amount of uncertainty and a lack of unreliability inherent to the process.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=Rr73pY9OCy" data-secret="Rr73pY9OCy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Glyphic Biotechnologies changes that by adding a step where the target amino acid is detached <em>first</em> and then tethered nearby using a novel molecule called ClickP developed by one of the co-founders. A single stationary amino acid attached to a known molecule is much, much easier to identify, and when it&#8217;s done, the process repeats as before.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s briefly stated but the advance is significant. Current techniques in the antibody discovery space produce and inspect on the order of tens of thousands of proteins per week per (very expensive) machine. It sounds like a lot but with proteins essentially innumerable, it&#8217;s just a drop in the bucket. Even running 24/7 this rate doesn&#8217;t come close to satisfying demand.</p>
<p>Glyphic&#8217;s approach, utilizing ClickP and single-molecule microscopy (like that used by DNA sequencing giant Illumina), should be capable of millions to tens of millions per week, possibly climbing to billions in time. Even at the most conservative estimate you&#8217;re talking about orders of magnitude in improvement — those tens of thousands in the other techniques include lots of (perhaps mostly) repeat or junk information due to their use of B cell cultivation to produce the antibodies in question.</p>

<p>Not only that, but because the ClickP process avoids the problem of interference from the next amino acid in the chain, it has way, way higher specificity and confidence. So you wouldn&#8217;t just be sequencing a hundred or a thousand times as many proteins, you&#8217;d be far more sure about the results.</p>
<p>At first Glyphic would be processing samples sent to them, but ultimately their tech could live in other labs as their competitors do now. Going from service to hardware sales and support is the current roadmap.</p>
<p>If everything works as advertised, Glyphic could be the new standard in protein sequencing just as demand skyrockets in the biotech world. To do so, though, it needs just a bit more time in the incubator.</p>
<p>The process they pioneered was the result of work done by co-founders Joshua Yang (CEO) and Daniel Estandian (CTO) at the lab of MIT&#8217;s Ed Boyden (on the team as &#8220;scientific founder&#8221;).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182011" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182011" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182011" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="514" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg 1244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daniel-josh.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2182011" class="wp-caption-text">CTO Daniel Estandian, left, and CEO Josh Yang. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Glyphic Biotechnologies</p></div></p>
<p>Yang explained that what stands between them and potential industry dominance is a mere matter of chemical engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;My co-founder [Estandian] developed ClickP himself. The chemistry works,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;But as a spinout of an academic lab, we didn&#8217;t develop all 20 binders, because it would have bankrupted the lab. This isn&#8217;t an &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; molecule.&#8221;</p>
<p>These binders are a bit like adapters that make the process work for each of the 20 amino acids. It takes time and money to engineer them, so they decided to show the system off with a handful first in order to get the cash to make the rest. &#8220;It&#8217;s really just about putting the time into getting them out there,&#8221; said Yang.</p>
<p>The $6.025 million seed round should finance the company through this early stage as it builds its platform. It was led by OMX ventures (which previously invested in 10X Genomics and Twist Bioscience), with participation from Osage University Partners, Wing VC, Artis Ventures, Cantos Ventures, Civilization Ventures, and Axial VC, and has an angel investor in Mammoth Biosciences CEO Trevor Martin.</p>

<p>Glyphic will be making its first home at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/berkeley-has-a-big-new-biotech-incubator-in-bakar-labs/">Bakar Labs, the freshly inaugurated new Berkeley biotech incubator</a>. There it will stay until it&#8217;s ready to take the next big step, likely hardware manufacturing next year on the back of an A round to be raised then. 2022 should then also see the company&#8217;s first paid services. And the antibody market, as large as it is, is only the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antibodies are just a starting point, as numerous applications can benefit from protein sequencing,&#8221; Josh explained in an email after we spoke. &#8220;Another high value area is in industrial biotechnology, where protein-sequencing-based screening of evolved enzymes can help identify enhanced or novel functions (e.g., better laundry detergents, waste-water treatment). Development of diagnostic tests would also benefit because, the more proteins you can sequence and identify in a sample set, the increased likelihood you can identify rare yet important biomarkers and/or develop a robust panel of biomarkers that together can detect or predict disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>A company like Glyphic may seem like a perfect target to get snapped up by one of the more deep-pocketed competitors out there, but Yang said they&#8217;re confident enough to ride it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The activity in this space is insane. My co-founder and I really want to be the next Illumina or 10X Genomics — we really want to be that leader in proteomics.&#8221; And unless the competition has a few cards hidden up their sleeves, Yang&#8217;s ambition seems like a distinct possibility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MyGlamm, a direct-to-consumer beauty brand in India that sells most of its products through its own website, app and retail touch points, said on Monday it has raised $71.3 million in a financing round as the Mumbai-headquartered firm looks to scale its business across the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The startup had raised $23.5 million in its four-times subscribed Series C financing round from Amazon, Ascent Capital and Wipro in March this year. On Monday, it said it has added an additional $47.8 million as part of the round &#8212; which is now closed.</p>
<p>Accel led the investment in the new tranche while existing MyGlamm investors &#8212; Bessemer Venture Partners, L’Occitane, Ascent, Amazon, Mankekar family, Trifecta and Strides Ventures &#8212; also participated, Darpan Sanghvi, founder and chief executive of MyGlamm, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sanghvi started <a href="https://www.myglamm.com">MyGlamm</a> in 2017 after pivoting his previous venture. He recalled the struggle he faced raising money for a direct-to-consumer brand, which were not as popular in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market just five years ago. To make matters worse, MyGlamm was also among the last direct-to-consumer startups to kick off its journeys at the time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182027" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182027" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182027 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1041" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=768,533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/myglamm-website.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182027" class="wp-caption-text">MyGlamm website. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MyGlamm</p></div></p>
<p>The startup today operates as a house of brands in the beauty and personal care spaces. “We operate across makeup, skincare, haircare, bath and body, and personal care. Unlike other brands, we have been able to successfully build a master brand across categories,” he said over a video call.</p>
<p>“The reason we have been able to build this is because we are truly direct to consumers. This allows us to communicate very directly with them,” he said, adding that most other firms in the industry are too reliant on third-party marketplaces for their sales.</p>
<p>He attributed the recent growth of the startup, which sells over 800 SKUs across categories (up from 600 in March), to its newfound user acquisition strategy. In August, the startup acquired POPxo, a startup that has built a community around content, influencers and commerce and serves over 60 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>“The content to the commerce engine has become our biggest moat,” he said. “We are acquiring 250,000 new users each month without spending any real money.”</p>
<p>POPxo, which is run by Priyanka Gill, engages with nearly 300,000 users each month, gathering their feedback and ideas for new products. Gill said in a video call that “in this line of business, CAC (cost of customer acquisition) is the game and POPxo has solved this problem,” she said, adding that POPxo, which is run like a fairly independent business, is on track to reach over 100 million users by March next year.</p>
<p>The startup also has 15,000 point-of-sale touch points in the physical world across India. The physical presence, which accounts for 40% of the revenue it generates today, “has been crucial to scale in the country,” Sanghvi said.</p>
<p>“We believe that the time is ripe for building out digital-first CPG brands with a deep focus on content-to-commerce,” said Anand Daniel, partner at Accel, in a statement.</p>
<p>“COVID has only cemented this belief. The unique combination of content coupled with a compelling product line gave us the conviction to lead this round in MyGlamm. We are excited to partner with Darpan, Priyanka and the MyGlamm team and look forward to building out the next-generation CPG giant,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its product development, data science and technology research teams. It is also working to expand its offline presence and broadening the digital reach of POPxo.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Last week, Tribe Capital&#8217;s investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/indias-blackbuck-valued-at-1-billion-in-67-million-fundraise/">crowned BlackBuck as India&#8217;s 16th unicorn this year</a>, compared to 11 last year and six in 2019. Food delivery startup Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">made a stellar stock market debut last week</a> and financial services firms MobiKwik and Paytm have also filed for their IPOs. Insurance aggregator service PolicyBazaar and online beauty e-commerce firm Nykaa are also expected to file their paperwork for an IPO in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polestar plans to launch in nine more markets this year, doubling its global presence as it seeks to sell more of its electric sedans.</p>
<p>The company, which is the electric performance vehicle brand under Volvo Car Group, said it is also planning to double the number of retail stores to 100 locations and add more service centers by the end of the year. Some of the retail locations will be temporary pop-up stores. The Swedish automaker has more than 650 so-called &#8220;service points&#8221; in Polestar markets and wants to exceed 780 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Polestar launched last year in the U.S., China, Canada, Belgium, Germany, UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. By the end of the year, the company plans to be in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specifically within the United States, Polestar has service centers and retail stores in Austin, Bellevue, Washington, Boston, Detroit, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Princeton, New Jersey, San Francisco, San Jose and Scottsdale, Arizona. Polestar plans to add locations in Orange County, California, central New Jersey, Charlotte, North Carolina and Grapevine, Texas.</p>
<p>This pace of expansion doesn&#8217;t appear to be waning. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement that the company aims to expand at a similar rate in terms of new markets in 2022. &#8220;This continued pace, combined with new retail concepts, will support our goal to exceed our owners&#8217; expectations,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today, Polestar has one primary product: the all-electric Polestar 2. But it has plans to add more to its portfolio in the coming years. The automaker announced in June that it would manufacture its first all-electric SUV in the United States. The SUV, which is called the Polestar 3, will be assembled at a plant shared with Volvo Cars at a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Polestar 3 follows the all-electric Polestar 2 sedan and the hybrid grand tourer Polestar 1. Production of Polestar 3 is expected to begin globally in 2022.</p>
<p>As Polestar scales up, it&#8217;s keen to find new ways to reach customers. The main strategy is to add more retail stores and expand in existing markets or into new ones. The company said Monday it is also experimenting with a new concept called Polestar Destinations. These &#8220;destinations&#8221; act just likes its &#8220;Polestar Spaces&#8221; stores, but are larger and located outside of urban centers. These destination stores will also act as centers where customers can pick up their vehicles, which can be ordered and paid for online.</p>
<p>The company is also adding 60 more test drive locations by the end of 2021 to provide additional access to Polestar 2 vehicles.</p>
<p>All of this expansion is being supported by an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/polestar-raises-500m-from-outside-investors-as-ev-market-grows/">influx of $550 million</a> that Polestar raised in April in an external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment. SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated in that round.</p>
<p>While this was Polestar&#8217;s first external round, the company suggested at the time that it wouldn&#8217;t be the last.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; raspy, deep voice helped her raise more than $700 million for her now-defunct company, Theranos. When I step into any boardroom for a pitch, I can hear her croaking her <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2197299-elizabeth-holmes-the-hypnotic-tale-of-the-rise-and-fall-of-theranos/#ixzz702xCxlA8">favorite line</a>: &#8220;I hope that less people will have to say goodbye too soon to people that they love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting across from a venture partner, I wonder if they might feel more compelled by my words if I cut my hair short (really short), or grew a beard, or removed my pregnant belly. Would they take out their checkbook if I were more aggressive in what I promised? Would they be more interested in getting to know my business and me better if I passionately slammed the table?</p>
<p>Actually, very likely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Holmes <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-deep-voice-2019-3%3Famp">adopted a ridiculously low voice</a> to get her startup off the ground in a world full of men. She promised impossible pinprick tests to detect hundreds of diseases and collected influential investors like Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Mattis and Betsy DeVos. She wore a Steve Jobs uniform &#8212; including the Issey Miyake turtleneck &#8212; and built a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/former-employees-theranos-explain-themselves-110149347.html">team of 800 brilliant people</a>. Did she go overboard with her lies? Yes. But she&#8217;s not the only one. The Silicon Valley and venture landscape only exacerbated whatever beliefs she already had in her company and inclinations to promise the moon.</p>
<p>Last week at a virtual hearing, she <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-renews-fight-to-constrain-prosecutors-11625693675">pushed</a> to keep a huge database of information protected from the government. Before that, she <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-sec-charges-theranos-and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-with-massive-frau.html">claimed</a> to have made $100 million in revenue in 2014, when it was really $100,000. These things, among others, are hands-down inexcusable. But I still believe that she thought she was doing the right thing taking the universal advice of Silicon Valley: &#8220;Fake it till you make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She once <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/15/theranos-ceo-fires-back-at-wsj-i-was-shocked.html">said, </a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-2315880316">borrowing</a> from previous thought leaders: &#8220;This is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you&#8217;re crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world.&#8221; I wonder if she just thinks she&#8217;s now on part two.</p>
<p>Raising money to start a company is about two things: having connections and making an appearance. Connections are <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">difficult</a> to make when you&#8217;re a woman: &#8220;Only about 12% of decision-makers at VC firms are women, and most firms still don’t have a single female partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even if you have connections, building relationships can be a bit weird: My cofounders end up being text buddies with our investors, while I hear news of things in passing. We hit a peak of 2.8% of funding going to women-led startups in 2019, but in 2020, that <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">dropped</a> again to 2.3%, possibly because investors reverted to their standard habits of keeping their cards close during uncertain times. Furthermore, investors generally have expectations that are aligned with male tendencies. For example, identical slides and scripts that are read by men and women are judged very differently, with <a href="https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/investors-prefer-entrepreneurial-ventures-pitched-attractive-men">men overwhelmingly rated higher</a>. Holmes’ deep voice, although off-putting, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347212004769?via%3Dihub">probably made her more convincing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to replicate the fundraising success that Holmes had, though. If other women tried to emulate this, they&#8217;d likely be penalized: In general, forward men are viewed positively as assertive, while forward women are viewed as <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/we-recorded-vcs-conversations-and-analyzed-how-differently-they-talk-about-female-entrepreneurs">emotionally unstable</a>. This is confusing because, inversely, if women <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/research-investors-punish-entrepreneurs-for-stereotypically-feminine-behaviors">retreat</a> to stereotypically feminine behaviors, they are viewed as weak. Hillary Clinton got stuck in this during her presidential race &#8212; criticized for being aggressive and cold when stereotypically masculine traits and pegged as weak when showing stereotypically feminine traits.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it turns out that in pitches, women are <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">asked</a> more preventative questions about potential loss and risk, while men are asked more promotional questions about upside and gains. Women can <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/how-the-vc-pitch-process-is-failing-female-entrepreneurs">work around this</a> by answering any preventative question in the positive. Holmes knew this deep down and played into it. That was the only way for her to win.</p>
<p>I am absolutely no <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a36806930/elizabeth-holmes-fans-tikt-tok/">&#8220;holmie,&#8221;</a> but I do understand firsthand her need to role-play. I&#8217;ve been overlooked; hell, I&#8217;ve even been told to change my product line (bras) because venture capitalists won&#8217;t get it. And they didn&#8217;t. I gave in.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to defend her, and I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s so easy to drop a line at a party or a board meeting about how obnoxious she was in her venture, but what irks me is that we focus on her specifically as the problem, completely bypassing the environment that created her. I remember soaking up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood:_Secrets_and_Lies_in_a_Silicon_Valley_Startup">John Carreyrou&#8217;s tantalizing book</a> thinking, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;ll never do that,&#8221; as I started my company. But as I have seen the pressures and the biases, I can see how the system shaped Holmes.</p>
<p>Why don’t we judge the biased system we created as much as we judge the person it destroyed? She sticks out like a sore thumb because, well, how many Elizabeth Holmeses are there out there? These problems are so ingrained in the system itself, though, that as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI">David Foster Wallace alluded to in the water speech</a>, we can&#8217;t see them and we probably aren&#8217;t ready to repair them.</p>
<p>The next time someone jokes at a cocktail party about Holmes’ baritone voice, just remind them how dumb is it that we give more money to people with deep voices.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The former Lucid Motors will expand its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet and aims to ultimately produce 400,000 vehicles a year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group (formerly Lucid Motors) will be expanding its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet, CEO Pete Rawlinson said Monday just hours after the company officially went public with a $4.5 billion injection of capital.</p>
<p>The company also said it has 11,000 paid reservations for its flagship luxury electric sedan, the Lucid Air.</p>
<p>Part of the expansion will be used to accommodate the manufacturing of Project Gravity, the mysterious title given to the automaker’s forthcoming luxury electric SUV, a Lucid spokesman told TechCrunch. Not much is known about Gravity at this point, other than that it’s scheduled to be available from 2023 and that it will use the same battery platform as the Air. Patent drawings submitted to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, first noticed by a member of the <a href="https://www.lucid-forum.com/threads/lucid-gravity-suv-patent-images-reveal-production-design.142/">Lucid Forum</a>, reveal little more than the renderings on Lucid’s website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also planning on bringing more of the component production in-house, including major pieces such as the body panel stampings, the spokesman added. These parts were being handled by an external supplier.</p>
<p>The Casa Grande City Council approved the plans to expand the nearly 1 million-square-foot space in March. The first phase of the factory, which cost around $700 million to construct, went up in a record 12 months after breaking ground. Lucid has said that it wants to expand production capacity from around 30,000 vehicles per year to up to 400,000.</p>
<p>Lucid has had a long, sometimes tenuous road to the public market. The company first set its sights on bringing an electric sedan to production as early as 2018, but it quickly hit funding challenges that pushed this timeline further and further back. Lucid received major funding in 2018 with a $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which continued to be its largest shareholder throughout Lucid&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/"> merger</a> with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.</p>
<p>That merger hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">a bit of a hiccup</a> last week when the company failed to garner a sufficient number of votes on a key proposal &#8212; likely due to the rise of retail traders and malfunctioning spam filters, executives said in an investor call.</p>
<p>Lucid, which will now operate under the name Lucid Group, is listed under the ticker symbol LCID.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five weeks after Lordstown Motors issued a warning that it might not have enough funds to bring its electric pickup truck to market, a hedge fund managed by investment firm Yorkville Advisors has agreed to buy $400 million worth of shares over a three-year period, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021009220/ride-20210723x8k.htm">regulatory filing posted</a> Monday.</p>
<p>The tumult within Lordstown Motors, which has resulted in the resignation of its CEO and CTO, has put the company at risk of failing. This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle. If approved by shareholders, hedge fund YA II PN will be able to purchase 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares.</p>
<p>The capital provides a lifeline to Lordstown, which has struggled in recent months. The hedge fund, which is able to buy the shares at $7.48 a share, could also benefit financially if the stock price rises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of former CEO Steve Burns&#8217; other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors.</p>
<p>The Ohio automaker was founded in 2019, and within a year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">reached a deal to merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion. The company had planned to begin production of its Endurance pickup truck starting in the second half of 2021 at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Those plans faltered and a series of missteps and allegations of fraud compounded the company&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had taken a short position on Lordstown Motors. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company that has &#8220;no revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hindenburg disputed that the company booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller said that &#8220;extensive research reveals that the company&#8217;s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p>Lordstown execs dug themselves into a deeper hole by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/">attempting to calm investors</a> a day after its CEO and CTO resigned with statements that they had binding orders from customers that would fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/"> company retracted those statements</a> within days.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice and the SEC are separately<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/"> investigating the company</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The FBI argued that compelling Guy Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it 'would not run afoul of the defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ordered a man accused of participating in the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6 to unlock his laptop &#8220;with his face&#8221; after prosecutors argued that the laptop likely contains video footage that would incriminate him in the attempted insurrection.</p>
<p>Guy Reffitt was arrested in late January, three weeks after he participated in the riot, and has been in jail since. He has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including bringing a firearm to the Capitol grounds and a charge of obstructing justice. His Windows laptop was one of several devices seized by the FBI, which investigators said was protected with a password but could be unlocked using Reffitt&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said forensic evidence suggested that the laptop contained gigabytes of footage from Reffitt&#8217;s helmet-worn camera that he allegedly used to record some of the riot. Prosecutors asked the court if it could compel Reffitt to sit in front of the computer to unlock it.</p>
<p>Reffitt&#8217;s lawyer told the court that his client could &#8220;not remember&#8221; the password, but the court sided with the government and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21016668-us-vs-reffitt">granted the motion to compel</a> his biometrics. Reffitt&#8217;s lawyer told CNN, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/21/politics/capitol-rioter-unlock-laptop/index.html">first reported the court order</a>, that the laptop is now unlocked.</p>
<p>The government took advantage of a loophole in the Fifth Amendment, which grants anyone in the U.S. the right to remain silent, including the right to not turn over information that could implicate them in a crime, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/court-police-suspects-passwords/">such as a password</a>. But some courts have ruled that those protections don&#8217;t extend to a person&#8217;s physical attributes that can be used in place of a password, such as a face scan or fingerprint.</p>
<p>In Reffitt&#8217;s indictment, the FBI said as much, arguing that compelling Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it &#8220;would not run afoul of the defendant&#8217;s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courts across the U.S. are still divided on the reading of the Fifth Amendment and whether it applies to the compelled use of a person&#8217;s biometrics. The U.S. Supreme Court isn&#8217;t likely to address the issue any time soon, rejecting two petitions in as many years to rule on the matter, leaving it largely up to the states to decide.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-22-brain-scanning-helmet.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">helmets</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-penn-medicine-brain-tumor-ai-151105509.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">AI</a> that can spot brain tumors, but a new hard hat can actually treat them, too.</p>
<p>As part of the latest neurological <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/investigational-magnetic-device-shrinks-glioblastoma-in-first-in-world-human-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">breakthrough</a>, researchers used a helmet that generates a magnetic field to shrink a deadly tumor by a third. The 53-year-old patient who underwent the treatment ultimately died due to an unrelated injury, but an autopsy of his brain showed that the procedure had removed 31% of the tumor mass in a short time. The test marked the first noninvasive therapy for a deadly form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma.</p>
<p>The helmet features three rotating magnets connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery. As part of the therapy, the patient wore the device for five weeks at a clinic and then at home with the help of his wife. The resulting magnetic field therapy created by the helmet was administered for two hours initially and then ramped up to a maximum of six hours per day. During the period, the patient&#8217;s tumor mass and volume shrunk by nearly a third, with shrinkage appearing to correlate with the treatment dose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The inventors of the device — which received Food and Drug Administration approval for compassionate use treatment — claim it could one day help treat brain cancer without radiation or chemotherapy.</p>
<p>“Our results &#8230; open a new world of non-invasive and nontoxic therapy &#8230; with many exciting possibilities for the future,” said David S. Baskin, corresponding author and director of the Kenneth R. Peak Center for Brain and Pituitary Tumor Treatment in the Department of Neurosurgery at Houston Methodist Neurological Institute. Details of the procedure have been published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.708017/full?utm_source=F-NTF&amp;utm_medium=EMLX&amp;utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Frontiers in Oncology</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Things in China seem to be changing for the worse, in terms of both future access to foreign capital for Chinese companies and doing business in the country overall.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">spent a little time</a> on Friday ruminating on the impact of then-rumored regulation in China targeting its edtech sector. News that the Chinese government intended to crack down further on the education technology market hit shares of public, China-based edtech companies. It was a mess.</p>
<p>Then over the weekend, the rumors became reality, and the impact is still being felt today in the global markets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more. China is also bringing new regulatory pressure on food-delivery companies and Tencent Music. More precisely, we&#8217;ve seen successive market-dynamic-changing moves from the Chinese government in the last few days, coming as 2021 had already proved to be a turbulent environment for China-based technology companies.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Today we have to do a little bit of work to understand precisely what is going on with the various regulatory changes. Why? Because the Chinese venture capital market is a <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/q2-2021-chinese-inbound-investment-announced-ma-transactions-and-equity-investments/">key player in the global venture scene</a>. And Chinese startups have gone public on both Chinese, Hong Kong and U.S. exchanges; there&#8217;s a lot of capital tied up in companies impacted today &#8212; and possibly tomorrow.</p>
<p>For startups, the regulatory changes aren&#8217;t a death blow; indeed, many Chinese tech startups won&#8217;t be affected by what we&#8217;ve seen thus far. And upstart tech companies in sectors less likely to be targeted by central authorities may become more attractive to investors than they were before the regulatory onslaught kicked off. But on the whole, it feels like the risk profile of doing business in China has risen. That could curb the pace at which capital is invested, cut valuations and lower interest in the Chinese startup market from private-market investors able to invest globally.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>The edtech clampdown did not start last week. China&#8217;s edtech sector started to rack up penalties and fines in June, which led to what <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2021/06/chinas-next-big-regulatory-clampdown-edtech/">the Asia Times called</a> &#8220;warning bells&#8221; in the sector. From there, things went from penalties to punishing regulatory changes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The round comes about a year after Solarisbank's last round of $67.5 million, but as a sign of the times, what is perhaps more notable is that its valuation has nearly quintupled since then.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; the process by which some of the more complicated, but also commoditized, aspects of financial services are built and wrapped in an API for anyone else to implement in their own products for end users &#8212; has become a huge cornerstone of how fintech is built today. Now, one of the earlier and bigger movers in the space is announcing a major round of growth funding to build out its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solarisbank</a>, a Berlin startup that provides a range of financial services by way of some 180 APIs that others use to build end-user-facing products (including basic banking and card services, lending, payments, and know-your-customer services) has raised €190 million ($224 million) in a Series D that values the company at €1.4 billion ($1.65 billion) and announced the acquisition of one of its competitors in the space, <a href="https://www.contis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contis</a>.</p>
<p>Decisive Capital Management, a Swiss firm that has also backed insurtech startup Wefox, led the round, with Pathway Capital Management, CNP (Groupe Frère) and Ilavska Vuillermoz Capital also participating, in addition to and previous backers Yabeo Capital, BBVA, Vulcan Capital and HV Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round comes about a year after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/banking-platform-solarisbank-raises-67-5-million-at-360-million-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round of $67.5 million</a>, but as a sign of the times, what is perhaps more notable is that the company&#8217;s valuation has nearly quintupled since then (it was $360 million in June 2020).</p>
<p>This latest round is going to be used for expansion. CEO Roland Folz said in an interview that the Contis acquisition &#8212; which underscores a wider consolidation trend in fintech &#8212; will help it better cover all of Europe and start to make its first early moves into Asia. There are no plans right now to add the U.S. to that list, he said.</p>
<p>He added that the combined entity will be making revenues in the &#8220;triple-digit euros&#8221; &#8212; that is, hundreds of millions; it posted net revenues of €35 million in 2020 &#8212; and will be in a position to go public next year, if it chooses to.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&#8217;s hoping to double down on the huge shift we&#8217;re seeing in the world of financial services, where consumers and businesses are opting for newer and more modern banking experiences as they migrate away from slower, less flexible and sometimes more expensive incumbents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe is an ideal space for us to work in,&#8221; said Folz. &#8220;We believe that in Europe there are roughly 800 million bank accounts and some 400 million of those will change &#8216;ownership,&#8217; where traditional banks will be swapped out with non-traditional banks. &#8230; If we look at the five- to 10-year perspective, we want to make sure a significant proportion of those accounts will be on our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>SolarisBank counts Trade Republic, American Express, BP, Samsung and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/vivid-is-a-new-challenger-bank-built-on-top-of-solarisbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivid</a> among its customers, powering basic banking, know-your-customer checks, lending, digital wallet and other services related to finance for companies that can, in turn, focus their energies on building more user-friendly customer experiences or other services altogether. It&#8217;s been growing at a rate of 40%-60% annually, Folz added, and it has some 50 &#8220;partners&#8221; (as it calls its customers) in all, covering some 2 million customer accounts.</p>
<p>Contis, meanwhile, is a substantial business in its own right, with some 200 customers covering more than 2 million users and €9.9 billion in transactions annually.</p>
<p>Solarisbank was founded five years ago out of the Berlin-based startup incubator and investor <a href="https://finleap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finleap</a>, with Ramin Niroumand, a founder of finleap, essentially the &#8220;founder&#8221; of Solarisbank, too. (Currently and more formally, he is also chairman of its advisory board.)</p>
<p>Embedded finance is all the rage at the moment, and a number of startups today are providing fintech-as-a-service or banking-as-a-service tools to third parties. Other notable names in the same segment of the market include Railsbank, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/railsbank-raises-70m-to-build-out-its-fintech-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced funding</a> earlier this month;  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapyd</a>, which raised a big round at a $2.5 billion valuation earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unit</a>, another banking-as-a-service startup picking up funding and growing; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/fintechos-nabs-61-5m-for-a-low-code-approach-to-modernizing-legacy-banking-and-insurance-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, which really does what its name says (and is also currently raising money); and the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, which ironically is targeting incumbents.</p>
<p>Solarisbank believes its particular approach to this gap in the market gives it more flexibility and mileage: Unlike its rivals, the bulked-up Solarisbank will have banking licenses for Europe and e-money licenses in Lithuania and the U.K., with its tech stack living on AWS, giving it an opportunity to build more services, scale and keep better margins in the process &#8212; a critical detail in what is essentially an economy of scale play.</p>
<p>It also believes that its diverse customer base &#8212; covering not just obvious fintech companies like neobanks, but a variety of others, like Samsung, that are building financial services (in its case, a digital wallet) &#8212; gives it more staying power to cater to whatever segment of that base is growing most at any given time. As Niroumand points out, around 70% of its revenues come from some 30% of its customers. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a diverse clientele we are serving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is currently active in Germany, France, Italy and Spain but says it can cover the whole European Economic Area with passporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the combined entity, we are looking at numbers that no one else is even close to remotely,&#8221; added Folz.</p>
<p>The market opportunity, combined with Solarisbank&#8217;s approach and its current customer base, is what attracted investors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are experiencing a paradigm shift in banking, where customers expect financial services to adapt to their specific needs,” Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, a partner at Decisive Capital Management, said in a statement. “Technology is the key to enable this transformation and Solarisbank’s powerful banking-as-a-service platform positions it perfectly for this new banking era. We are both inspired by the team and thrilled to work together on its mission.”</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Do you live in a city with shared e-scooters and e-bikes that you never really ride even though you think it&#8217;s a cool concept? Maybe you think paying $10 to go 3 miles is ridiculous, or you don&#8217;t want to touch the sticky handlebars that someone may have previously coughed on. You&#8217;ve considered buying your own, but it ain&#8217;t cheap and you&#8217;re not ready for that kind of commitment &#8230; but wait! From the depths of this stream of consciousness, a new business model emerges: micromobility subscriptions.</p>
<p>The premise is that customers pay a somewhat affordable fee for a monthly rental of a higher-quality e-scooter or e-bike. It&#8217;s delivered to their door and assembled for them. If it breaks down, someone will ship them a new one. And customers can cancel anytime. It&#8217;s truly made for the 21st-century city dweller, adding nicely to their subscriptions of meal kits, vitamins, video streaming, music streaming, book reading, meditation apps, digital trainers and outfits.</p>
<p>Enough about the customer. Investors and companies are seeing the value in either building a business around the micromobility subscriptions model or adding it as another line to an existing business. They say it&#8217;s easy to scale, provides a good return on investment and costs less per mile to operate. And for those who actually care about sustainability, it allows the operator to control the vehicle&#8217;s end of life in a way that sales don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m harping on about this model is because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/why-startups-and-investors-are-turning-to-micromobility-subscriptions/">I wrote about it for ExtraCrunch</a> this week. It&#8217;s behind a paywall, but here are some highlights from the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shawn Carolan, managing director at Menlo Ventures, which invested in e-scooter subscription/sales company Unagi, is bullish on the micromobility subscription model. He says most people would rather pay a low monthly fee rather than a higher upfront fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best customers are repeat customers, commuters or local neighborhood trips,&#8221; Carolan said. &#8220;Repeatedly paying per ride is both expensive and cognitively taxing. People want low friction in transportation. Getting from here to there shouldn&#8217;t require a lot of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures bet that customers would also take better care of high-quality scooter they get to &#8220;own&#8221; for a time, which translates to a longer lifetime for hardware &#8212; something the dockless shared model consistently struggles with. Having an additional route to micromobility will broaden the market, positioning it as a SaaS business, which achieves a higher multiple.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for the subscription model? Startups looking to go this route need to work on providing the best possible service in order to retain customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The job to be done is reliability,&#8221; Oliver Bruce, angel investor and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast with Horace Dediu, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Maintenance and repairs is still a nascent sector, but for people who want to have a reliable option for travel and don&#8217;t know or care about how to maintain their brakes or gears, it&#8217;s a really good option. Proper servicing will open up micromobility to a far wider group, especially when paired to safe infrastructure and favorable transport policies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Ireland gets on the e-scooter bandwagon</b></h3>
<p>In other news, this week <strong>Ireland</strong> launched its first e-scooter trial across five campuses of Dublin City University. Berlin-based <strong>Tier</strong> will work with Irish and DCU-based<strong> Luna</strong> to equip e-scooters with computer vision tech that will be able to detect pavement lines and pedestrians. This is similar to what <strong>Drover</strong> is doing with <strong>Spin</strong>, which has just launched its visually updated scooters in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics and Smart DCU, a district of Smart Dublin, will also collaborate on the pilot research. E-scooters are still illegal to ride on Irish roads, but there is <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/e-scooter-laws-ireland-what-20671464">proposed legislation</a> in the works to change that.</p>
<h3>Superpedestrian&#8217;s scooters are not backing vision</h3>
<p>E-scooter company <strong>Superpedestrian</strong> acquired <strong>Navmatic</strong>, a startup that helps micromobility operators locate vehicles and correct their movements in real-time. With access to Navmatic&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">super fusion tech</a>, Superpedestrian has created an advanced safety system called Pedestrian Defense that can detect unsafe riding behaviors and stop them in real-time.</p>
<p>Navmatic&#8217;s technology basically allows the scooter to detect the rider&#8217;s micro-movements. Through those, plus other data picked up from sensors, it can determine things like if the scooter is going the wrong way on a one-way street or riding on the pavement.</p>
<h3>Bike stuff</h3>
<p>The Rad Power RadRover 6 Plus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">launched this week</a>, the latest model of the company&#8217;s flagship bike.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the e-bike for people who come to the world of biking from a car-centric background somewhat reluctantly, but get hooked to the smooth, sturdy ride, user-friendly design and really affordable price. This totally rad bike is only $1,999, and it&#8217;s built to last.</p>
<p>I talked to the bike manufacturer&#8217;s chief product officer, Redwood Stephens, and he explained how Rad Power&#8217;s business model is all about reducing friction for the customer, from the way you order your vehicle to the packaging it arrives in to the big obvious ON button. And this method appears to be going quite well for the company. In February it raised $150 million in funding, probably the most any e-bike company in America has ever raised.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> scored another $2.5 billion in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/rivian-raises-another-2-5b-pushing-its-ev-war-chest-up-to-10-5b/">private funding round of returning investors</a>. The round was led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in the round, according to Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised an eye-popping $10.5 billion to date. The company didn&#8217;t share a post-money valuation, but earlier this year when it had announced a $2.65 billion raise TechCrunch learned that its valuation was $27.6 billion.</p>
<p>As the money comes in, the pressure is increasing for the company to deliver its consumer and commercial products. Rivian recently delayed deliveries of its R1T truck and R1S SUV from this summer to September due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips. The company also confirmed it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">open a second U.S. factory</a>.</p>
<p>My other &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; involves a deal that almost wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m speaking of <strong>Lucid Motors of</strong> course, which had to extend the deadline to approve its merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. (They were able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">approve the merger on Friday</a>).</p>
<p>The hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger &#8212; proposal two, which would revise the company&#8217;s charter so that Lucid could receive key financing. That proposal requires a higher number of votes than the others &#8212; and it must be approved for the merger to take place &#8212; so a lack of votes ended up halting the entire process. The lack of shareholders was blamed on retail investors&#8217; unfamiliarity with the SPAC process and, unbelievably, spam filters gone awry.</p>
<p>The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ChargePoint</strong> acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">European charging software company <strong>has·to·be</strong></a> for €250 million ($295 million) in cash and stock, the electric vehicle charging network&#8217;s first acquisition since it became a publicly traded company. Through the deal, ChargePoint gains more than just 125 employees and the company&#8217;s operating software, which manages more than 40,000 networked ports in Europe. The acquisition will give ChargePoint a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America, as well as VW Group as a strategic partner.</p>
<p><strong>Magna International</strong>, the Canadian auto parts maker, is going to <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/magna-international-buy-veoneer-38b?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FEuropeNews+%28Automotive+News+Europe+News+Feed%29">acquire its rival Veoneer</a>, which had spun off from safety equipment supplier Autoliv in 2018, for about $3.8 billion in cash, Automotive News reported. (This also qualifies for my &#8220;deal of the week.&#8221;) The acquisition is going to give Magna a major boost, particularly in the area of driver assistance technologies business.</p>
<p>Magna will buy out Veoneer&#8217;s outstanding shares for $31.25 each, and the acquisition represents an enterprise value of $3.3 billion including debt, the companies said in a joint statement. Magna also said it will capture about $100 million in annual cost savings by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, a universal rewards platform and app that allows anyone with a smartphone to earn miles for all of their travel, raised $12.5 million in Series A funding round led by Scrum Ventures, with participation from TransLink Capital and Japan Airlines (JAL Innovation Fund), TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance (MS&amp;AD), Synapse Partners and several other prominent individual investors. The raise brings Miles&#8217; total funding to $20 million, with other notable investors including JetBlue Technology Ventures, Liil Ventures, Porsche Ventures, Panasonic, SAIC, Sony Innovation Fund, Urban Us (VC), and Gabe Klein (Co-founder CityFi).</p>
<p><strong>Rodo</strong>, an e-commerce startup focused on buying and selling vehicles, raised $18 million in a Series B financing round led by Holman Enterprises and Evolution VC Partners. The round also included existing investor IAC along with Kevin Hart&#8217;s HartBeat Ventures as well as auto industry veterans RML Automotive vice chairman Mack McLarty, McLarty Diversified Holdings Chairman and CEO Franklin McLarty, and Ken Schnitzer, the former chairman of Park Place Automotive Group. Rodo, which has raised a total of $45 million to date, plans to use the funds to scale its dealership network nationwide and invest in marketing and customer acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Sonatus</strong>, the California-grown automotive software company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/auto-software-company-sonatus-raises-35-million-from-hyundai-motor-group-saic-capital/"> raised $35 million in a Series A round</a> that attracted high-profile technology and automotive industry companies including Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s Kia Corporation, SAIC Capital and LG Electronics. Silicon Valley VC Translink Capital led the round, with other investors including Marvell Technology, UMC Capital and Wanxiang Group Company.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">secure nickel</a> from the commodity production giant BHP. The companies didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of mineral that will be supplied, just that it will come from BHP&#8217;s Nickel West division mines in Western Australia. The two companies also agreed to work together to increase battery supply chain sustainability and to identify ways to decrease carbon emissions from their respective operations using energy storage paired with renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>Uber Freight</strong>, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, acquired TransPlace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">for $2.25 billion</a> from private equity group TPG Capital. It&#8217;s one of those upstream-meets-downstream type of deals. The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p>
<p>This deal marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner!</p>
<p>EV rebates and tax credits are a well-known incentive mechanism to encourage Americans to make the switch to electric, but people looking for micromobility incentives have historically been out of luck. A new bill introduced in the Senate is looking to change that. The <strong>Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act</strong> would give consumers a refundable 30% tax credit on the purchase of an electric bicycle, up to $1,500.</p>
<p>Qualifying bikes must be under $8,000 and reach a max speed of no more than 28 miles per hour. So that means a huge swath of the market would be eligible for the credit. A <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1019/text?r=1&amp;s=1">sister bill</a> was introduced to the House earlier this year. If it passes in both parts of Congress, it would then head to President Joe Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/blogs/the-scenic-route/an-inside-look-at-the-ebike-act">interesting interview</a> with <strong>Rep. Earl Blumenauer</strong>, one of the legislators who introduced the bill in the House. (Just a note, it was conducted by The Scenic Route, a vertical of e-bike seller <strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>.) The congressman talks about how e-bike incentives could fit into the larger goals of the massive infrastructure bill currently being mulled by lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking to the Secretary of Transportation yesterday about the opportunities we have with this big infrastructure package and this is one of those elements that ties in with what we&#8217;re doing with the tax system,&#8221; Blumenauer said. &#8220;It reduces traffic congestion, there&#8217;s less pollution to contend with, and it eases the problem of parking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in Austin, where the hills have dissuaded me from cycling around &#8212; yet, the majority of my car trips are less than 4 miles. I&#8217;ve often thought that an electric bike would be a good way to use my car less. I&#8217;m sure many other Americans feel similarly.</p>

<p>As per usual, there is a lot to get to this week. When will the news cycle slow down?</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> and its backer and customer Ford had the big AV story of the week. The two companies announced plans to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles</a> on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. I get deep into the details in the story, but the tl;dr includes Lyft taking a 2.5% stake in Argo, which now has a valuation of $12.4 billion.</p>
<p>The first Ford self-driving vehicles, which are equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, will become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year. Austin will follow next year, with the remaining U.S. cities being added to the Lyft app in 2023 and beyond. Argo currently tests in Detroit, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Jody Kelman, who heads up Lyft&#8217;s Autonomous, the company&#8217;s self-driving deployment business unit, answers the why we should care question: &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest deployment certainly that we&#8217;re doing and that I think anyone else is doing. One thousand cars across six markets is a big leap forward in terms of scaled commercialization.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mobileye</strong> expanded its autonomous vehicle testing program <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/">to New York City</a> as part of its strategy to develop and deploy the technology. If you&#8217;re not watching Mobileye, you should be — even those who don&#8217;t agree with the company&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>New York City joins a number of other cities, including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo, where Mobileye has either launched testing or plans to this year. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> is expanding into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/waymo-to-open-offices-in-pittsburgh-an-av-tech-hub/">AV hub Pittsburgh</a>. The company will start by hiring around a dozen engineers, a source familiar with the move told TechCrunch, and they&#8217;ll co-locate in Google&#8217;s existing offices in the Bakery Square district. As of Thursday, only around three open positions for the Pittsburgh area were listed on Waymo&#8217;s website, but the company will be adding more roles soon.</p>
<p>Notably, some of the new team will come from Pittsburgh-based RobotWits, a tech startup focused on autonomous vehicle decision-making. Waymo acquired RobotWits&#8217; IP rights, and some members of its engineering and technical teams, as well as the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Maxim Likhachev, are joining Waymo.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, the commercial electric vehicle company, has been chosen to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">build electric buses</a> for the City of Anaheim, California. The Federal Transportation Administration awarded Anaheim a $2 million grant in 2019. The city&#8217;s transportation network announced the plan to partner with Arrival to achieve its goal of running California&#8217;s first all-electric bus fleet by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Battery joint ventures</strong> have become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">hot must-have deal</a> for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years. TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan digs into what is driving this trend and provides a roundup of the latest deals.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> said it will add a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/gm-confirms-a-third-electric-pickup-truck-is-in-development/">full-size electric pickup truck</a> to its GMC lineup, the latest in a string of EV product announcements by the automaker in the past year as it pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. GM didn&#8217;t provide much more, but we can expect it to follow the GMC Hummer EV pickup that is coming late this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla CEO Elon Musk</strong> said the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/elon-musk-tesla-to-open-up-global-charging-network-to-other-evs-later-this-year/">will allow other electric vehicles</a> to access its global network of chargers later this year. Musk has been chattering about this idea for years now; what made me take it a skosh more seriously is that he attached a timeline to this. My prediction is that Tesla owners will push back.</p>
<p>Speaking of Musk, the technoking said the automaker will &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-most-likely-accept-bitcoin-again-when-it-becomes-more-eco-friendly/">most likely&#8221; resume accepting bitcoin</a> as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables. He made the comments at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation. You might recall that Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that the company purchased a historic $1.5 billion in bitcoin &#8212; before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> laid out a €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">an electric-only automaker</a> by the end of the decade. To be clear, Mercedes did give itself some wiggle room in that ambitious goal, noting that it will be &#8220;ready to go all-electric by the end of the decade, where markets allow.&#8221; This could mean that some combustion-engine Mercedes, which are already equipped with 48-volt mild hybrid systems, will be produced and sold beyond the decade.</p>
<p>This target is driving Mercedes to become more vertically integrated, secure its supply chain and retrain its workforce. For instance, the automaker noted that it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">acquired U.K.-based electric motor company YASA and determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</span></p>
<h2>In-car tech and ADAS</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is rolling out three major upgrades, including automatic lane changes and towing support, to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">hands-free driver assistance system</a> Super Cruise. It will be available in six vehicles, including the 2022 all-new GMC Hummer EV pickup truck.</p>
<p>Speaking of Super Cruise, GM isn&#8217;t OK with <strong>Ford</strong> naming its own ADAS BlueCruise. GM and its self-driving vehicle subsidiary Cruise <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/564670-gm-files-trademark-lawsuit-against-ford">filed a lawsuit against Ford</a> claiming that the BlueCruise name is too similar to its Super Cruise trademark and Cruise&#8217;s trademark, The Hill reported.</p>
<h2>Ride-hailing, car-sharing and other stuff</h2>
<p><strong>Getaround</strong> was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/peer-to-peer-car-rental-startup-getaround-fined-nearly-1m-by-dcs-attorney-general/">fined nearly $1 million</a> by the Washington, D.C., Office of the Attorney General for operating without a license and other violations, part of a settlement of what the peer-to-peer car rental startup calls &#8220;politically motivated allegations.&#8221;</p>
<h2>People makin&#8217; moves</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> has hired Yanbing Li as its new senior VP of engineering, according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6820569879918325760/">posting on LinkedIn</a>. Yanbing comes from Google, where she led the enterprise services platform organization in Google Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> announced its board of directors and it contains some high-profile transportation folks, including Zoox CEO Aicha Evans, Dr. James Kuffner, CEO of Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings,·Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn Co-Founder and Co-Lead Director of Reinvent Technology Partners, Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado and Dipender Saluja the managing director of Capricorn Investment Group.</p>
<p>Of course, the board also includes Joby founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt, Founder and executive chairman Paul Sciarra.</p>
<p><strong>Velodyne Lidar</strong> lost its CEO, the latest in a series of issues and internal drama that have cropped up since the sensor company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp. CEO Anand Gopalan, who was previously CTO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">announced he is leaving</a> the lidar company at the end of July.</p>
<p>A team of top executives that includes COO Jim Barnhart, CFO Drew Hamer, Chief People Officer Kathy McBeath and Chief Commercial Officer Sinclair Vass will run the company as a search for a new chief executive is conducted. The company didn&#8217;t disclose why Gopalan was leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Xos</strong>, the electric truck company that is set to go public via SPAC merger later this summer, announced nominees for the board that will represent the combined company. Beyond Xos co-founders Dakota Semler and Giordano Sordoni, the list includes Burt Jordan, the former VP of global purchasing operation and supply chain sustainability at Ford; S. Sara Mathew, the former chair and CEO at Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation; George Mattson, who co-founded NextGen Acquisition Corporation; and Ed Rapp, the former group president for resource industries and former CFO at Caterpillar Inc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tick tock, early-stage startup fans: If you plan to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ebsavingsendthisweek&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ebsavingsendthisweekpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23), time is running out to score a pass to the world’s leading conference dedicated to tech startups — for less than $100. The early bird sale ends this week, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ebsavingsendthisweek&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ebsavingsendthisweekpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass here</a> before the deal expires on <strong>July 30 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>And if you’re part of the tech startup ecosystem — or aspire to be — why the heck wouldn’t you dive headlong into three days dedicated to the art and science required to build and scale successful startups? Just listen to what three past attendees said about their Disrupt experience.</p>
<p>Disrupt is a great sweet spot, and highly valuable, for anyone in the idea stage all the way through to having raised some angel money. Soak up the pitch deck teardowns and the VC presentations. They’re telling you what they&#8217;re looking for, what motivates them, what pushes them to contact you for a meeting. And that’s exactly what every startup raising capital needs to know. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“TechCrunch has created a great venue that brings together all the different people within the startup ecosystem. It’s a place where new startups can present, attendees can learn from top industry experts and who knows? One day they might be the person speaking on the Disrupt stage. It&#8217;s a great event overall.” — JC Bodson, founder and CEO of Arbitrage Technologies</p>
<p>“The connections I made at Disrupt offer long-term benefits. Investors willing to put forth capital, engineers offering tech expertise and manufacturers to help me streamline. Fostering these relationships will help me grow my company and my bottom line.” — Felicia Jackson, inventor and founder of CPRWrap.</p>
<p>Disrupt is the place to be to learn, connect, collaborate and keep tabs on rapidly changing trends. Here’s just one example of the timely topics and world-class experts we have on tap. Don’t forget to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">check out the agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Saving the World:</strong> COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and wellbeing, but it also shook industries and economies across the globe. The same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech Cofounder and CEO, Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world’s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Sahin will be joined by Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund to discuss what’s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> We’ll add new speakers, events and discounts in the run up to Disrupt — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#6141988e-b433-4082-ad44-e4b86a66c471">sign up for updates</a> so you don’t miss out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://queenly.com/">Queenly</a>, a resale marketplace for formalwear, announced on Friday that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">grown its seed round</a> to $6.3 million in a financing round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Connie Chan. The financing event brings Queenly’s total venture raised to date at $7.1 million.</p>
<p>Queenly sees itself as a “StockX” for formalwear, but has its own hold on the resale market for luxury goods. The startup gets consumers to list their used dresses &#8211; whether it be from weddings, proms, or pageants &#8211; on the platform to sell at a discounted price to others. Sellers then make about 80% of the listed price when a dress is sold, while buyers get a unique dress that wouldn&#8217;t have been worn gain anyways.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JIsZsZIGRs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">The StockX EC-1</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The StockX EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/embed/#?secret=JIsZsZIGRs" data-secret="JIsZsZIGRs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement, A16z’s Chan said that she experienced “firsthand how unique but underserved the formalwear market is by technology.” The investor noted how fit is less important because people often rely on alterations, but uniqueness matters. She also credited the experience that the Queenly co-founders Trisha Bantigue and Kathy Zhou both have at pageants, which has made its way into the end-product.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the co-founders have put much of their energy into an algorithm designed to help buyers find the best dress for them, with search capabilities that are meant to be more inclusive of size and skin color than competitors like retail stores and Poshmark.</p>
<p>“These are just some things that we know because we’re women, and we know how to build this product for women,” Zhou said in a previous interview. “As opposed to if this was a male founder, they would not know that that would even be something that women would search for.”</p>
<p>The resale marketplace comes with its own challenges, the biggest of which can often be quality assurance. For dresses priced at $300 or less, Queenly gets proof photos of condition and then allows sellers ship directly to buyers. Dresses above $300 are routed through the company’s own operation, where a qualiy assurance team more closely checks for the condition of the dress.</p>
<p>Queenly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">graduated from Y Combinator in Winter 2021</a>, in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the lack of in-person events, the co-founders said that they had half a million in sales, thanks to Zoom weddings, Twitch pageants and socially-distant graduations. Queenly also got small fancy dress businesses, looking for a digital solution to get ubuyers, to list their inventory on the site.</p>
<p>The growth helped the startup raise while still in the accelerator, landing $800,000 from investors including Mike Smith, former COO of Stitch Fix, Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber, and Kelly Thompson, former COO of Samsclub.com and Walmart.com. The company then closed the first bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">its seed round at $2.3 million, </a>bringing on Dragon Capital along with other investors.</p>
<p>Now, three months later, Queenly has extended that seed round by a few million. The company declined to disclose its new valuation or sales volume, but did say that number of dresses on Queenly’s platform have grown from 50,000 in February to 60,000 now, in July. Queenly also landed a partnership, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/07/23/queenly-tackles-a-formalwear-industry-ripe-for-disruption/?sh=371688be3c5d">per Forbes,</a> with the Miss USA organization, which will help grow its footprint through contestants uploading their dresses to the platform. Of course, dresses aren&#8217;t synonymous with sales &#8211; but with millions more, the startup could be equipped to turn that reach into real dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Blue Origin, is offering to knock up to $2 billion off the cost of developing a lunar lander and to self-fund a pathfinder mission in exchange for a NASA contract.</p>
<p>The specific contract in question relates to developing a lunar lander for the Human Landing System program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo days. NASA announced in April 2020 that Blue Origin, SpaceX and Dynetics were chosen for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">the initial phase of the contract</a>, and it was thought that the competition would likely be whittled down to two final companies to build lunar landers. As TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">Darrell Etherington notes</a>, it’s not uncommon for NASA to select two vendors, as it did when it awarded both Boeing and SpaceX contracts under its Commercial Crew program.</p>
<p>But a year later, in a move that veered from historical practice, NASA announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">it had selected just one company</a> for the contract: SpaceX. That company, headed by Elon Musk, proposed a $2.89 billion plan for its lander – around half of Blue Origin’s $5.99 billion proposal. Bezos is now offering to cut that price tag by $2 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a document obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/">The Washington Post</a> explaining the rationale behind selecting a sole vendor for the HLS contract, NASA admits that it’s “current fiscal year budget did not support even a single [contract] award.” In response, SpaceX updated its payment schedule so it would fit “within NASA’s current budget.” That the agency has severe budgetary constraints is no secret: Congress approved just $850 million for the HLS program in fiscal year 2021, far short of the $3.4 billion NASA requested.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX wins NASA contract to develop human landing system for returning to the moon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/embed/#?secret=PDTOoJsNGS" data-secret="PDTOoJsNGS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Enter <a href="https://blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson">Bezos’ open letter</a> to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, which addresses the budget issue directly. He writes that the proposed incentives would remedy “perceived near-term budgetary issues” with the Human Landing System Program, which caused NASA to select a single company instead of two.</p>
<p>“Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the Agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX,” Bezos says in the letter. “That decision broke the mold of NASA’s successful commercial space programs by putting an end to meaningful competition for years to come.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Blue Origin has publicly questioned NASA’s decision to go with just one vendor. The company, along with Dynetics, filed protests with the Government Accountability Office just one week after the award was announced. Blue Origin argued that the contract requirements did not give companies an ability to “meaningfully compete.” GAO must rule on the protest by August 4.</p>
<p>Blue Origin and Dynetics are not the only entities to support two contract awards. The Senate recently passed a bill that would, among other things, require NASA to select two companies for the HLS lander – and the extra funds to do so, <a href="https://spacenews.com/senate-passes-nasa-authorization-act-2/">SpaceNews reported</a>. Not every lawmaker was happy about the inclusion of the extra funding, however: Senator Bernie Sanders called it a &#8220;Bezos bailout,&#8221; but was ultimately unsuccessful in getting the extra funding stripped from the bill.</p>
<p>“We stand ready to help NASA moderate its technical risks and solve its budgetary constraints and put the Artemis Program back on a more competitive, credible, and sustainable path,” Bezos said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com/">Box</a> released its new native e-signature product Box Sign on Monday, providing e-signature capability and unlimited signatures as part of Box’s business and enterprise plans at no additional cost.</p>
<p>The launch comes five months after the Redwood City, California-based company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">agreed to acquire</a> e-signature startup <a href="http://signrequest.com/">SignRequest</a> for $55 million.</p>
<p>Box CEO Aaron Levie told TechCrunch the company is already securing content management for 100,000 businesses, and Box Sign represents “a breakthrough product for the company” — a new category in which Box can help customers with business processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are building out a content cloud that powers the lifecycle of content so customers can retain and manage it,” Levie said. “Everyday, there are more transactions around onboarding a customer, closing a deal or an audit, but these are still done manually. We are moving that to digital and enabling the request of signatures around the content.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Users can send documents for e-signature directly from Box to anyone, even those without a Box account. Places for signature requests and approvals can be created anywhere on the document. All of this integrates across popular apps like Salesforce and includes email reminders and deadline notifications. As with Box’s offerings, the signatures are also secure and compliant.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/digital-signature-market?utm_source=PRN&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=PRN_PAID">global e-signature software market</a> was estimated to be around $1.8 billion in 2020, according to Prescient &amp; Strategic Intelligence, while <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US46257920">IDC expects it to grow to $3.8 billion</a> by 2023.</p>
<p>Levie considers the market still early as less than one-third of organizations use e-signature due to legacy tool limitations and cost barriers, revealing massive future opportunities. However, that may be changing: Box worked with banks during the pandemic that were still relying on mailing, scanning and faxing documents to help them adapt to digital processes. It also surveyed its customers last year around product capabilities, and the No. 1 “ask” was e-signature, he said.</p>
<p>He mentioned major players DocuSign and Adobe Sign — two products it will continue to integrate with — among the array of technology within the space. He said that Box is not trying to compete with any player, but saw a need from customers and wanted to proceed with an option for them.</p>
<p>The e-signature offering also follows the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005237/en/Box-Announces-Appointment-of-Diego-Dugatkin-as-Chief-Product-Officer">hiring of Diego Dugatkin</a> in June as Box’s new chief product officer. Prior to joining, Dugatkin was vice president of product management for Adobe Document Cloud and led strategy and execution for Adobe’s suite of products, including Adobe Sign.</p>
<p>“Our strategy has been for many years to expand our portfolio and power more advanced use cases, as well as a vision to have one platform to manage everything,” Levie said. “Diego has two decades of tremendous domain experience, and he will make a massive dent in powering this for us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the e-signature product, Box also introduced its Enterprise Plus plan that includes all of the company’s major add-ons, as well as advanced e-signature capabilities that will be available later this summer, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aditi Shekar&#8217;s path to entrepreneurship was a very intentional one, and while it wasn&#8217;t quite a childhood dream, it was the real-world version of the goals she did have as a kid. Fast forward to today, and Aditi&#8217;s company Zeta is on a rocket ship ride in fintech, having recently jumped from being a money management and virtual adviser app for couples, to an actual financial solutions provider built from the ground up with shared financial management in mind.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of Found, TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook and I sit down with Aditi to talk about where she gets her endless drive and determination, to why she loves financial management (I&#8217;m trying to get her zeal to wear off on me, tbh). We also get into why Zeta makes so much sense in the context of a field of legacy financial solutions that generally don&#8217;t acknowledge that the way we manage and think about money, especially as it relates to the dynamics between multiple people, has changed significantly over the course of the past several decades.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kut4flfo6R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">What should banking look like for modern couples?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Aditi definitely isn&#8217;t afraid to get real about what&#8217;s required to be an entrepreneur and dedicate yourself to a vision you really believe in. And as usual, Jordan and I end up feeling deeply inadequate and ashamed about our life choices — but in a fun way.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Aditi, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode.
