					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Welcome to the weekend! We made it. Barely, I think, given how tired everyone sounds on the phone and over on Twitter. But we beat the working days back all the same, which means we get to lean back and enjoy ourselves for a minute. Yes, we’re talking crypto today. Rejoice!</p>
<p><strong>The race to fund crypto’s future sure is expensive </strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258166" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’m impressed with the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures/recent_investments">pace at which Coinbase has invested capital</a> into other companies in the larger blockchain market. It’s a smart move, as the public U.S. company can disburse comparatively small sums (when stacked next to its revenue base) and buy both ownership and information access in startups, providing it with early-warning data regarding what’s popping. Given that Coinbase is an obvious incumbent – and gatekeeper, to some degree – in the crypto market, its investments make sense.</p>
<p>But there’s investing, and there’s <em>investing</em>. And it appears that the newly announced FTX fund is something more aggressive than what Coinbase has managed, despite its pretty quick cadence of deals.</p>
<p>FTX’s fund crypto will total some $2 billion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402?mod=djemalertNEWS">and, per interviews</a>, could be disbursed <em>just this year</em>. That’s a wild pace of investment, perhaps one reminiscent of <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-investor-katie-haun-leave-andreessen-horowitz-e11aa2f2-6ad9-4b27-abb4-b44e461174ec.html">how quickly a16z put its recent $2.2 billion crypto fund to work</a>.</p>
<p>A few questions:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ol>
<li>Why does the crypto market need this much money when its user base is pretty small compared to the larger Internet?</li>
<li>Why are we using so much fiat to finance crypto?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are interlinked questions. They sum to a simple confusion of mine regarding why it’s so hard to build things in the crypto market that are useful. Coinbase and FTX exist toward the edges of the crypto world, shuttling money back and forth from the traditional economy and what could be its future. That they are investing is smart, but the amount of money they are willing to invest, along with what traditional venture capitalists are also lobbing at blockchain startups, has me somewhat confused – what’s it all being spent on?</p>
<p>The two major blockchains are established, and hardly new (Ethereum was thought up in 2013 and launched in 2015; the Bitcoin whitepaper came out in <em>2008</em>); stablecoins exist and have a number of well, stable players; and a bunch of capital has gone to NFT marketplaces and a few crypto games. Some of which have even built modest player bases. But it feels a bit concentrated when we compare the amount of money flowing into the space to what we can see in terms of usable outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1w6r1v3pjg15s/Where-Did-VC-Money-Go-in-2021-Crypto-Startups">Institutional Investor reports</a> that $32.8 billion in total was invested into “crypto and blockchain technology businesses” last year. Perhaps a lot of stuff built by that money is coming out soon that will blow us away, but now well north of a decade after Bitcoin said, “Hello, world,” I still don’t use any blockchain-powered apps or services day to day. Unless I am tinkering with one part of the crypto world for research purposes, of course.</p>
<p>And I spend more time online than I want to admit! Perhaps the new FTX fund will bring the mass-market blockchain product to market that isn’t merely another vehicle for speculation. Let’s wait and see, I suppose.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">“Raising money is catastrophically challenging for female founders, and even harder for Black female founders.”</p>
<p>It’s a bold, even damning statement — one I made in a recent discussion speculating what’s to come in 2022 for women leading startups, like myself.</p>
<p>As one of a few Black female CEOs in the developer tools space, I’m often asked to comment on big, collective social issues centered in tech. It’s a lot to carry, but I realize the value to all of us in raising these issues, and my voice, when I can. Still, while I’d like to be able to offer decisive answers, I’ve got a lot of questions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Tech innovation &lt; social progress</h2>
<p>In the world of technology, we thirst to be a part of the next digital product that benefits from first-mover status and shapes what’s to come at an industry level. This is especially relevant in regard to seeking capital. And while we’ve witnessed some impressive transformations in the developer tools space, with VC-backed funding following suit, sometimes I worry we’re at risk of conflating technological growth for the social progress we really need. Women are still behind. Why?</p>
<p>There are some great female developer founders, like Nora Jones of Jeli, Window Snyder of Thistle Technologies, Edith Harbaugh of Launch Darkly, and Jean Yang of Akita Software, to name a few. There are also some amazing female angels and VCs. These are women I look to as leaders in the industry — those overcoming the barriers of either giving or seeking funding while remaining authentic to who they are.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Limited partners should back more female VCs, and funds should offer women the same graces and latitude that are given to men.							<cite>Shanea Leven</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Despite those of us trying to make a name for ourselves in dev tools, the reality is the dev tools space is led predominately by white men. For those of us who don’t meet those gender and racial criteria, simply thriving requires more attention to detail, energy and time than is often sustainable.</p>
<p>We need to level-set, acknowledging the current ways in which women must fight to thrive. We need to ask some tough questions.</p>
<h2>The fight to be taken seriously</h2>
<p>We want to be able to fundraise from other people that look like us, right? But many female investors are fighting just as hard to be taken seriously as the female founders they want to support. If we’re all facing the same social constraint — fighting to prove our legitimacy — we’re probably maintaining the same aversion to risk.</p>
<p>This creates an invalidating cycle in which female investors take fewer risks, particularly in regard to investing in female founders, and garner fewer funds than their male counterparts. How can we break this cycle?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Limited partners should back more female VCs, and funds should offer women the same graces and latitude that are given to men. Female VCs should be promoted to partnerships, where they will be able to write meaningful checks quickly.</p>
<p>I’ve personally witnessed the extraordinary results of empowered female angels and VCs connecting with others to support female founders; the community and sense of sisterhood they inspire have the potential to change the industry. This is what we need to latch on to and scale.</p>
<h2>The fight to overcome ingrained psychological barriers</h2>
<p>Today, there exists a widespread belief that women are less aggressive in the process of confirming a round, both as founders and VCs. As a female founder, I’ve been told male counterparts are capable of committing larger funds, faster — that women appear to be more risk-averse, often moving slower through the process and requesting less.</p>
<p>So, what’s causing the pause among women? It’s likely the most obvious answer: We are, in fact, facing a greater risk of rejection in the funding process. We also tend to have fewer connections into the VC community, where the “rules of VC” — what to do, say, and how to act — are often confusing and counterintuitive. Nothing like the clear guidelines on writing a good piece of code.</p>
<h2>The fight against the numbers</h2>
<p>Imagine you have 1,000 potential investors and only 10% of them focus on companies offering technologies like yours. Then, just 2% of them invest in companies at your stage and 5% of those share your same philosophies — and you’re only able to access yet another percentage of those. Now, imagine you’re stepping into those discussions with the understanding that we are ultimately people pitching to people, so you must “click” in an often all-too-brief interaction.</p>
<p>You’ll be committed in business to this investor for the next decade or more. So, while you’re attempting to navigate the numbers — the odds against you — you’re also trying to figure out a VC&#8217;s history, personality and perspectives. How have they been burned before? Can we be empathic to their businesses of the past and assure them our business is a worthy investment … all in 30 minutes or less?</p>
<h2>So, how can women successfully fight for funding?</h2>
<p>The simple answer: We cannot do it alone. Like most professional endeavors, seeking funding is ideally bolstered by a social network. While I wish I could say women intrinsically have everything they need to excel in the world of venture capital, I believe we require allies and support beyond basic networking and spanning gender and race.</p>
<p>We need everyone who has a stake in the game to join the fight for women, with focused attention on the challenges encountered by women of color. We must acknowledge the potential danger to female founders and investors in working from a survival mindset and provide them the coaching and guidance they need to step into funding discussions practiced, prepared and able to speak on behalf of a company with greater strength.</p>
<p>Said simply, we need to trust in the ability and potential of women on both ends of the deal, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>And so, my final question to founders and investors everywhere: Are you willing to join our fight?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 14, 2022! I suppose that this has been the week of Wordle, in that everyone and their dog are tweeting their scores and results. A small bit of camaraderie for those of you out there who are not good at the game: I am also trash. And since I still get paid to write, I refuse to connect “Good at Wordle” with “Good at words!” – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. Speaking of words, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/the-friends-with-benefits-of-the-financial-world/">the Equity team had a heck of a good time this week</a>, in case you wanted a chatty dive through recent startup happenings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/online-checkout-bolt-decacorn/">Bolt raises $355M as the online checkout war continues</a>: Bolt (not <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bolt-raises-709m-at-an-8-4b-valuation-to-expand-its-transportation-and-food-delivery-super-app/">this Bolt</a></em>) has raised a huge new round of capital that pushes its valuation to $11 billion. Bolt provides an online checkout solution for other companies. It competes, variously, with Fast and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation/">Checkout.com, which just raised $1 billion at a $40 billion valuation</a>. You can argue that there is separation between the players in terms of where they sit in the world of online payments and checkout, but the overlap appears increasingly material between the competitors. (Just about one year ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/">we called the online check market a war</a>; the battle continues.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/jan-6-tech-subpoenas-insurrection/">Major tech companies subpoenaed by Congress</a>: As an investigation into the January 6 insurrection continues here in the U.S., major tech companies are being caught up in the hunt for answers. YouTube (Alphabet), Facebook and Instagram (Meta), Reddit, and Twitter appear to be in the line of fire.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/nft-volume-daos-and-the-curious-case-of-looksrare/">All that glitters is not legit trading volume</a>: As the market for non-fungible tokens – digital signatures on the blockchain that often point to assets stored on the traditional web, like images – heats up, we’re tracking the various exchanges where trading takes place. What we’ve most recently learned is that not all trading volume may be what it first appears.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/daasity-investing-15m-in-data-so-consumer-brands-can-do-more-with-it/">Daasity raises $15M to help companies leverage e-comm data</a>: Daasity is a startup that helps customers aggregate their information from various e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc.), “analyze it and push it to marketing channels to optimize customer experiences based on insights from a historical performance,” TechCrunch writes. The company’s new funding round was a Series A, led by VMG Catalyst.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/evage-raises-28m-to-be-a-driving-force-in-indias-commercial-ev-revolution/">Commercial EVs for the Indian market</a>: Amazon is working with a number of companies on EVs for its global delivery network, one of which is EVage. The Indian company just raised $28 million for an electric truck-van-box that I must admit is rather fetching – provided you are the sort of person who enjoys brutalist architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/vangst-ropes-in-19-million-more-to-place-employees-with-work-in-the-growing-cannabis-industry/">The cannabis labor market is growing startups</a>: TechCrunch notes in this story that there are labor platforms being built to help particular industries hire. The healthcare market has a few, for example. And now the cannabis industry as well, thanks to Vangst, which just raised a $19 million Series B.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation is often decried as a hurdle to innovation in most parts of the developing world.</p>
<p>But in Brazil, the Central Bank is being hailed by investors and fintech founders alike as a tailwind for bringing banking to the masses.</p>
<p>“The open banking initiatives adopted by Brazil’s Central Bank are absolutely tailwinds for fintech innovation,” Costanoa Ventures’ Amy Cheetham told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an in-depth market analysis, Anna Heim explores Brazilian fintech’s growth in the wake of Brazil’s open banking initiatives and how insurtech is also poised to take advantage.</p>

<p>Today we have a grip of transit-themed Big Tech news, followed by, what else, some European legal news involving a major U.S. tech company!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/2021-robotaxi-china/">Self-driving taxis work to merge onto the fast lane in China</a>: Our own Rita Liao did everyone a favor by writing up a deep dive into the self-driving taxi market in China.

What do the individual news events add up to? Find out!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/j-b-hunt-will-be-waymos-first-self-driving-freight-customer/">And speaking of self-driving cars</a>: Waymo and J.B.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based industrial robotics firm Sesto this week announced a $5.7 million raise, featuring TRIVE, WTI GmbH and SEEDS Capital (Enterprise Singapore’s VC wing). The round follows a similarly sized $4 million Series A, back in 2018.</p>
<p>Sesto has had a busy few years since that round &#8212; as have many in the industrial robotics category, as more companies have looked toward automation during the pandemic. In May 2020, the firm launched HealthGUARD, a disinfecting robot that was ahead of the curve of UV-C systems we’ve seen over the past few years.</p>
<p>That August, the company added Magnus to its lineup of AMRs (autonomous mobile robots). That system operates similarly to a number of autonomous warehouse robots, and looks a fair bit like the systems developed by (the now-Amazon-owned) Kiva. Their modular design means that various accessories can be mounted on top of the robots for additional functionality, a plus for companies looking to swiftly deploy an army of autonomous assistance. That includes things like Sesto Prime, a 7-axis robot arm designed specifically for semiconductor production &#8212; a category of manufacturing no doubt eagerly looking to expand into automation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Last May, Sesto expanded operations to Europe &#8212; specifically Austria, Germany and Switzerland. That no doubt explains investment interest this round from EU-based firms. Citing research from GMD, CEO Chor-Chen Ang notes of the round, “We are excited to tap into the growth of Autonomous Mobile Robots in Europe which is projected to expand at a CAGR of 11.8% over the next 4 years from US $4.40B currently.”</p>
<p>Funding will go toward expanding these sorts of international partnerships, market, as well as building out the company’s product offerings and the versatility of its existing robots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following news that the FTC&#8217;s antitrust suit against Meta<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_75-1_ftc_v_facebook_public_redacted_fac.pdf"> cleared a critical hurdle</a> earlier this week, the agency is apparently also taking a sharp interest in the company&#8217;s VR business.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/meta-s-oculus-unit-faces-ftc-led-probe-of-competition-practices?srnd=technology-vp">reports</a> that the FTC and multiple state attorneys general are probing Meta&#8217;s virtual reality division for &#8220;potential anti-competitive practices.&#8221; New York reportedly leads the state-level investigation, which has been chatting up outside software developers who make apps for Meta&#8217;s VR experience.</p>
<p>The state and federal officials are examining how the company may have engaged in anti-competitive behavior to suppress competition in the VR market. The officials were also interested in how the company subsidizes the price of its Quest 2 VR headset to push it on consumers and box out the competition, according to Bloomberg.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The fact that the FTC is digging around about Meta&#8217;s app store, hardware and software practices suggests that the company&#8217;s acquisitions aren&#8217;t its only angle in what could be a landmark antitrust case that defines the next era of internet businesses.</p>
<p>In December, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal?utm_source=ti_app">The Information</a> reported that the FTC was looking into Meta&#8217;s proposed acquisition of Supernatural, a VR fitness app, in a deal worth more than $400 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a judge ruled that the FTC&#8217;s major antitrust case against Facebook (owned by parent company Meta) could continue, throwing out the company&#8217;s effort to block it. In December, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-asks-court-dismiss-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit-with-prejudice-2021-12-01/">Facebook asked the court to dismiss the suit</a> and pushed for FTC Chair Lina Khan, a proponent of breaking up big tech, to recuse herself.</p>
<p>In that suit, the FTC accuses Facebook of abusing its market power to quell rivals in the social media space and goes as far as asking a judge to make parent company Meta divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The facts alleged this time around to fortify those theories, however, are far more robust and detailed than before, particularly in regard to the contours of Defendant’s alleged monopoly,&#8221; U.S. District <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_75-1_ftc_v_facebook_public_redacted_fac.pdf">Judge James Boasberg wrote.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Although the agency may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations, the Court believes that it has now cleared the pleading bar and may proceed to discovery.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whatever you do, don't refer to LG's incubator program LG Nova as a corporate venture capital (CVC) outfit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t refer to LG&#8217;s incubator program LG Nova as a corporate venture capital (CVC) outfit.</p>
<p>LG Nova is the pointiest tip of the spear for LG, the company&#8217;s experimental playground to work with startups to explore spaces where the corporation has spotted areas ripe for future growth. Backed by a relatively large &#8212; and rapidly growing &#8212; team and a healthy budget, LG Nova is rolling up its proverbial sleeves and exploring versions of the future.</p>
<p>Below is my interview with Sokwoo Rhee, LG&#8217;s corporate SVP and head of the North America Innovation Center &#8212; LG Nova among friends. The interview is edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we a CVC? The answer is no. Hell no,&#8221; Rhee said. &#8220;CVC, as you know, is a venture capital play. Their ultimate goal is to have a high return. Because of that, they invest in companies with the potential to grow the market value. We are not that; we invest, and while we care about the growth of the companies, we look at much more about how the business we can create together will grow. But if there&#8217;s potential to grow the business with us, and if that company has something that we need to grow our business as well, then we&#8217;re going to invest and work with them. We will do a proof of concept (POC), putting our resources behind the company. And a financial investment is just one part of that. We are much more interested in creating joint businesses and joint ventures. For some companies, we may even make outright acquisitions. CVC is very much a financial play; we are more a business creation play.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			“You’re probably tired of hearing about the metaverse every day,” laughs Rhee, eliciting an honest nod from your correspondent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;LG Electronics is one of the largest manufacturers of appliances and so on. We&#8217;re doing very well, and we also want to look at the future, specifically at areas that we believe are ripe for future growth, areas where LG aren&#8217;t necessarily operating today. LG Nova is for areas where LG wants to grow, but we aren&#8217;t yet. Last year, we established this center to find out what those things are and grow new businesses in the new future growth areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team came up with five different areas of focus, explicitly targeting aspects of the market where LG can leverage its platform and ecosystem strengths while extending its innovation reach. The areas are digital health, the metaverse, EV infrastructure and &#8220;smart lifestyle.&#8221; The latter is an extension of smart homes, home automation and living smarter through the power of tech. In addition, LG Nova highlights an overarching mandate to look at representation across all the categories it serves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look for things like helping under-served communities and products and services that can make an impact in communities to improve quality of life,&#8221; Rhee explained. &#8220;Corporate innovation has happened before, but a lot of them started internally. You take a lot of R&amp;D centers and innovation initiatives, and you spend a lot of time internally in the lab to create something new, innovating within existing structures. We are looking at a very different perspective &#8212; we are doing what we call outside-in innovation. LG Nova doesn&#8217;t have R&amp;D capability, and that is done intentionally. We have some engineers, but we won&#8217;t be building entirely new innovations internally. Instead, we want to encourage outside entities &#8212; startups and so on &#8212; to propose the ideas and work with LG Electronics in this new future growth area. We want to figure out how we can create new businesses together.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I say new businesses, that can mean a lot of different things. We are willing to create a new business unit if the idea, suggestions and partnership hit a home run.</p>
<p>So far, that sounds like any other corporate incubator. Still, the devil is in the details, and LG Nova is bringing a lot of exciting twists to the corporate accelerator mix. Implementing how it works with its startups is far broader than the &#8220;write a check and hope for the best&#8221; and &#8220;here&#8217;s some customers, good luck&#8221; approach that many of the other corporates are taking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258179" style="width: 1377px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258179" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2258179 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg" alt="" width="1367" height="773" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg 1367w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mission-Launch-2021-6-e1642197109968.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1367px) 100vw, 1367px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2258179" class="wp-caption-text">On stage announcing LG Nova&#8217;s launch &#8212; Sokwoo Rhee, LG&#8217;s corporate SVP and head of LG Nova. (Image: LG Nova)</p></div></p>
<h2>The process and the benefits</h2>
<p>LG Nova has started finding its feet, starting off with a funneling process it&#8217;s calling the Grand Challenge program. It started with a competition launched back in September, which it calls the &#8220;Mission for the Future,&#8221; which was met with a lot of interest from startups; LG&#8217;s team tells me it received over 1,300 proposals from more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>LG Nova differs from many other incubators because it isn&#8217;t taking the corporate venture capital approach of investing, nor is it looking for technology proposals. Instead, the incubator is looking for submissions for how startups want to bring their products to market by leveraging the reach and impact of LG Electronics.</p>
<p>From the 1,300 proposals, they make a shortlist of 50 or so companies. At this point, each of the companies is assigned an entrepreneur in residence (EIR) who will work with the startups to flesh out the ideas and put together a proposal, figuring out what the potential synergies are with LG&#8217;s larger-picture strategy and the strengths and opportunities brought by the startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Korean technology giant <a href="https://www.lg.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG</a> makes everything from televisions (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/lg-oled-tv-at-ces/">they announced some new ones at CES</a>), washing machines and fridges, to, well, <a href="https://www.testthepeople.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;ll probably take less time to list the things they don&#8217;t get involved in</a>. It shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that the company has a robust interest in innovation, then, and <a href="http://www.lgnova.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG Nova</a> is its relatively new North American Innovation Center. Based out of Santa Clara in Silicon Valley, California, the LG business unit is finding new and interesting ways to work with startups to further LGs mission in some of its core growth areas.</p>
<p>At the consumer electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas, the company announced the first companies that have made it onto its shortlist for working with the electronics giant. The startups have a few traits in common, highlighting and reinforcing some of the focus areas for the company&#8217;s innovation areas.</p>
<p>LG Nova is aiming to be the center of the Venn diagram of the entire startup ecosystem, including the startups, of course. It wants to unite this with LG&#8217;s own strengths and advantages, including the wider investor landscape, big tech, academia, the entrepreneur community and LG&#8217;s own sales and marketing channels, where appropriate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The current program LG Nova is running is the Mission for the Future challenge, which is essentially a filtration system to find the most promising entrepreneurs and startups who can work with LG&#8217;s entrepreneurs in residence to help create businesses within the LG ecosystem. Mission for the Future<span data-contrast="auto"> is LG Nova’s nine-month annual challenge program created to seek the best ideas, concepts and businesses worldwide that will improve quality of life in a smarter, healthier, more-connected future. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p>The first big theme for LG in this space is <strong>connected health</strong>, with a particular focus on doubling down on healthcare focused on healthcare to meet people&#8217;s wellness needs at healthcare facilities, in their homes or through services in that space. LG Nova announced its first two shortlisted companies as <a href="https://www.xr.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XR Health</a>, which offers VR treatment rooms for telehealth services, and <a href="https://www.mayamd.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maya MD</a>, which is a digital AI health assistant that leverages LG&#8217;s televisions to encourage customers into active conversations about their health.</p>
<p>The <strong>metaverse</strong> is the second broad category where LG Nova is paying particular attention, in what appears to be a more broad exploration of how people and machines can connect in new interaction modalities. Here, LG Nova announced <a href="https://iq3connect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iQ3</a>, which creates enterprise applications and services for product training for the metaverse, and <a href="https://i3m.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I3M</a>, which is building a hyper-realistic virtual travel and tourism experience.</p>
<p>Sustainable mobility is the third pillar in LG&#8217;s innovation push, in what the company terms <strong>Energizing Mobility</strong>. <a href="https://driivz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SparkCharge</a> is an interesting company that is making EV charging mobile, while maintaining sustainability. <a href="https://driivz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Driivz</a>, meanwhile, is building an operating system of sorts for electric vehicle charging management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final part of LG Nova&#8217;s innovation pie chart is all about <strong>Smart Lifestyles</strong>, which appears to be LG-speak for smart home technology. In this universe, they chose a universal smart-key technology, <a href="https://everykey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EveryKey</a>, which is an effort to use a single device to unlock your car, phone and doors, and keeps your website logins safe, while <a href="https://www.akin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.kin AI</a> is a company working to add virtual assistant technology to LG&#8217;s hardware products. It&#8217;s particularly aimed at homes that have home-care coordination challenges for neuro-diverse audiences. <a href="https://chefling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chefling</a> rounds out the smart lifestyle cabal, with a solution for planning, shopping for and cooking meals that follow your dietary requirements.</p>
<p>The announced startups give you a glimpse behind the curtain for the type of thing LG Nova is looking for. <a href="https://www.lgnova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The next batch opens for applications later this year</a>, and at CES, <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3rhdLNC">I spoke in-depth with the boss of the program to learn more about what LG is looking for, how the program is aiming to work with startups and to get the inside track on how to catch the eye of the incubator&#8217;s selection committee</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (formerly Extra Crunch Live) is coming back this February, and we have a fantastic lineup to start the new season. Changes are coming to the show, too. In 2022 look for more pitch decks, more pitch-offs and more of the best founder/investor combos.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s season ended on a high note. We had Pilot&#8217;s founder explain how it convinced Index Ventures to think long-term about margins. Before that, Aileen Lee and Rachel Carlson presented Guild Education&#8217;s early pitch deck. They&#8217;re available here, but we hope you can join us live in 2022. We&#8217;re always looking for good questions from the audience to ask guests, and soon startups will be able to apply to pitch their company.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live helps founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, precisely, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision and their step-by-step plan to get there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this — complete with looking at these companies&#8217; early pitch decks and more — on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3 pm ET and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven&#8217;t yet, sign up now!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in February.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kanyi Maqubela (Kindred Ventures) + Dr. Jeff Wessler (Heartbeat Health)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>February 9 &#8211; 12pm PT / 3pm ET</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Jeff Wessler co-founded Heartbeat Health in 2016 to develop better heart care. After writing the company&#8217;s pre-seed check, Kenyi Maqubela joined Heartbeat Health&#8217;s founding team and board of directors in 2017. Maqubela&#8217;s firm, Kindred Ventures, reinvested in Heartbeat Health over the next two rounds. Hear on TCL how Wessler pitched Maqubela about his ambitious plan and eventually secured funding.</p>

Starting on January 19th, you&#8217;ll be able to visit <a href="https://www.covidtests.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">COVIDTests.gov</a> and request tests, which will be mailed to your home.</p>
<p>For now, the website only has a landing page in English and Spanish. It notes that the shipping costs will be covered too.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is buying one billion at-home, rapid tests to give to US residents for free. The hope is to make sure everyone has a test on hand when they need it. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">The White House</a> said 500 million of those tests will be available on January 19th. At the outset, you&#8217;ll be able to order four per residential address.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258156" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A phone line is being set up so those who can&#8217;t access the website can place an order. The administration says it&#8217;s working with national and local organizations to help people in at-risk and hard-hit communities to secure tests.</p>
<p>One important thing to note: the tests will usually ship within 7-12 days of ordering. That timeline won&#8217;t be incredibly useful for people who show symptoms of COVID-19 or have a close contact with a positive case and don&#8217;t have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-19-at-home-rapid-serial-testing-074232925.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">at-home test</a> handy.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s worth stocking up on these free tests, especially given how in-demand they are. Even Twitter accounts known for helping people secure new gaming consoles are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/07/wario64-covid-home-tests-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">providing stock alerts</a> for COVID-19 tests these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has raised the prices of its subscription services once again in the U.S. and Canada. All new subscribers will see the new prices starting today, and existing customers will receive an email notice 30 days before the increase enters effect.</p>
<p>The hikes were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-netflix-raises-monthly-subscription-prices-us-canada-2022-01-14/">first reported by Reuters</a>, which Netflix told: &#8220;We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">The new prices are as follows</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258135" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Basic (1 stream, 480p): $8.99 → $9.99</li>
<li>Standard (2 streams, 1080p): $13.99 → $15.49</li>
<li>Premium (4 streams, 4K): $17.99 → $19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada the new prices are $16.49 for Standard and $20.99 for Premium, with Basic unchanged at $9.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/netflix-is-raising-prices-on-most-of-its-plans-in-the-us/">The last increase was in 2020</a> (standard went from $13 to $14) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/netflix-price-hike/">before that 2019</a> (from $11 to $13). One imagines they waited until January just so no one can say they raised the price three years in a row.</p>
<p>The pandemic has seen something of a historic increase in demand for TV and movies, and while Hollywood is still trying to sort out its strategy, Netflix has confidently doubled down on a winning formula and slipped its customers the bill.</p>
<p>While nobody likes to lose another buck a month, the value proposition is hard to deny with the platform&#8217;s seemingly endless selection of increasingly international productions. The breakout hit &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; is just one example of a show that probably wouldn&#8217;t have been made (indeed the creator shopped it unsuccessfully for years) without Netflix&#8217;s deep pockets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Expect an email soon detailing the changes — you&#8217;ll have a chance to change or cancel, but who among us has the strength to do so? Just use the increase as justification for watching 10% more shows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We'll be off on Monday, January 17 in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startup founders have just a few ways to recruit and retain employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a competitive salary</li>
<li>Create a role that harnesses their interests/talent</li>
<li>Give them a stake in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, equity will not leave employees with substantial wealth. But even the most embittered worker will think twice about walking away from a job before they&#8217;re fully vested.</p>
<p>In a TC+ guest post, Kirsten Prost, vice president at VC/PE firm Tercera, lays out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/a-startup-founders-guide-to-allocating-equity-grants/">detailed steps for designing your equity program</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258076" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>Her guide includes brackets and multipliers for contributors at different levels, along with fictional examples founders can use for modeling, and tips that will help employees understand the value of their stake.</p>
<p>Speaking as a veteran of many early-stage startups: entrepreneurs love to be seen talking about fostering an ownership mentality, but if that&#8217;s going to be more than happy talk, you&#8217;ll first need a transparent equity program.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be off on Monday, January 17 to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading, and have an excellent weekend!</p>

<p><strong>In between spending time with our daughter and sightseeing, we’d like to explore the feasibility of expanding our business in the United States.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do we need to get a special visa to do that?</strong></p>

<p>There’s a growing rift between the public and private markets’ valuation of tech startups, and Justworks’ decision to delay its IPO may well be a bellwether of what’s to come, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Software companies are getting hammered on the public markets, while the private markets continue to retain their enthusiasm for tech startups.</p>
<p>This difference in opinion, writes Alex, could turn out poorly for richly valued startups that want to exit this year.</p>
<p>“Justworks’ IPO delay indicates that the enthusiasm gap between private markets and their public analog is wide. And for pricey unicorns still bleeding cash, that’s terrible news.”</p>

<p>Game distribution platform Steam banned blockchain-based games in October 2021: Any titles that incorporate NFTs or cryptocurrency were summarily booted from the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, within Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online game, new players are paying hundreds of dollars to acquire mythical pets and love potions.</p>
<p>Blockchain gaming is making inroads with some consumers, but given the lack of regulatory guidance and the speculative nature of many crypto holdings, what do investors think?</p>
<p>To find out, we surveyed seven who are active in the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anton Backman, principal, and Kenrick Drijkoningen, general partner, Play Ventures</li>
<li>Banafsheh Fathieh, head of investments, Americas, Prosus Ventures</li>
<li>Josh Chapman, managing partner, Konvoy Ventures</li>
<li>Eddie Thai, general partner, 500 Startups and general partner, Ascend Vietnam Ventures</li>

<p>It’s one thing to get a prospective customer to visit your site, but convincing them to reach for their wallet or share their phone number is a stretch.</p>
<p>As consumers gain greater control over their privacy, Aleksandra Korczynska, CMO of GetResponse, says marketers who align lead generation with the goals of their prospective customers will gain a significant advantage.</p>
<p>“The key is building a foot-in-the-door technique for continuous engagement — lead magnets,” she says.</p>

<p>Special purpose acquisition companies took 2020 and 2021 by storm, enabling a large cohort of companies to go public.</p>
<p>But, as they say: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>Disappointment isn&#8217;t limited to a single industry, writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange. Property tech, fintech, media, and personal mobility companies have all seen big drop-offs since their debut.</p>

<p>Paying users to play is part of blockchain gaming&#8217;s unique selling proposition, but is that the purpose of entertainment?</p>
<p>Senior Editor Alex Wilhelm says he enjoys the fun and excitement associated with playing against others online, but &#8220;I am bearish on crypto games as they currently exist for a few reasons, even if the incentives are more aligned than they appear in traditional gaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halsey Minor is best known as a co-founder of CNET and an early Salesforce.com investor, but for the last several years, he&#8217;s been working in crypto.</p>
<p>After three decades developing content, he&#8217;s now leading Vivid Labs, which operates a proprietary NFT publishing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like I recognized the massive explosion of the internet many years ago, I see crypto and NFTs as the technology of the future,&#8221; said Minor in a TC+ interview that includes advice for founders hoping to raise capital for web3 projects.</p>

<p>Next week, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm plan to file a series of stories for The Exchange examining sectors and trends in different regions. To build a foundation for that reporting, this week, they looked back at a record-setting year for venture capital.</p>
<p>In 2021, VC investment totaled $621 billion, an increase of 111% from the year before, according to CB Insights. Crunchbase pegs the figure at $643 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of which number we choose, it’s clear that well north of half a trillion dollars was invested into high-growth private companies last year – a rough doubling of what the same asset class managed in 2020.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a country where many people are still unbanked, and queuing to pay bills is part of daily life, the impact of being able to pay anyone instantly can't be understated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian instant payment system Pix ended 2021 having powered more than 8 billion transactions, according to <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pixstatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics</a> from the country&#8217;s Central Bank. This is quite an impressive figure for an offering only launched in November 2020 and goes to show how ubiquitous Pix has become in the country.</p>
<p>You could describe Pix as &#8220;a government-built version of Venmo,&#8221; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/kaszek-leads-z1s-latest-round-as-it-develops-its-bank-app-aimed-at-latam-teens/">João Pedro Thompson, founder of fintech Z1,</a> told TechCrunch. However, the analogy doesn&#8217;t fully capture the fact that Pix appeals to many more than just digitally savvy teenagers repaying friends for coffee. Otherwise, it wouldn&#8217;t be used by <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/11/6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-ja-usaram-o-pix-pelo-menos-uma-vez.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six of 10 Brazilians</a>.</p>
<p>In a country where many people are still unbanked and queuing to pay bills is part of daily life, the impact of being able to pay anyone instantly can&#8217;t be understated. In addition, Pix now supports more services, such as letting you <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazils-pix-new-features-saque-and-troco-are-avaliable-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdraw cash from businesses</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that Pix is an institutional initiative, part of a wider range of public efforts to transform Brazil&#8217;s financial landscape. &#8220;The Central Bank has been doing a tremendous job and Pix is one of the most relevant structural changes,&#8221; Brazilian VC <a href="https://twitter.com/brunoyoshimura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruno Yoshimura</a> told TechCrunch when we wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">Latin America&#8217;s fintech boom</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived in Brazil, so this naturally piqued my interest. At the time, entrepreneurs were constantly complaining about bureaucracy, and their highest hope was that institutions would just stay out of the way. But now, VCs and founders are actually praising the Central Bank for its initiatives and the opportunities it has created.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both Open Banking and Pix will level the playfield for new challenges, and we expect to see a lot of innovation around them,&#8221; Yoshimura said, referring to another of the Central Bank&#8217;s projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Pix, and it&#8217;s not only the Central Bank&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/about/bcbhashtag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BC# agenda</a> either. Brazil&#8217;s Superintendence of Private Insurance (Susep) is working on <a href="https://openinsurance.susep.gov.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open insurance plans</a>, which means that insurtech could be the next sector to benefit from regulatory tailwinds.</p>
<p>To understand what&#8217;s going on with regulations in Brazil, and how this is affecting startups, I reached out to experts with firsthand knowledge of Latin America&#8217;s fintech ecosystem.</p>
<p>On the VC side, I got in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a>, a partner at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/things-are-heating-up-for-costanoa-ventures-closes-two-over-subscribed-funds/">Costanoa Ventures</a>, whose recent investments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/plug-raises-2-7m-to-make-payment-acceptance-in-brazil-less-terrible/">include Rio de Janeiro-based Plug</a>; and <a href="https://mundiventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma Mundi Ventures</a>&#8216; <a href="https://twitter.com/javiersantiso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Santiso </a>for additional thoughts on insurtech. On the startup side, I spoke with CEOs <a href="https://twitter.com/rodrigoteijeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rodrigo Teijeiro</a> from <a href="https://recargapay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecargaPay</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrosonegodeoliveira/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pedro Sônego de Oliveira</a> from <a href="https://truepay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TruePay</a>.</p>
<h2>Opportunities abound</h2>
<p>&#8220;The open banking initiatives adopted by Brazil&#8217;s Central Bank are absolutely tailwinds for fintech innovation,&#8221; Costanoa&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a> said. &#8220;As consumers regain control of their data, it creates space for new entrants to the banking ecosystem and creates more competition, giving consumers access to better, cheaper, fairer, and more secure financial products and services. This includes giving fintechs the power to build for previously [underserved] or unserved segments of the population,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://recargapay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecargaPay</a> is one of the startups leveraging the new regulations to expand their B2C services. &#8220;Our mission at RecargaPay,&#8221; founder Teijeiro said, &#8220;is to democratize mobile payments and financial services in Brazil, so open banking and Pix are the perfect recipe to accelerate our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teijeiro is particularly appreciative of Pix and its &#8220;incredible&#8221; trajectory. &#8220;What was accomplished in just one year was a tremendous disruption benefiting millions of Brazilians by making their payments easier, faster and cheaper. For this, the Brazilian Central Bank deserves to be recognized as the &#8216;fintech startup of the year,'&#8221; he said, describing Pix&#8217;s impact on cash going mobile as &#8220;a huge blessing for RecargaPay.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its technology enables legal professionals and companies to create profiles and be matched to available work, monitor projects and pay through the platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Similar to other industries embracing contract work, <a href="https://www.lawtrades.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawtrades</a> is giving legal professionals a way to become independent and run their own virtual law practices.</p>
<p>Raad Ahmed and Ashish Walia started the company in 2016 with an initial focus on startups and small businesses, trying to find product-market fit (as one does), but finding that legal usage among companies of that size was often project-based, infrequent and short-term if the company folds.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company pivoted to working with mid-market and enterprise-level companies by selling into legal departments, and that’s when growth took off, Ahmed told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Lawtrades works with companies, like Doordash, Gusto and Pinterest, to offer them a marketplace of professionals that can be hired remotely and with flexibility. Its technology enables professionals and companies to create profiles and be matched to opportunities, monitor projects and pay through the platform.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, it is a new internet-native work model that we are starting with legal because it is a $100 billion market that has not been disrupted much in the last 100 years,” Ahmed said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257732" style="width: 3210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257732" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png" alt="Lawtrades" width="3200" height="2400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3200px) 100vw, 3200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257732" class="wp-caption-text">Lawtrades app design. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lawtrades</p></div></p>
<p>He and Walia wanted to build a different hiring experience from the likes of LinkedIn, where companies would have to weed through hundreds of applicants to find the qualified few. Professionals are also able to provide a flat pricing structure, unlike law firms which have overhead and other firm costs that are typically factored into billable hours.</p>
<p>Following the doubling of revenue in 2021, it closed on a $6 million Series A round, led by Four Cities Capital, with participation from Draper Associates and 500 Startups. The round also included nearly 100 customers, angel investors and company founders, including Gumroad founder Sahil Lavingia, Teachable’s Ankur Nagpal and GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani.</p>
<p>“Due to the world finally embracing remote legal work and more lawyers leaving big law firms to work for themselves, we’re cash flow positive and leveraging revenue-based financing, so we didn’t have to do a big dilutive equity raise,” Ahmed said.</p>

<p>At the end of 2021, Lawtrades had 80 customers on the platform and 150 active engagements. On the talent side, there are over 1,000 profiles, up from 400 made by the end of 2020. Currently, it is running on an invite-only model, and 5% are accepted into the network. The makeup of the network is 60% women and over 35% are minorities.</p>
<p>In December, the company’s revenue run rate was $8 million, up from $3 million at the beginning of 2021, Ahmed added. More than $11 million was earned on the platform to date by the network and over 60,000 hours of work was logged on the platform in 2021, a 200% boost from 2020.</p>
<p>Ahmed plans to use the new funding to rebrand the company, launch an iOS app, expand into other professional categories, like finance and management consulting, and gain an international footprint. He also intends to double Lawtrades’ current headcount from 15 to 30 across product, support and sales.</p>
<p>“The world of work is in a unique position,” he added. “People are working remotely and companies are looking for talent, so it is an all-out talent war with the best people getting the best offers. With our model, the power is in the individual to pick the kind of work they want to do. That’s how we are able to attract amazing talent and then be able to get companies that want to hire them. We are iterating on and pushing the boundaries of the 40-hour work week.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Meta’s stated mission is to seamlessly connect disparate environments like work, social media and gaming so it can allow people to effectively live and work in the virtual space.</p>
<p>This will clearly have a significant and sustained impact on our networks. We aren’t just talking about a need to be constantly connected, without glitches; we’re talking about fully immersive content streaming seamlessly, in 4K and 8K, with low latency and minimal lag.</p>
<p>We will need to be able to go from one experience to another without being distracted by reboots, operating system or application loading times, network congestion, or anything else that suggests we’re not in a seamless virtual environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Accomplishing all of this makes virtual life seem as challenging as moving to Mars.</p>
<p>Yet, it is possible to make the journey to our new virtual world friction-less. We just need to make sure we are putting in place the basic building blocks needed for virtual life.</p>
<p>Starting today, we have the opportunity to make the metaverse habitable and hospitable, a place where our virtual selves can thrive, not just survive.</p>
<h2>Bandwidth is key</h2>
<p>We’ll need a lot of bandwidth to make this work at scale. Much like water is a building block of life, there is no way we could function in a metaverse without bandwidth. We need high-performance connectivity capable of supporting the different demands of bandwidth-hungry applications in the metaverse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That bandwidth must be widespread and affordable, too, to better support our underserved and under-connected communities. Visions of a virtual world often center on equal opportunities for everyone to create and explore. For that to happen inside the metaverse, we need to ensure a level playing field of connectivity in the real world first.</p>
<h2>Low latency is as critical as air</h2>
<p>Bandwidth is one thing, but if it takes the avatar we’re engaging with several seconds to respond – or worse – then meta life is suddenly annoying and inhospitable. We already find it frustrating to have lag when streaming live sports or gaming online, and this will only be exacerbated when we are trying to fully immerse ourselves into a virtual world.</p>
<p>Technology such as edge computing – which can reduce network latency and improve reliability – will become increasingly important in networks that require real-time responsiveness.</p>
<h2>Virtual hardware: The infrastructure of the metaverse</h2>
<p>We’ve all been there: Hardware breaks, and we need to fix it. In that time, we need to be able to survive without whatever function that piece of hardware operated. But this can’t happen in a metaverse – or at least it shouldn’t, because we should have utilized virtualized functions for much of what the metaverse requires.</p>
<p>Deploying infrastructure functions using virtual machine and container concepts where they, like apps, can be deployed across the network at scale and in real time will be key. Classic network functions such as routing and switching will need to be fully virtualized. They need to be easily updated, upgraded, patched and deployed.</p>
<h2>Software intelligence: The mayor of the metaverse</h2>
<p>We need the metaverse to be software-defined to enable it to act quickly and seamlessly. It’s the equivalent of a local government or council being able to repair our roads, remove the trash and control traffic flows in real time. This generally happens today in real life without us knowing, until it stops working and we wonder what happened.</p>
<p>Automation and AI, powered by programmable software capabilities, hold the key to helping speed the delivery of network rollouts, making them more accessible and adaptive.</p>
<p>An adaptive virtual programmable network will be able to identify a fault and self-heal, without the need for a physical truck-roll. It can draw resources – compute, storage, bandwidth – from underutilized areas to ramp up other parts of the metaverse seeing increased activity, and revert automatically when required.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, we will hear a lot of talk about the metaverse, but any innovation in use cases will not happen without the required network innovations. An adaptive network that provides software-controlled, high-capacity, low-latency connectivity will be even more important of a foundation for the future metaverse than it is for today’s cloud apps.</p>
<p>The building blocks are already there for the artist formerly known as Facebook to build a hospitable metaverse, and as those technologies continue to evolve – driven by an expected uptick in innovation among tech developers looking to capitalize on the metaverse emergence – Meta will have more world-building tools to work with.</p>
<p>Simply put, it’s not easy to build a virtual universe, but it’s certainly something that we can bring closer to reality through proper network infrastructure investments and innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like you, I check NFT marketplace volume a few times each day to keep tabs on the burgeoning market for buying and selling digital signatures on various blockchains that point to images and the like. We&#8217;re very cool.</p>
<p>Mostly, the data is steady. OpenSea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/">volumes tend to lead the space</a>, with other, smaller NFT exchanges and some crypto games filling in the list. You can take a look at DappRadar&#8217;s NFT marketplace data set <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, a related list of numbers from NonFungible <a href="https://nonfungible.com/market/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and some great charted data from The Block <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/marketplaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, if you want to dive in on your own.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But recently the data changed, and an NFT marketplace called <a href="https://looksrare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LooksRare</a> shot up on the charts, quickly surpassing OpenSea&#8217;s results and taking the top slot among its competitors in volume terms.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Is OpenSea in trouble? Did LooksRare suddenly surge to the top of the charts thanks to a better model, price list or other business effort? Kinda, but it appears that there&#8217;s a lot of bullshit going down to make the numbers look better than they are. So let&#8217;s talk about incentives and governance tokens to parse out what&#8217;s up with LooksRare and the larger future of the financialization of everything.</p>
<h2>Incentives</h2>
<p>The data is pretty funny. In the last 24 hours, LooksRare has seen just under $290 million worth of NFT trades, per DappRadar data. OpenSea&#8217;s 24-hour tally is a more modest $131.6 million. Given how far ahead of OpenSea that single data point puts LooksRare, have we seen a new marketplace king crowned? No.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Friday episode, a run-down of key news headlines, startup funding rounds and whatever else is popping in the worlds of startups and tech. Happily this week, we did not talk about NFTs, and I don’t think that we even said “token” a single time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, Mary Ann and Natasha and Alex got back to what we might consider the roots of Equity. Here’s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">We started with a look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/fertilis-ivf-cell-culture-funding/">at the recent Fertilis round</a>. Fertilis is an Australian startup working to make the IVF process more reliable. We are big fans of the concept, though the startup has lots of work ahead of it before it moves the needle for couples hoping to conceive.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mary Ann brought together two very Equity topics: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2257147">Fintech and SaaS</a>, but more interestingly, fintech that only wants to serve SaaS startups. Even though we tried to define Arc’s relationship with the startups it serves, Alex landed on it being a friends with benefits for the financial world.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Speaking of fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/">Brex made headlines</a> (again) with its new raise and new executive &#8212; thanks to Meta.</li>
<li aria-level="1">We keep returning to the hiring conversation, and that’s for good reason. Career Karma (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/">news here</a>) and SeekOut (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/tiger-doubles-down-on-seekout-which-just-raised-115m-to-help-enterprises-hire-and-retain-talent/">news here</a>) have two different strategies when it comes to empowering employees at companies &#8212; and all of us agreed that retention, versus placement, is the future of hiring tech.</li>
<li aria-level="1">We ended with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/">conversation on accelerators</a> thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">Y Combinator’s news</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/has-y-combinators-new-deal-changed-the-early-stage-investing-game/">venture reaction thereof</a>. Plus, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/">new AngelList</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/dorm-room-fund-returns-to-campus-with-new-10-4-million-fund/">Dorm Room Fund</a> remind us that staying niche in strategy continues to be the way that early-stage venture operations are winning deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>A big hug to you all for surviving the start to the working year during a COVID surge. We can do this! We’ll get through it as a big team, OK?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bentley Motors stands bestride the old world and the modern era. For over a century, the automaker has been at the forefront of automotive luxury and performance, and while it has constantly adapted to change during the years, classic, tactile coachbuilding has always remained as its ethos.</p>
<p>This romantic view of automotive manufacturing seems almost at odds with our current level of technological advancement and the demands of the modern luxury consumer.</p>
<p>If Bentley has mastered anything, it&#8217;s rolling with the times while sticking to the classic hits. The best example of this is the 2022 Bentley Continental GT Speed, a powerful two-door grand tourer that&#8217;s simply unlike any other car on the road today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257900" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2257976" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257976" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2257976 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg" alt="bentley-continental gt speed" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bentley-alex-side.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2257976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>The Bentley Continental GT is the two-door sibling to the four-door Bentley Continental Flying Spur sedan. Though they share many elements, the GT is much more than a halved version of the larger car, and distinguishes itself in design and performance, among other factors.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the GT is a 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 engine, a massive power unit that is a unique outlier in this era of shrinking (or indeed vanishing) engines. This signature system produces 650 horsepower for the Speed, a 24 hp bump from the standard Conti GT W12. It doles out an impressive 664 pound-feet of torque and is sent through a dual-clutch eight-speed automatic gearbox.</p>
<p>Power is sent through all four wheels while an enhanced chassis system puts it all to use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our chassis engineers have an incredible array of technology at their disposal, to give the car genuine duality in ride and handling, and controlled by the driver using Drive Dynamics Control,&#8221; Mike Sayer, head of Product Communications for Bentley Motors Ltd. told TechCrunch. &#8220;To enable the chassis to be varied, we utilize three-chamber air springs, which allow three distinct spring stiffnesses. In Sport mode, a single chamber in each air spring is utilized, providing a high spring stiffness. In Comfort, solenoid valves bring all three chambers into play, at a low pressure, providing a softer spring. To this we then add Bentley Dynamic Ride &#8212; our 48V electric anti-roll control.&#8221;</p>
<p>This iteration of the Speed brings some new tech to the GT for the first time, specifically an electronic rear differential and rear-wheel steering.</p>
<p>For the E-diff, this distributes torque across the rear angle to give it balance and control during turn-in when driving in a sporty manner. Rear-wheel steering was first applied to the Flying Spur to give the full-sized luxury four-door a tighter turning radius as well as enhanced stability at speed. On the GT Speed, it&#8217;s meant to give the two-door sharper turning and is far more active on this car than on the sedan.</p>
<p>All told, the more than 5,000-pound GT can sail at up to 208 mph, rocketing off the line to hit 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds, something cars without a cruise ship&#8217;s worth of luxury accouterments struggle to achieve.</p>
<h2>Bentley sprinkles in tech</h2>

<p>Within the Continental GT Speed is a carefully crafted interior that has been a signature element of Bentley vehicles.</p>
<p>A substantial sum of the car&#8217;s assembly is by hand, and while there are some automated tasks, there are very few elements that don&#8217;t receive attention from a master craftsperson. The interior is replete with premium leather and real wood surfaces that range from burr walnut to rare, naturally felled redwood.</p>
<p>Seat elements and the steering wheel are all hand-stitched, and the hefty metal switches are scored with diamond-pattern knurling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knurling that&#8217;s used on the main rotary controls took 18 months to develop, and involved the creation of an algorithm to accurately describe the way the facets of the knurling are angled,&#8221; added Sayer, highlighting the degree of focus given to every detail. This ornate, meticulously built interior is the setting for a high degree of modern technology, and yet it&#8217;s all very well integrated.</p>

<p>A 12.3-inch touchscreen can be found in the center of the dashboard, as a modern luxury car buyer would expect, and it performs the usual functions. It&#8217;s the source for navigation and entertainment, as well as the interface for several vehicle functions. Drivers can customize their preferred throttle and steering settings, raise the suspension for a few inches of extra clearance and access the full driver&#8217;s manual if need be.</p>
<p>This is paired with an all-digital gauge cluster that can also be customized to mirror much of the same information displayed on the touchscreen. There&#8217;s even a heat-based night vision option that highlights the area in front of the car for enhanced night driving. This system also has integrated pedestrian recognition, so any persons encountered in the night are highlighted by a red box.</p>
<p>The high-resolution screens feature graphics styled to mitigate their juxtaposition against all of the tangible craftsmanship.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design of the graphics of those gauges was subject to the same attention to detail as physical components,&#8221; said Sayer. &#8220;Beyond that, our ethos includes retaining physical, haptic buttons and rotary controls in lieu of multiple touchscreens.&#8221;</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s still too much tech to tolerate, the screen tumbles away into the panel and is replaced with three analog gauges; a clock, compass and air temp monitor. A touch of in-car gadgetry theater? Perhaps, but another way of looking at it is future-proofing the interior of a vehicle in a way. Aesthetically speaking, the rest of the cabin will age far better than the display will, and having a method to tuck it out of sight fits the accommodating nature of this luxury grand tourer.</p>
<h2>The UX</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2257983" style="width: 5194px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257983" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2257983 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg" alt="bentley continental gt speed" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6642.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2257983" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>Seated at the wheel of the GT Speed can be a little dazzling at first due to the glitzy chrome and polished veneer, but it&#8217;s quick to demonstrate how driver focused it is from the moment of ignition.</p>
<p>Assists such as a head-up display and traffic sign recognition are on hand to improve situational awareness, and on long journeys, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control relieve some of the burden. Convenient, though the GT Speed is most rewarding when fully engaged.</p>
<p>The W12 engine is blustery and sonorous when its note rumbles out the back of the exhaust. Stepping on the throttle feels and sounds like accelerating in the single-engined fighter planes that the GT Speed shares a lineage with. That&#8217;s as far as the similarities go because everything else beyond is far from antiquated. Power delivery is smooth yet forceful, and there&#8217;s quite a ways to go before experiencing any drop-off, though reaching that point requires a length of unrestricted highway.</p>
<p>In that regard, the GT Speed mirrors the Flying Spur in that it feels heavy and grounded like a steam locomotive, and when it&#8217;s time to take a sharp corner, this leads to a great degree of hesitation. Muster up some trust and bravery, though, and the GT Speed is surprisingly dynamic.</p>
<p>The car is at its best in those moments when a windy back road presents itself. Its size and weight are still palpable, but the active tech in play allow the Bentley to round corners with confidence. The enjoyment diminishes when things get increasingly challenging, however, and all the physics-warping engineering can&#8217;t disguise the car&#8217;s heft. It&#8217;s in those moments where you make a mental note to return with something smaller and more spry.</p>
<p>Regardless if it&#8217;s in sport or comfort, the speed at which the GT&#8217;s dual-clutch transmission fires through gears is near seamless, giving spirited drivers the power they need and cruising ones a touch more serenity. On the highway or as a daily driver, the GT Speed doesn&#8217;t put one foot wrong, making the more than $274,000 price tag feel worth it. One would hope, at least.</p>
<h2>Contenders</h2>
<p>From a competitor standpoint, the GT Speed does stand largely on its own, not because of a lack of sporty luxury coupes, but due to how uniquely it executes the same mission. Segment stalwarts BMW and Mercedes-Benz can&#8217;t rightly match the level of lavishness and exclusivity that the Bentley provides, so anything equally dynamic would still be lesser. In terms of handling and power, the AMG S63 Coupe comes close and at a relatively lower starting price ($173,100), but though it&#8217;s in the same weight class, the Continental GT Speed simply does it better.</p>
<p>For a true contender, its not-too-distant cousin, the Rolls-Royce Wraith is the closest match. Beyond its similarly stacked luxury pedigree and exclusivity, the Wraith sports its own whopper of a power unit, a 624-horsepower 6.6-liter V12. This two-door grand tourer has an equally staggering $300,000 price tag and can pull off similar tricks that the GT Speed can in terms of acceleration and cruising smoothness.</p>
<p>As with anything, the future is uncertain for how Bentley plans to continue this union of old and new. As the past has proven, it&#8217;s planning ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly, the product range will be hybridized &#8212; we&#8217;ve already launched hybrid versions of the Bentayga and Flying Spur, and the Continental family will follow. We&#8217;ll then launch the first Bentley BEV in 2025, ahead of Bentley being an electric-only brand by 2030,&#8221; Sayer stated.</p>
<p>For now, we still have the Bentley Continental GT Speed, a near-anachronistic luxury powerhouse that sets the standard in its segment while marching to the beat of its own thumping 12 cylinder engine. It&#8217;s the culmination of Bentley&#8217;s dogged adherence to sticking to what they do best while still being flexible enough to bend with the winds of change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/press/message/single.htm%21id%3D10439388%40fsbMessage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that it has raided and shut down the operations of the notorious REvil ransomware gang.</p>
<p>The unprecedented move — which will undoubtedly send a message to other ransomware groups operating out of the country — saw the Russian authorities conduct raids at 25 addresses across the Moscow, St. Petersburg and Lipetsk regions that belonged to 14 suspected members of REvil.</p>
<p>The gang, which shut down its operations in July before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">a failed comeback in September</a>, is believed to have orchestrated some of the most damaging attacks of the past 12 months, including those targeting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jbs-paid-11-million-to-resolve-ransomware-attack-11623280781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JBS Foods</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FSB said it seized more than 426 million rubles and €500,000 (about $6 million), as well as $600,000 in cash, and cryptocurrency wallets, computers and 20 high-end cars.</p>
<p>In a statement, the FSB said it conducted the search operation at the request of U.S. authorities, which were notified of their results.</p>
<p>The detained members of the ransomware gang were charged under Russian law for the alleged &#8220;illegal circulation of means of payment.&#8221; Russian authorities have not released the names of any of the suspects.</p>
<p>“As a result of joint actions of the FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the organized criminal community ceased to exist, the information infrastructure used for criminal purposes was neutralized,” the FSB said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>News of the FSB&#8217;s surprise operation comes just two months after the U.S. Department of Justice charged a 22-year-old Ukrainian citizen linked to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">REvil ransomware</a> gang for orchestrating the July ransomware attack against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>. Seven other REvil gang members were also arrested throughout 2021 following operations coordinated by Europol. In July, President Biden urged Russia to follow suit, pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to take action to disrupt these criminal gangs.</p>
<p>The action taken by the FSB also comes just hours after a major cyberattack took down government websites in Ukraine on Friday, including websites for the foreign ministry, national security and defense council and the government&#8217;s cabinet of ministers. Officials said it was too early to draw any conclusions but they pointed to a “long record” of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo Via, the autonomous vehicle company&#8217;s trucking and cargo transportation unit, is expanding its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">existing partnership with logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services</a> from a pilot into a long-term strategic alliance.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, J.B. Hunt will be Waymo Via&#8217;s first launch customer for fully autonomous, driverless freight routes, which Waymo expects to reach within the next few years.</p>
<p>Waymo and J.B. Hunt began a &#8220;test run&#8221; in 2021 along I-45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas, one of the country&#8217;s busiest trade corridors. Waymo&#8217;s Daimler trucks, powered by the Waymo Driver autonomous platform, delivered 862,179 pounds of freight by the end of the pilot, with no crashes or speeding events, 100% on-time pickup and delivery and 100% freight intact, <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/what-we-learned-from-our-initial-trial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the company</a>. Each of the runs were completed with a commercially licensed truck driver and a software technician onboard to monitor operations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257867" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Our pilot last year with Waymo Via really helped us get a hands-on understanding of how autonomous driving technology could be implemented within our operations,” said Craig Harper, chief sustainability officer and executive vice president at J.B. Hunt, in a statement. “This strategic alliance will continue that momentum and further explore the intricate details that would make this a value-driven solution for customers.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257901" style="width: 975px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257901" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257901" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png" alt="" width="965" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png 965w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257901" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Waymo</p></div></p>
<p>In 2022 and beyond, the companies intend to launch several more pilots along the same corridor in Texas to prepare for driverless autonomous operations.</p>
<p>Waymo did not share what specific goals it hopes to achieve for its next pilot with J.B. Hunt, other than to firm up the company&#8217;s driver-as-a-service model, which involves Waymo partnering with an OEM like Daimler to build autonomous trucks equipped with the Waymo Driver. Those trucks will be purchased directly from fleets or carriers, like J.B. Hunt and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ryder-to-build-logistics-network-with-autonomous-trucking-company-embark/"> serviced by partners like Ryder</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the long-term vision,&#8221; Julianne McGoldrick, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the interim as we scale up to that vision, we have our test fleet of trucks, and the pilots that we&#8217;ll do with those and with our autonomous specialists are really to gain that operational practice so that when we do reach fully autonomous operations, we have all the foundations in place to haul freight with no human driver for J.B. Hunt and customers like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the Waymo-J.B. Hunt partnership, the two companies also plan to conduct joint operational and market studies to learn more about their collective progress using self-driving trucks, as well as explore a technology integration with J.B. Hunt 360, the company&#8217;s digital freight matching platform.</p>
<p>Of course, Waymo isn&#8217;t the only self-driving truck on the roads in Texas, or elsewhere. <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">One of Waymo Via&#8217;s competitors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/">TuSimple, recently completed its first driverless autonomous trucking run, </a>which effectively puts its tech at a more progressive milestone. Aurora and Kodiak Robotics are also testing and carrying freight in Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> That doesn&#8217;t worry Waymo &#8212; the Alphabet-owned strategy is linked more tightly with its partners than with ticking off autonomous boxes, McGoldrick says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think what we&#8217;ve seen is a lot of partnerships or collaborations in the industry have been primarily centered around one-off trial runs or one-off pilots, and there hasn&#8217;t been much meat to them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re entering this multi-year deal with multiple components that really cover everything and show that we&#8217;re going really deep with our partners, as opposed to just doing a pilot for pilot&#8217;s sake. We&#8217;re really crafting what our fully autonomous launch will look like together with our partners so that it&#8217;s as successful as possible when we&#8217;re ready.&#8221;  </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brands can collect customer data from dozens of touch points, analyze it and make smarter decisions about how to market their products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daasity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daasity</a>, an e-commerce analytics and data company, secured $15 million in Series A funding as it continues developing its approach to helping consumer brands better leverage their customer data to make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>VMG Catalyst led the oversubscribed round and was joined by existing investors Cove Fund, Exeter Capital, 1855 Capital, Mooring Ventures, Okapi Venture Capital and Serra Ventures. This gives the company $20.7 million in total funding to date, CEO Dan LeBlanc told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>The company’s technology enables brands to pull in all of their data from different places, like Shopify, Amazon, Facebook and Klaviyo, analyze it and push it to marketing channels to optimize customer experiences based on insights from a historical performance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There have never been more consumer product brands, and competition among them is at an all-time high,” LeBlanc said. “Brands win by having access to the right data, which leads to faster and more confident decision-making. Data demands have never been higher, and we are investing in the data infrastructure to get brands the access to the data they need.”</p>
<p>Daasity is working with more than 1,600 brands, including Manscaped, Vuori and Caraway Home, and in the past year grew its annual recurring revenue by 300%, while also growing its headcount by 100%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will enable further employee growth, with LeBlanc expecting to grow another 160% by the end of 2022. The company is also investing in technology development for better data accessibility, data sources and educational resources for better insight into results. It will also be working on more personalized customer data.</p>
<p>Next up, the company will be heads down in making brands’ data infrastructure modular by allowing the ability to configure components of their data infrastructure — as easily as they select food from a menu, LeBlanc said. It is also adding 35 integrations, like data sources, warehousing options, transformation capabilities and visualization tools.</p>
<p>Brooke Kiley, partner at VMG Catalyst, said in a written statement that the firm was “thrilled to continue our partnership with Dan and the Daasity team as they enter their next phase of growth. We consistently see how difficult it is for brands to act on their data, yet there is a greater need than ever. It is vital to utilize data to succeed in today’s competitive e-commerce environment. Daasity makes data accessible to all brands, empowering them with actionable insights and the ability to enrich their marketing channels with essential customer data.”</p>
