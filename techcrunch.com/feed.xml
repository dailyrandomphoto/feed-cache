					<description><![CDATA[The recent round followed by a quick direct listing means that we'll be able to mock Sequoia if Amplitude winds up worth more than $4.15 billion when it floats.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amplitude is going public in a direct listing that will see its shares trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;AMPL.&#8221; The company first <a href="https://amplitude.com/press/amplitude-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-for-proposed-direct-listing">announced</a> its intention to direct list in July and filed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1866692/000119312521260696/d143868ds1.htm#toc143868_16">its S-1 document</a> in August.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup lists major shareholders Battery, Benchmark, IVP, Sequoia and Jasmine Ventures in its S-1 filing. Each of those investors owns at least 5% of the company.</p>

<p>Following our digs through recent IPO filings from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">Freshworks</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Toast</a>, this morning we&#8217;re taking a spade to Amplitude&#8217;s document.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;re curious why the company is direct listing instead of raising capital in its debut. We also want to understand how the company sees the future, because its product thesis is essentially a roadmap to its long-term growth; how investors value the company will in part hinge on whether Wall Street agrees with where Amplitude sees technology heading.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll do our usual work to understand the company&#8217;s revenue mix and quality, wrapping with some noodling on what it may be worth. Sound fun? Good. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Amplitude&#8217;s core product thesis</h2>
<p>Most S-1 filings are full of corporate babble that I don&#8217;t drag you through. After all, we don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need to chat about how a particular vertical SaaS company thinks that its chosen niche is a great market. You already know what the debuting concern thinks. But with Amplitude, I want to do a bit more.</p>
<p>Amplitude sells what it calls &#8220;digital optimization&#8221; software. In practice, that means its software helps other companies design better software.</p>
<p>The company thinks that the way that digital products are built has changed. Gone are the days, in its view, of trusting intuition when it comes to digital design choices. Instead, Amplitude expects that companies with digital products will instead lean on data-driven decision-making. Or as it phrased it in its filing, digital product design is leaving the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; phase for a more &#8220;Moneyball&#8221; era.</p>
<p>Data is at the core of how Amplitude sees companies designing future products. But in its view, many companies currently rely on a collection of disparate software tools to collect data on their digital footprint. Amplitude thinks it has a better method of collecting digital user data &#8212; and learning from it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of us have not switched insurance carriers because we don’t want to deal with the hassle of comparison shopping?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot, I’d bet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://insurify.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that wants to help people make it easier to get better rates on home, auto and life insurance, announced that it has closed $100 million in an “oversubscribed” Series B funding round led by Motive Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Viola FinTech, MassMutual Ventures, Nationwide, Hearst Ventures and Moneta VC also put money in the round, as well as new investors Viola Growth and Fort Ross Ventures. With the new financing, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Insurify has now raised a total of $128 million since its 2013 inception. The company declined to disclose the valuation at which the money was raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we last covered Insurify, the startup has seen some impressive growth. For example, it has seen its new and recurring revenue increase by “6x” since it closed its Series A funding in the 2019 fourth quarter. Over the last three years, Insurify has achieved a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 151%, according to co-founder and CEO Snejina Zacharia. It has also seen consistent “2.5x” year-over-year revenue growth, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify has built a machine learning-based virtual insurance agent that integrates with more than 100 carriers to digitize &#8212; and personalize &#8212; the insurance shopping experience. There are others in the insurtech space, but none that we know of currently tackling home, auto </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life insurance. For example, Jerry, which has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jerry-raises-75m-at-a-450m-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised capital twice</span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ai-powered-jerry-raises-28m-to-help-you-save-money-on-car-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is focused mostly on auto insurance, although it does have a home product. The Zebra, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/austins-newest-unicorn-insurtech-the-zebra-raises-150m-after-doubling-revenue-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">became a unicorn this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">started out as a site for people looking for auto insurance via its real-time quote comparison tool. Over time, it has also evolved to offer homeowners insurance with the goal of eventually branching out into renters and life insurance. But it too is mostly focused on auto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zacharia said that since Insurify’s Series A funding, it has expanded its home insurance marketplace, deepened its carrier integrations to provide users an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“instant” purchase experience and launched its first two embedded insurance products through partnerships with Toyota Insurance Management Solutions and Nationwide (the latter of which also participated in the Series B funding round).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, when ShyScanner had to lay off staff, Insurify scooped up much of its engineering team and established an office in Sofia, Bulgaria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zacharia, a former Gartner executive, was inspired to start the company after she was involved in a minor car accident while getting her MBA at MIT. The accident led to a spike in her insurance premium and Zacharia was frustrated by the “complex and cumbersome” experience of car insurance shopping. She teamed up with CTO Tod Kiryazov to build Insurify, which the pair describe as a virtual insurance agent that offers real-time quotes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided to build the most trusted virtual insurance agent in the industry that allows for customers to easily search, compare and buy fully digitally &#8212; directly from their mobile phone, or desktop, and really get a very smart, personalized experience based on their unique preferences,” Zacharia told TechCrunch. “We leverage artificial intelligence to be able to make recommendations on both coverage as well as carrier selection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Insurify is also a fully licensed agent that takes over the fulfillment and servicing of the policies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company is mostly working as an insurance agent, it gets paid new and renewed commission. So while it’s not a SaaS business, its embedded insurance offerings have SaaS-like monetization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to provide an experience for the end consumer that allows them to service and manage all of their policies in one place, digitally,” Zacharia said. “We think that the data recommendations that the platform provides can really remove most of the friction that currently exists in the shopping experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify plans to use its fresh capital to continue to expand its operations and accelerate its growth plans. It also, naturally, wants to add to its 125-person team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build into our API integrations so customers can receive real-time direct quotes with better personalization and a more tailored experience,” Kiryazov said. “We also want to identify more embedded insurance opportunities and expand the product functionality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also down the line wants to expand into other verticals such as pet insurance, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify intends to use the money in part to build brand awareness, potentially through TV advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost half of our revenue comes from self-directed traffic,” Zacharia said. “So we want to explore more inorganic growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James “Jim” O’Neill, founding partner at Motive Partners and partner Andy Rear point out that o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nline purchasing now accounts for almost all of the growth in U.S. auto insurance. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="25LDKg8YtW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lesson from other markets which have been through this transition is that customers prefer choice, presented as a simple menu of products and prices from different insurers, and a straightforward online purchasing process,” they wrote via email. “The U.S. auto market is huge: even a slow transition to online means a massive opportunity for Insurify.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conducting their due diligence, the pair said they were impressed with how the startup is building a business model “that works for customers, insurers and white-label partners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harel Beit-On, founder and general partner at Viola Growth, believes that the quantum leap in e-commerce due to COVID-19 will completely transform the buying experience in almost every sector, including insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is time to bring the frictionless purchasing experience that customers expect to the insurance space as well,” she said. “Following our fintech fund&#8217;s recent investment in the company, we watched Insurify’s immense growth, excellent execution with customer acquisition and building a brand consumers trust.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/">Cox Automotive</a> is getting into the electric vehicle battery lifecycle business.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday it acquired Oklahoma City-based <a href="http://www.spiersnewtechnologies.com/">Spiers New Technologies</a> (SNT), a business that provides repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing and repurposing services for EV battery packs.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Cox said the acquisition will help it establish its battery servicing offerings, particularly as “EVs take center stage.” It added that electric vehicles have completely difference service profiles than their internal combustion engine vehicle counterparts, and much of that comes down to the battery. EV battery support is particularly critical as the battery pack itself can comprise as much as 40% of the vehicle’s cost.</p>
<p>Even as federal investment in electric vehicles grow, and more automakers announce billions to build out their EV businesses, public skepticism remains. Eight out of 10 people not considering purchasing an EV are skeptical about the value of the battery and its useful life, according to research conducted by Cox.</p>
<p>This is not Cox’s only foray into EV battery management; the company also build a battery health diagnostic tool with SNT that uses Spiers’ software platform, Alfred. Cox said it would use the diagnostic tool to push greater confidence in electric vehicles, likening it to the way that Kelley Blue Book has provided greater transparency about ICE vehicles’ condition for consumers.</p>
<p>The acquisition will also give Cox a stake in the battery repurposing business. Spiers is one of a few companies that specializes giving EV batteries a “second life” after they are no longer fit in a vehicle. Around 80% to 90% of the batteries SNT receives are from OEMs, with the rest from auto dismantlers, the company told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year. It’s a business segment that is likely only to grow as more EVs come off the roads, so the transaction is likely giving Cox a stake in end-of-life purposes as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx, which wants to build a real estate “super app” for Latin America, has closed on a $20 million Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis and 500 Startups co-led the investment, which included participation from ALLVP and Expa. Previously, Flat.mx had raised a total $10 million in equity and $25 million in debt. Other backers include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/">Opendoor</a> CEO and CEO and co-founder Eric Wu, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/homebuying-startup-flyhomes-closes-150-million-series-c/">Flyhomes’</a> co-founder and CEO Tushar Garg and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/">Divvy Homes’</a> co-founder Brian Ma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in July 2019, Mexico City-based Flat.mx started out with a model similar to that of Opendoor, buying properties, renovating them and then reselling them. That September, the proptech startup had raised one of Mexico’s largest pre-seed rounds to take the Opendoor real estate marketplace model across the Rio Grande.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real estate market in Mexico is broken,” said co-founder Bernardo Cordero. “One of the biggest problems is that it takes sellers anywhere from 6 months to 2 years to sell. So we launched the most radical solution we could find to this problem: an instant offer. This product allows homeowners to sell in days instead of months, a fast and convenient experience they can’t find anywhere else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an instant buyer (ibuyer) in Mexico &#8212; and Latin America in general &#8212; is a complex endeavor. Unlike in the U.S., Mexico doesn’t have a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). As such, pricing data is not readily available. On top of that, agents are not required to be certified so the whole process of buying and selling a home can be informal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since mortgage penetration in Mexico is also low, it can be difficult for buyers to have access to reasonable financing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To build an iBuyer, we had to solve the transaction end-to-end,” said co-founder Victor Noguera. “We had to build the MLS, a third-party marketplace, a contractor marketplace, financial products, broker technology, and a home maintenance provider, along with other services. In other words, we have been building the real estate Superapp for Latam.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx says its certified remodeled properties have gone through a 200+ point inspection and “a full legal review.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx is growing sales by 70% quarter-over-quarter, and has increased its inventory by 10x over the last year, according to its founders. It has also nearly tripled its headcount from 30 at the middle of last year to over 85 today. So far, Flat.mx has conducted thousands of home valuations and over 100 transactions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic only helped boost interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our low touch digital solution was key for having a strong business during the pandemic. We were able to create quick liquidity for sellers at a time in Mexico where it was complicated to sell,” said Cordero. “Our model allows sellers to sell with one visit instead of having to receive over 40 potential buyers at a time where they wanted to sell but also wanted to avoid contact with many buyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to continue to develop what it describes as a “one-stop shop where homeowners and buyers will be able to get all the services they need in one place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders believe that rather than just try to tackle one aspect of the homebuying process, it makes more sense in emerging markets to address them all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that each one of our products makes the others stronger and creating this ecosystem of products will continue to give us an important advantage in the market,” said Noguera. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to also use the capital from the round to expand its presence in Mexico for iBuying, and to invest in data and financial products.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196752" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196752" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196752 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="485" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196752" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flat.mx</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Flat.mx&#8217;s investors are bullish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archie Cochrane, principal investor at Anthemis Group, said his firm views Flat.mx as an integral part of its embedded finance thesis in the context of the Mexican property sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The iBuyer model itself is well understood and developed in many parts of the world, but it is also a complex model with many variables that requires a seasoned and astute team to execute the strategy,” Cochrane wrote via email. “When we met Victor and Bernardo, it was clear that their clarity of vision and deep understanding of the broader opportunity set would allow them to succeed over the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim Chae, managing partner at 500 Startups, said he envisions that Flat.mx will become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the go-to route” for buyers, sellers, agents and lenders in Mexican real estate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are nuances and specific problems that are unique to Mexico that Flat.mx has done a great job identifying and solving,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP Partner Fernando Lelo de Larrea said that essentially after years of “unkept promises,” software is finally transforming the real estate industry in Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most models replicate successful models from the more mature U.S. proptech space,” he said. “Since we started investing in proptech, we’ve never seen such an innovative approach to seizing a trillion dollar opportunity.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A stealthy startup co-founded by a former senior designer from Apple and one of its ex-senior software engineers has picked up a significant round funding to build out its business. <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humane</a>, which has ambitions to build a new class of consumer devices and technologies that stem from &#8220;a genuine collaboration of design and engineering&#8221; that will represent &#8220;the next shift between humans and computing&#8221;, has raised $100 million.</p>
<p>This is a Series B, and it&#8217;s coming from some very high profile backers. Tiger Global Management is leading the round, with SoftBank Group, BOND, Forerunner Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures also participating. Other investors in this Series B include Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, Kindred Ventures, Marc Benioff&#8217;s TIME Ventures, Valia Ventures, NEXT VENTŪRES, Plexo Capital and the legal firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</p>
<p>Humane has been around actually since 2017, but it closed/filed its Series A only last year: $30 million in September 2020 at a $150 million valuation, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/327321-91/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>. Previous to that, it had raised just under $12 million, with many of the investors in this current round backing Humane in those earlier fundraises, too.</p>
<p>Valuation with this Series B is not being disclosed, the company confirmed to me.</p>
<p>Given that Humane has not yet released any products, nor has said much at all about what it has up its sleeve; and given that hardware in general presents a lot of unique challenges and therefore is often seen as a risky bet (that old &#8220;hardware is hard&#8221; chestnut), you might be wondering how Humane, still in stealth, has attracted these backers.</p>
<p>Some of that attention possibly stems from the fact that the two co-founders, husband-and-wife team Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, are something of icons in their own right. Bongiorno, who is Humane&#8217;s CEO, had been the software engineering director at Apple. Chaudhri, who is Humane&#8217;s chairman and president, is Apple&#8217;s former director of design, where he worked for 20 years on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/apple-watch-designer-reveals-the-devices-origins-on-its-fifth-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of its most seminal products</a> &#8212; the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. Both have dozens of patents credited to them from their time there, and they have picked up a few since then, too.</p>
<p>Those latest patents &#8212; plus the very extensive list of job openings listed on Humane&#8217;s otherwise quite sparse site &#8212; might be the closest clues we have for what the pair and their startup might be building.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One patent is for a &#8220;Wearable multimedia device and cloud computing platform with laser projection system&#8221;; another is for a &#8220;System and apparatus for fertility and hormonal cycle awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company currently has nearly 50 job openings listed, including engineers with camera and computer vision experience, hardware engineers, designers, and security experts, among many others. (One sign of where all that funding will be going.) There is already an impressive team of about 60 people the company, which is another detail that attracted investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The caliber of individuals working at Humane is incredibly impressive,&#8221; said Chase Coleman, Partner, Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;These are people who have built and shipped transformative products to billions of people around the world. What they are building is groundbreaking with the potential to become a standard for computing going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked for more details on the company&#8217;s product roadmap and ethos behind the company, and who its customers might potentially be: other firms for whom it designs products, or end users directly?</p>
<p>For now, Bongiorno and Chaudhri seem to hint that part of what has motivated them to start this business was to reimagine what role technology might play in the next wave of innovation. It&#8217;s a question that many ask, but not many try to actually invest in finding the answer. For that alone, it&#8217;s worth watching Humane (if Humane lets us, that is: it&#8217;s still very much in stealth) to see what it does next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humane is a place where people can truly innovate through a genuine collaboration of design and engineering,&#8221; the co-founders said in a joint statement. &#8220;We are an experience company that creates products for the benefit of people, crafting technology that puts people first — a more personal technology that goes beyond what we know today. We&#8217;re all waiting for something new, something that goes beyond the information age that we have all been living with. At Humane, we&#8217;re building the devices and the platform for what we call the intelligence age. We are committed to building a different type of company, founded on our values of trust, truth and joy. With the support of our partners, we will continue to scale the team with individuals who not only share our passion for revolutionizing the way we interact with computing, but also for how we build.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: after publishing, I got a little more from Humane about its plans. Its aim is to build &#8220;t<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">echnology that improves the human experience and is born of good intentions; p</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">roducts that put us back in touch with ourselves, each other, and the world around us; and e</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">xperiences that are built on trust, with interactions that feel magical and bring joy.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a whole lot to go on, but more generally it&#8217;s an approach that seems to want to step away from the cycle we&#8217;re on today, and be more mindful and thoughtful. If they can execute on this, while still building rather than wholesale rejecting technology, they might be on to something.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>A few years ago, I moved my startup’s headquarters to New York from Estonia on an E-2 investor visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve taken on a few investors since then, but if I take on more, I run the risk of no longer qualifying for an E-2 because my equity is diluting. </strong><strong>I’m considering either having my startup sponsor me for an O-1A visa or self-petitioning an EB-1A green card. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Any advice or insights on how to present a strong case for an O-1A or EB-1A? Thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Savvy Startup Founder</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dear Savvy,</p>
<p>Congrats on your success so far! Yes, we have many best practices to pass along for filing for an O-1A extraordinary ability visa or an EB-1A extraordinary ability green card.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/nadia-zaidi/">Nadia Zaidi</a>, an associate attorney at Alcorn Immigration Law and an expert in immigration law services for startups and creatives, and I recently did a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/086-back-to-school-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp-part-2/">podcast</a> reviewing what to keep in mind when filing for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/o-visas/">O-1A visa</a>, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card</a> or <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)</a> green card. Take a listen! I would also recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney who can help you determine the best approach based on your timing and goals.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you pursue an O-1A visa, you will need to show that your startup and you have an employer-employee relationship, or you will need an agent to file on your behalf. If demonstrating an employer-employee relationship, that usually involves showing that your startup’s board of directors oversees your work and can fire you.</p>

<p>You might also want to consider filing for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP). My firm has filed several IEP petitions on behalf of clients. Based on our experience, it takes less time to prepare an IEP petition than an O-1A petition because it’s not as document-intensive. Moreover, if you’re married and you’re granted IEP status, your spouse will be eligible to apply for a work permit. The spouse of an O-1A visa holder is not eligible for a work permit.</p>
<p>Getting back to answering your question, here are some best practices for filing for either an O-1A or an EB-1A:</p>
<h2>Field of expertise</h2>
<p>Spend some time homing in on your area of expertise. Because both the O-1A and EB-1A are for individuals of extraordinary ability or accomplishments who are at the top of their field, the more narrowly defined your field of expertise is, the easier it will be to demonstrate that you are at the top of it. For example, instead of listing tech entrepreneurship as your area of expertise, narrow it to something like entrepreneurship focused on developing machine learning software for the healthcare industry. Work with an experienced immigration attorney to craft your field for the petition.</p>
<h2>Qualification criteria</h2>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the qualification criteria for the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/o-visas/">O-1A</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A</a>, which are similar, and determine which of your skills and achievements best meet the criteria. As a startup founder, the critical and essential role you play at your startup should be easy to demonstrate. Remember, this is not the time to be humble.</p>
<p>Under your leadership, how much funding has your startup raised? Have you received any significant awards? What is your startup’s annual recurring revenue, and how many jobs have you created in the U.S.? Were you invited to judge a pitch competition, speak on a panel or mentor others based on your background, experience or skill set? Were you invited to become a member of an exclusive organization that has a rigorous selection process? Are you a thought leader in your field?</p>
<p>You will need to gather recommendation letters — more on those in a moment — and documentary evidence to demonstrate your achievements, such as a scan or photo of an award, email correspondences, copies or screenshots of articles written either about you or by you, or screenshots of a conference agenda or presentation on YouTube that generated a significant number of views. You should know that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not consider awards or prizes given out at the university level to be significant accomplishments. Some investments through competitions can qualify as awards, and some investments might not.</p>
<h2>Recommendation letters</h2>
<p>We typically recommend obtaining five to eight letters from experts in your field who can discuss your abilities and accomplishments and the significance of their impact on your field or beyond. Typically, the more details and examples provided in the recommendation letter — discussed in easy-to-understand terms — the more compelling the letter. You should keep in mind that the immigration official who is evaluating your case will likely not be an expert in your field.</p>
<p>It’s often valuable to submit letters from a variety of individuals, such as those who have worked directly with you and those who only know of you based on your work within your field, academic and professional experts, and individuals from both inside and outside the United States.</p>
<p>Make sure to ask prospective recommenders if they’re willing to submit a letter to USCIS on your behalf. While most recommenders are time-constrained individuals who prefer that you write a draft letter that they can edit, some recommenders prefer to write their own letters, which is good to know from the get-go. Make sure that those individuals who are doing so are willing to edit and make changes to any drafts, such as eliminating jargon or adding more detail.</p>
<p>The process of finalizing recommendation letters and getting them signed along with gathering documentary evidence for a case usually takes longer than most people anticipate. That said, get started!</p>
<p>All the best in the next phase of growing your startup!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is appealing the more than half a billion dollar fine it got slapped with by France&#8217;s competition authority in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">July</a>.</p>
<p>The penalty relates to the adtech giant&#8217;s approach toward paying news publishers for content reuse.</p>
<p>In a statement today, Sebastien Missoffe, a Google France VP and country manager, characterized the fine as &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; &#8212; claiming that the $592M penalty is not justified in light of Google&#8217;s &#8220;efforts&#8221; to cut a deal with news publishers and comply with updated copyright rules. Which reads like fairly weak sauce, as defence statements go.</p>
<p>“We are appealing the French Competition Authority’s decision which relates to our negotiations between April and August 2020. We disagree with a number of legal elements, and believe that the fine is disproportionate to our efforts to reach an agreement and comply with the new law,&#8221; wrote Missoffe, adding: &#8220;Irrespective of this, we recognize neighboring rights and we continue to work hard to resolve this case and put deals in place. This includes expanding offers to 1,200 publishers, clarifying aspects of our contracts, and we are sharing more data as requested by the French Competition Authority in their July Decision.”</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">2019</a>, the European Union agreed on an update to digital copyright rules which extended cover to the ledes of news stories &#8212; snippets of which aggregators such as Google News had for years routinely scraped and displayed.</p>
<p>Individual EU Member States then needed to transpose the updated pan-EU reforms into their national laws &#8212; with France leading the pack to do so.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s competition watchdog has also been leading the charge in enforcing updated rules against Google &#8212; ordering the tech giant to negotiate with publishers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">last year</a> and following that up with a whopping fine when publishers complained to it about how Google was treating those talks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Announcing the penalty this summer, the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> accused the tech giant of attempting to unilaterally impose a global news licensing product it operates upon local publishers in a bid to avoid having to put a separate financial value on neighbouring rights remuneration &#8212; where there is a legal requirement (under EU and French law) upon it to negotiate with said publishers&#8230;</p>
<p>The watchdog&#8217;s full list of grievances against Google&#8217;s <em>modus operandi</em> was very long &#8212; check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">our earlier report here</a> &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear how much of a placeholder action this appeal by Google is.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-appeals-french-500-mln-eur-copyright-fine-2021-09-01/">Reuters</a>, the <em>Autorité </em>has said the appeal will not hold up the penalty nor impede the timeline of the order it already issued &#8212; which, in mid July, gave Google a two month timeframe to revise its offer and provide publishers with all the required info, with the threat of daily fines (of €900,000) if it failed to meet all its requirements by then. So there is now only a couple of weeks to go before that deadline.</p>
<p>Google may thus be hoping that by announcing an appeal now it will help &#8216;concentrate&#8217; publishers&#8217; minds &#8212; and encourage them to accept &#8212; whatever tweaked offer it comes up with, hence its statement noting an &#8216;expanded&#8217; offer (now covering 1,200 publishers), and talk of &#8220;clarifying aspects of our contracts&#8221; and &#8220;sharing more data&#8221;, all of which were areas where Google got roundly spanked by the <em>Autorité. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is getting into fantasy sports and other types of fantasy games. The company this morning <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/">announced</a> the launch of Facebook Fantasy Games in the U.S. and Canada on the Facebook app for iOS and Android. Some games are described as &#8220;simpler&#8221; versions of the traditional fantasy sports games already on the market, while others allow users to make predictions associated with popular TV series, like &#8220;Survivor&#8221; or &#8220;The Bachelorette.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first game to launch is Pick &amp; Play Sports, in partnership with Whistle Sports, where fans get points for correctly predicting the winner of a big game, the points scored by a top player, or other events that unfold during the match. Players can also earn bonus points for building a streak of correct predictions over several days. This game is arriving today.</p>

<p>In the months ahead, it will be followed by other games in sports, TV, and pop culture, including Fantasy Survivor, where players choose a set of Castaways from the popular CBS TV show to join their fantasy team and Fantasy &#8220;The Bachelorette,&#8221; where fans will pick a group of men from the suitors vying for the Bachelorette&#8217;s heart and get points based on their actions and events that take place during the show. Other upcoming sports-focused games include MLB Home Run Picks, where players pick the team that they think will hit the most home runs, and LaLiga Winning Streak, where fans predict the team that will win that day.</p>
<p>In addition to top players being featured on leaderboards, games have a social component for those who want to play with friends.</p>

<p>Players can create their own fantasy league with friends to compete with one another or against other fans, either publicly or privately. League members can compare scores with each other and will have a place where they can share picks, reactions and comments. This league area resembles a private group on Facebook, as it offers its own compose box for posting only to members and its own dedicated feed. However, the page is designed to support groups with specific buttons to &#8220;play&#8221; or view the &#8220;leaderboard,&#8221; among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The addition of fantasy games could help Facebook increase the time users spent on its app at a time when the company is facing significant competition in social, namely from TikTok. According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/go/state-of-mobile-2021/">App Annie</a>, the average monthly time spent per user in TikTok grew faster than other top social apps in 2020, including by 70% in the U.S., surpassing Facebook.</p>

<p>Facebook had dabbled in the idea of becoming a second screen companion for live events in the past, but in a different way than fantasy sports and games. Instead, its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/facebook-takes-on-twitter-with-venue-a-second-screen-companion-for-live-events/"> R&amp;D division tested Venue</a>, which worked as a way for fans to comment on live events which were hosted in the app by well-known personalities.</p>
<p>The company has several other gaming investments, as well, including through its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/facebook-steps-into-cloud-gaming-and-another-feud-with-apple/"> cloud gaming service</a> on the desktop web and Android, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/in-a-challenge-to-twitch-and-youtube-facebook-adds-gaming-to-its-main-navigation/">Games tab for streamers</a>, and its VR company, <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus</a>.</p>
<p>The new league games will be available from the bookmark menu on the mobile app and in News Feed through notifications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.animaapp.com/">Anima</a>, the YC-backed platform that turns designs into code, has today announced the close of a $10 million Series A financing. The round was led by MizMaa Ventures with participation from INcapital and Hetz Ventures.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been following Anima, which was bootstrapped until last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/animas-latest-update-draws-on-the-popularity-of-design-and-no-code-tools/">for a while now</a>.</p>
<p>The startup indexes on several trending ingredients right now, including a bottoms-up distribution approach, and the popularity of low/no code.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>Most developers spend a tremendous amount of time turning design elements into code. Unfortunately, this piece of their job isn&#8217;t nearly as exciting as writing the code that actually makes the app, website, platform, etc. work.</p>
<p>With Anima, designers can upload their element or design from Figma and it will be automatically transformed into high-quality code, with support for React, Vue.js, HTML, CSS and Sass. Designers can also create prototypes of their work right within Anima, so that the system can process not only how something looks statically but how the flow should feel.</p>
<p>Cofounders Avishay and Michal Cohen and Or Arbel (a name you may recognize from the glory days of Yo!) have a clear vision on how to use the funding. Alongside tripling the size of the team, they plan to build integrations with platforms like Figma, Sketch, etc. and Github so that Anima itself can effectively get out of the way, allowing designers and developers to hand off these elements in the platforms where they already live.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of distribution, Anima is making the most of their bottoms-up approach. Any designer can sign up for free to use Anima, and right now there are more than 600,000 users registered with the platform. That&#8217;s compared with roughly 300,000 users in October of 2020. Avishay Cohen clarified that active users are growing, too, with 80,000 monthly active users on the platform now compared with 10,000 a year ago.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Anima&#8217;s latest update draws on the popularity of design and no-code tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/animas-latest-update-draws-on-the-popularity-of-design-and-no-code-tools/embed/#?secret=WBEG2aaOa6" data-secret="WBEG2aaOa6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Cohens went on to explain that more than 5 percent of free users convert into paying users, and that 15 percent of paying accounts expand into teams organically within the first one to two months of becoming a paid user. The startup is already getting requests for enterprise accounts, which the cofounders describe as the next phase of the business on the back of this new funding.</p>
<p>Arbel told TechCrunch that the greatest challenge during this time has been hiring in a remote world, and that the answer to that, for Anima, has been looking at talent on a global scale. The Cohens added that with that hyperscaling, growing the team from four to 30 in the year and continuing to hire, it is challenging to maintain and foster company culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Traditional voice-based call center service is difficult and costly. This is where artificial intelligence and voice technology have presented an opportunity for enterprises to overcome the challenges of scale and engagement at their customer contact centers,” co-founder and CEO Skit Sourabh Gupta told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented increase in call volumes at bank call centers as customers tried to manage their portfolios amid the chaos of work from home policy and financial instability, Gupta said. And that presented an opportunity for companies like <a href="https://skit.ai/">Skit</a>.</p>
<p>“Customers have a natural tendency to prefer voice call support over other self-service channels and this has led to the increase in pressure on the traditional interactive voice responses (IVR) systems and support agents to respond to all incoming queries,” he said.</p>
<p>Bengaluru-based artificial intelligence SaaS voice automation company Skit, formerly known as Vernacular.ai, developed its AI-based voice automation platform VIVA, short for Vernacular Intelligent Voice Assistant, which enables corporations to automate 90% of their call center operations powered by Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technology.  Its product VIVA covers more than 16 languages and 160 dialects.</p>
<p>Skit announced today it has closed $23 million Series B round to accelerate its growth in domestic and global markets including the US and South East Asia and enhance its voice automation platform.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2016 by two co-founders, Indian Institute of Technology alumni, Roorkee alumnus, Sourabh Gupta and Akshay Deshraj.</p>
<p>The latest funding was led by WestBridge Capital along with existing investors Kalaari Capital and Exfinity Ventures, IAN Fund, LetsVenture and Sense AI. Angel investors including Prophetic Ventures’ Aaryaman Vir Shah also participated the round. The Series B round brings Skit’s total funding to $30 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Skit will use the fresh funding for sales, marketing, further R&amp;D to strengthen its personalized solutions and voice products, as well as its global expansion.</p>
<p>“We want to double down and scale operations in both Indian and global markets. We are also planning on increasing our employee headcount. Through our new headquarters in New York, we want to build a strong customer base in North America by our product available to US enterprises,” Gupta told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company said it has quadrupled its amount of revenue and numbers of customers in 2020-2021 since its previous fundraising, $5.1 million Series A, in May 2020. Its average order book has also been growing in CAGR 200-300% every year, Gupta added. It currently has 150 employees.</p>
<p>Skit recently expanded into the US and South East Asia market.</p>
<p>“We noticed that there (South East Asia) is a high potential market for the adoption of conversational AI. Most importantly, these markets are home to a multitude of languages and dialects,” Gupta said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Given that language and hyper-personalization are Skit’s strongest suit, the company is witnessing increase adoption in South East Asia market, where is easier for the company to expand with similar demographics and business challenges as in India, Gupta explained.</p>
<p>It also opened headquarters in NYC, “It is a mature market, ahead in technology adoption with a level-playing for strong competition,” he said.</p>
<p>Venture advisor at WestBridge Capital Sashi Reddi said in a statement: “Skit’s success in helping India’s largest companies, positions them well to enter the US market where there is a massive need for voice AI solutions.”</p>
<p>The global contact center market size is expected to increase steadily and reach $496 billion by 2027. Skit will potentially address the $300 billion voice customer service market with its voice AI platform VIVA, Gupta said.</p>
<p>Its B2B and B2C clients are in diverse industries including banking, insurance, finance, securities, non-banking finance companies, travels, logistics, food &amp; beverage, e-commerce. It has more than 25 B2B clients including Axis Bank, Hathway, Porter and Barbeque Nation, according to Gupta.</p>
<p>Call centers are traditionally places where there are high costs and high attrition rates, and for the end-users the traditional interactive voice responses (IVRs) and the wait times are irritating. There were longer than usual wait-times, call drops and going through extensive IVR menus and frequent agent transfers which increase customer frustration.</p>
<p>With over 10 million hour of training data, Skit&#8217;s VIVA replicates human-like conversation and understands speaker’s intent and can translate other unique speech characteristics that enable more efficient query resolutions, Gupta said.</p>
<p>Skit has been listed in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia start-ups 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private equity firm Vista Equity Partners announced today that it is taking a majority stake in <a href="https://www.drift.com/">Drift</a>, a company which aims to be the Amazon of businesses, with a “growth investment&#8221; that propels the venture-backed startup to unicorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, neither party would disclose the amount of the investment, or Drift’s new valuation. But co-founder and CEO David Cancel did say the SaaS company saw 70% growth in its annual recurring revenue (ARR) in 2020 compared to the year prior and is on target for a similar metric this year. It is not yet profitable, as it is focused on growth, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this financing, Boston-based Drift had raised $107 million in funding from the likes of Sequoia Capital, CRV and General Catalyst since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So just what does the company do exactly? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it is out to ”reimagine the B2B buying experience,” according to Cancel. By using its software, Drift’s 50,000 customers are able to bring together sales and marketing teams on one platform to “deliver personalized conversations” that the company says build trust and accelerate revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ServiceNow, Okta, Grubhub, Mindbody, Adobe, Ellie May and Snowflake, among others. Today 75% of Drift’s customers are mid-market enterprise, according to Cancel. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drift has worked to create and define something it describes as “Conversational Marketing” with the goal of helping marketers “harness the digital experience for lead generation.” Or to put it more simply, Drift subscribers can use chatbots to help turn web visits into sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it is out to remove the friction between buyers and sellers so they can not only get more leads, but also close more sales. This led Drift to expand its focus to build a platform that includes conversational sales, which integrates chat, email, video and artificial intelligence to power conversations, not just on a customer&#8217;s website, but for the sales team too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancel said that Vista’s strategic growth investment will help the company move even faster, expand globally and launch a new B2B category called “Conversation Commerce,” an interactive approach to conversations that Drift believes has the potential to “transform the entire B2B revenue function.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the company is trying to make the B2B buying/selling experience similar to that of a B2C one. At</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> least 80% of B2B buyers are not only looking for, but expect, a buying</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">experience similar to that of a B2C customer, according to Cancel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n 2021, Drift’s customers generated $5 billion in pipeline value by making the customer side of the buying process easier, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Cancel, a serial entrepreneur who previously founded and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-cancel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold four other companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the notion of owning a company with a unicorn valuation was not something he and co-founder and CTO Elias Torres were overly consumed with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what did appeal to the pair was the opportunity to add to the too-short list of U.S.-based unicorns with Latin founders and serve as an inspiration for other entrepreneurs of Latin descent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancel’s parents emigrated from Puerto Rico and Cuba while Torres emigrated from Nicaragua in his teens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn&#8217;t really care about that [unicorn] status except for one reason and the reason was that we are both Latino and if we hit this milestone, then we would be part of the less than 1% of Latinos that had ever done that,” Cancel told TechCrunch. “And that was important to us because we believe that we have the responsibility to pay it forward and to help people and to inspire other people who are like us and are often marginalized. We want to show that they can do this too.”</span></p>
<p>Torres agreed, saying that he and Cancel were &#8220;proud to be one of the only Latino-founded companies to ever achieve over $1 billion valuation – a rare, Latino-founded unicorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to see more of us do the same and we will pave the way for other Latino founders and leaders to achieve success,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having a majority owner in Vista, which focuses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusively on backing enterprise software, data and technology-enabled businesses, Cancel believes that Drift can “get more efficient in some areas.” He also thinks that the firm can help it ramp up its acquisitions pace. (So far it has made three.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nearly 600-person company still has its sights on going public, according to Cancel, and believes that by working with Vista, it will have a “clearer path” to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s something we think about a lot,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s still in our future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monti Saroya, co-head of the Flagship Fund and senior managing director at Vista, thinks that Drift represents a &#8220;compelling&#8221; opportunity for Vista.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Drift is a company that is experiencing hypergrowth at scale, we and we believe the conversational marketing and sales tools it offers will continue to be in high demand as companies race to modernize their B2B commerce strategies,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Vista &#8212; which has over $77 billion in assets under management &#8212; </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/vista-equity-takes-minority-stake-in-canadas-vena-with-242m-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested $242 million to acquire a minority stake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><a href="http://www.venasolutions.com/?utm_source=release&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FY22Q1_Fund_Raise_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vena</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Canadian company focused on the Corporate Performance Management (CPM) software space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Vista’s acquisition of Drift is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The free itinerary maker and road trip planner takes the best parts of Google Docs and Maps and enables users to import the information and map out their trips with others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twin brothers Harry and Peter Yu grew up traveling all over, an aspect of their lives that continued even into their careers. What they didn’t enjoy was figuring out all the logistics, which has become more difficult during the pandemic: vacations that could be taken quickly now require more planning and even reservations.</p>
<p>“People travel differently, but the common denominator is that everyone uses some kind of document to plan and share their trip information,” Harry Yu told TechCrunch. “We saw a need for something that is better than spreadsheets and ‘copy-and paste.’ ”</p>
<p>So they launched Bay Area-based <a href="https://wanderlog.com/">Wanderlog</a> in 2019 to enable users to gather and record their travel plans. The free itinerary maker and road trip planner takes the best parts of Google Docs and Maps and enables users to import the information and map out the trip. You can even add lists of places you’d like to visit, and Wanderlog will recommend the best way to get there. Reservations can also be added, Peter Yu said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196469" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196469" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196469" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Web-product-demo.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="419" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196469" class="wp-caption-text">Wanderlog demo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wanderlog</p></div></p>
<p>The company announced Wednesday it raised $1.5 million in seed funding from General Catalyst and Abstract Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanderlog has built a product that has a unique understanding of how users plan trips and share their experiences — it’s no surprise that people love using it,” General Catalyst’s Niko Bonatsos said via email. “General Catalyst is proud to invest in Wanderlog as they change the way we travel together, and we&#8217;re excited by the growth Peter, Harry and the entire Wanderlog team have achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which was part of Y Combinator’s 2019 cohort, plans to use the new funding to expand its web and mobile app features, including offering restaurant recommendations, based on Google and Yelp reviews, for those who don’t want to do a bunch of searching and reading reviews.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders declined to share growth metrics, but said the platform is already facilitating thousands of trips per week. Customers are already sharing with the founders that the app is good for communication among a large group, where everyone can see what the plans are and discuss them, Harry Yu said. In addition, they just launched a subscription service and are seeing good early metrics.</p>
<p>Wanderlog is among a number of travel startups attracting venture capital dollars as travel restrictions have begun to ease amid the pandemic. For example, just over the past month companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">Thatch raised $3 million</a> for its platform aimed at travel creators, travel tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns/">Hopper brought in $175 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/wheel-the-world-raises-2m-to-provide-unlimited-experiences-for-travelers-with-limited-accessibility/">Wheel the World grabbed $2 million</a> for its disability-friendly vacation planner and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/">Elude raised $2.1 million</a> to bring spontaneous travel back to a hard-hit industry.</p>

This brings the round’s new total to $29 million.</p>
<p>The strategic investment marks the first time UBS has invested private equity in Lynk. The startup, which has now raised $35 million in funding, added UBS as a client in May, giving the banking giant’s research analysts and institutional investor clients access to Lynk’s database and tools.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015 by chief executive officer Peggy Choi, Lynk uses machine learning algorithms to match users with experts on its platform. Its goal is to connect its clients, including financial institutions and government organizations, with people they might not usually find online or at traditional consultancy. The company has offices in New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Shanghai and Toronto.</p>
<p>As part of the funding, Lynk will broaden its collaboration with UBS Group. UBS Investment Bank’s Global Markets team was already offering Lynk to its institutional investor clients. Lynk has also brought some of UBS Global Research’s top-ranked analysts onto its platform as experts, including in areas like Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), valuation and accounting, and industry trends in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Agricultural robotics firm<a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/"> Carbon Robotics</a> (not to be confused with <a href="https://cobotsguide.com/2016/06/carbon-robotics-katia/">our former Battlefield contestant</a>) announced this week that it has secured $27 million in funding. The round &#8212; which features Anthos Capital, Ignition Capital, Fuse Venture Partners and Voyager Capital &#8212; follows an $8.4 million Series A raised back in 2019. The company’s total funding is now at around $36 million.</p>
<p>“Weeding is one of the biggest challenges farmers face, especially with the rise of herbicide-resistant weeds and increasing interest in organic and regenerative methods,” founder and CEO Paul Mikesell said in a release. “This round of investment will enable us to scale our operations to meet the increasing demand for this technology. Additionally, this funding will allow our team to continue to innovate new products and identify revolutionary ways to apply technology to agriculture.”</p>
<p>The Seattle-based startup’s primary offering is an autonomous robot that uses lasers to zap weeds. The round follows the April announcement of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/robotics-roundup-8/"> Carbon’s latest-generation Autonomous Weeder</a>, which it says is capable of eradicating around 100,000 weeds per hour. The pandemic has continued to accelerate interest in many agricultural robotics companies, as labor shortages continue to mount.</p>
<p>Carbon notes some international bans on various pesticides have left many farmers searching for an alternative solution. A system that works without the need for harmful chemicals that also reduces human labor in an industry often suffering from shortages in headcount has clear appeal.</p>
<p>The company says it has already sold out of its 2021 and 2022 stock, so one assumes scaling up production and headcount will be key investments from this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish electric motorcycle manufacturer Cake has released its newest vehicle, the Makka, a super lightweight e-moped that&#8217;s built for urban convenience. The bike starts at $3,500 and is now available for <a href="https://ridecake.com/en/">pre-order</a> in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The Makka is a step outside the norm for Cake, which is best-known for off-road motorbikes like its flagship <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/cake-brings-a-swedish-take-on-e-motorcycle-design-to-the-u-s/">high-performance Kalk</a> and its utility machine <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ösa. This third platform will be Cake&#8217;s first motorbike specifically made for city riding like short-haul commercial transportation and commuting needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These new electric mopeds further define Cake&#8217;s ambition of making two-wheeled electric vehicles accessible to everyone, while constantly pushing the envelope of performance, durability and relevancy in line with the company’s mission to inspire towards a zero-emission lifestyle,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>The Makka weighs about 132 pounds and comes standard with a rear cargo rack. Mounts and other accessories like saddlebags, a child seat or even a passenger seat can be attached to the rack.</p>
<p>The e-moped comes in white or gray and is street legal. In the U.S., it&#8217;s classified as a motor-driven cycle, meaning it produces 5-brake horsepower or less, and requires a car or motorcycle license. In the EU, the Makka has an L1e-b classification, which means the motor does not exceed 45 kilometers per hour (28 miles per hour), and requires a moped or car license.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2196758,2196759,2196760"]</p>
<p>Cake&#8217;s newest moped comes in two forms. The Makka Range, which is available only in Europe, has a lower maximum speed of 15 miles per hour and a range of up to 35 miles. The Makka Flex, which is available in Europe and the U.S., costs $3,800 and can hit top speeds of 28 miles per hour,. The range of this vehicle is slightly less at 30 miles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both bikes feature a foot board and aluminum step-through frame, which rides on top of two 14 by 3 inch motorcycle tires. The Makka range comes with a touchscreen display that shows information like battery, speedometer, odometer, ride mode (for extended range or balanced performance) and brake mode selection.</p>
<p>The Makka&#8217;s drivetrain has 3.6 kW of power and a battery capacity of 1.5 kWh. It takes about two hours to charge the battery up to 80%, which can be done by removing the battery or plugging the bike in. It takes three hours to charge the battery to 100%. The electronic motorcycle braking system with hand levers for both front and rear braking regenerates braking power into the battery to increase range.</p>
<p>Cake isn&#8217;t the only manufacturer to see the utility in repurposing off-road bikes for urban use. Ubco, a New Zealand electric utility bike brand, has recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">$10 million to expand sales of its moped</a>, which has a similar look and feel to the Makka, internationally to the U.S. <a href="https://ridecake.com/en/cake-closes-14m-funding-round/">Cake&#8217;s last funding round was a $14 million Series A in 2019</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The acquisition was driven by a boost in e-commerce websites as a result of the global pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.duda.co/">Duda</a> announced Wednesday that it acquired Canada-based <a href="https://snipcart.com/">Snipcart</a>, a startup that enables businesses to add a shopping cart to their websites.</p>
<p>The acquisition is Palo Alto-based Duda’s first deal, and follows the website development platform’s <a href="https://blog.duda.co/duda-announces-growth-funding-50-million-series-d">$50 million Series D round</a> in June that brings its total funding to $100 million to date. Duda co-founder and CEO Itai Sadan declined to comment on the acquisition amount.</p>
<p>Duda, which works with digital agencies and SaaS companies, has approximately 1 million published paying sites, and the acquisition was driven by the company seeing a boost in e-commerce websites as a result of the global pandemic, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This was not just about a technology acquisition for Duda, but also a talented team, Sadan said. The entire Snipcart team of 12 is staying on, including CEO Francois Lanthier Nadeau; the companies will be fully integrated by 2022 and the first collaborative versions will come out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When he met the Snipcart team, Sadan thought they were “super experienced and held the same values.”</p>
<p>“We share many of the same types of customers, many of which are API-first,” he added. “If our customers need more headless commerce, they can build their own front end using Snipcart. Their customers will benefit from us growing the team — we plan to double it in the next year and roll out more features at a faster pace.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">global retail e-commerce market</a> is estimated to grow by 50% to $6.3 trillion by 2024, according to Statista. Duda itself has experienced a year over year increase of 265% in e-commerce sites being built on its platform, which Sadan said was what made Snipcart an attractive acquisition to further accelerate and manage its growth that includes over 17,000 customers.</p>
<p>Together, the companies will offer new capabilities, like payment and membership tools inside of the Duda platform. Many of Duda’s customers come with inventory and don’t want to manage it on another e-commerce platform, so Snipcart will be that component for taking their inventory and making it shoppable on the web.</p>
<p>“Everyone is thinking about how to introduce transactions into their websites and web experiences, and that is what we were looking for in an e-commerce platform,” Sadan said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s plan to digitize your wallet is slowly taking shape. What started with boarding passes and venue tickets later became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/apple-introduces-its-own-credit-card-the-apple-card/">credit cards</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/you-can-now-pay-for-bart-using-an-iphone-or-apple-watch/">subway tickets</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-to-a-dozen-more-universities/">student IDs</a>. Next on Apple&#8217;s list to digitize are driver&#8217;s licenses and state IDs, which it plans to support in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/">its iOS 15 update</a> expected out later this year.</p>
<p>But to get there it needs help from state governments, since it&#8217;s the states that issue driver&#8217;s licenses and other forms of state identification, and every state issues IDs differently. Apple said today it has so far secured two states, Arizona and Georgia, to bring digital driver&#8217;s license and state IDs.</p>
<p>Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah are expected to follow, but a timeline for rolling out wasn&#8217;t given.</p>
<p>Apple said in June that it would begin supporting digital licenses and IDs, and that the TSA would be the first agency to begin accepting a digital license from an iPhone at several airports, since only a state ID is required for traveling by air domestically within the United States. The TSA will allow you to present your digital wallet by tapping it on an identity reader. Apple says the feature is secure and doesn&#8217;t require handing over or unlocking your phone.</p>
<p>The digital license and ID data is stored on your iPhone but a driver&#8217;s license must be verified by the participating state. That has to happen at scale and speed to support millions of drivers and travelers while preventing fake IDs from making it through.</p>
<p>The goal of digitizing licenses and IDs is convenience, rather than fixing a problem. But the move hasn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/12/1005624457/apple-iphones-can-soon-hold-your-id-privacy-experts-are-on-edge">exactly drawn confidence</a> from privacy experts, who bemoan Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-wallet-drivers-license-digital-id/">lack of transparency</a> about how it built this technology and what it ultimately gets out of it.</p>
<p>Apple still has not said much about how the digital ID technology works, or what data the state obtains as part of the process to enroll a digital license. Apple is working on a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/ios-15-apple-implementing-security-verification-with-selfies-to-validate-id-cards-in-the-wallet-app/">new security verification</a> feature that takes selfies to validate the user. It&#8217;s not to say these systems aren&#8217;t inherently problematic, but there are privacy questions that Apple will have to address down the line.</p>
<p>But the fragmented picture of digital licenses and IDs across the U.S. isn&#8217;t likely to get less murky overnight, even after Apple enters the picture. A recent public records request <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2021/aug/25/apple-wants-your-new-drivers-license-to-be-an-ipho/?utm_content=buffer42181&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">by MuckRock</a> showed Apple was in contact with some states as early as 2019 about bringing digital licenses and IDs to iPhones, including California and Illinois, yet neither state has been announced by Apple today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21048496-wisconsin-apple-email">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/south-carolina-302/apple-wallet-electronic-drivers-license-department-of-motor-vehicles-113857/#file-950667">South Carolina</a>, and <a href="https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/06/23/06.10.2021_Zagaja_APRA_Request-Responsive_Documents.pdf">Rhode Island</a> are likely further behind, after finding out about Apple&#8217;s digital license plan the very day it was announced at WWDC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is expanding its in-app parental controls feature, Family Pairing, with educational <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/guardians-guide/">resources</a> designed to help parents better support their teenage users, the company announced morning. The pairing feature, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">launched</a> to global users last year, allows parents of teens aged 13 and older to connect their accounts with the child&#8217;s so the parent can set controls related to screen time use, who the teen can direct message, and more. But the company heard from teens that they also want their voices to be heard when it comes to parents&#8217; involvement in their digital life.</p>
<p>To create the new educational content, TikTok partnered with the online safety nonprofit, <a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/">Internet Matters</a>. The organization developed a set of resources in collaboration with teens that aim to offer parents tips about navigating the TikTok landscape and teenage social media usage in general.</p>
<p>Teens said they want parents to understand the rules they&#8217;re setting when they use features like Family Pairing and they want them to be open to having discussions about the time teens spend online. And while teens don&#8217;t mind when parents set boundaries, they also want to feel they&#8217;ve earned some level of trust from the adults in their life.</p>
<p>The older teens get, the more autonomy they want to have on their own device and social networks, as well. They may even tell mom or dad that they don&#8217;t want them to follow them on a given platform.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the teen is up to no good, the new resources explain to parents. The teens just want to feel like they can hang out with their friends online without being so closely monitored. This has become an important part of the online experience today, in the pandemic era, where many younger people are spending more time at home instead of socializing with friends in real-life or participating in other in-person group activities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196866" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196866" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196866" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg 5001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=2048,1070 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Teens said they also want to be able to come to parents when something goes wrong, without fearing that they&#8217;ll be harshly punished or that the parent will panic about the situation. The teens know they&#8217;ll be consequences if they break the rules, but they want parents to work through other tough situations with them and devise solutions together, not just react in anger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All this sounds like straightforward, common sense advice, but parents on TikTok often have varying degrees of comfort with their teens&#8217; digital life and use of social networks. Some basic guidelines that explain what teens want and feel makes sense to include. That said, the parents who are technically savvy enough to enable a parental control feature like Family Pairing may already be clued into best practices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196865" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196865" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2196865" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196865" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, this sort of teen-focused privacy and safety content is also designed to help TikTok better establish itself as a platform working to protect its younger users &#8212; an increasingly necessary stance in light of the potential regulation which big tech has been trying to ahead of, as of late. TikTok, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications/">announced</a> in August it would roll out more privacy protections for younger teens aimed to make the app safer. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">YouTube</a> also did the same.</p>
<p>TikTok says parents or guardians who have currently linked their account to a teen&#8217;s account via the Family Pairing feature will receive a notification that prompts them to find out more about the teens&#8217; suggestions and how to approach those conversations about digital literacy and online safety. Parents who sign up and enable Family Pairing for the first time, will also be guided to the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/guardians-guide/">resources</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Direct to consumer online sales have helped a number of female-focused startups get products to market in recent years &#8212; often pitching better designed and generally more thoughtful feminine hygiene products than mainstream staples.</p>
<p>The lack of innovation in the mainstream market for feminine hygiene has certainly created a gap for startups to address. Examples in recent years include companies like <a href="https://www.shethinx.com">Thinx</a> (absorbent panties for menstruation) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/flex-raises-another-3-million-to-replace-tampons/">Flex</a> (a disc-shaped tampon alternative for wearing during sex). Or Daye &#8212; which makes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/daye/">CBD tampons</a> for simultaneously treating period cramps.</p>
<p>Even so, there still hasn&#8217;t been a critical mass of product innovation in the category &#8212; to the point where alternatives can trickle down (no pun intended) and influence the trajectory of the mainstream market. The core products on shelves are, all too often, depressingly familiar &#8212; disposable pads and tampons &#8212; even if they may (sometimes) now be made of organic cotton or have some other mild design tweaks.</p>
<p>The most notable change to the available product mix is probably period pants &#8212; which have recently started to appear on mainstream shop shelves and seem to be selling well in markets like the UK, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/01/the-rise-of-period-pants-are-they-the-answer-to-menstrual-landfill-and-womens-prayers">Guardian</a> reported recently.</p>
<p>In the average drug store, the other non-disposable alternative you&#8217;ll most likely see is the menstrual cup. Which is not at all new &#8212; but has finally got traction beyond its original (very) niche community of users, which is another signal that consumers are more open to trying different solutions to deal with their monthly bleeding vs the same old throwaway wadding.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_bleeding">free bleeding</a> &#8212; an old movement which has also seen a bit of wider pick up in recent years &#8212; can also be seen, at least in part, as a protest against the poor quality of mainstream products for periods.</p>
<p>All of which makes this forthcoming product launch rather interesting: Meet <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/193289139/lastpad-not-just-another-reusable-menstrual-pad?ref=1ryn31&amp;token=d9479eb7">LastPad</a>, a reusable (rather than disposable) sanitary towel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll likely notice is that the pad is black in color &#8212; which certainly rings the changes vs the usual white stick-on fodder. The company behind LastPad says it worked with an unnamed &#8220;luxury lingerie manufacture&#8221; on look and feel &#8212; and, well, judging by the product shots alone it shows.</p>
<p>The bigger behind-the-scenes change is that it&#8217;s been designed for sustained, repeat usage. So each LastPad comes with its own fabric pouch (in a range of colors) for folding up and storing after use (and until you get a chance to pop it in the wash). The pad can also stay in its pouch for washing so there&#8217;s no need for additional handling until you&#8217;re getting it out of the washing machine to dry.</p>
<p>LastPad is the brainchild of Danish designer and entrepreneur Isabel Aagaard whose company, <a href="https://lastobject.com">LastObject</a>, has &#8212; for the past three years &#8212; been taking aim at the wastefulness of single use hygiene and beauty products, designing reusable alternatives for what are unlovely but practical items &#8212; like Q-Tips and tissues*.</p>
<p>In total, LastObject has sold around 1.5M products so far &#8212; across its existing range of beauty, hygiene and travel-focused items. But LastPad marks its first push into a really female-focused product category.</p>
<p>A reusable (washable) sanitary pad is clearly a big step up on the design challenge front vs making reusable (silicone) Q-Tips or (cotton) tissues or makeup rounds &#8212; because of the complexity involved with designing a wearable, intimate hygiene product that can handle the variable and often messy nature of periods, and keep doing so, use after use.</p>
<p>It needs to be both comfortable and reliable &#8212; as so many disposable pads actually aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not too surprising that, per Aagaard, the company has been working on designing and prototyping LastPad for two years. Now they&#8217;re finally ready to bring it to market &#8212; launching the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/193289139/lastpad-not-just-another-reusable-menstrual-pad?ref=1ryn31&amp;token=d9479eb7">LastPad on Kickstarter</a> today &#8212; with a goal of shipping to early backers next February.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing amazing conversions [for the LastPad pre-campaign],&#8221; she says, discussing how much demand they&#8217;re expecting. &#8220;This is our sixth [crowdfunder] campaign &#8212; and it&#8217;s looking really good. So I think the demand is bigger than I actually imagined. Because this is also the first product that is only women. And we were very much in doubt that we should put it on Kickstarter because it&#8217;s a very male-dominated platform but it&#8217;s looking really positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We already started working on this two years ago so it&#8217;s really been a process. And also because we wanted it to be really innovative. Because right now you can see on the market there&#8217;ll be pads that are more like home sewn or do it yourself &#8212; and we wanted to really make an exclusive, very, very innovative version of that &#8212; that has a lot of the benefits that the single use version has.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196399" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196399" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196399" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg 4186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196399" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: LastPad</p></div></p>
<p>Each LastPad is made up of three layers: A woven top to help keep the pad feeling dry against the skin by quickly funnelling menstrual fluids down into &#8212; layer two &#8212; a central absorbent section (made of bamboo) &#8212; which sits above a TPU base to ensure no risk of leaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first layer is a woven material that is really, really fine &#8212; it has a little bit of silver in it so that the odours will disappear. It&#8217;s also woven with small funnels so that the blood disappears very quickly into the middle layer &#8212; because it&#8217;s so important that you&#8217;re not like wet. Because that&#8217;s awful. So it dries quite quickly when you&#8217;re wearing it,&#8221; explains Aagaard. &#8220;And then the middle layer is 100% bamboo &#8212; it&#8217;s absorbent like crazy; 40% more absorbent than, for example, cotton. And it also has anti-bacterial properties. And then the bottom layer is a TPU [Thermoplastic Polyurethane] &#8212; which is just a leak proof cover; it&#8217;s comfortable, it&#8217;s not like a plastic bag but it does make sure that you cannot bleed through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While disposable sanitary towels rely on an adhesive layer to enable the consumer fix the pad to their panties, LastPad has to do that a bit differently too given it&#8217;ll be going through the wash. So the pads have wings &#8212; which wrap around the gusset of the panties and fix together underneath with a (soft) velcro fastening.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all: There&#8217;s a (sticky) silicone strip running around the back side of the pad which helps prevent it from moving around &#8212; and, per Aagaard, will happily survive repeat washing (in fact if it&#8217;s not used for a time, she says dust may temporarily reduce the stickiness &#8212; but says that immediately resolves just by wetting it again).</p>
<p>&#8220;Where I felt that we really made a huge difference is that on the back side of the pad &#8212; it has wings [with] a velcro [fastener] that&#8217;s completely soft and you don&#8217;t feel it; even if you&#8217;re biking &#8212; that was like the big test &#8212; and then it has a silicone strip in the back and at the bottom, like a sticky silicone&#8230; so it doesn&#8217;t move around in your pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Practically speaking, it won&#8217;t be possible for a LastPad user to use just one LastPad to see them through their period &#8212; given the need to wash and dry them between uses. So a pack of several reusable pads will be necessary to entirely replace disposable pads and ensure there&#8217;s always a clean towel available to swap out the used pad.</p>
<p>But LastObject&#8217;s idea is, much like you own several pairs of socks and briefs, you&#8217;ll have a set of LastPads to see you through until after laundry day.</p>
<p>The product comes in three different sizes and thicknesses to cater to different flow levels, too. So the consumer may end up owning a range of reusable LastPads &#8212; from a panty liner option to a day flow and heavier duty night pads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196407" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196407" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg 4338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196407" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: LastPad</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t as simple as I thought it was going to be &#8212; but that&#8217;s also because you have to understand the viscoses of blood, for example, compared to water,&#8221; Aagaard tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And also a flow &#8212; it&#8217;s not just blood. There&#8217;s a lot of other stuff that come out. So it&#8217;s taking all of these things into consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been testing it for so long,&#8221; she goes on. &#8220;That was our main thing with this product. A lot of the other [LastObject products] were very much about printing it, looking at it. Using it of course &#8212; but it took us long before we had it in actually a silicone form. Because that is also expensive. Whereas [LastPad] we could sew quite quickly just here at the office and [test it]&#8230; So we&#8217;ve just been testing it constantly &#8212; how&#8217;s the feeling? Getting it out to a lot of different women that wear different panties that have different cycles. So it&#8217;s really been about testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pricing for LastPad will be around $60 for three pads &#8212; so around $20 per pad. Which is obviously a lot more expensive than the per unit cost of disposable towels. But LastObject says it will offer packs so if a consumer buys more pads it should shrink the per pad cost a little.</p>
<p>Aagaard says the product has been tested to withstand at least 240 washes &#8212; which she suggests will mean it&#8217;s able to last at least a couple of years, saving likely hundreds of disposable pads from being consumed in its stead.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s maybe less likely to save consumers money &#8212; depending on which disposable pads you&#8217;d buy and how many you&#8217;d used per cycle (basic disposable pads can cost as little as ~20c each) &#8212; as LastObject recommends owning nine of its LastPads which could cost around $80 or more). But the target user is evidently someone with enough disposable income to be able to pay a premium for an eco alternative.</p>
<p>Given the price-point, it does also look more expensive than the menstrual cup &#8212; an existing and highly practical alternative to disposable menstrual products &#8212; which can cost around $30 (for one reusable cup; and you can get away with owning just one) and, typically, a cup will also last for years as it&#8217;s made of silicone.</p>
<p>However the menstrual cup won&#8217;t suit every woman &#8212; and does require access to clean water to rinse and sanitize &#8212; so having more non-disposable alternatives for periods is great.</p>
<p>Aagaard says she&#8217;s a fan of the menstrual cup but suggests LastPad can still be useful for its users as a back-up to catch any leaks and/or provide an added layer of reassurance.</p>
<p>While, with period pants, she says the issue she finds unpleasant is the feeling of wetness when wearing them.</p>
<p>On LastPad&#8217;s environmental credentials, the washing process required to keep reusing the pad does obviously require some resources (water, soap etc) but &#8212; as is the case with other LastObject products &#8212; the company&#8217;s claim is that it&#8217;s still substantially greener to wash and reuse its non-disposable products vs consuming and binning single use items that have to be continually produced and shipped out (generating ongoing CO2). Such products can also pollute the environment after they&#8217;ve been thrown away &#8212; and plastic waste is of course a huge global problem (including from thrown away sanitary products).</p>
<p>LastObject will be publishing a third party LCA (lifecycle assessment) for LastPad to back up its eco claims for the reusable product &#8212; comparing it to using disposable sanitary pads. But Aagaard is confident it will be substantially better when compared against most disposable alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be putting a wash on anyway; [LastPads] don&#8217;t take up that much space; you&#8217;re not going to wash them just them; it is with your other laundry; and if you wash them at a cold wash I think that the LCA report will look really good,&#8221; she suggests when we ask about the eco credentials.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing this with all our products where we&#8217;re taking them through a third party who&#8217;s testing everything and putting them up against [alternatives] and having these considerations with CO2, with water, with chemicals &#8212; with the whole pack&#8230; So we&#8217;ll be doing that more specifically; right now&#8230; the alternative of a [disposable] pad &#8212; they are so differently produced. It&#8217;s crazy. So I could say the worst [for comparative purposes] or I could say the best &#8212; and ours is about 12x better than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we got the LCA report for the LastTissue and LastSwab they were so much better than I have imagined,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>From this year the European Union has started banning the sale of some single use plastic items (such as Q-tips and disposable cutlery) as reducing plastic waste is one of the goals for regional lawmakers. And &#8212; globally &#8212; regulators are increasingly looking for quick wins to shrink the environmental impact of the fast moving consumer goods market&#8217;s long standing love affair with plastic.</p>
<p>But some disposable product categories are simply more essential than others &#8212; which makes it hard for lawmakers to just ban plenty of wasteful, polluting products. So developing innovative, reusable alternatives is one way to help lighten the usage load.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most sustainable pad that you can ever have is actually the one that you don&#8217;t produce but that would just be free bleeding &#8212; and I think that 99% of women are not ready for that,&#8221; adds Aagaard. &#8220;So can we make some solutions on some of the things that we actually have to take care of?&#8221;</p>
<p>While LastObject is sticking with Kickstarter to get LastPad to market, Aagaard confirms that once they see how much early adopter demand it&#8217;s getting they plan to produce enough to also sell via some of the other outlets where they currently sell their products &#8212; such as ecommerce sites like Amazon and of course their own web shop.</p>
<p>So far, the US has been the main market for LastObject&#8217;s reusable wares, per Aagaard &#8212; which she attributes to mostly using Kickstarter to build a community of users. But she adds that the company is starting to see more traction in Europe as it&#8217;s increased the number of regional distributors it works with.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for the company after LastPad? The product direction they&#8217;ll take is an active discussion, she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can keep going the beauty way, we can go more personal care but we have to also [not] go in too many directions. I personally have a lot of fun things I want to do in the bathroom still, because I feel like it&#8217;s a space where not a lot of designers have actually really been investigating some of the products that we&#8217;re using. Both in beauty but also in personal care. Like in the floss and toothbrush but also in diapers and wipes and all of that. So I think that there&#8217;s some innovation that could be really fun. But&#8230; this one took two years and I&#8217;m so happy about the result and I couldn&#8217;t have spent two months less on it. Then we wouldn&#8217;t have had the solutions that we&#8217;ve gotten to. So that feels very important.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>*Washable tissues are also of course not new. Indeed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief">Wikipedia</a> credits the invention of pocket squares to wipe the nose to King Richard II of England who reigned in the 14th century. But the traditional (fabric) handkerchief &#8212; which was used, laundered and reused &#8212; became yet another casualty of the switch to single-use, disposable, cheap consumer goods that&#8217;s since been shown to have such high environmental costs. So perhaps reversing this damaging default will bring more &#8216;historical product innovation&#8217; back into fashion as societies look to apply a modern &#8216;circular economy&#8217; lens </em></p>
