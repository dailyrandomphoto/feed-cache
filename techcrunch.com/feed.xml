<p>Fortunately, as one talented AirTag owner has found, that&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t fix with a heat gun, a bit of soldering and an understanding that you could totally fry your shiny new AirTag in the blink of an eye. Oh, and a 3D printer.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rHyAAkf5tE">Andrew Ngai</a> realized that much of AirTag&#8217;s thickness came from its PCB and its battery being stacked atop each other, he set out to instead arrange them side-by-side. With the help of some <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50145/airtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks">iFixit guides</a> (which, by the way, provide an awesome peek inside the AirTag if you&#8217;re curious what&#8217;s in there but aren&#8217;t looking to dissect one yourself), Andrew tore the AirTag down to its key components. After making sure everything still worked in its freshly disassembled state, he 3D printed a new case, soldered in wires to connect the board to the battery at a distance, and put everything back together. Success! And he did it all within just days of AirTag being released.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While this sort of project requires a pretty broad set of skills to pull off, Andrew has kindly handled one of the steps for anyone looking to take it on: he&#8217;s uploaded the STL file for the 3D-printed card holder as a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4850601">free download on Thingiverse</a>. <em>(Or you could, of course, just buy a Tile Slim. But that doesn&#8217;t involve soldering irons and 3D printing, so where&#8217;s the fun in that?)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728">confirmed earlier reports</a> that it’s testing a new Tip Jar feature. The new addition utilizes a number of different payment platforms, including PayPal, Venmo, Patreon, Cash App and Bandcamp (all region-dependent).</p>
<p>“Tip Jar is an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation on Twitter,” the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html">wrote in a blog post</a> confirming the news. “This is a first step in our work to create new ways for people to receive and show support on Twitter &#8212; with money.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148697" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148697" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148697 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spaces_Tipping_From_Profile_English_V5.gif" alt="" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148697" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Image Credits:</a> Twitter</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently available on both iOS and Android, the feature is designed to give users a way to quickly tip creators with a few taps. Tip Jar is beginning to roll out to select groups of users, including nonprofits, journalists, experts and creators. The company has further plans to roll it out to additional groups and languages.</p>
<p>For now, those using Twitter in English will be able to send a tip. Those profiles that have enabled it will show the Tip Jar icon on their profile page to the left of the Follow button. Hitting that will show a list of the aforementioned third-party money transfer apps. The opt-in feature will pop up in the mobile app, letting qualified users choose which payment platforms they&#8217;ll accept.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, Android users will be able to send money via Twitter’s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces. The company says it won’t be taking a percentage of those transactions.</p>
<p>The feature comes as the service looks to become a more well-rounded content-creation platform. In addition to the audio feature, Spaces (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">saw a much wider roll out</a>), Twitter has also been looking to take on the likes of Substack with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">its own newsletter-style offering</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">David Swensen, among the most highly regarded money managers in the world after growing Yale’s endowment from $1 billion when he joined as a 31-year-old former grad student of the school, to the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/10-universities-with-the-biggest-endowments">second-largest</a> school endowment in the country after Harvard, has passed away at age 67. The cause was cancer, which Swensen had been battling since first being diagnosed in 2012.</p>
<p>The news is likely sending shockwaves and sadness throughout endowment offices, many of which closely followed the moves of Swensen, who famously pulled the school into non-traditional asset classes like hedge funds, private equity, venture funds and real estate.</p>
<p>Many endowment heads learned from working with him directly, in fact. As a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-swensen-yale-endowment-chief-who-changed-the-course-of-institutional-investing-dies-at-67-11620305438?mod=hp_lead_pos11">WSJ piece</a> about his death notes, Princeton&#8217;s endowment chief for the past 26 years, Andrew Golden, spent five years as a senior associate in Yale&#8217;s investment office in the 1980s, yet it helped him form a blueprint for his career. As he told the outlet in 2017, &#8220;90% of my good ideas on how to organize the office and develop a culture I’ve stolen from Yale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania, Bowdoin College, Wesleyan University and MIT also recruited Swensen protégés over the years. Robert Wallace, who has headed up the Stanford Management Company since 2015, is another former Yale investment manager.</p>
<p>As wealth management recruiter <a href="https://www.davidbarrettpartners.com/">David Barrett</a> told the WSJ in 2015, when hiring an investment chief, wealthy universities often asked the same question, which was: &#8220;Is there anyone at Yale?&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Even as he battled cancer, Swensen was pushing Yale forward in new directions. In 2018, despite, or because of, extreme volatility in the world of cryptocurrencies, he approved investments in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/yale-investment-chief-david-swensen-jumps-into-crypto-with-bets-on-two-silicon-valley-funds.html">two then-new crypto funds</a>: the inaugural crypto fund of Andreessen Horowitz and the debut fund of Paradigm, co-founded by the co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang. Yale was among the first schools of its stature to make such a bet.</p>
<p>In a separate but meaningful decision that&#8217;s expected to have lasting impact on the broader industry, Swensen last fall told the firms that manage Yale&#8217;s money that they risked losing the school&#8217;s backing if they didn&#8217;t hire more women and minorities into their ranks &#8212; and keep them there.</p>
<p>It was a decision that was years in the making, Swensen suggested, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yales-david-swensen-puts-money-managers-on-notice-about-diversity-11603450800">telling the Journal</a> that he&#8217;d held off on any kind of systematic effort relating to diversity because he long believed there existed an insufficient pipeline of diverse candidates; he said the Black Lives Matter movement helped him to recognize that far more needed to be done &#8212; and that Yale could do nothing or that it could be part of the solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of the 22 million comments submitted to the FCC regarding 2017&#8217;s controversial rollback of net neutrality, some 18 million were fake, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-issues-report-detailing-millions-fake-comments-revealing">an investigation by the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office has found</a>. The broadband industry funded the fraudulent creation of about 8.5 million of those, while a 19-year-old college student submitted 7.7 million, and the remainder came from unknown but spurious sources.</p>
<p>The damning report, issued today, is the result of years of work; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/new-yorks-attorney-general-sets-up-a-page-to-report-fraudulent-fcc-comments/">it set up a tip line</a> early on so people could report fraudulent comments, and no doubt received plenty, as people were already independently finding themselves, dead relatives and other obviously fake submissions among the record.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jatRF2FdeI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/18/more-dead-commenters-appear-to-come-out-against-net-neutrality/">More dead commenters appear to come out against net neutrality</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More dead commenters appear to come out against net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/18/more-dead-commenters-appear-to-come-out-against-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=jatRF2FdeI" data-secret="jatRF2FdeI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It turns out that a huge number of these comments were paid for by a consortium of broadband companies called Broadband for America, which laid out about $4.2 million for the purpose. They contracted with several &#8220;lead generator&#8221; companies, the kind of shady operations that offer you free trials of &#8220;male enhancement pills&#8221; or the like if you fill out a form — in this case, asking the person to write an anti-net-neutrality comment.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, the lead-generation companies didn&#8217;t even bother plying their shady trade in what passes for an honest way; instead they fabricated the lists and comments with years-old data and, in one case, with identities stolen in a major data breach. The practice was near universal:</p>
<blockquote><p>In all, six lead generators funded by the broadband industry engaged in fraud. As a result, nearly every comment and message the broadband industry submitted to the FCC and Congress was fake, signed using the names and addresses of millions of individuals without their knowledge or consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The broadband companies are off the hook on a technicality, since they were careful to firewall themselves from the practices of those they were contracting with, even though the record shows it was plain that the information being collected and used was fraudulent. But because the actions were, ostensibly, independently taken by the enterprising lead generators, the buck stops there.</p>

<p>Notably, these scams were also involved in more than a hundred other advocacy campaigns, including submitting over a million fake comments for an EPA proceeding and millions of other letters and digital comments.</p>
<p>The wholesale undermining of the processes of government earned fines of $3.7 million, $550,000 and $150,000 for Fluent Inc., React2Media and Opt-Intelligence, respectively. There are also &#8220;comprehensive reforms&#8221; imposed on them, though it may be best not to expect much from those.</p>
<p>Internet rights advocacy organization Fight for the Future <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2021-05-06-fight-for-the-future-group-who-originally-exposed/">issued a king-size &#8220;I told you so&#8221;</a> noting that they had flagged this process at the time and helped bring it to the attention of both government officials and ordinary folks.</p>
<p>Another 7.7 million fake comments were submitted by a single person, a California college student who simply combined a fake name generation site with disposable email service to provide plausible identities. The person automated an individual comment submission process, and somehow the FCC&#8217;s systems didn&#8217;t flag it. Another unknown person used similar means to submit another 1.6 million fake comments.</p>

<p>Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that &#8220;Today’s report demonstrates how the record informing the FCC’s net neutrality repeal was flooded with fraud. This was troubling at the time because even then the widespread problems with the record were apparent. We have to learn from these lessons and improve because the public deserves an open and fair opportunity to tell Washington what they think about the policies that affect their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, at the time, Rosenworcel<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/schneiderman-delay-fcc-vote/"> suggested delaying the vote</a>, joining many in the country who felt the scale of the shenanigans warranted further investigation — but then-Chairman Ajit Pai brushed aside their concerns, one of many decisions that have considerably tarnished his legacy.</p>
<p>Altogether it&#8217;s a pretty sad situation, and the broadband companies and their lobbyists get off without so much as a slap on the wrist. The NY AG report has a variety of recommendations, some of which no doubt have already been implemented or suggested as the FCC&#8217;s comment debacle became clear, but the bad guys definitely won this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital launch company Virgin Orbit has scheduled its next mission to space.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit will be returning its LauncherOne rocket to orbit in June to deliver payloads for the U.S. Department of Defense Space Test Program, SatRevolution and the Royal Netherlands Air Force.</p>
<p>The manifest includes three CubeSat satellites as part of the DoD’s Rapid Agile Launch Initiative; a CubeSat satellite called BRIK II, Norway’s first military satellite to go to space; and two optical imaging satellites from SatRevolution for Earth observation. DoD awarded the launch to Virgin Orbit&#8217;s defense-focused subsidiary VOX Space last April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LauncherOne will take its payload to a target orbit of around 310 miles above Earth.</p>
<p>This will be LauncherOne’s first take-off since a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/virgin-orbit-reaches-orbit-for-the-first-time/">demonstration mission in January</a>, during which the LauncherOne carried satellites to low Earth orbit on behalf of NASA. That most recent demonstration was the first time Virgin Orbit proved that its unique hybrid aircraft/orbital rocket system actually works. The first try, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/virgin-orbits-first-orbital-test-flight-cut-short-after-rocket-released-from-carrier-aircraft/">which took place in May</a> of last year, ended after the rocket initiated an automatic safety shutdown after detaching from the Boeing 747 that takes it to launch altitude.</p>

<p>The mission will be conducted from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California on a yet-to-be-announced date in June. The rocket will be shipped out to the Mojave site “in the coming days” for prelaunch operations, the company said. Virgin Orbit will offer a public livestream of the mission on its website.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit is part of a small cohort of private orbital launch companies that have actually sent payloads to space. As opposed to providers like SpaceX, which uses massive rockets similar to legacy designs from agencies like NASA, LauncherOne is essentially a 747 that’s been retrofitted with a rocket. Besides being smaller and able to take off from traditional airplane runways, the 747 saves on costs by being completely reusable.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit was spun out of Virgin Galactic in 2017, with the latter focusing exclusively on commercial human spaceflight services. In homage to its beginnings as a humble record company, the mission has been christened “Tubular Bells, Part One,” so named after the first track on the first album ever released by Virgin Records.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio has chosen Norway — an EV hotspot — for its first foray into international markets. Nio Norway will offer a European version of ES8, Nio&#8217;s flagship electric SUV, to Norwegian customers from September this year. The ET7 sedan will follow in 2022.</p>
<p>“The decision to have Norway as our first destination overseas is backed by long-term thinking,” Nio founder William Li explained at an event Thursday. “Norway is the most EV-friendly company.” Among the European countries, Norway is the biggest adopter of battery electric vehicles. The company&#8217;s relationship with Norway stretches back to 2018 when Norges Bank, the country&#8217;s sovereign fund, gave the automaker “critical support” during its initial public offering, Li said at the event. Nio signed a strategic partnership agreement with the Norwegian EV Association, also in 2018.</p>
<p>That high EV adoption rate also means Nio will be making its pitch to a growing consumer base of savvy EV owners. In Norway, Nio will face competition from Chinese automakers like XPeng, international rivals Tesla and European automakers such as Volkswagen and Audi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to vehicle sales, the company also detailed plans to open dedicated service centers, vehicle charging stations and its Nio Power Swap battery swapping stations in Norway. The company aims to build four battery swapping stations around Oslo by the end of 2021, with additional swapping stations coming to the Norwegian cities Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger and Kristiansand in 2022. Nio&#8217;s Norway team is composed of around 15 people, but that number is expected to grow to around 50 by the end of 2021, according to the company.</p>
<p>The Chinese automaker has had a slow start since its founding in 2014, but started gaining ground in the second half of 2020 through the latest quarter. Nio <a href="https://ir.nio.com/node/8156/pdf">reported deliveries</a> of 20,060 vehicles in the first quarter, a 422.7% jump from the same period last year when COVID-19 was busy upending the economy on a global scale. Sales in the first quarter of 2021 were also 15.6% higher from the fourth quarter. It has delivered 102,000 vehicles to date. These deliveries helped the company increase its vehicle sales by 489% compared to the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>Still, Nio is losing money, albeit the gap between revenues and net loss continues to narrow.</p>
<p>The boost in sales was likely due in part to the January debut of the ET7, its flagship electric sedan and the first vehicle model to be fitted with its so-called &#8220;Nio Autonomous Driving&#8221; software. The company has been an outlier when it comes to charging, adopting a battery-swap option in addition to traditional plug and charge stations. Nio has already completed more than 2.4 million swaps for Chinese users, Li said &#8212; a number that’s growing by 10,000 every day. Last August, the company also debuted its “battery-as-a-service” purchasing option, which allows drivers to lease the battery from the company and only purchase the vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Months after Apple&#8217;s App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">introduced privacy labels for apps</a>, Google announced its own mobile app marketplace, Google Play, will follow suit. The company today <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announced its plans</a> to introduce a new &#8220;safety&#8221; section in Google Play, rolling out next year, which will require app developers to share what sort of data their apps collect, how it&#8217;s stored and how it&#8217;s used.</p>
<p>For example, developers will need to share what sort of personal information their apps collect, like users&#8217; names or emails, and whether it collects information from the phone, like the user&#8217;s precise location, their media files or contacts. Apps will also need to explain how the app uses that information &#8212; for example, for enhancing the app&#8217;s functionality or for personalization purposes.</p>
<p>Developers who already adhere to specific security and privacy practices will additionally be able to highlight that in their app listing. On this front, Google says it will add new elements that detail whether the app uses security practices like data encryption; if the app follows Google&#8217;s<a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families"> Families policy</a>, related to child safety; if the app&#8217;s safety section has been verified by an independent third party; whether the app needs data to function or allows users to choose whether or not to share data; and whether the developer agrees to delete user data when a user uninstalls the app in question.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps will also be required to provide their privacy policies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lzL5O3fQlh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/building-customer-first-relationships-in-a-privacy-first-world-is-critical/">Building customer-first relationships in a privacy-first world is critical</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Building customer-first relationships in a privacy-first world is critical&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/building-customer-first-relationships-in-a-privacy-first-world-is-critical/embed/#?secret=lzL5O3fQlh" data-secret="lzL5O3fQlh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While clearly inspired by Apple&#8217;s privacy labels, there are several key differences. Apple&#8217;s labels focus on what data is being collected for tracking purposes and what&#8217;s linked to the end user. Google&#8217;s additions seem to be more about whether or not you can <em>trust</em> the data being collected is being handled responsibility, by allowing the developer to showcase if they follow best practices around data security, for instance. It also gives the developer a way to make a case for why it&#8217;s collecting data right on the listing page itself. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s &#8220;ask to track&#8221; pop-ups on iOS</a> now force developers to beg inside their apps for access user data.)</p>
<p>Another interesting addition is that Google will allow the app data labels to be independently verified. Assuming these verifications are handled by trusted names, they could help to convey to users that the disclosures aren&#8217;t lies. One early criticism of Apple&#8217;s privacy labels was that many were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/">providing inaccurate information</a> &#8212; and were getting away with it, too.</p>
<p>Google says the new features will not roll out until Q2 2022, but it wanted to announce now in order to give developers plenty of time to prepare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148631" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=1536,809 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>There is, of course, a lot of irony to be found in an app privacy announcement from Google.</p>
<p>The company was one of the longest holdouts on issuing privacy labels for its own iOS apps, as it scrambled to review (and re-review, we understand) the labels&#8217; content and disclosures. After initially claiming its labels would roll out &#8220;soon,&#8221; many of Google&#8217;s top apps then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/google-restarts-updates-for-some-ios-apps-after-long-pause-triggered-by-lack-of-privacy-labels/">entered a lengthy period where they received no updates at all</a>, as they were no longer compliant with App Store policies.</p>
<p>It took Google months after the deadline had passed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/google-apps-privacy-label-updates/">provide labels for its top apps</a>. And when it did, it was mocked by critics &#8212; like <a href="https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1371509053613084679">privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo</a> &#8212; for how much data apps like Chrome and the Google app collect.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s plan to add a safety section of its own to Google Play gives it a chance to shift the narrative a bit.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a privacy push, necessarily. They&#8217;re not even called privacy labels! Instead, the changes seem designed to allow app developers to better explain if you can trust their app with your data, rather than setting the expectation that the app should not be collecting data in the first place.</p>
<p>How well this will resonate with consumers remains to be seen. Apple has made a solid case that it&#8217;s a company that cares about user privacy, and is adding features that put users in control of their data. It&#8217;s a hard argument to fight back against &#8212; especially in an era that&#8217;s seen too many data breaches to count, careless handling of private data by tech giants, widespread government spying and a creepy adtech industry that grew to feel entitled to user data collection without disclosure.</p>
<p>Google says when the changes roll out, non-compliant apps will be required to fix their violations or become subject to policy enforcement. It hasn&#8217;t yet detailed how that process will be handled, or whether it will pause app updates for apps in violation.</p>
<p>The company noted its own apps would be required to share this same information and a privacy policy, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield is one of the most popular parts of our annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt conference</a> which is happening on September 21-23 this year. Now we&#8217;re very excited to reveal one of the fine people who will be judging Startup Battlefield at this year&#8217;s all-virtual event in September: Shauntel Garvey, a general partner at Reach Capital, a VC specializing in the world of education technology.</p>
<p>Startup Battlefield sees startups applying far and wide for a chance to pitch their ideas to a panel, and to all of us in the audience, giving the finalists a lot of exposure and a shot at winning the grand prize of $50,000. Startups: You can <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply to be a part of the action here</a>.</p>
<p>Edtech has seen a huge surge of interest in the last year of pandemic living, and that&#8217;s led to a pretty notable rise in education startups, more funding for education technology and a lot more attention paid to voices in edtech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because not only is edtech of huge importance to society and our economy, but those in the field have picked up a lot of learnings that apply well outside of edtech.</p>
<p>They know firsthand about engagement and how to get it; connecting with larger ecosystems of stakeholders; learning to work with public and private bodies; and the ins and outs of tapping into the latest innovations in areas like streaming, artificial intelligence and graphics to get the most out of a concept.</p>
<p>All of this makes Garvey a great person to have as a judge, someone with specific-area knowledge but very aware of how it relates to the wider challenges and opportunities in tech.</p>
<p>Garvey is a co-founder and general partner at Reach Capital, a Silicon Valley VC focused on the wider opportunity within the educational spectrum, backing the likes of ClassDojo, Springboard, Outschool, Handshake, Winnie and <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more</a>. Garvey herself currently sits on the boards of Riipen, FourthRev, Holberton School and Ellevation Education.</p>
<p>Her experience in edtech extends back years. Before Reach, she was a partner at the NewSchools Seed Fund and she has invested in more than 40 early-stage edtech companies, including Newsela, Nearpod and SchoolMint. She is also not all about edtech: Before turning to education and startups, Garvey trained and worked as a chemical engineer. We&#8217;re really looking forward to her input as a Startup Battlefield judge.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t gotten your tickets yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> is coming up around the corner, September 21-23. This will be our second year of having the conference in an all-virtual format, and we have a lot of great speakers, networking opportunities and other things planned &#8212; free of physical constraints, we can fly! &#8212; and we really hope you&#8217;ll join us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chromebooks have been having banner quarter after banner quarter for the past year. While PC and tablet sales in general have been doing well as people shifted to remote working and learning, Google’s operating system has been leading the charge, in terms of the growth. That’s due in large part to the company’s wins in education.</p>
<p>With an extremely solid foothold in that category, Google is pushing to make a big play in enterprise &#8212; a category traditionally dominated by Microsoft (and, to a lesser degree, Apple). Today the company is announcing the launch of a new series of docks as part of the Works With Chromebook certification program it launched last year.</p>
<p>Launch partners including Targus, Belkin, Acer and Hyper. The hope is pretty clear: making the traditionally limited hardware more capable for a work setting. There are two different types of docks &#8212; one designed for remote working and the other for office/enterprise. Per Google:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Employees can benefit from two types of docks: larger docks capable of extending up to 3 external displays via HDMI, DP or USB-C, and smaller docks that extend to one external HDMI display for those in need of a more compact, travel-friendly docking solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>More details are forthcoming from the third parties, which will be releasing the devices “in the coming months.” The Hyper system (pictured at top of the post), for instance, launches in August for $240, which put it around as much as some Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Among the upshots are the fact that these will also be compatible with PCs and Macs, to some degree &#8212; an upshot for enterprise buyers.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Which disease results in the highest total economic burden per annum? If you guessed diabetes, cancer, heart disease or even obesity, you guessed wrong. Reaching a mammoth financial burden of <a href="https://everylifefoundation.org/burden-study/">$966 billion</a> in 2019, the cost of rare diseases far outpaced diabetes ($327 billion), cancer ($174 billion), heart disease ($214 billion) and other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Cognitive intelligence, or cognitive computing solutions, blend artificial intelligence technologies like neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing, and are able to mimic human intelligence.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that rare diseases didn’t come to mind. By definition, a rare disease affects fewer than 200,000 people. However, collectively, there are thousands of rare diseases and those affect around 400 million people worldwide. About half of rare disease patients are children, and the typical patient, young or old, weather a diagnostic odyssey lasting five years or more during which they undergo countless tests and see numerous specialists before ultimately receiving a diagnosis.</p>
<h2>No longer a moonshot challenge</h2>
<p>Shortening that diagnostic odyssey and reducing the associated costs was, until recently, a moonshot challenge, but is now within reach. About 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and technology and AI advances are combining to make genetic testing widely accessible.</p>
<p>Whole-genome sequencing, an advanced genetic test that allows us to examine the entire human DNA, now costs under $1,000, and market leader Illumina is targeting a $100 genome in the near future.</p>
<p>The remaining challenge is interpreting that data in the context of human health, which is not a trivial challenge. The typical human contains 5 million unique genetic variants and of those we need to identify a single disease-causing variant. Recent advances in cognitive AI allow us to interrogate a person’s whole genome sequence and identify disease-causing mechanisms automatically, augmenting human capacity.</p>
<h2>A shift from narrow to cognitive AI</h2>
<p>The path to a broadly usable AI solution required a paradigm shift from narrow to broader machine learning models. Scientists interpreting genomic data review thousands of data points, collected from different sources, in different formats.</p>
<p>An analysis of a human genome can take as long as eight hours, and there are only a few thousand qualified scientists worldwide. When we reach the $100 genome, analysts are expecting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml9QdqtHHk8">50 million-60 million people</a> will have their DNA sequenced every year. How will we analyze the data generated in the context of their health? That’s where cognitive intelligence comes in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you ask Nik Bonaddio why he wanted to build a new mobile trivia app, his answer is simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my life, I&#8217;ve got very few true passions: I love trivia and I love sports,&#8221; Bonaddio told me. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already started a sports company, so I&#8217;ve got to start a trivia company.&#8221;</p>
<p>He isn&#8217;t kidding about either part of the equation. Bonaddio actually <a href="https://millionaire.fandom.com/wiki/Nik_Bonaddio">won $100,000 on &#8220;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&#8221;</a>, which he used to start the sports analytics company numberFire (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/19/fanduel-acquires-numberfire/">acquired by FanDuel in 2014</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And today, after a period of beta testing, Bonaddio is launching <a href="https://playbigbrain.com">BigBrain</a>. He&#8217;s also announcing that the startup has raised $4.5 million in seed funding from FirstRound Capital, Box Group, Ludlow Ventures, Golden Ventures and others.</p>
<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t mention mobile trivia without thinking of HQ Trivia, the trivia app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/hq-trivia-shuts-down/">shut down last year</a> after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/14/trivia-game-of-thrones/"> some high-profile drama</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/15/hq-trivia-shut-down-final-show/">a spectacular final episode</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146436" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146436" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2146436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg?w=314" alt="BigBrain" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Question.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146436" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BigBrain</p></div></p>
<p>But Bonaddio said BigBrain is approaching things differently than HQ in a few key ways. For starters, although there will be a handful of free games, the majority will require users to pay to enter, with the cash rewards coming from the entry fees. (From a legal perspective, Bonaddio said this is distinct from gambling because trivia is recognized as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dc643bdd6fb34f5c886e6cf35657824d">a game of skill</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The free-to-play model doesn&#8217;t really work for trivia,&#8221; he argued.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2nwENfQeiX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/how-thor-fridrikssons-trivia-royale-earned-2-5m-downloads-in-3-weeks/">How Thor Fridriksson&#8217;s &#8216;Trivia Royale&#8217; earned 2.5M downloads in 3 weeks</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Thor Fridriksson&#8217;s &#8216;Trivia Royale&#8217; earned 2.5M downloads in 3 weeks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/how-thor-fridrikssons-trivia-royale-earned-2-5m-downloads-in-3-weeks/embed/#?secret=2nwENfQeiX" data-secret="2nwENfQeiX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition, there will be no live video with a live host — Bonaddio said this would be &#8220;very, very difficult from a technical perspective and very cost ineffective.&#8221; Instead, he claimed the company has found a middle ground: &#8220;We have photos, we have different interactive elements, it&#8217;s not just a straight multiple choice quiz. We do try to keep it interactive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, the simpler production means that where HQ was only hosting two quizzes a day, BigBrain will be hosting 20, with quizzes every 15 minutes at peak times.</p>
<p>Topics will range from old-school hip hop to college football to &#8217;90s movies, and Bonaddio said different quizzes will have different prize structures — some might be winner take all, while others might award prizes to the top 50% of participants. The average quiz will cost $2 to $3 to enter, but prices will range from free to &#8220;$20 or even $50.&#8221;</p>
<p>What kind of quiz might cost that much money to enter? As an example, Bonaddio said that in a survey of potential users, he found, &#8220;There are no casual &#8216;Rick and Morty&#8217; fans &#8230; They&#8217;re almost completely price sensitive, and since they&#8217;ve seen every episode, they can&#8217;t fathom a world where someone knows more about &#8216;Rick and Morty&#8217; than they do.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As the COVID-19 lockdowns cascaded around the world last spring, companies large and small saw demand slow to a halt seemingly overnight. Enterprises weren’t comfortable making big, long-term commitments when they had no clue what the future would hold.</p>
<p>Innovative SaaS companies responded quickly by making their products available for free or at a steep discount to boost demand.</p>
<p>While Zoom gets all the attention, there were <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/347840">hundreds of free SaaS tools</a> to help folks through the pandemic. Pluralsight ran a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/news/stay-home-skill-up-for-free">#FreeApril</a> campaign, offering free access to its platform for all of April. Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-teams-free-for-small-businesses-during-coronavirus-emergency/">made its Teams product free</a> from March until September 1, 2020. GitHub went <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-14-github-is-now-free-for-teams/">free for teams</a> in April and slashed the price of its paid Team plan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148169" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148169" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2148169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphic-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148169" class="wp-caption-text">A selection of new free, free trial and low-priced offerings from leading SaaS companies. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kyle Poyar/OpenView.</p></div></p>
<p>The free products were aimed squarely at <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth/">end users</a> — whether it be a developer, individual marketer, sales rep or someone else at the edge of an organization. These end users were stuck at home during the pandemic, yet they desperately needed software to power their working lives.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			End users prefer to do the vast majority of their research online before ever talking to a sales rep, making free products the ideal way to reach them.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>End users prefer to do the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey">vast majority</a> of their research online before ever talking to a sales rep, making free products the ideal way to reach them. Many end users want to jump straight into a product, no hassle or credit card or budget approval required.</p>
<p>After they’ve set up an account and customized it for their workflow, end users have essentially already made a purchase decision with their time — all without ever feeling like they were in an active buying cycle.</p>
<p>An end user-focused free offering became an essential SaaS survival strategy in 2020.</p>
<p>But these free offerings didn’t go away as lockdowns loosened up. SaaS companies instead doubled down on freemium because they realized that doing so had a real and positive impact on their business. In doing so, they busted the outdated myths that have held <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2019-expansion-saas-benchmarks/">82% of SaaS companies</a> back from offering their own free plan.</p>
<h2>Myth: A free offering will cannibalize paying customers</h2>
<p>GoDaddy is a digital behemoth, known for being a ’90s-era pioneer in web domains as well as for their controversial Super Bowl ads. The company has steadily diversified into business software, now generating roughly $700 million in ARR from its business applications segment and reaching millions of paying customers. There are very few businesses that would see greater potential revenue cannibalization from launching a free product than GoDaddy.</p>
<p>But GoDaddy didn’t let fear stop them from testing freemium when lockdowns set in. Freemium started out as a small-scale experiment in spring 2020 for the websites and marketing product. GoDaddy has since <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/406380394/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/GDDY-Q420-Earnings.pdf">increased the experiment</a> to 50% of U.S. website traffic, with plans to scale to 100% of U.S. traffic and open availability to other markets in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://metafy.gg/">Metafy</a>, a distributed startup building a marketplace to match gamers with instructors, announced that it has closed an additional $5.5 million to its $3.15 million seed round. Call it a seed-2, seed-extension or merely a baby Series A; <a href="https://www.forerunnerventures.com/">Forerunner Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.dcm.com/">DCM</a> and <a href="https://www.sevensevensix.com/">Seven Seven Six</a> led the round as a trio.</p>
<p>Metafy&#8217;s model is catching on with its market. According to its CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/joshfabian?lang=en">Josh Fabian</a>, the company has grown from incorporation to gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $76,000 in around nine months. That&#8217;s quick.</p>
<p>The startup is building in public, so we have its raw data to share. Via Fabian, here&#8217;s how Metafy has grown since its birth:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148513" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148513" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148513" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="450" height="449" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=768,767 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/metafy.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148513" class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshFabian/status/1389245190184087554/photo/1">the company</a>. As a small tip, if you want the media to care about your startup&#8217;s growth rate, share like this!</p></div></p>
<p>When TechCrunch first caught wind of Metafy via <a href="https://m25vc.com/">prior seed investor M25</a>, we presumed that it was a marketplace that was built to allow esports pros and other highly capable gamers teach esports-hopefuls get better at their chosen title. That&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think of Metafy as a marketplace where you can hire a former professional League of Legends player to help improve your laning-phase AD carry mechanics. Though that might come in time. Today a full 0% of the company&#8217;s current GMV comes from esports titles. Instead, the company is pursuing games with strong niche followings, what Fabian described as &#8220;vibrant, loyal communities.&#8221; Like Super Smash Brothers, its leading game today in terms of GMV generated.</p>
<p>Why pursue those titles instead of the most competitive games? Metafy&#8217;s CEO explained that his startup has a particular take on its market &#8212; that it focuses on coaches as its core customer, over trainees. This allows the startup to focus on its mission of making coaching a full-time gig, or at least one that pays well enough to matter. By doing so, Metafy has cut its need for marketing spend, because the coaches that it onboards bring their own audience. This is where the company is targeting games with super-dedicated user bases, like Smash. They fit well into its <em>build for coaches, onboard coaches, coaches bring their fans, GMV is generated</em> model.</p>
<p>Metafy has big plans, which brings us back to its recent raise. Fabian told TechCrunch any game with a skill curve could wind up on Metafy. Think chess, poker or other games that can be played digitally. To build toward that future, Metafy decided to take on more capital so that it could grow its team.</p>
<p>So what does its $5.5 million unlock for the startup? Per its CEO, Metafy is currently a team of 18 with a monthly burn rate of around $80,000. He wants it to grow to 30 folks, with nearly all of its new hires going into its product org, broadly.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s perspective is that gaming is not becoming mainstream, but that it has already done so. Building for the gaming world, then, makes good sense, as tools like Metafy won&#8217;t suffer from the same boom/bust cycles that can plague game developers. Especially as the startup becomes more diversified in its title base.</p>
<p>Normally we&#8217;d close by noting that we&#8217;ll get back in touch with the company in a few quarters to see how it&#8217;s getting on in growth terms. But because it&#8217;s sharing that data publicly, we&#8217;ll simply keep reading. More when we have a few months&#8217; more data to chew on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is expanding its integrations with third-party apps. The company today announced the launch of two new tool sets for app developers, the TikTok Login Kit and Sound Kit, that will allow apps on mobile, web and consoles to authenticate users via their TikTok credentials, build experiences that leverage users&#8217; TikTok videos and share music and sounds back to TikTok from their own apps.</p>
<p>The company already offers tools that allow app developers to share content, including both pictures and videos, back to TikTok. But the new kits &#8212; or, SDKs (software development kits) &#8212; expand upon that functionality to make TikTok not just a destination for sharing, but a more deeply integrated part of the third-party app experience.</p>
<p>For starters, the new Login Kit allows an app&#8217;s users to sign in quickly using their TikTok log-in credentials, similar to other social log-ins offered by Facebook or Snap. Once signed in, users can then access their TikTok videos in the third-party app, potentially fueling entire new app ecosystems with TikTok content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2148156" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148156" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148156 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg 5001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148156" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>For example, a video dating app called <a href="https://www.thesnackapp.com/">Snack</a> is using the Login Kit to allow users to share their TikTok videos on their dating profiles to help them find new matches. The game recording app <a href="https://medal.tv/">Medal</a> will allow users to share their TikTok videos with their fellow gamers. And Singapore-based <a href="https://www.burpple.com/sg">Burpple</a> lets users share their food and dining reviews with a community.</p>
<p>Other early adopters of the Login Kit include gaming clips app <a href="https://allstar.gg/clips">Allstar</a>, anti-anxiety app <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/?shortlink=9008545&amp;pid=Tiktok+Profile&amp;c=Tiktok">Breathwrk</a>, social app <a href="https://www.irl.com/">IRL</a>, as well as dating and friend-making apps <a href="https://thelollyapp.com/">Lolly</a>, <a href="https://www.meetme.com/">MeetMe</a>, <a href="https://monet.world/">Monet</a>, <a href="https://swipehouse.co/">Swipehouse</a> and <a href="https://www.emehive.co/">EME Hive</a>. Creator tool provider <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs</a> is also using Login Kit, as is video game <a href="https://www.pubg.com/">PUBG</a>, which is only using the login functionality. A forthcoming NFT platform <a href="https://neonapp.com/">Neon</a> will use Login Kit, too.</p>
<p>When users log in to these apps via their TikTok credentials, they&#8217;ll then be presented with an additional permissions box that asks them if the app in question can read their profile information and access their public videos, which they then have to also agree to in order to take advantage of the additional video sharing options inside the app itself.</p>
<p>For the time being, these are the only permissions that Login Kit asks for &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t give the app access to further information, like who the TikTok user&#8217;s friends are, for example. If TikTok expands beyond these permissions in the future, it says it will be transparent with users about any changes or new additions. For the time being, however, the focus is more on allowing apps to better integrate TikTok content into their own experiences.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148155" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148155" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148155" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok/Rapchat</p></div></p>
<p>The other new SDK launching today is the Sound Kit, which allows artists and creators to bring their original sounds and music from a third-party app into TikTok. This kit, which also requires Login Kit to work, will help TikTok seed its sounds database with more original content it doesn&#8217;t have to license from major labels. Instead, whatever licensing rights to the music and other sounds that exist within the original app will still apply to whatever is shared out to TikTok. But by sharing the music more broadly, creators can gain interest from potential fans and even see their sounds used as the backing for new TikTok videos.</p>
<p>Early adopters on this front include mobile multi-track recording studio <a href="https://www.audiobridge.com/">Audiobridge</a>, music creation and collaboration suite <a href="https://www.landr.com/en/">LANDR</a>, hip hop music creation app <a href="https://rapchat.me/">Rapchat</a> and upcoming audio recording and remix app <a href="https://www.yourdio.me/">Yourdio</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok says some of the apps selected as early partners for the SDKs were those that already adopted its Share to TikTok SDK, which launched in 2019. Others, however, were chosen based on a specific set of criteria, including the ability to move quickly to integrate the new features and the strength of their specific use cases. TikTok was looking for a diversity of use cases and those that were particularly novel &#8212; like building out a dating network based on videos, for instance.</p>
<p>More information on the new tools and developer documentation will be added to TikTok&#8217;s developer website, but TikTok says it will be vetting and reviewing developers who request access. And as most of the current developer partners are U.S.-based, with just a few exceptions, the company says it is looking to diversify the list of companies going forward, as this is a global initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;As TikTok becomes increasingly ingrained in culture, more third-party apps across a variety of categories and use cases are looking to tap into our community on their own platforms,&#8221; said Isaac Bess, TikTok&#8217;s Global Head of Distribution Partnerships, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;Through the Sound Kit and Login Kit for TikTok, we&#8217;re providing seamless integration solutions that help developers expand their reach, increase exposure for creators, and empower our community to showcase their content on other platforms,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap on Wednesday announced its plan to soon launch a Creator Marketplace, which will make it easier for businesses to find and partner with Snapchat creators, including Lens creators, AR creators and later, prominent Snapchat creators known as Snap Stars. At launch, the marketplace will focus on connecting brands and AR creators for AR ads. It will then expand to support all Snap Creators by 2022.</p>
<p>The company had previously helped connect its creator community with advertisers through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/snapchat-storytellers/">its Snapchat Storytellers program</a>, which first launched into pilot testing in 2018 &#8212; already a late arrival to the space. However, that program&#8217;s focus was similar to Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/brand-collabs-manager">Brand Collabs Manager,</a> as it focused on helping businesses find Snap creators who could produce video content.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s new marketplace, meanwhile, has a broader focus in terms of connecting all sorts of creators with the Snap advertising ecosystem. This includes Lens Creators, Developers and Partners, and then later, Snap&#8217;s popular creators with public profiles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap says the Creator Marketplace will open to businesses later this month to help them partner with a select group of AR Creators in Snap&#8217;s Lens Network. These creators can help businesses build AR experiences without the need for extensive creative resources, which makes access to <a href="https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/advertising">Snap&#8217;s AR ads</a> more accessible to businesses, including smaller businesses without in-house developer talent.</p>
<p>Lens creators have already found opportunity working for businesses that want to grow their Snapchat presence &#8212; even allowing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/tech/snapchat-lens-creators">some creators to quit their day jobs</a> and just build Lenses for a living. Snap has been further investing in this area of its business, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/snap-announces-3-5m-fund-directed-toward-ar-lens-creation/">announced</a> in December a $3.5 million fund directed toward AR Lens creation. The company said at the time there were tens of thousands of Lens creators who had collectively made over 1.5 million Lenses to date.</p>
<p>Using Lenses has grown more popular, too, the company had noted, saying that more than 180 million people interact with a Snapchat Lens every day — up from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/snapchat-debuts-a-library-of-selfie-filters/"> 70 million daily active users of Lenses</a> when the Lens Explorer section first launched in the app in 2018.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snapchat launches a TikTok-like feed called Spotlight, kick-started by paying creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/embed/#?secret=m1Oq3cUzKl" data-secret="m1Oq3cUzKl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, Snap says that over 200 million Snapchat users interact with augmented reality on a daily basis, on average, out of its 280 million daily users. The majority (over 90%) of its U.S. users are 13 to 25-year-olds. In total, users are posting over 5 billion Snaps per day.</p>
<p>Snap says the Creator Marketplace will remain focused on connecting businesses with AR Lens Creators throughout 2021.</p>
<p>The following year, it will expand to include the community of professional creators and storytellers who understand the current trends and interests of the Snap user base and can help businesses with their ad campaigns. The company will not take a cut of the deals facilitated through the Marketplace, it says.</p>
<p>This would include the creators making content for Snap&#8217;s new TikTok rival, Spotlight, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">launched</a> in November 2020. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">encouraged</a> adoption of the feature by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html"> shelling out $1 million per day</a> to creators of top videos. In March 2021, over 125 million Snapchat users watched Spotlight, it says.</p>

<p>Spotlight isn&#8217;t the only way Snap is challenging TikTok.</p>
<p>The company also on Wednesday announced it&#8217;s snagging two of TikTok&#8217;s biggest stars for its <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snapchat-megan-thee-stallion-charli-dixie-damelio-1234966360/">upcoming Snap Originals lineup</a>: Charli and Dixie D&#8217;Amelio. The siblings, who have gained over 20 million follows on Snapchat this past year, will star in the series &#8220;Charli vs. Dixie.&#8221; Other new Originals will feature names like artist Megan Thee Stallion, actor Ryan Reynolds, twins and influencers Niki and Gabi DeMartino, and YouTube beauty vlogger Manny Mua, among others.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s shows were watched by over 400 million people in 2020, including 93% of the Gen Z population in the U.S., it noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re happy to announce Snap’s Creator Marketplace, which will drive win-win-win opportunities for marketers, Creators, and Snap,&#8221; said Peter Naylor, Snap&#8217;s VP of Sales in the Americas, of the marketplace news. &#8220;For brands, it&#8217;s an opportunity to leverage the expertise of our network of AR Creators; for Creators, it gives them a way to further build a sustainable audience and business on the platform; and for Snap, it means more advertising partners can produce and execute compelling creative on Snapchat without the need for extensive resources,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity has been linked with equity and inclusion because diversity is just one part of the equation when it comes to hiring Black employees. How do the companies they work for make people feel welcome and included, rather than isolated? How do Black employees find their way into management, up the corporate ladder to the C Suite and into the boardroom?</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://valence.community/">Valence</a>, a startup dedicated to empowering Black professionals, announced a new program called BONDS, which is designed to help companies train, retain and promote Black employees.</p>
<p>Valence CEO Guy Primus says that the organization has almost 16,000 community members and, recognizing that getting hired was just the first step in a long journey, the company wanted to find a more concrete way to help its members. He says that companies tend to focus too much on the hiring pipeline and don&#8217;t give enough attention to what happens after Black employees get hired.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People want the numbers to go up, and there&#8217;s [this notion of] recruit, retain and promote. The problem is that everyone is focused on the recruiting pipeline, but they&#8217;re not focused on retention and promotion, which ultimately affects recruiting. So it&#8217;s an ecosystem problem, not a pipeline issue,&#8221; Primus explained.</p>
<p>Primus knew that the company needed to do more, and he hired Tracy Williams as vice president of learning and development to build a curriculum specifically designed to help Black professionals thrive.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BLCK VC launches educational initiative to bring more Black entrepreneurs into investing ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/blck-vc-launches-educational-initiative-to-bring-more-blacks-into-investing-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=F8cb7jYIPy" data-secret="F8cb7jYIPy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Williams points out that Black professionals often find themselves isolated at companies, without a lot of peers with whom they can talk. She wanted to create a program that could give people that sense of community where they could commiserate over the issues they face with people who understood their experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where an organization may not be able to provide that sense of community for their Black professionals, we&#8217;re able to do that for them and the benefit for those corporations and organizations is that they&#8217;re able to now invest in their Black employees&#8217; development and opportunities, while connecting with their peers on a more personal level and still being trained and developed as potential senior-level leaders,&#8221; Williams told me.</p>
<p>She says that this also gives the company a way to hold organizations accountable when it comes to promoting Black employees into management and executive positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have this opportunity not only to provide the community for emerging Black executives, but also on the other side of the marketplace, create a tool of accountability for these organizations who are investing in their employees and ensuring that they are acknowledging their employees&#8217; readiness, and recognizing and promoting them based on their leadership readiness as well,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Among the organizations participating at the launch of this program are Accel, Electrolux, GGV Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Providence Strategic Growth, Roblox, Silicon Valley Bank and Upfront Ventures.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bevy raises $40M Series C with 20% coming from Black investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/bevy-raises-40m-series-c-with-20-coming-from-black-investors/embed/#?secret=rtdMoP43WW" data-secret="rtdMoP43WW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The program itself includes a couple of key components, including a curriculum designed around three modules: leading self, leading others and leading within your organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of the curriculum components across those three modules truly provides content and development for our members that focus on how they are able to represent themselves and navigate the nuances of being an emerging Black executive in their organization, how they&#8217;re able to amplify their leadership readiness, how they&#8217;re able to communicate more effectively in their organizations and externally as well, and the steps that they need to take in order to fully own their career development,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>But Williams wanted to do more than provide training materials for the members, she wanted to provide support for every member of the BONDS program. So the other component of this is a cohort with 10 peers, led by a facilitator and a coach who lead the members in deeper discussions about the training materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a safe space to practice what they&#8217;ve learned in the on-demand curriculum, but also dive as deep as they need to in order to feel fully ready to promote themselves within their organization,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The program is trying to address a real problem related to Black employees getting the opportunity to grow into management and executive positions. The company pointed out that while Black professionals make up 12% of entry-level corporate jobs, just short of their 13.4% representation in the U.S. population, their numbers fall to 7% of management roles, according to research <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/Race-in-the-workplace-The-Black-experience-in-the-US-private-sector">conducted by McKinsey &amp; Co</a>.</p>
<p>The hope is that by providing a more concrete framework like BONDS, it can lead to closing this gap and helping more Black professionals climb the professional ladder in their organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was going to wait until after Square reported its Q1 results today to dig into the world of fintech earnings and what they might mean for startups, but something got stuck in my craw that matters more than what Jack&#8217;s team may have up its sleeve: How much space is being left in fintech when the major players are growing rapidly in categories where startups are doing their best to make a dent?</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;ll examine the buy now, pay later (BNPL) market, mostly through the lens of PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/v2/Q1-21-PayPal-Investor-Update.pdf">first-quarter results</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>PayPal&#8217;s BNPL results are impressive &#8212; and not just to your humble servant, but to other fintech watchers<a href="https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1390097953369595913?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"> as well</a> &#8212; which begs the question: Can the platform effect that the PayPals of the world bring to bear suffocate a growing slice of the startup market?</p>

The first being that BNPL-focused Affirm recently went public. And Affirm was, until very recently, a startup and later a unicorn. And then there&#8217;s BNPL player AfterPay, which went public a few years back, not to mention Klarna, which could go public sometime soon.</p>
<p>But what we&#8217;re watching is PayPal chase a handful of unicorns-and-later BNPL companies. What about the actual startups in the market? Can they hack it? Let&#8217;s dig into PayPal&#8217;s results, take a peek at what AfterPay&#8217;s own can tell us, and then we&#8217;ll noodle on the startup question. We&#8217;ll come back to all of this after Affirm reports in a few day&#8217;s time.</p>
<h2>Platforms versus startups</h2>
<p>The &#8220;kill-zone&#8221; concept &#8212; that startups should not get too close to what big tech companies do &#8212; has never sat well with me. Mostly because it&#8217;s not true that small companies cannot take on big ones. And because big companies have a really great history of crappifying their products into vulnerability.</p>
<p>A great example of the first count is Zoom, which took on a host of enterprise-ready, platform-supported video chat services and crushed them by simply being not awful. This brings us to our second point: As big tech companies need to keep finding incremental revenue adds from their existing products, they make them worse to find a marginal top line. The biggest tech shops often trade near-term economic growth for long-term market ownership.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re thrilled to announce Caryn Marooney is speaking at our upcoming T<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">echCrunch Early Stage virtual event in July</a>. She spoke with us last year and we had to have her back.</p>
<p>Just look at her resume. She was the co-founder and CEO of The Outcast Agency, one of Silicon Valley’s best-regarded public relations firms. She left her company to serve as VP of Global Communication at Facebook, which she did for eight years, overseeing communication for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. In 2019 she joined Coatue Management as a general partner, where she went on to invest in Startburst, Supabase, Defined Networks and others.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Marooney is one of the Valley&#8217;s experts on getting people&#8217;s attention &#8212; a skill that&#8217;s critical when running a startup, nonprofit or school bake sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She said it best last year: “People just fundamentally aren’t walking around caring about this new startup — actually, nobody does.” So how do you get people to care? That&#8217;s the trick and why we&#8217;re having her back to speak on this evergreen topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/facebooks-former-pr-chief-explains-why-no-one-is-paying-attention-to-your-startup/">Watch her presentation from 2020 here</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<p>One of the great things about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage</a> is that the show is designed around breakout sessions, with each speaker leading a chat around a specific startup core competency (like fundraising, designing a brand, mastering the art of PR and more). Moreover, there is plenty of time for audience Q&amp;A in each session.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">Pick up your ticket for the event</a>, which goes down July 8 and 9, right here. And if you do it today, you&#8217;ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">save a cool $100 off</a> of your registration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspired by his own problems with skin ailments, tech founder Daniel Jensen decided there had to be a better way. So, using an in-house tech platform, his Copenhagen-based startup <a href="https://noie.com/">Nøie</a> developed its own database of skin profiles to better care for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Nøie has now raised $12 million in a Series A funding round led by Talis Capital, with participation from Inventure, as well as existing investors including Thomas Ryge Mikkelsen, former CMO of Pandora, and Kristian Schrøder Hart-Hansen, former CEO of LEO Pharma’s Innovation Lab.</p>
<p>Nøie’s customized skincare products target sensitive skin conditions including acne, psoriasis and eczema. Using its own R&amp;D, Nøie says it screens thousands of skincare products on the market, selects what it thinks are the best, and uses an algorithm to assign customers to their &#8220;skin family&#8221;. Customers then get recommendations for customized products to suit their skin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Skin+Me is probably the best-known perceived competitor, but this is a prescription provider. Nøie is non-prescription.</p>
<p>Jensen said: &#8220;We firmly believe that the biggest competition is the broader skincare industry and the consumer behavior that comes with it. I truly believe that in 2030 we&#8217;ll be surprised that we ever went into a store and picked up a one-size-fits-all product to combat our skincare issues, based on what has the nicest packaging or the best marketing. In a sense, any new company that emerges in this space are peers to us: we&#8217;re all working together to intrinsically change how people choose skincare products. We&#8217;re all demonstrating to people that they can now receive highly-personalized products based on their own skin&#8217;s specific needs.”</p>
<p>Of his own problems to find the right skincare provider, he said: &#8220;It&#8217;s just extremely difficult to find something that works. When you look at technology, online, and all our apps and everything, we got so smart in so many areas, but not when it comes to consumer skin products. I believe that in five or 10 years down the line, you&#8217;ll be laughing that we really used to just go in and pick up products just off the shelf, without knowing what we&#8217;re supposed to be using. I think everything we will be using in the bathroom will be customized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beatrice Aliprandi, principal at Talis Capital, said: &#8220;For too long have both the dermatology sector and the skincare industry relied on the outdated &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; approach to addressing chronic skin conditions. By instead taking a data-driven and community feedback approach, Nøie is building the next generation of skincare by providing complete personalization for its customers at a massive scale, pioneering the next revolution in skincare.&#8221;</p>
