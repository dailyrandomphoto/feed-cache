										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp will soon let you use the popular instant messaging app simultaneously on multiple devices, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. The instant messaging app, used by over 2 billion users, also plans to add more options to its disappearing messages feature, top executives said.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/">confirmed to news outlet WaBetaInfo</a> that multi-device support will be arriving on the instant messaging service “soon.” WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said users will be able to connect up to four devices to one account. The messaging firm is also working to introduce a dedicated WhatsApp app for the iPad, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we&#8217;ve solved this and we&#8217;re looking forward to getting it out soon!&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The instant messaging service, which last year introduced the ability to set a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">seven-day timer on messages</a> (disappearing mode), is now planning to expand this feature to let users share pictures and videos that can only be viewed once. &#8220;We&#8217;re also about to start rolling out &#8216;view once,&#8217; so you can send content and have it disappear after the person sees it,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>WhatsApp users will also get an option to enforce disappearing mode across the app for all new chats.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg and Cathcart told the news outlet &#8212; and it&#8217;s indeed the two of them talking &#8212; that these features will be available to users in public beta “in the next month or two.”</p>

These are big names in the new wave of e-commerce companies taking the world by storm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their business of acquiring small e-commerce brands that look promising and consolidating them is quite popular in the U.S. and Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept has sifted through those shores to Latin America and Asia, where companies like Una Brands and Valoreo have raised significant investment to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and build these brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the concept has made its way into the Middle East and Africa as <a href="https://www.opontia.com/">Opontia</a> has closed a financing of $20 million to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and scale e-commerce brands across the regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This seed round, one of the largest in the Middle East and Africa, is a mix of debt and equity financing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Opontia does not disclose the ratio of equity and debt, it confirmed that the majority was debt which will be used to make</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquisitions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors include Global Founders Capital, Presight Capital, Raed Ventures and Kingsway Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The angel investors that participated are also notable names in e-commerce across EMEA; they include</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tushar-ahluwalia/?originalSubdomain=de"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tushar Ahluwalia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO of Razor Group;</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-jonathan-doerr-60b0a334/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Doerr</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the former CEO of Daraz and co-founder of Jumia; and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hosam/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosam Arab</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CEO of Tabby and the former CEO of Namshi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-CEOs</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnstonphilip/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Johnston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manfredmeyer82/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manfred Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has teams in Dubai and Riyadh, with professionals from Amazon, Zomato, Noon.com, Namshi, McKinsey and Uber Eats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the coming months, the company plans to open in Cairo, Istanbul and Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often when small e-commerce brands take off, the owner usually starts by being passionate about their product and customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due to no fault of their own, most begin to reach a point of stagnation caused by constraints on working capital, operations, logistics and e-commerce commercial management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnston and Meyer started Opontia to take these burdens off their back by convincing them to sell their brands and for Opontia to manage all parts of their operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the interesting thing, like most companies that roll up e-commerce brands, these owners will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuously</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">be involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the day-to-day activities of building the brand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started Opontia to enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to realize the full potential of their brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to do this both </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> getting an exit now as well as benefiting from future growth,&#8221; Johnston said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We also want to help nurture and build the entrepreneurial e-commerce ecosystem in the Middle East and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Opontia acquires these brands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the owners get to share in the increase in profits over the next couple of years, Johnston added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We do this so that they continue to see the benefit of their hard work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-month-old company is particularly interested in brands with at least $10,000 in monthly revenue and at least $5,000 in net profit per month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the categories of products, Opontia has a soft spot for less seasonal &#8220;all-weather&#8221; products, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including kitchen products, bathroom, sport, home and living, cosmetics and toys</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of startups rolling up e-commerce brands worldwide besides Razor Group, Branded and Thrasio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But none of them has sights on the Middle East and Africa yet, with their bigger and more mature target markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce market, with an annual growth rate of more than 30% and <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/22729/e-commerce-sales-growth-by-region/">annual online sales exceeding $850 billion</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The second-largest market, which is the U.S, stands at over $350 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazil has annual sales reaching $36 billion, accounting for <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2453/e-commerce-in-latin-america/">32% of Latin America&#8217;s e-commerce market</a>. For the Middle East and Africa, these numbers are at $30 billion and $25 billion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both regions present Opontia with a huge opportunity. Still, if past happenings in other regions repeat themselves, it wouldn&#8217;t be too long before the company starts facing new competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Every business needs to adopt what model works best in a region but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he founders believe the model used by companies in other markets can also serve the Middle East and Africa, despite differences in size and how they operate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The market in the Middle East and Africa is currently less mature than in the West, but is growing faster than any other market in the world, with the number of sellers on marketplace growing at over 50% per year,&#8221; Meyer remarked. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business model will work here because there have been so many amazing entrepreneurs in the Middle East coming up over the last few years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a great opportunity for sellers to be able to realize some of the hard work from building their brand so that they can take a break or work on their next big thing.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, it would&#8217;ve been a concern if Opontia or a similar company launched in both regions, as there just weren&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enough sellers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the recent and continued growth in marketplace sellers, there are now more than enough brands for Opontia to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, there are about 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon, with 1 million joining </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia says that its opportunity lies in the 30,000 African and Middle East sellers in Amazon and Noon marketplaces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia adds that it will scale acquired brands across their regions and to other parts of the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is in talks with more than 100 small e-commerce brands and claims to have signed &#8220;several term sheets&#8221; with some of them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnston and Meyer come from two distinct e-commerce backgrounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former McKinsey consultant, Johnston worked on e-commerce strategy, private equity and post-merger integration at the Big 3 firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that, he spent years doing venture capital, investing and banking across Southern Africa, London, New York and Singapore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Meyer worked as the chief marketplace officer for Lazada and CEO of Next Commerce, an e-commerce enabler in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to acquiring brands, the founders will be looking to hire talent with industry experience, who will be tasked with managing and growing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these brands post-acquisition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://golightyear.com">Lightyear</a>, a new London-based startup coming out of stealth today. The company is building a stock trading app with a focus on creating a truly commission-free app. In addition to waving account fees and trading fees, Lightyear doesn’t charge foreign exchange fees either — up to a certain point.</p>
<p>The two founders met when they were working at Wise — then known as TransferWise. That’s why it makes sense that Lightyear wants to stand out from the crowd with lower foreign exchange fees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinsokk">Martin Sokk</a>, co-founder and CEO of Lightyear, worked at Wise between 2012 and 2017. He has held various roles, such as head of product, head of people and head of operations. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihkel-aamer-9099b918">Mihkel Aamer</a>, Lightyear’s other co-founder and CTO, was an engineering lead at Wise between 2013 and 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Having spent my career in financial services, I’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly. I believe retail investing in Europe is still very much ‘the ugly’ — we’re talking about sneaky fees, less access and complicated products remaining as the status quo,” Martin Sokk said in a statement. “We’re building something that will change that by opening up investing up to everyone, whichever global market they want to invest in and however much they want to invest.”</p>
<p>As a user, you can expect a mobile app that lets you buy and sell shares and ETFs. There will be 1,500 stocks and ETFs from multiple markets at launch. Customers won’t pay any account fees, trading fees and foreign exchange fees. But there will be a limit on foreign exchange fees. After £3,000 per month, users will pay 0.35% in FX fees.</p>
<p>The app isn’t quite ready just yet as Lightyear is opening up a waitlist today. The product should roll out at some point during the third quarter of this year.</p>

<p>Lightyear has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed funding round co-led by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/fund-with-no-name/">new unnamed fund</a> formed by Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus and Teleport co-founder Sten Tamkivi Teleport. This is their first investment through this new venture. Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn is also co-leading the found through Metaplanet. There are also several business angels participating in today’s funding round, including Checkout.com CTO Ott Kaukver, former President of Robinhood UK Wander Rutgers, and Veriff founder Kaarel Kotkas.</p>
<p>It’s a nice list of investors but the company will face tough competition from other startups — you’ll likely end up paying more fees if you use one of these competitors, but they’re already well established. For instance, Berlin-based stock trading app <a href="https://traderepublic.com">Trade Republic</a> has recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">raised $900 million</a>. In the U.K., <a href="https://freetrade.io">Freetrade</a> has also managed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/stock-trading-app-freetrade-raises-69-million/">attract</a> 600,000 users.</p>
<p>And yet, more importantly, Lightyear also competes with legacy brokers. Unlike in the U.S., the vast majority of retail investors still rely on traditional banks and web platforms for stock trading. There will be room for more than one company in this space. So let’s see how Lightyear executes in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India may be grappling with the second wave of the coronavirus, rising unemployment, and a dwindling economy, but the South Asian nation’s burgeoning startup ecosystem has never had it better.</p>
<p>High-profile investors in India have long aggressively chased growth-stage, and late-stage deals, pouring <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/indian-startups-raised-7-8-billion-in-first-four-months-of-2021/articleshow/82889825.cms">record amounts of capital</a> into the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. But in a sign of the growing investor bullishness regarding Indian startups, even early-stage companies that have largely been bereft of much similar attention in recent years are now sharing the limelight.</p>
<p>More than 70 early-stage Indian startups are currently in advanced stages of talks to raise money, according to sources familiar with the matter. The size of the investments vary from a few million dollars to up to $100 million. TechCrunch is reporting some of the more notable deals today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The usual caveat &#8212; that many of deals haven’t yet closed, and that their terms could change or the talks may not materialize into an investment &#8212; applies in our reporting. The deals described below have not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India, the most prolific <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/sequoia-announces-1-35-billion-venture-and-growth-funds-for-india-and-southeast-asia/">investing firm in the country</a>, is in talks to make bets in over two-dozen Indian startups including <strong>Register Book</strong>, a firm that operates an eponymous bookkeeping app; <a href="https://vahvah.com"><strong>Vah Vah</strong></a>, which runs an app to educate people about makeup from artists; SaaS platform <a href="https://bamboobox.ai"><strong>BambooBox</strong></a>, and email marketing software provider <strong>MailModo</strong>.</p>
<p>The firm is also in talks to back, alongside venture fund Nexus, <a href="https://www.onecode.in"><strong>OneCode</strong></a>, a startup that runs an app to connect digital-first brands with sellers. Sequoia Capital India, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/sequoia-surge/">launched a dedicated fund for early stage startups called Surge</a> two years ago, is also in talks to invest in <a href="https://probo.in"><strong>Probo</strong></a>, an app to predict future trends; and <strong>Rattle</strong>.</p>
<p>Vaibhav Domkundwar, who runs Better Capital, said the early-stage startup scene in India has never been this hot.</p>
<p>“Pre-seed and seed stage momentum is at its peak, but we are also seeing pre-emptive rounds at Series As and Bs now,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Domkundwar, who has backed over 140 startups including Khatabook and neobank Open, attributed some excitement to the new generation of founders in India, who he said are building product-first and distribution-first companies. “We are seeing the fastest pace of investment in these teams,” he said.</p>
<p>A different investor, who requested anonymity, said that second time founders are now able to raise on a deck or a Notion doc from elite angels, unicorn founders and microVCs. The pace at which these founders are able to close the deal, the investor said, was &#8220;stunning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The frantic pace of investments in early-stage deals come as many of the more mature bets have become unicorns in India and many established startups are finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">exploring taking the public markets</a>.</p>
<p>India has birthed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/home-services-platform-urban-company-raises-255-million-at-2-1-billion-valuation/">14 unicorns this year</a>, up from 11 last year and just 6 in 2019. High-profile investors such as Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">increased their focus on India</a> this year and winning founders with their large size of checks, higher valuation, access to resources, and quick turnaround time.</p>
<p>Many established firms are now chasing early-stage deals.</p>
<p>GSV is in talks to invest in <a href="https://www.findfilo.com"><strong>Filo</strong></a>, a startup that operates an eponymous tutor app; and payments stack startup <strong>Inai</strong> has closed a new round from Better Capital and others and will be part of Y Combinator’s next batch. (Speaking of which, Y Combinator’s previous batch featured its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinators-new-batch-features-its-largest-group-of-indian-startups/">largest cohort of Indian startups in history</a>.)</p>
<p>One-year-old startup <a href="https://www.brightchamps.com"><strong>BrightCHAMPS</strong></a>, which has built a coding and math platform for kids, is currently in talks with GSV and Tiger Global to raise about $70 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://indiagold.co"><strong>Indiagold</strong></a>, a startup that allows people in the South Asian nation to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/former-paytm-execs-team-up-indiagold/">access credit against their gold reserve</a>, is in talks to close a new round with two high-profile foreign investors that have traditionally backed growth and late stage deals.</p>
<p>Germany’s Razor Group is in late stage talks to invest in <strong>Upscale</strong>, a startup that is attempting to replicate the Thrasio model in India.</p>
<p>Fintech investor RTP is in talks to invest in <strong>Fleek</strong>, a startup that is building “a payments system for subscription economy.” Falcon Edge’s AWI is in talks to invest in <a href="https://www.absolutefoods.in"><strong>Absolute Foods</strong></a> and fitness subscription platform <a href="https://ultrahuman.com"><strong>Ultrahuman</strong></a>, while SaaS platform <a href="https://www.acceldata.io"><strong>AccelData</strong></a> has been approached by Bessemmer and WestBridge.</p>
<p>For high-profile investors with billions in dry powder, there are many rewards for spotting a promising startup in its initial years. One can buy a much larger stake in a startup for lower prices before the valuation of the startup &#8212; assuming things work out well &#8212; soars. Investing early also reduces the amount an investor may lose should things with the portfolio firm goes south.</p>
<p>But not everyone is happy with the new dynamics.</p>
<p>An investor with a micro fund told TechCrunch &#8212; on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly &#8212; that involvement of bigger investors in early stage deals has made it tougher for smaller firms to source new deals as the bigger investors are now aggressively trying to close entire rounds by themselves.</p>
<p>The investor said there is an additional competition in the market now: groups of high-profile founders, who tend to collectively back startups.</p>
<p>The investor cited earlier in the story termed these investments as &#8220;optionality checks.&#8221; These optionality checks &#8212; that usually back second time founders or first time founders who previously worked at a unicorn or soonicorn &#8212; started with the Series A crowd such as Sequoia Capital India, Matrix, Lightspeed India Partners, he said. Now, the investor said, Tiger and Falcon / AWI are doing it, too.</p>
<p>There are two implications of these optionality checks, the investor said. &#8220;They make life more difficult for microVCs / seed VCs as they cannot compete with the Tigers or Falcons or Series A funds who can cut &#8216;smaller&#8217; checks with impunity, and perhaps even dilute less.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the investor cautioned the founders who are raising such optionality checks. &#8220;If the same fund doesn&#8217;t back them in the next round, then the negative signal can imperil their chances of raising from other VCs. Second, the excess money that they get can sometimes encourage faster expansion and higher spends.</p>
<p>Lightspeed India Partners, best known for its investments in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/lightspeed-raises-275-million-fund-for-india/">unicorns Oyo Rooms and e-commerce platform Udaan</a>, is in talks to back <a href="https://www.vegrow.in"><strong>Vegrow</strong></a>, a startup that partners with farmers; and has held talks to invest in <a href="https://100ms.live"><strong>100ms.live</strong></a>, which operates an eponymous tool to help developers add video conferencing features to their apps, as well as edtech startup <a href="https://www.kalamlabs.in"><strong>Kalaam Labs</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dyte.in"><strong>Dyte</strong></a>, which is building a “Stripe for live video calls,” is in talks with Nexus and Sequoia Capital India. Elevation Capital, which is also in talks to invest in <strong>VeGrow</strong>, is inching closer to investing in <a href="https://fampay.in"><strong>FamPay</strong></a>, which offers credit cards to teens at about $150 million valuation. Bangalore-based Chiratae Ventures is in the final stages of talks to invest in <a href="https://www.aroleap.com"><strong>AroLeap</strong></a> and analytics startup <a href="http://locale.ai"><strong>Locale.ai</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fangame.live"><strong>Fanplay</strong></a>, a platform for social media influencers to monetise via mobile games, has already raised from several American microVCs, but the round hasn’t closed yet. Mumbai-headquartered due diligence and monitoring platform <a href="https://advarisk.com"><strong>Advarisk</strong></a> has been approached by “several investors” but has yet to close the round.</p>
<p>Trading signals provider <strong>Tradex</strong> is in talks to raise from Leo Capital. Audio social media app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dating.for.all&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US"><strong>Frnd</strong></a>, radio and podcast aggregator app <a href="https://kukufm.com"><strong>Kuku FM</strong></a>, and crop management platform <a href="https://bharatagri.com"><strong>Bharatagri</strong></a> are also in advanced stages of talks with investors to raise capital.</p>
<p>Plug and play payments provider <a href="https://www.card91.io"><strong>Card91</strong></a> has been approached by several investors, but hasn’t closed the round yet. <a href="https://tournafest.com"><strong>Tournafest</strong></a> has closed a round from a clutch of angel investors, and so have <strong>Easy Eat</strong> and <strong>Stockgro</strong>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/y-combinator-backed-kosh-is-a-neobank-for-blue-collar-workers-in-india/"><strong>Kosh</strong></a> has raised from YC, and VentureSouq among others.</p>
<p>Tech veteran Nandan Nilekani’s firm Fundamentum is in talks to back <a href="https://www.bijak.in"><strong>Bijak</strong></a>, which operates a business-to-business marketplace to trade agricultural commodities, and supply chain startup <a href="https://reshamandi.com"><strong>Reshamandi</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A survey by InnoVen Capital, results of which were published on Thursday, said that over 80% of the investors it had surveyed said their dealflow for early-stage startups had increased this year, compared to 2020.</p>
<p>Over 75% of the respondents in the same survey said the valuations in recent deals were on the “higher side” because of the “intense competition for high quality deals and entry of large established VCs in this space.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage investment activity has proven to be resilient despite the pandemic, with bigger transaction sizes and higher valuations, a clear sign of a maturing early-stage ecosystem,&#8221; said Tarana Lalwani, Senior Director at InnoVen Capital India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tuesday.vc/">Tuesday Capital</a>, a 10-year-old seed-stage fund that was founded by longtime VC Patrick Gallagher and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, has changed considerably over the years. Arrington now leads a <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">crypto hedge fund</a>. Tuesday was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crunchfund-rebrands-as-tuesday-capital-1528935755">formerly known as Crunchfund</a>. Gallagher now runs the outfit with partner Prashant Fonseka, who joined the fund in 2015 as an associate.</p>
<p>Tuesday has also formed a tight relationship over the years with the industrial design shop Frog Design, which is a limited partner in the fund and sold a portion of its venture portfolio to Tuesday early <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/tuesday-capital-teams-up-with-design-powerhouse-frog-to-grab-startups-attention-and-keep-it/">last year</a>. (Tuesday obtained stakes in nine startups in the deal.)</p>
<p>Perhaps most meaningfully, ten years ago, Tuesday didn&#8217;t have stakes in so many portfolio companies. Now that it has backed 600 founders, it has exits to point to and networks to leverage, says Gallagher of why the firm, which recently closed its fourth fund with $30 million, is now investing all over the globe and could be in the market later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both make a huge difference in a frothy market, where everyone and her brother has become an angel investor &#8212; if not a pre-seed fund manager. Indeed, upwards of 30% of Tuesday&#8217;s deal flow now comes from referrals and 15% of its newest stakes are in portfolio companies whose founders have spun out of companies that Tuesday backed previously. Among those many portfolio companies is the cloud computing company DigitalOcean, which <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/digitalocean-stock-opens-below-ipo-price-on-first-day-of-trading/">went public</a> in March; the collaborative software maker Airtable, recently valued by its investors at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/">nearly $6 billion</a>; and the pet care marketplace Rover, set to become publicly traded <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/pet-care-marketplace-rover-to-go-public-via-spac/">via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>As it happens, the pandemic itself has also changed the firm is unanticipated ways. Though the firm&#8217;s early bets included some that are far flung, such as the buy-now-pay-later fintech <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/kueski-mexican-fintech/">Kueski</a> in Mexico, it is now seeing even more interesting startups outside the Bay Area because Fonseka has been &#8220;living like a nomad&#8221; since early last year &#8212; and talking with founders en route. (Recent stops include Tulum, Mexico; Costa Rica; Virginia; Miami; and Austin. &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure he&#8217;ll land,&#8221; laughs Gallagher. &#8220;He does enjoy this lifestyle.&#8221;)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wAAxGSixgO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/applied-xl-seed-funding/">Applied XL raises $1.5M to build &#8216;editorial algorithms&#8217; that track real-time data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Applied XL raises $1.5M to build &#8216;editorial algorithms&#8217; that track real-time data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/applied-xl-seed-funding/embed/#?secret=wAAxGSixgO" data-secret="wAAxGSixgO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tuesday is also ratcheting up its remote bets thanks in part to Frog, which has offices around the globe and often introduces Tuesday to clients, and to Zoom, which the firm has gotten more comfortable about using to diligence a deal.</p>
<p>One recent check, for example, went to Applied XL, a 16-month-old, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based startup that&#8217;s developing real-time information systems powered by experts to track the health of people, places and the planet, and which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/applied-xl-seed-funding/">$1.5 million</a> in seed funding led by Tuesday, with participation from Frog (which continues to fund the occasional startup off its balance sheet).</p>
<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed is the firm&#8217;s thinking about its place in the investing universe. While in go-go markets like this one, funds tend to get bigger, write larger checks, and lead deals as time passes, Tuesday is content to write initial checks of $250,000 to $550,000 and to be a syndicate partner.</p>
<p>While everyone has an angle these days, Tuesday has always been, and continues to be, a generalist fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mandate is very broad,&#8221; says Gallagher. &#8220;Prashant is spending time around digital health. I&#8217;ve [long liked] e-commerce and space. But when someone asks, &#8216;Should we show you a B2B deal? Should we show you vertical SaaS?&#8217; I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we love mission-driven founders, whether consumer or enterprise,&#8221; and whether in California or as far away as Israel.</p>
<p>Tuesday, which also includes associate David Jee, has now backed 29 startups altogether with its newest fund, including the nine it acquired through Frog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roadster, the Palo Alto-based digital platform that gives dealers tools to sell new and used vehicles online has been acquired for $360 million by retail automotive technology company CDK Global Inc., according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1609702/000160970221000043/cdk-20210602.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission filing</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the all-cash deal, Roadster is now a wholly owned subsidiary. Roadster&#8217;s business model has evolved since its founding in 2013. The online sales platform initially hosted dealers&#8217; inventory on its site, but handled the entire sales process with customers. Roadster now works more directly with dealerships by providing its digital retail tools directly to these businesses through its <a href="https://roadster.com/products#storefront">&#8220;Express&#8221; products</a>.</p>
<p>These digital tools have helped dealerships enter a modern era and serve customers who have become accustomed to completing retail purchases online, particularly in the last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumers have shown they are increasingly more willing to purchase big ticket items online, and this trend has quickly accelerated during the pandemic,” said Brian Krzanich, CDK Global&#8217;s president and CEO, in a statement. “To meet their expectations, the automotive industry requires integrations of the right technology, data and infrastructure to better connect its online and in-store experiences.”</p>
<p>CDK is known for making the vehicle sales process easier with digital products like Connected Store, a digital quote, loan and payment tool, or Elead CRM, a leads generating software platform. Roadster&#8217;s assets will connect CDK to dealer back-end-systems for a more seamless end-to-end sales process.</p>
<p>“Automotive retailing is extremely complex, and the best way to create a truly frictionless, end-to-end buying experience is to fully integrate our technology with the back-end systems that power dealership sales, finance and operations, regardless of provider,” said Andy Moss, Roadster&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart accidentally scooped itself by publishing product listings for its own, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=onn+&amp;redirect=false">onn</a>-branded, low-cost Android TV streaming stick to the Walmart.com website ahead of its formal launch, where it <a href="https://twitter.com/AndroidTV_Rumor/status/1399274149835689991?s=19">was soon spotted</a>, alongside an <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Android-TV-UHD-Streaming-Device/636597403">upcoming 4K streaming device</a>. Both items are officially arriving next week in stores and online, Walmart told TechCrunch, but it seems the website revealed them a bit earlier than planned.</p>
<p>The entry-level device streaming stick had been <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/walmart-android-tv-stick-leaked-may-launch-under-the-onn-brand-20210317/">leaked</a> earlier this year thanks to its FCC listing, but its online listing caught people&#8217;s eye thanks to its almost absurdly low price point of just $24.88 &#8212; a figure that rivals or even undercuts other streaming sticks on the market, including some from Walmart&#8217;s partner, Roku.</p>
<p>Roku today makes a product line of Walmart exclusives, where its <a href="https://www.roku.com/products/players">cheapest player</a> is the Roku Express 4K at $34.99, currently. Otherwise, Roku&#8217;s most affordable streaming player is the Roku Express, at $24.99. Google&#8217;s entry-level <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv_compare?hl=en-US">Chromecast</a>, meanwhile, is $29.99, and Amazon&#8217;s cheapest Fire TV stick is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YNLBS7R/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c2_odscatsm_0_i?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_r=QK46P7QPSTN37CK7PN6N&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=46d7f922-acfb-4f96-beb4-f5c8cc052a80&amp;pf_rd_i=8521791011">the Fire TV Stick Lite</a> at $24.99.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Walmart streaming stick, which is published under the retailer&#8217;s onn electronics brand, falls in line with the specifications you&#8217;d expect to find on a low-cost device like this. It support FHD (Full HD, meaning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p">1080p</a>), Dolby Audio, and ships with an Android TV-style remote (with batteries included), 1 HDMI Extender, AC adapter, and 1 USB to Micro-USB cable.</p>

<p>The system itself is powered by Android TV, which offers an easy way for consumers to turn a regular TV into a smart TV with access to streaming apps, voice control, and the ability to &#8220;cast&#8221; content like photos, video and music to the TV. Device owners can also ask Google Assistant to control their TV with their voice, and access over 700,000 movies and TV shows from the Android TV interface.</p>
<p>The included remote offers a Google Assistant button and dedicated buttons for YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max.</p>
<p>The stick may not be the sort of thing you&#8217;d use in your living room for your big screen, but may make sense to add to another, less important TV &#8212; like the one in the kid&#8217;s room or guest room &#8212; where having the top specs isn&#8217;t as essential.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Walmart is addressing the higher-end of the streaming market with its new 4K Android TV streamer <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Android-TV-UHD-Streaming-Device/636597403?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_zdY2WmQSGxyLT0swUx0Mo37nUkBzaL35TTi5XA0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_10078&amp;clickid=zdY2WmQSGxyLT0swUx0Mo37nUkBzaL35TTi5XA0&amp;sharedid=aftvnews.com&amp;affiliates_ad_id=612734&amp;campaign_id=9383">the $29.88 Onn UHD Streaming Device</a>, also published ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>The overall concept here is the same, but offers an affordable upgrade to 4K streaming.</p>
<p>The retailer&#8217;s <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=onn+&amp;redirect=false">onn brand</a> today carries a range of devices, including TVs, headphones, portable speakers, tablets, and other accessories. Roku has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/roku-to-launch-low-cost-versions-of-its-soundbar-and-subwoofer-under-walmarts-onn-brand/">produced lower-cost versions</a> of its new Smart Soundbar and Wireless Subwoofer for Walmart under the onn brand, too.</p>
<p>Walmart confirmed the new streaming devices are preparing to launch in stores and online in the retailer&#8217;s full assortment starting next week. Despite the website saying only a few devices are in stock or are out of stock, Walmart assures us there is, in fact, plenty of inventory available. These are not considered &#8220;test&#8221; items.</p>
<p>The company offered the following official specs for the new devices:</p>
<p><strong>Streaming Stick</strong></p>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a year ago, Google <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-promotes-prabhakar-raghavan-to-lead-search-replacing-ben-gomes-335561">announced</a> a couple of leadership changes that saw Prabhakar Raghavan, who joined the company back in 2012, take over the lead of Search, Assistant and Maps. Now, sources familiar with the hiring tell us, the company has hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherphillips1/">Christopher Phillips</a>, who was previously the chief product and technology officer at SiriusXM, to lead its geo team, which is responsible for products like Google Maps, Google Earth and Google Maps Platform, the company&#8217;s enterprise business around these products. Google has confirmed his hire but declined to share any additional information. Phillips will officially join the company later this month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160608" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160608" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2160608" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?w=300" alt="Christopher Phillips" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/phillips.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2160608" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Christopher Phillips/LinkedIn</p></div></p>
<p>Phillips came to SiriusXM after the company acquired music service Pandora last year. Before the acquisition, he spent six years as Pandora&#8217;s CPO and head of Technology, a role he took after leading product and design for Amazon Music from 2012 to 2014 and executive roles at Workspeed and Intuit before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In his new role at Google, Phillips will lead both product and engineering for the Geo team and report directly to Raghavan, who will continue to oversee Search, Assistant, Geo, Commerce and Ads. Before last year&#8217;s leadership shuffle, Jen Fitzpatrick essentially played a similar role for the Geo team.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-promotes-prabhakar-raghavan-to-lead-search-replacing-ben-gomes-335561">Search Engine Land</a>, Dane Glasgow and Liz Reid became the leads for the Geo team after her departure. Glasgow has since departed Google and is now at Facebook, while Reid recently <a href="https://searchengineland.com/prabhakar-raghavan-googles-head-of-search-appoints-new-leads-347498">took on a new role</a> to lead Google&#8217;s search experiences. That obviously left a bit of a vacuum, which Phillips will now fill.</p>
<p>While Phillips doesn&#8217;t have any direct experience in building geo products, he does bring with him extensive experience in managing product-oriented engineering teams. His hiring also comes at an interesting time for Google Maps, which only recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/google-maps-to-add-more-detailed-maps-crowd-indicators-better-routing-and-more/">announced</a> a number of <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/redefining-what-map-can-be-new-information-and-ai/">major updates</a> and which is becoming an increasingly important part of Google&#8217;s product portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As dating app Tinder and its parent company Match explore the future of personal connection through apps, it&#8217;s interesting to see what sort of ideas it tested but later discarded. One such experiment was something called &#8220;Tinder Mixer,&#8221; which had briefly offered Tinder users a way to join group video chats, and &#8220;play games&#8221; with others nearby.</p>
<p>The feature was tested for a short period of time last year in New Zealand, we understand, but will not be launching.</p>
<p>The Tinder Mixer experience was uncovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who found references the product in the Tinder Android app&#8217;s code. He had not yet publicized the finding, as we worked to learn more about the origins of the product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160545" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160545" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2160545" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_onboarding.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160545" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The resources he found in the dating app had given the appearance of a product in the midst of development, Paluzzi noted, but as it turns out it was one that had already been tested and quickly shut down as Tinder continued its other, ongoing experiments in the dating market.</p>
<p>According to Tinder, the Tinder Mixer test has no impact on its product roadmap this year, and the Tinder Mixer experience described here will likely never come into existence.</p>
<p>That said, what made the product particularly intriguing was that it saw Tinder venturing, however briefly and experimentally, into more of a social discovery space, compared with the usual Tinder experience. Typically, Tinder users swipe on daters&#8217; profiles, match, chat and sometimes even <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046122311-Face-to-Face-Video-Chat">video call</a> each other on a one-on-one basis. But live video chatting with a group is not something Tinder today offers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160546" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160546" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2160546" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?w=381" alt="" width="381" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=381,680 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_no_mixer.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160546" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>That said, the idea of going live on video is not new to Match.</p>
<p>This is an area where the company has experimented before, including with its apps Plenty of Fish, which <a href="https://blog.pof.com/2020/03/what-is-the-live-feature-on-plenty-of-fish/">offers a one-to-many video broadcasting feature</a>, and <a href="https://ablo.live/">Ablo</a>, which offers one-on-one video chats with people around the world. These experiments constitute what the company considers &#8220;dating-adjacent&#8221; experiences. In other words, you <em>could</em> meet someone through these video interactions, but that&#8217;s not necessarily their main goal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160543" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160543" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2160543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tinder_mixer_room.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160543" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>These video experiences have continued even as Match announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">$1.73 billion acquisition of Seoul-based Hyperconnect</a> &#8212; its biggest acquisition ever, and one that puts the company more on the path towards a future that involves the &#8220;social discovery&#8221; and live streaming market.</p>
<p>The company believes social discovery an area with vast potential, and a market it estimates that could be twice the size of dating, in fact.</p>
<p>Match Group CEO Shar Dubey spoke to this point recently at the JP Morgan Technology, Media and Communications Conference, noting that on some of its bigger platforms, Match has seen that a number of its users were looking for more of &#8220;a shared experience and a sense of community among other like-minded single people on the platform,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She noted that technology has reached a point where people could now interact with others through richer experiences than the traditional dating flow of swipe-match-chat allowed for, including few-to-few, many-to-many, and one-to-many type of experiences.</p>
<p>Hyperconnect brings to Match much of the technology that would allow the company to expand in these areas.</p>
<p>Today, it offers two apps, Azar and Hakuna Live, which let users to connect with one another online. The former, launched in 2014, is focused on one-on-one live video and voice chats while the latter, launched in 2019 is in the online broadcast space. Not coincidentally, these apps mirror the live stream experiences that Match has been running on Plenty of Fish and Ablo.</p>
<p>Because these live streaming services are often more heavily adopted by younger demographics, it makes sense that Match may have wanted to also test out such a live stream experience on Tinder, which also skews younger, even if the test ultimately only served as a way to collect data as opposed to informing a specific future product&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>With the Hyperconnect deal soon to be finalized, the incoming apps will initially give Match an expanded footprint in the live streaming and social discovery market in Asia &#8212; 75% of Hyperconnect&#8217;s usage and revenue comes from markets in Asia. Match then plans to leverage its international experience and knowledge to accelerate their growth in other markets where they haven&#8217;t yet broken through.</p>
<p>But another major reason for the acquisition is that Match sees the potential in deploying Hyperconnect&#8217;s technology across its existing portfolio of dating apps to not only create richer experiences but also to cater to users in markets where the &#8220;Western&#8221; way of online dating hasn&#8217;t yet been fully embraced, but social discovery has.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there is real synergy of bringing some of these experiences that are popular in social discovery platforms onto our dating platforms, as well as sort of enhance the social discovery platforms and help people get to their dating intent, should they choose to,&#8221; Dubey explained, at the JP Morgan conference.</p>
<p>What any of that may mean for Tinder, more specifically, is not yet known.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 2, 2021. It’s a good day in the tech world because former unicorn Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">is out with new features about <em>you</em></a>. Yes, the company is taking its yearly listening review to a midyear format and packing its app with even more personalized mixes. My playlists are why I won’t leave Spotify until the heat death of the universe, so I suppose it makes sense that the service is doubling down on its personalization feature set.</p>
<p>And yes, I do listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1400164730036277252">a lot of Taylor Swift in the morning</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stack-overflow-acquired-by-prosus-for-a-reported-1-8-billion/">Stack Overflow sells for $1.8B</a>: </strong>Well-known developer community and hub of copy-pastable coding snippets for software engineers of all skill levels Stack Overflow is selling itself to Prosus for nearly $2 billion. What’s Prosus? It’s part of Naspers, a South African investing group that you may have heard of. Naspers is perhaps best known for owning a large stake in Tencent.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/guild-education-valued-at-3-75-billion-with-newest-round/"><strong>Guild Education raises $150M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The company, focused on providing what TechCrunch described as “employer-sponsored learning opportunities” for employees, is now worth $3.75 billion after its latest funding round. For the burgeoning edtech startup market, the round is big news. There’s still lots of capital for tech companies tackling the various sides of the education market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/reading-the-ipo-markets-tea-leaves/"><strong>The great technology company liquidity run continues</strong></a><strong>: </strong>As well-known tech startups like Marqeta look to list, other companies are jumping on the bandwagon. TechCrunch reported this morning that fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/yieldstreet-raises-100m-as-it-mulls-going-public-via-spac-eyes-acquisitions/">Yieldstreet may go public via a SPAC</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">data-centered unicorn Confluent is also going public</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The week’s busy startup fundraising cycle continued today with a host of companies from the very earliest stages to the most mature unicorns raising capital. What follows is a selection of the day’s hottest deals. We’re starting in the world of wheels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/faction-raises-4-3m-to-deploy-3-wheeled-evs-for-driverless-delivery/"><strong>Faction raises $4.3M for three-wheeled delivery vehicles</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That are driverless, we should add. Daily Crunch is certain that, simply given the sheer amount of capital that has gone into the various projects of this sort, it will eventually work. Perhaps Faction will be the company to get it right.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/"><strong>FlixMobility raises $650M for its low-cost bus service</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you are American, you may have not heard of FlixMobility, which operates FlixBus and FlixTrain, low-cost transport services in Europe. The company is also working to expand in the U.S. For reference, the new Flix round is a Series <em>G</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/"><strong>Tier options $60M for e-scooter network</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Electric scooter shares are <em>not</em> dead, it turns out. Sure, Bird’s SPAC demonstrates how difficult the economics proved for the model in some markets, but Tier now has access to a “highly scalable asset-backed debt facility,” in the words of its CFO, to keep growing. The company also has some neat battery tech aboard its portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, today’s other rounds of note tackling a more diverse set of industries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stemma-launches-with-4-8m-seed-to-build-managed-data-catalogue/"><strong>Stemma raises $4.8M for managed Amundsen</strong></a><strong>: </strong>What’s Amundsen? Per <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron</a>, it’s a “data catalogue project that [Lyft built] to manage its massive data requirements.” And now there’s a startup offering it as a service. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">reminds me of BuildBuddy to a degree</a>, in which a startup takes on a BigCo tool, helping others access and leverage it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fintech-jeeves-emerges-from-stealth-with-131m-in-debt-equity-from-a16z-yc-and-a-bunch-of-unicorn-ceos/"><strong>$131M in total capital for Jeeves</strong></a><strong>: </strong> It’s $31 million in equity funding and $100 million in debt access, which we presume is a revolving facility of sorts because Jeeves is building a multinational expense management platform. You know, for companies that have employees everywhere. Like every single early-stage startup we talk to these days.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/divido-bags-30m-to-take-its-buy-now-pay-later-platform-to-more-markets/"><strong>Divido raises money because apparently we still need more buy now, pay later (BNPL) services</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Divido has put together a fresh $30 million round to bring its BNPL service to more markets, TechCrunch reports. The startup BNPL market has been hot because the companies in it have been doing well. But at some point we hit saturation, right? <em>Right?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>With $1.6B Depop purchase, Etsy asks, &#8216;How do you do, fellow kids?&#8217;</h2>
<p>News broke today that Etsy will buy used fashion marketplace Depop in a transaction that values the U.K.-based startup at $1.625 billion.</p>
<p>Depop showed 100% year-over-year growth to reach $70 million in revenue last year, but it&#8217;s still worth asking whether Etsy paid a premium to expand its reach into the hearts, minds and wallets of Gen Z and young millennial consumers.</p>
<p>To frame the deal&#8217;s overall value in a larger context, let&#8217;s look at revenue multiples for rivals Poshmark and ThredUp. If large e-commerce players are willing to splash out for youth-approved marketplaces, there&#8217;s a good reason why.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big Tech was super busy today, Spotify aside. Today we’re talking Amazon, Apple, Facebook, GitLab and Huawei:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/amazon-to-stop-screening-employees-for-marijuana/"><strong>Welcome to 2021, Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The American e-commerce giant is doing away with cannabis testing of its employees. Our first reaction to this news was that <em>Amazon was drug testing its employees?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/"><strong>Apple thinks highly of itself</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Apple has a study out saying that it facilitated more than a half-trillion dollars in commerce last year. We are sure that Apple really put itself to the test in coming up with the number.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook does two things that don’t suck:</strong> Today Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-opens-its-messenger-api-for-instagram-to-all-businesses/">opened up its Messenger API to all companies</a>, which is good. And Big Blue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-to-launch-a-researcher-api-for-the-academic-community/">put together a research API</a>. Both are good things from Zuck’s empire. Which is nice to say for once.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/gitlab-acquires-unreview-as-it-looks-to-bring-more-ml-tools-to-its-platform/"><strong>GitLab buys UnReview</strong></a><strong>:</strong> GitLab is north of $100 million in revenue and is slated for an eventual IPO, so it’s big enough to warrant inclusion in this section. Regardless, the GitHub competitor has bought a startup that “helps software teams recommend the best reviewers for when developers want to check in their latest code” using machine learning. Honestly, that sounds cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones/"><strong>Huawei’s new OS loves Android</strong></a><strong>:</strong> TechCrunch has lots of details on HarmonyOS, the new operating system from Huawei. It turns out that it <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/02/huawei-harmonyos-android-launch/">uses some Android code</a>. All hail Google, we suppose.</li>
</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Would you like to work with private equity and venture capital funds?</p>
<p>There are relatively few jobs directly inside private equity and venture capital funds, and those jobs are highly competitive. However, there are many other ways you can work and earn money within the industry — as a consultant, an interim executive, a board member, a deal executive partnering to buy a company, an executive in residence or as an entrepreneur in residence.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists often have an operations background. However, historically most private equity professionals were former investment bankers and other finance professionals. Then private equity players gradually realized that value cannot be created through financial engineering alone. A <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2016/private-equity-power-of-buy-build">BCG study</a> of 121 investments found that operational improvement drives 48% of value creation in PE-backed companies<strong>. </strong>PE funds now almost always require an upgrade in management and change management teams if necessary.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the tighter your relationship with the firm, the more money you will earn:</p>

<p>At <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a>, we’ve used all these models. We are soon launching <a href="https://versatilevc.com/fnm/">Founders’ Next Move</a>, a selective, free community for founders researching their next move, which will be a key tool for working with outside talent.</p>
<p>The simplest path forward is to identify funds in your industry of expertise and reach out. You can explore all of the models below with them. First, start by identifying the firms that invest in companies that you&#8217;ve worked with. Then, more broadly, look for investors in the industries in which you have expertise. You can identify institutional investors through one of multiple online databases:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the different ways you can work with the investment community.</p>
<h2>Expert networks</h2>
<p>Expert network firms source subject matter experts from various domains and pair them with clients seeking topical or industry insights. They typically charge clients up to <a href="https://eninsider.com/expert-networks-compared-how-do-expert-networks-charge-their-clients/">$1,200 per hour</a>, and pay the expert $100 to $500 an hour. I founded Circle of Experts, an expert network that I <a href="https://teten.com/evalueserve-acquires-nitron-advisor">sold</a> to Evalueserve.</p>
<p>The expert network industry has grown an average <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/expert-networks-industry/#:~:text=poll%20Average%20industry%20growth%202015%E2%80%932020%3A%204.5%25&amp;text=Over%20the%20five%20years%20to,of%204.5%25%20to%20%24958.6%20million.">4.5% annually</a> between 2015 and 2020, its market size topping <a href="https://inex.one/blog/expert-network-market-size">$1.3 billion</a> in 2020. While the major clients were initially hedge funds and private equity firms, consulting firms now comprise 32% of total demand for expert network services.</p>
<p>Inex One, an expert network marketplace, has compiled a list of <a href="https://inex.one/expert-network-directory">80 expert networks</a>, summarized in the graphic below:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160121" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160121" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2160121 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png" alt="80 expert networks" width="1200" height="774" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160121" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Inex One and Integrity Research</p></div></p>
<p>The largest expert networks include: <a href="https://glginsights.com/">GLG</a>, which accounts for approximately <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/expert-networks-industry/#:~:text=poll%20Average%20industry%20growth%202015%E2%80%932020%3A%204.5%25&amp;text=Over%20the%20five%20years%20to,of%204.5%25%20to%20%24958.6%20million.">50%</a> of the industry’s revenue; <a href="https://www.alphasights.com/">AlphaSights</a> is the second biggest generalist expert network; <a href="https://www.guidepoint.com/services/">Guidepoint</a> services six major categories of clients globally across several industries; and <a href="https://thirdbridge.com/about-us/">Third Bridge</a> hires and retains talent to &#8220;democratize the world’s human insights and upend the traditional research model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other notable expert networks include <a href="https://www.atheneum.ai/our-story/">Atheneum Partners</a>, <a href="https://colemanrg.com/about-us">Coleman Research Group</a>, <a href="https://dialecticanet.com/">Dialectica</a>, <a href="https://www.eng-llc.com/">ENG</a>, <a href="https://lynk.global/">Lynk Global</a>, <a href="https://mosaicrm.com/advisors">Mosaic</a>, <a href="https://www.prescouter.com/about-us/">PreScouter</a>, <a href="https://prosapient.com/">ProSapient</a> and <a href="https://www.tegus.co/">Tegus</a>. There are also expert networks with sector or geography specialization. For example, <a href="https://www.sermo.com/about/">SERMO </a>is a global social media network for physicians to exchange knowledge and share challenging patient cases, and <a href="https://clarity.fm/">Clarity.fm</a> connects startups to experts in building new businesses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Protesters gathered in bright red t-shirts and matching masks bearing the Independent Drivers Guild logo. Placards bearing slogans like “Freeze Hiring, Reactive Workers Now!” and “Unlock Uber” were being handed out at a table toward the entrance. What the gathering lacked in sheer numbers, it made up with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A wide range of speakers approached the podium &#8212; IDG members, drivers, local and prospective politicians. Nearly every speech was followed by a spirited call and response from the crowd, culminating in pro-union chants.</p>
<p>Previous protests have found drivers opting for other locations &#8212; perhaps most notably in 2019, when Brooklyn Bridge traffic toward the mayor’s residence at Gracie Mansion was <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/09/17/uber-lyft-drivers-protest/">slowed to a crawl</a>. Today’s location was perfectly suited for such an event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2160241" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160241" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160241" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160241" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The gathering was framed by <a href="http://jrtrealty.com/uber-expands-36k-sf-falchi-building-lic/">the Falchi Building</a>, a large office space in Queens, New York, housing some 36,000 square feet of Uber offices. The neighborhood of Long Island City has long served as an epicenter for the city’s ridesharing operations. Lyft has offices nearby, as does the Taxi Limousine Commission (TLC). Walk down a block or two and you’ll almost certainly stumble across rows upon rows of yellow cabs.</p>
<p>The concerns of gig workers are nothing new, of course, but today’s crowd gathered in Long Island City, Queens to add support to a proposed bill currently making its way through the state legislature in Albany. The legislation is designed to make it easy for gig economy workers in the state to unionize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, the gig workers have no voice in their workplace. No voice to negotiate pay or benefits of workplace policies,&#8221; bill sponsor state Sen. Diane Savino of Staten Island explained in <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2021/05/28/bill-to-unionize-gig-workers-may-fall-short-in-albany">a recent interview</a>. &#8220;And I have been talking about this issue for several years now. The world of work is changing, and labor law has not caught up to technology and how it has changed the world of work.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160238" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Such legislation would have a profound impact on not just ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft, but also a wide range of gig economy jobs, including food delivery services like Seamless. The gig economy has experienced explosive growth over the past decade, in many cases accelerated by the pandemic, as more people have relied on delivery and other services amid shutdowns. But the complaints remain the same: As corporations thrive on the backs of contractors, these workers too seldom receive the benefit of that growth.</p>
<p>The already complex math of being a driver in a city like New York is further compounded by a series of regulations that largely exist to support its once-thriving taxi business.</p>
<p>Tamina Ahmed, a member of the NYC Rideshare Club and registered nurse who has also worked as a driver for six years, cites the flexible hours as a net benefit for workers, but notes the rather intensive process required to start driving in NYC.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160230" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160230" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160230" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>“That takes a lot time, funds and energy for the drivers,” Ahmed told TechCrunch after speaking at the event. “They have to sacrifice to get to this point, and it’s not right for them to be deactivated without cause. They don’t give valid reason. They just deactivate them. They’re never on the driver’s side. They’re always on the rider’s side.”</p>
<p>The group present at the protest seems optimistic about Savino’s proposed legislation. The ability to unionize brings certain protections to gig workers, include wages, discrimination protection and unemployment benefits. The latter is even more timely these days, as some<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-benefits-gig-workers-republican-states/"> one million gig employees in 20 Republican-controlled states</a> will be losing Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits soon. Prop 22, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/">which passed in California last November</a>, has been seen as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">another major precedent setting legislation</a> for the industry.</p>
<p>With the legislative session ended this month, many are expecting action on Savino’s proposed bill. But not everyone is thrilled with what it offers. “[T]he biggest concern I have is that workers won’t have employee status,&#8221; State Senate Labor Committee Chair <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2021/05/28/bill-to-unionize-gig-workers-may-fall-short-in-albany">Jessica Ramos told NY1</a>. &#8220;And more than that, Uber and Lyft drivers&#8217; pay would be slashed in half. It’s very unfortunate that they crafted this bill without the workers at the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Savino&#8217;s office for additional comment.</p>

<p>Among those I spoke with at the event, employee status wasn’t high on the list of demands. In fact, a number of drivers told me that the flexibility the current model affords them. Ramos’ name appeared on a number of the protest placards at the event, largely in a negative light. It’s a complex issue, certainly &#8212; only exacerbated by the large number of residents any legislation would impact. The rise of the gig economy has brought a number of key questions relating to the connection between worker protections and employee status to the fore.</p>

<p>What seems clear across the board, however, is that these drivers &#8212; and other gig economy workers &#8212; are seeking what, in many other industries, have become fairly fundamental protections. Of late, unionization has become a major talking point for blue and white-collar workers, alike. Efforts have seen a number of wins over the past few years, though April’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/"> failure to unionize employees</a> at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama has been seen as a major setback for the cause.</p>
<p>Like those workers, the list of complaints among drivers is long. When a speaker at today’s event asked the crowd how many in attendance had had their accounts deactivated, the response was overwhelming. Many believed the decisions were made fairly arbitrarily.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160243" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160243" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160243" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160243" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>“A lot of drivers are falsely being accused, deactivated, thrown out of all these rideshare companies that they invested so much money on,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>The Independent Drivers Guild &#8212; which organized today’s event along with the NYC Rideshare Club and the Chinese Delivery Association &#8212; isn’t mincing words.</p>
<p>“By helping drivers through deactivated systems, we realized only a true union can solve that problem,” Aziz Bah, IDG organizing director, told TechCrunch. “We decided to unionize. We will let the companies know what our plans are. They had better be behind our proposal. Because this is no negotiation. If this is what drivers and delivery workers want, they had better be behind it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity giant FireEye has agreed to sell its products business to a consortium led by private equity firm Symphony Technology Group for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The all-cash deal will split FireEye, the maker of network and email cybersecurity products, from its digital forensics and incident response arm Mandiant.</p>
<p>FireEye&#8217;s chief executive Kevin Mandia said the deal unlocks its &#8220;high-growth&#8221; Mandiant business, allowing it to stand alone as a separate business running incident response and security testing.</p>
<p>The move to split the two companies comes almost a decade after FireEye acquired Mandiant, and made Mandia chief executive.</p>
<p>Mandia said: &#8220;STG’s focus on fueling innovative market leaders in software and cybersecurity makes them an ideal partner for FireEye Products. We look forward to our relationship and collaboration on threat intelligence and expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>STG managing partner William Chisholm said there is an &#8220;enormous untapped opportunity for the business that we are excited to crystallize by leveraging our significant security software sector experience and our market leading carve-out expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said the deal is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>FireEye has become one of the more prominent names in cybersecurity, known for its research into hacking groups — some linked to governments — and its Mandiant unit for responding to major security incidents. Mandiant was called in to help Colonial Pipeline recover from a recent ransomware attack.</p>
<p>In December, FireEye admitted that its own networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">had been hacked</a>, a move praised across the cybersecurity industry for helping to speed up efforts that led to the discovery of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the SolarWinds espionage attack</a>, later attributed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">Russian foreign intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>FireEye becomes the latest cybersecurity giant in STG&#8217;s portfolio. In March, Symphony bought McAfee&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-sells-enterprise-biz-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4b/">enterprise business</a> for $4 billion, and last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">bought RSA</a> for $2 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is looking to crowdsource its way out of misinformation woes with its new product Birdwatch which taps a network of engaged tweeters to add notes to misleading tweets. Today, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1400150143693950977?s=20">announced</a> that they are starting to roll out the Birdwatch notes to pilot participants across iOS, Android and desktop.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">launched a pilot version</a> of the program back in January, describing the effort as a way to add context to misinformation in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable&#8221; Product VP Keith Coleman wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">blog post</a> at the time. &#8220;Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That time is apparently now for an early set of Birdwatch pilot participants.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey there! Exciting news <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Now, when you’re browsing Twitter on Android, iOS, or <a href="https://t.co/lEjTtR4BGM">https://t.co/lEjTtR4BGM</a>, you may see Tweets with Birdwatch notes. Notes will appear in a card on the Tweet. Right now, this feature is only visible to pilot participants. <a href="https://t.co/dyMHgawLUl">pic.twitter.com/dyMHgawLUl</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Birdwatch (@birdwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1400150143693950977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says that once Birdwatch notes are added to a tweet, users will have the opportunity to rate whether the feedback is helpful or not. If none of the replies are deemed helpful, the Birdwatch card itself will disappear, but if any notes are deemed helpful they&#8217;ll pop up directly inside the tweet.</p>
<p>There have been an awful lot of questions about how and whether Birdwatch will work inside the current social media framework. Using community feedback differs from more centralized efforts used by platforms like Facebook that have tapped independent fact-checking organizations. Twitter is clearly aiming to decentralize this effort as much as it can and put power in the hands of Birdwatch contributors, but with audiences of individual tweeters currently responsible for deeming the helpfulness and visibility of fact checks, it&#8217;s clear this is going to be a pretty messy solution at times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://cloudera.com">Cloudera</a> announced its sale to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">a pair of private equity firms yesterday</a> for $5.3 billion, along with a couple of acquisitions of its own, the company detailed a new path that could help it drive back toward relevance in the big data market.</p>
<p>When the company launched in 2008, Hadoop was in its early days. The open-source project developed at Yahoo three years earlier was built to deal with the large amounts of data that the internet pioneer generated. It became increasingly clear over time that every company would have to deal with growing data stores, and it seemed that Cloudera was in the right market at the right time.</p>
<p>And for a while things went well. Cloudera rode the Hadoop startup wave, garnering a cool billion in funding along the way, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/31/intel-pours-740m-into-cloudera-in-exchange-for-an-18-stake/">stunning $740 million check</a> from Intel Capital in 2014. It then went<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/cloudera-finishes-up-20-in-stock-market-debut/"> public in 2018</a> to much fanfare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the markets had already started to shift by the time of its public debut. Hadoop, a highly labor-intensive way to manage data, was being supplanted by cheaper and less complex cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The excitement around the original promise of the Hadoop market has contracted significantly. It’s incredibly expensive and complex to get it working effectively in an enterprise context,&#8221; Casey Aylward, an investor at Costanoa Ventures told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company likely saw that writing on the wall when it merged with another Hadoop-based company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/cloudera-and-hortonworks-announce-5-2-billion-merger/"> Hortonworks, in 2019</a>. That transaction valued the combined entity at $5.2 billion, almost the same amount it sold for yesterday, two years down the road. The decision to sell and go private may also have been spurred by <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/08/12/activist-investor-carl-icahn-shakes-cloudera/">Carl Icahn buying an 18% stake</a> in the company that same year.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Cloudera&#8217;s sale could provide the enterprise unicorn room as it regroups.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies, sees the deal as a positive step for the company. &#8220;I think this is good news for Cloudera because it now has the capital and flexibility to dive head first into SaaS. The company invented the entire concept of a data life cycle, implemented initially on premises, then extended to private and public clouds,&#8221; Moorhead said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="z4M8wS9EoH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/how-to-ensure-quality-in-the-era-of-big-data/">How to ensure data quality in the era of Big Data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to ensure data quality in the era of Big Data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/how-to-ensure-quality-in-the-era-of-big-data/embed/#?secret=z4M8wS9EoH" data-secret="z4M8wS9EoH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adam Ronthal, Gartner Research VP, agrees that it at least gives Cloudera more room to make necessary adjustments to its market strategy as long as it doesn&#8217;t get stifled by its private equity overlords. &#8220;It should give Cloudera an opportunity to focus on their future direction with increased flexibility &#8212; provided they are able to invest in that future and that this does not just focus on cost cutting and maximizing profits. Maintaining a culture of innovation will be key,&#8221; Ronthal said.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the two purchases Cloudera also announced as part of its news package.</p>
<p>If you want to change direction in a hurry, there are worse ways than via acquisitions. And grabbing Datacoral and Cazena should help Cloudera alter its course more quickly than it could have managed on its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] two acquisitions will help Cloudera capture some of the value on top of the lake storage layer &#8212; perhaps moving into different data management features and/or expanding into the compute layer for analytics and AI/ML use cases, where there has been a lot of growth and excitement in recent years,&#8221; Aylward said.</p>
<p>Chandana Gopal, research director for the future of intelligence at IDC, agrees that the transactions give Cloudera some more modern options that could help speed up the data-wrangling process. &#8220;Both the acquisitions are geared towards making the management of cloud infrastructure easier for end-users. Our research shows that data prep and integration takes 70%-80% of an analyst&#8217;s time versus the time spent in actual analysis. It seems like both these companies&#8217; products will provide technology to improve the data integration/preparation experience,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company couldn&#8217;t stay on the path it was on forever, certainly not with an activist investor breathing down its neck. Its recent efforts could give it the time away from public markets it needs to regroup. How successful Cloudera&#8217;s turnaround proves to be will depend on whether the private equity companies buying it can both agree on the direction and strategy for the company, while providing the necessary resources to push the company in a new direction. All of that and more will determine if these moves pay off in the end.</p>

<p>For the past several months or so, I&#8217;ve been writing an accompanying post to editions of the Gillmor Gang. Due to production issues, I&#8217;m usually at least a week behind the recording session for the target show. This originally seemed like an impediment to the process of enhancing the impact of the show, but over time and various attempts to solve the out-of-sync timing problem, I began to see the delay actually produced some interesting context to the original recording. First and foremost, what seemed important weeks earlier became more nuanced as things developed — or often didn&#8217;t. Politics seemed loud and unprecedented in the moment; 10 days later, the ups and downs of the graph smoothed out the drama and accentuated the relative stability of intuitive analysis.</p>
<p>This in turn isolated some of the conflicts and pressure the media perceived as central to its ability to fund journalism, or more accurately nonfictional novelistic engagement and eyeball maintenance. And produced a wave of antagonism toward this repetitive ginned-up sawtooth of anger and despair. As the vaccines began to take root, we slowly but surely confirmed that we really didn&#8217;t have to live that way. Streaming and notifications are now in the process of moving into the mainstream, with media companies climbing into bed with tech giants and hybrid venture catalysts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cracks in this new infrastructure threaten to slow down the requisite belief that these changes will stick. Clubhouse seems to be going through a bloating effect on its gateway page; what once was a short list of 5 or 6 rooms now balloons to 20 or more entries. Topics, never my favorite mechanism for discovery, nail many of these conversations to the wall and move away from the underlying name intersections that suggest emergent themes rather than sandblasting them into the stage. Release notes of updates suggest the analytics are being mined for improvements to the differentiation with vanilla podcasts, but how they are surfaced is time sensitive to the momentum of the platform. The good news is that healthy injections from the founder and venture team will keep things afloat while we see the impact of the Android client. Competitive pressure, particularly from Kara Swisher on Twitter Spaces, will also help integrate mainstream and newsletter media with streaming audio innovation.</p>
<p>At a broader level, acquisitions and merger/alliances are recasting media companies as hybrid gorillas. Although AT&amp;T is positioned by many as backing out of their foray into content, a more interesting dynamic is the combination of WarnerMedia scripted assets with Discovery&#8217;s sports and reality programming in an ad-supported streaming bundle. It&#8217;s reminiscent of the formation of MGM in the early days of Hollywood, blending a small beleaguered studio, Metro Pictures, with Sam Goldwyn&#8217;s independent near-bankrupt studio, firing Goldwyn but keeping the name, and installing a third studio&#8217;s Louis B. Mayer and his production head Irving Thalberg as executives of the bundled company. Not so coincidentally, it was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was acquired by Amazon a few days later, bringing its library of the James Bond franchise, more than 4,000 classic films, and 17, 000 television properties to Prime&#8217;s 175 million active subscribers.</p>
<p>At various times, MGM and its United Artists acquisition have been bought and resold as power switched first from theaters to television and then to cable. Ted Turner famously bought the library and played it off on its Turner Classic Movies channel. Now the pandemic&#8217;s call to action has propelled digital transformation to the fore, and tossed yet another mix of the puzzle pieces into play. But MGM&#8217;s collapse in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s and the auctioning off of its backlot to real estate developers suggests something similar might be happening today with broadcast television networks losing out one by one when the music stops playing in this corporate game of musical chairs. Cable news may be blocked out if antitrust regulators refuse attempts to merge the new Warners Discovery with Comcast, the former now home for CNN and the latter MSNBC. Regulators will likely frown on two of the remaining 3 broadcast networks merging with a Viacom/CBS and Comcast /NBC/Universal deal.</p>
<p>Instead, the tech networks and their burgeoning social audio/newsletter platforms will virtualize the big studio model. Cable news will move from podcasts through Clubhouse and Spaces to newsletter brands, building tentpole events around technology news, innovations coverage, and startup deal flow. The scale of big incumbents like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon will produce 5,000+ executive interviews, with independent analysis from break-away blogs and newsletters looking a lot like a merger of MSNBC and CNBC. Apple and Spotify will emulate the ad-supported free tiers of their streaming networks to unbundle the music companies from their captive back catalogues and create a hybrid live performance promotional Top Forty for the play-from-anywhere crowd. The Marvel, DC, Star Wars cinematic universes will use the digital tier to promote theatrical experiences as the pandemic moves overseas and hopefully is suppressed globally over 2022. Politics, a trailing indicator, will be the arbiter of how quickly we can rearchitect in infrastructure, health care, and an equitable working majority rule of law. By then, maybe I can take a 3D VR trip through the MGM backlot and dream that this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With wildfires becoming an ever more devastating annual phenomenon, it is in the whole planet&#8217;s interest to spot them and respond as early as possible — and the best vantage point for that is space. OroraTech is a German startup building a constellation of small satellites to power a global wildfire warning system, and will be using <a href="https://ororatech.com/2021/06/01/ororatech-successfully-closes-e5-8m-series-a-to-launch-first-satellites-to-tackle-global-wildfire-and-climate-crisis/">a freshly raised €5.8 million (~$7 million) A round</a> to kick things off.</p>
<p>Wildfires destroy tens of millions of acres of forest every year, causing immense harm to people and the planet in countless ways. Once they&#8217;ve grown to a certain size, they&#8217;re near impossible to stop, so the earlier they can be located and worked against, the better.</p>
<p>But these fires can start just about anywhere in a dried out forest hundreds of miles wide, and literally every minute and hour counts — watch towers, helicopter flights and other frequently used methods may not be fast or exact enough to effectively counteract this increasingly serious threat. Not to mention they&#8217;re expensive and often dangerous jobs for those who perform them.</p>
<p>OroraTech&#8217;s plan is to use a constellation of about 100 satellites equipped with custom infrared cameras to watch the entire globe (or at least the parts most likely to burst into flame) at once, reporting any fire bigger than 10 meters across within half an hour.</p>

<p>To start out with, the Bavarian company has used data from over a dozen satellites already in space, in order to prove out the service on the ground. But with this funding round they are set to put their own bird in the air, a shoebox-sized satellite with a custom infrared sensor that will be <a href="https://spire.com/press-release/leading-wildfire-monitoring-provider-ororatech-partners-with-spire-to-launch-first-satellite-in-2021/">launched by Spire later this year.</a> Onboard machine learning processing of this imagery simplifies the downstream process.</p>
<p>Fourteen more satellites are planned for launch by 2023, presumably once they&#8217;ve kicked the proverbial tires on the first one and come up with the inevitable improvements.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to cover even more regions in the future and to be able to give warning earlier, we aim to launch our own specialized satellite constellation into orbit,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Thomas Grübler in a press release. &#8220;We are therefore delighted to have renowned investors on board to support us with capital and technological know-how in implementing our plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160456" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160456" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2160456 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg" alt="Mockup of an OroraTech Earth imaging satellite in space." width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg 1331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2160456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OroraTech</p></div></p>
<p>Those renowned investors consist of Findus Venture and Ananda Impact Ventures, which led the round, followed by APEX Ventures, BayernKapital, Clemens Kaiser, SpaceTec Capital and Ingo Baumann. The company was spun out of research done by the founders at TUM, which maintains an interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely remarkable what they have built up and achieved so far despite limited financial resources and we feel very proud that we are allowed to be part of this inspiring and ambitious NewSpace project,” APEX&#8217;s Wolfgang Neubert said, and indeed it&#8217;s impressive to have a leading space-based data service with little cash (it raised an undisclosed seed about a year ago) and no satellites.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only company doing infrared imagery of the Earth&#8217;s surface; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/">SatelliteVu recently raised money</a> to launch its own, much smaller constellation, though it&#8217;s focused on monitoring cities and other high-interest areas, not the vast expanse of forests. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/spacetech-startup-constellr-that-can-monitor-land-surface-temperatures-raises-e1m-pre-seed-round/">ConstellR</a> is aimed (literally) at the farming world, monitoring fields for precision crop management.</p>
<p>With money in its pocket Orora can expand and start providing its improved detection services, though sadly, it likely won&#8217;t be upgrading before wildfire season hits the northern hemisphere this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be over, but HBO Max is still breaking new ground, and even breaking the internet &#8212; this past weekend, HBO Max </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/hbo-max-blacks-out-before-much-anticipated-mare-of-easttown-finale-1234766720/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blacked out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right before the finale of &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mare of Easttown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; likely due to traffic. But if you haven’t hopped aboard the HBO Max train yet, it might be time to try it out. Today, the streaming platform premieres an ad-supported subscription at $9.99 per month. Its existing service &#8212; which features no ads &#8212; costs $14.99 per month. Subscribers can save 15% on their subscription, no matter which version they choose, if they pre-pay for an entire year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advertisements aren’t the only drawback of the more affordable subscription option. The ad-supported tier offers a maximum quality of 1080p, which is still pretty good for most consumers, unless you&#8217;re watching “Friends: The Reunion” in your 4K home theater. But, lower-tier subscribers won’t be able to download content to view offline, nor will they have access to same-day film premieres of Warner Bros.’s newest theatrical releases. However, these films will become available to stream months after release. On the bright side, ads will not appear on original HBO programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just four minutes of ad time per hour, the ad-supported tier “</span><a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/new-hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-available-today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launches with a commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to maintaining the lowest volume of commercials among popular streaming services. HBO Max follows in the footsteps of Hulu, which also offers a discounted subscription with ads for $5.99 per month, as opposed to $11.99 per month. But on Hulu, a half-hour show can contain </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-premium-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost five minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of unskippable ad time. Meanwhile, Netflix offers its most basic plan &#8212; which allows streaming on one screen at a time without HD &#8212; for $8.99 per month. Its standard plan is $13.99 a month. Now that HBO Max has a more competitively priced option, it might give these other platforms a run for their money. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kinds of ads can you expect to see on HBO Max? The company says that subscribers can expect “a greater personalization in the ads they see” over time, with “more innovation in formats to come.” This could resemble the ad experience on Hulu, which has experimented with viewer-friendly </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/hulu-launches-its-viewer-friendly-binge-watch-ads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">binge-watch ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our most exciting ad format for launch is Brand Block, which allows brands to own a block of content and consumers to delight in a limited commercial experience,&#8221; said Julian Franco, the vice president of Product Management at HBO Max. &#8220;We’re exploring a number of new formats in the future, including pause ads and a branded discovery format that allows brand partners to sponsor custom content curations.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as ad personalization goes, Franco added, &#8220;We’ve created a variety of product tools including new data ingestion pipelines to help power our dashboards and real-time reporting and the ability to test and pair specific cohorts of customers with specific ad break patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of April 2021, HBO Max and HBO reached a combined <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-hbo-reaches-44-2-million-subscribers-4165569/">44.2 million subscribers</a>, and in Q1 of the year, added <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/zack-snyders-justice-league-did-little-to-boost-hbo-max-subscriptions.html">2.7 million domestic subscribers</a>. By comparison, Netflix reported an increase of 4 million subscribers in the same period, bringing them to about 207 million global subscribers. However, only 450,000 of those new subscribers come from the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>On June 29, HBO Max will launch in 39 Latin American markets. Later in the year, the streaming service is expected to roll out in Europe. This will only further the platform&#8217;s rapid growth &#8212; in 2019, AT&amp;T, which owns HBO Max, set the modest goal to attain 50 million subscribers by 2025. Now, HBO Max expects it will reach between <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/att-expects-120-million-to-150-million-hbo-max-subs-by-end-of-2025.html">120 million and 150 million subscribers</a> by the same date.</p>
<p>The ad-supported subscription option for HBO Max is available now.</p>
<p><em>Update 6/2/21, 4:47 PM EST with comment from HBO Max</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Confluent became the latest company to announce its intent to take the IPO route, officially filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001699838/000119312521178773/d63025ds1.htm">its S-1 paperwork</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week. The company, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confluent">raised over $455 million</a> since it launched in 2014, was most recently valued at just over $4.5 billion when it raised $250 million last April.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			What we can see in Confluent is nearly an old-school, high-burn SaaS business. It has taken on oodles of capital and used it in an increasingly expensive sales model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What does Confluent do? It built a streaming data platform on top of the open-source Apache Kafka project. In addition to its open-source roots, Confluent has a free tier of its commercial cloud offering to complement its paid products, helping generate top-of-funnel inflows that it converts to sales.</p>
<p>Kafka itself emerged from a LinkedIn internal project in 2011. As we wrote at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/confluent-raises-50m-to-continue-growing-commercial-arm-of-apache-kafka/">Confluent’s $50 million Series C in 2017</a>, the open-source project was designed to move massive amounts of data at the professional social network:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Kafka is simply a messaging system, created originally at LinkedIn, that’s been designed from the ground up to move massive amounts of data smoothly around the enterprise from application to application, system to system or on-prem to cloud — and deal with extremely high message volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confluent CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-raises-a-125m-series-d-funding-round/">wrote at the time of the funding</a> that events streaming is at the core of every business, reaching sales and other core business activities that occur in real time that go beyond storing data in a database after the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;[D]atabases have long helped to store the current state of the world, but we think this is only half of the story. What is missing are the continually flowing stream of events that represents everything happening in a company, and that can act as the lifeblood of its operation,” he wrote.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Confluent comes in.</p>
<p>But enough about the technology. Is Confluent’s work with Kafka a good business? Let’s find out.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
