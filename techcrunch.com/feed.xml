										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hepster.com/">Hepster</a>, an insurtech platform from Germany, has raised $10 million in a Series A funding led by Element Ventures. Also participating was Seventure Partners, MBMV, and GPS Ventures, as well as previous investors. The funds will be used to broaden the Hepster insurance ecosystem and scale up its network, with an emphasis on automation.</p>
<p>The German insurance market is famously slow at adopting new practices, and Hepster is part of a new wave of insurtech startups in the country taking advantage of this. It allows businesses to build insurance policies from scratch, matched specifically to the needs of their individual service or industry. E-commerce players, for instance, can then embed these insurance products into the e-commerce journey.</p>
<p>Its products are therefore better suited to the new sector of, for example, shared e-bike schemes and peer-to-peer rental platforms, which are rarely covered by traditional brokers in Germany. However, it also caters to traditional, established industries as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now has more than 700 partners, including European bike retailers and rental companies Greenstorm Mobility and Baron Mobility, as well as Berlin-based cargo bike provider Citkar and Munich e-bike startup SUSHI.</p>
<p>Christian Range, Hepster co-founder and CEO, said in a statement: “Hepster is now a key player within the European insurance market. Our state-of-the-art technology with our API-driven ecosystem, as well as our highly service-oriented approach, sets us apart.” </p>
<p>In interview, he told me: “Germany is the toughest market with the most regulations, the most laws. We have a saying in Germany if you can make it in Germany, you can make it everywhere. Also, it&#8217;s a big market in terms of selling insurance products because Germans really like insurance in every regard. So there is huge market potential in Germany I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael McFadgen, partner at Element Ventures, said: “As new industries and business models emerge, companies need much more flexible insurance propositions than what is currently being offered by traditional brokers. Hepster is the breakout company in the space, and their focus on embedded insurance will pay dividends in years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html">announced</a> that its Chrome browser is moving to a faster release cycle by shipping a new milestone every four weeks instead of the current six-week cycle (with a bi-weekly security patch). That&#8217;s one way to hasten the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>, I guess, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Mozilla also moved to a four-week cycle for Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/moving-firefox-to-a-faster-4-week-release-cycle/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we have improved our testing and release processes for Chrome, and deployed bi-weekly security updates to improve our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/security-dev/c/fbiuFbW07vI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch gap</a>, it became clear that we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly,&#8221; the Chrome team explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Google, however, also acknowledges that not everybody wants to move this quickly &#8212; especially in the enterprise. For those users, Google is adding a new Extended Stable option with updates that come every eight weeks. This feature will be available to enterprise admins and Chromium embedders. They will still get security updates on a bi-weekly schedule, but Google notes that &#8220;those updates won’t contain new features or all security fixes that the 4 week option will receive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new four-week cycle will start with Chrome 94 in Q3 2021, and at this faster rate, we&#8217;ll see Chrome 100 launch into the stable channel by March 29, 2022. I expect there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/6ug6Bbc6diA?t=166">cake</a>.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been thinking about creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am one: I put out an e-book on Gumroad about cold emailing. That is actually the low point of creativity in my whole life, considering I think I have it in me to be a scriptwriter, a stand-up artist or at least a mediocre YouTuber. I created a piece of art about spamming. What a fall!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are successful creators, unlike me. But what makes them succeed, and how should brands work with them? Let’s get the definitions in place first.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators create and hence have an influence over their fans. Influencers exist. That’s the working definition we’ll go with.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Where brands go astray is when they expect creators to obtain products for their brands in the way that influencers do.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands work with influencers all the time. It doesn’t take a special skill to have a rotund posterior on which a wine glass can be balanced. Most of us don’t try such things. Yet some do, post it on Instagram and build multibillion-dollar fashion brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s art if an influencer does it. You and I have no business here, but brands embrace such influencers. Influencers monetize eyeballs directly (through brand partnerships) or through platform ad revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators are morally superior — they earnestly create good, mediocre or bad content/art/internet moments through their good, bad or mediocre skills. That builds a niche fan following. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They monetize through ads, brand partnerships or subscriptions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where brands go astray is when they expect creators to obtain products for their brands in the way that influencers do. Influencers influence. Creators endear themselves to their audience. Creators evolve and their audience base evolves along with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a framework for how brands can think about creator relationships and how to set goals for such relationships.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s call it FFS (Fan Follower Strength <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f926-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) Framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans of a creator manifest their liking for the creator in one of these ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appreciate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adulate</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the scale of the audience base and their fan following strength, creators&#8217; alternative revenue streams could be anywhere between that of a guy who does the opening act at an obscure club&#8217;s stand-up night to that of a cult founder.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120963" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120963" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png" alt="fan following strength the fan following framework" width="750" height="520" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fan-Following-Strength-The-FFS-Framework.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ashwin Ramasamy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much influence a creator has depends on the distribution of fans they have in these stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more adulation they get, the more they are ready to carry a brand or monetize on their own. While the number of fans decides the scale of an outcome (exposure, sales, etc.), at any scale a creator can monetize if they have more fans in the advocate or adulate stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brand has to choose its creators both on the scale and the goals they have for the relationship.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t4argOdQsk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">RIBS: The messaging framework for every company and product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RIBS: The messaging framework for every company and product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/embed/#?secret=t4argOdQsk" data-secret="t4argOdQsk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A creator with millions of merely appreciative followers could be good for brand exposure but not immediate sales, whereas a niche creator who receives great adulation from their audience could not just move products but move their audience to visit your store to buy a product they promote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such creators &#8212; if they are able to maintain a high proportion of advocates and adulatory followers as they hit scale &#8212; could launch their own brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship becomes troublesome when brands simply look at influencer marketing metrics (engagement, clicks, etc.) and ignore the FFS metrics (intensity of fan following as measured from comments, organic shares and engagement for those shares; the shelf life of the content measured by the longevity of comment interaction; fanfic creations around the creator’s content or about the creator, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the understanding of FFS metrics, brands end up partnering with creators at a life stage that could be incompatible with brand goals. A creator with a huge following does not automatically translate to sales if their fan following strength is skewed more toward appreciation than advocacy or adulation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/tiktoks-new-qa-feature-lets-creators-respond-to-fan-questions-using-text-or-video/">was spotted testing</a> a new Q&amp;A feature that would allow creators to more directly respond to their audience&#8217;s questions using either text or video. Today, the company has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-q-and-a">announced</a> the feature is now available to all users globally. With the release of TikTok Q&amp;A, as the feature is officially called, creators will be able to designate their comments as Q&amp;A questions, respond to questions with either text comments or video replies, and add a Q&amp;A profile link to their bios, among other things. The feature also works with live videos.</p>
<p>TikTok Q&amp;A grew out of a way that creators were already using the video platform to interact with viewers. Often, after posting a video, viewers would have follow-up questions about the content. Creators would then either respond to those questions in the comments section or, if the response was more involved, they might post a second video instead.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A feature essentially formalizes this process by making it easier for creators &#8212; particularly those with a lot of fans &#8212; to identify and answer the most interesting questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121123" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121123" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121123" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="285" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png 2816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=768,322 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=680,285 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=1536,645 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=2048,860 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/a171f7e7f92ff3e9043f3ee8ec06c245.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121123" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>To use Q&amp;A, viewers will first designate their comment as a Q&amp;A question using a new commenting option. To do so, they&#8217;ll tap the Q&amp;A icon to the right side of the text entry field in comments. This will also label their comment with the icon and text that says &#8220;Asked by&#8221; followed by the username of the person asking the question. This makes it easier for creators to see when scanning through a long list of comments on their video.</p>
<p>The feature will also feed the question into the creator&#8217;s new Q&amp;A page where all questions and answers are aggregated. Users can browse this page to see all the earlier questions and answers that have already been posted or add a new question of their own.</p>
<p>Creators will respond to a Q&amp;A question with either text or video replies, just as they did before &#8212; so there isn&#8217;t much new to learn here, in terms of process.</p>
<p>They can also add Q&amp;A comments as stickers in their responses where the new video will link back to the original, where the question was first asked, similar to how they&#8217;re using comment stickers today.</p>
<p>The feature will also be available in TikTok LIVE, making it easier for creators to see the incoming questions in the stream&#8217;s chat from a separate panel.</p>

<p>As a part of this launch, a Q&amp;A profile link can be added to creators&#8217; Profile bios, which directs users to the Q&amp;A page where everything is organized.</p>
<p>During tests, the feature was only made available to creators with public accounts that had more than 10,000 followers and who opted in. Today, TikTok says its available to all users with Creator Accounts.</p>
<p>To enable the feature on your own profile, you&#8217;ll go to the privacy page under Settings, then select &#8220;Creator,&#8221; tap &#8220;Q&amp;A&#8221; and then &#8220;Turn on Q&amp;A.&#8221; (If users don&#8217;t already have a Creator account, they can enable it for themselves under settings.)</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out to users worldwide in the latest version of the TikTok app now, the company says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, Microsoft announced that its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge browser</a> would get vertical tabs and here we are: Microsoft today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/customer-insights-research/articles/giving-users-an-edge-whats-new-with-microsofts-latest-browser-2/">announced</a> that vertical tabs in Edge are now generally available.</p>
<p>In addition, the Edge team also announced a few under-the-hood changes that will allow the browser to startup significantly faster (up to 41% faster according to Microsoft&#8217;s preliminary tests, to be precise). Since Microsoft can&#8217;t speed up your hard drive or significantly shrink Edge, though, the way the team achieves this is by loading the browser in the background when you sign in and then it&#8217;ll continue running when you close all browser windows. If that&#8217;s not to your liking, you can always turn this feature off, too.</p>
<p>While vertical tabs are available for you to play with now, though, the startup improvements will roll out over the course of this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121119" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121119" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121119" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png 2253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=1536,976 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Startup-boost-settings.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121119" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Vertical tabs, of course, are nothing new. Other browsers have long supported them, either as a built-in feature or through extensions. But it&#8217;s nice to see them finally becoming a reality in Edge, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most websites follow a conventional grid that leaves plenty of whitespace on either end of the page,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcdanelmichele/">Michele McDanel</a> writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;As we began working with our users, we realized that this vertical real estate could be a better location for tabs, rather than the traditional horizontal list of tabs at the top. While vertical tabs may not be an entirely new concept, we saw an opportunity to improve the browser experience and tested several prototypes with our users.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121090" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical-Tabs_16x9_en-US.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121090" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical-Tabs_16x9_en-US.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>In its research, Microsoft discovered that users who like vertical tabs also like to switch between them and standard horizontal tabs, so it added an always-visible toggle to do so. And since users sometimes want to reclaim all of their screen estate, the team added the ability to collapse the sidebar, too.</p>
<p>For those of you who use Bing, Microsoft is also adding a few nifty new features to its search engine. There&#8217;s a new <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=fish+tacos+recipes&amp;form=MO12I1&amp;OCID=MO12I1">recipe view</a> for when you&#8217;re once again out of ideas for what to make for dinner, improved visual search results, and the company has spruced up some of its rich sidebar snippets with a more <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=kenya&amp;form=MO12I6&amp;OCID=MO12I6">infographic-like feel</a>. But let&#8217;s face it: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">you&#8217;re not using Bing</a>. If perchance you do, you can find more details about the udpates <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/03/04/amp-up-your-performance-with-startup-boost-and-find-information-blazingly-fast-with-microsoft-edge-and-bing/">here</a>.</p>

They&#8217;ve also taken the unusual step of taking out an eight-figure line of credit to buy outright the medical facilities they&#8217;ll need to do it.</p>
<p>As anyone who&#8217;s had to deal with major health concerns can attest, the care you get differs widely from one provider to another depending on many factors, not least of which are what your insurance covers and what methods are already in use by the provider.</p>
<p>For men going in to get a prostate cancer screening, for instance, the common bloodwork and rectal exam haven&#8217;t changed in years, and really aren&#8217;t that great at predicting problems, leading to uncertainty and unnecessary procedures like biopsies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re lucky, your provider might offer multiparametric MRIs, which are much better at finding problems —and if you combine that MRI with a urine test that checks for genetic markers, the detection accuracy rises to practically foolproof levels.</p>
<p>But these tests are more expensive, take special facilities and personnel, and may otherwise not fit into the provider&#8217;s existing infrastructure. Halo aims to provide that infrastructure by revamping the medical data stream to allow for this kind of multi-factor diagnosis.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Combining machine learning tools for medical imaging with genetic sequencing nets Sophia Genetics $110M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/combining-machine-learning-tools-for-medical-imaging-with-genetic-sequencing-nets-sophia-genetics-110m/embed/#?secret=Lmc8fLGXa8" data-secret="Lmc8fLGXa8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Basically doctors and imaging centers aren&#8217;t offering latest level of care. If you&#8217;re lucky you might get it, but in community medicine you&#8217;re not going to,&#8221; said Brian Axe, co-founder and chief product officer at Halo Dx. &#8220;As perverse as it sounds, what the healthcare industry needs is financial alignment, not just outcomes. The challenge is the integrated diagnostic solution — how do you get these orders, go to market and talk with primary care providers?&#8221;</p>
<p>An added obstacle is that multi-modal testing isn&#8217;t really the kind of thing medical imaging or testing providers just decide to get into. An imaging center isn&#8217;t going to hear that a urine test improves reliability and think &#8220;well let&#8217;s buy the building next door and start doing that too!&#8221; It&#8217;s costly and complex to build out testing facilities, and getting the expertise to run them and combine the results is another hurdle.</p>
<p>So Halo Dx is parachuting in with tens of millions of dollars and purchasing the imaging and testing centers themselves (four so far), taking over their operations and combining them with other tests.</p>
<p>Assuming that much liability as a young company may seem like folly, but it helps that these imaging centers are strong businesses already — not derelict, half-paid-off MRI machines being operated at a loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;The imaging orders are coming in already; the centers are profitable. They&#8217;re coming on board because they see how technology is coming to disrupt them, and they want to help,&#8221; said Axe.</p>
<p>Prostate and breast cancers are the first target, but more and better data produce similarly improved diagnosis and treatment planning for more conditions, potentially (these are still being proven out) Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson&#8217;s, and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>With one company running multiple intake, imaging, and testing facilities and integrating the results, it&#8217;s much more likely that providers will sign up. And Halo Dx is trying to bring some of the enterprise-grade software expertise to bear on the historically neglected field of medical data storage and communication.</p>
<p>Axe deferred to the company&#8217;s chief medical officer, Dr John Feller, on the perils of that aspect of the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Feller describes this so well: &#8216;I have this state of the art MRI machine that can see inside your body, but because of the fragmented solutions that are out there, from intake to the storage centers, I feel like I&#8217;m living with pre-dot-com era tech and it&#8217;s crippling,&#8217; &#8221; Axe recalled. &#8220;If you want to look at records or recommend additional tests, software vendors don&#8217;t talk to each other or integrate. You have three providers that need to talk to each other and there&#8217;s a dozen systems between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Axe compared the company&#8217;s approach here to One Medical&#8217;s — increasing efficiency and using that to make the relationship with the consumer lighter and easier, leading to more interactions.</p>
<p>In some ways it seems like a risky move, taking on nearly a hundred million in obligations and jumping into a hugely complex and highly regulated space. But the team is accomplished, the backers are notable, the potential for growth is there, and the success of the likes of One Medical have likely emboldened all involved.</p>
<p>Zola Global Investors led the round, and a who&#8217;s-who in medical and tech participated: Anne Wojcicki, Fred Moll, Stephen Pomeranz, Bob Reed, Robert Ciardi, Jim Pallotta, and believe it or not Ronnie Lott of 49ers fame.</p>
<p>These and others involved make for a strong statement of confidence in both the model and the specific approach Halo Dx is taking to expanding and advancing care. Here&#8217;s hoping, however, that you won&#8217;t have to make use of their services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has clarified that the iOS 14.5 beta is not actually allowing users to select a new default music service, as has been reported. Following the beta&#8217;s release back in February, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/">number</a> of beta testers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/">noticed</a> that Siri would now ask what music service they would like to use when they asked Siri to play music. But Apple doesn&#8217;t consider this feature the equivalent to &#8220;setting a default&#8221; &#8212; an option it more recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-will-let-users-pick-their-own-default-email-and-browser-apps/">began to allow</a> for email and browser apps.</p>
<p>Instead, the feature is Siri intelligence-based, meaning it can improve and even change over time as Siri learns to better understand your listening habits.</p>
<p>For example, if you tell Siri to play a song, album or artist, it may ask you which service you want to use to listen to this sort of content. However, your response to Siri is not making that particular service your &#8220;default,&#8221; Apple says. In fact, Siri may ask you again at some point &#8212; a request that could confuse users if they thought their preferences had already been set.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Apple also points out th<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ere&#8217;s no specific setting in iOS where users can configure a &#8220;default&#8221; music service, the way there is with email and browser apps. While many earlier reports did note this difference, they still referred to the feature as &#8220;setting a default,&#8221; which is technically incorrect. </span></p>
<p>More broadly, the feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content &#8212; not just music. Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.</p>
<p>When Siri asks you the which service you want to use for these sorts of audio requests, it will present a list of the audio apps you have installed for you to choose from.</p>

<p>In addition to Siri&#8217;s understanding of your habits &#8212; which are based on your responses and choices &#8212; app developers can optionally use APIs to provide Siri with access to more intelligence about what people listen to in their app and why. This could allow Siri to fulfill users&#8217; requests with more accuracy. And all this processing takes place on the device.</p>
<p>The audio choice feature, of course, doesn&#8217;t prevent users from requesting a particular service by name, even if it&#8217;s not their usual preference.</p>
<p>For instance, you can still say something like &#8220;play smooth jazz radio on Pandora&#8221; to launch that app instead. However, if you continued to request Pandora by name for music requests &#8212; even though you had initially specified Apple Music or Spotify or some other service when Siri had first prompted you &#8212; then the next time you asked Siri to play music without specifically a service, the assistant may ask you again to choose a service.</p>

<p>Although this may seem like a minor clarification, it has a greater importance given the increased regulatory scrutiny Apple is under these days over how its App Store and app ecosystem work. Spotify, in particular, has alleged that Apple is behaving in anti-competitive ways &#8212; for instance by requiring a commission on Spotify&#8217;s in-app purchases even though Apple runs a rival music service that Spotify claims has first-party advantages.</p>
<p>The audio choice feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-ios-14-5-beta-default-music-app-siri-152712457.html">had first</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/">appeared</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify">in iOS 14.5 beta 1</a>, but had been pulled in beta 2. It has since returned with the release of beta 3, which again drew <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/02/apple-re-enables-the-option-to-change-default-music-player-for-siri-requests-with-ios-14-5-beta-3/">attention</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2021/03/03/ios-145-public-beta-3-lets-you-choose-your-default-music-service/?sh=15a22c4b7d87">headlines</a> &#8212; as well as Apple&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not technically allowing you to set a &#8220;default,&#8221; the Siri-powered feature could eventually feel like one for users with consistent listening behavior. The iPhone will simply become smarter about how to play what you want to hear, without necessarily forcing you to use Apple&#8217;s own apps if you don&#8217;t want to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://clearglass.com">ClearGlass Analytics</a> has closed a £2.6 million ($3.6M) funding round for its platform, which aims to create greater transparency on fees in the long-term savings market, such as pensions and the wider asset management market. </p>
<p>The £2.6m seed round includes European VC Lakestar and Outward VC, the venture arm of Investec, as well as several angels from both the asset management and pension fund worlds. These include Ruston Smith, a pension trustee; Richard Butcher, Chair of the PLSA (UK pension trade body); Chris Wilcox, former Global Head of JP Morgan Asset Management; and Rob O’Rahilly, Sikander Ilyas and Alex Large, also former JP Morgan employees.</p>
<p>ClearGlass is targeting the £1.5trillion mature &#8216;Defined Benefit&#8217; pension schemes market and claims to now work with over 500 DB pension funds. It will use the funding to expand into the UK Defined Contribution pension market, and consolidate its early footprint in Europe and Africa.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>How ClearGlass works is that it acts as a data interface between asset managers and their clients. Pension funds then use the platform to see all of their investment costs in one place, thus getting more data than usual from more asset managers and other suppliers. This helps the funds see the ‘true cost’ of what they are paying for the management of their investments. ClearGlass claims to be able to uncover the kinds of costs of asset management that, in some instances, can be more than double those expected.</p>
<p>The startup recently did an analysis of the cost and performance of over 400 asset managers. It found that while most UK asset managers were meeting minimum standards for data delivery, quality, and accuracy, 30 (including some powerful players) did not pass their tests.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Dr. Christopher Sier, a World Bank and FCA expert who previously developed the cost transparency standard at the request of the FCA, and co-founders Ritesh Singhania and Kunal Varma.</p>
<p>Sier, founder and CEO, said: “Finding your costs are so much larger is shocking, but also something to be celebrated. These incremental costs were always there, they just weren’t exposed, and now you can identify those and bring about change. You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Ritesh Singhaniam, COO, said getting the data about pension funds is normally “super challenging and complicated. And second of all, even when you got the data, you couldn&#8217;t make head nor tail of it because you can&#8217;t compare it across funds. What we have done is that we have been the line of communication between the manager and the pension fund. So we have built a piece of technology that helps with the communication between the asset managers, and the pension funds to be able to collect that data, check that data. And finally, give them something that doesn&#8217;t require them to spend 20 hours to understand it.”</p>
<p>ClearGlass was incubated by the Founders Factory accelerator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Colombian startup <a href="https://elenas.co">Elenas</a> says it&#8217;s helping tens of thousands of women make money by selling products online. And today, it announced that it has raised $6 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s on top of the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-elenas-lands-2m-seed-to-expand-commerce-platform-in-latin-america/">$2 million seed round</a> that Elenas announced last fall. Founder and CEO Zach Oschin said that demand continues to grow, particularly with high unemployment levels (<a href="https://www.bbvaresearch.com/en/publicaciones/colombia-effects-of-covid-19-on-september-employment/">particularly among women</a>), while consumers remain nervous about in-person shopping during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to provide opportunities for tens of thousands of women to earn extra income,&#8221; Oschin said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He suggested that Elenas is essentially a reinvention of the direct sales/catalog sales model that 11 million women participate in across the Latin America. The idea is that independent seller/entrepreneurs (often but not always women) can browse a catalog of products in categories like beauty, personal care and electronics, from more than 250 distributors and brands, all available at a discounted wholesale price. They decide what they want to sell, how much they want to mark the price up and then promote the products on social channels like WhatsApp and Facebook.</p>

<p>Besides its digital focus, Oschin said said Elenas is better for the resellers because there&#8217;s less risk: &#8220;We don’t hold inventory for the company, which is very different than traditional direct sales, and our entrepreneurs don&#8217;t ever hold inventory.&#8221; Nor do those entrepreneurs need to get involved in things like payment collection or delivery, because Elenas and its distributor partners handle all of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, the goal is to provide this backend operating system that gives women everything they need to run their store,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Elenas offers an automated on-boarding process for the sellers, but Oschin said that within the app, &#8220;we do a lot of work to train our sellers how to sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/elenas-at-startup-battlefield-latin-america-2018/">participated in our Latin American Startup Battlefield</a> in 2018) says it&#8217;s now paid out more than $7 million to its sellers. It doesn&#8217;t limit participation by gender, but Oschin estimated that more than 95% of sellers are women, with 80% of them under the age of 30 and about a third of them without any previous direct sales experience.</p>
<p>The new funding comes from Leo Capital, FJ Labs, Alpha4 Ventures and Meesho. Oschin said the company&#8217;s investors have a presence across six different continents, reflecting its international vision. Indeed, one of its next steps is expanding across Latin America, starting with Mexico and then Peru.</p>
<p>“Having seen the meteoric growth of social commerce in India and China we are excited to partner with Elenas as they have demonstrated the right product and operating model for the region.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said Leo Capital co-founder Shwetank Verma in a statement. “The Elenas team has built a solution that&#8217;s inclusive, impactful and is well positioned for exponential growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche is taking its electrification ambitions to two wheels.</p>
<p>The German automaker unveiled two electric bikes Thursday, alongside the global debut of the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, the latest variant to its EV flagship.</p>
<p>Both electric bikes are said to be inspired by the Taycan, Porsche&#8217;s first electric vehicle that kicked off its broader EV ambitions. While the underlying inspiration and foundation are the same— both have have full-suspension carbon frames — each bike has a slightly different purpose and customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bikes are a collective effort. They were developed in collaboration with eBike expert Rotwild and use components from well-known bike parts manufacturers Shimano, Magura and <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Crankbrothers. High-design touches from Porsche — the spit and polish — and customers get a luxe ebike priced between $8,500 and $10,700.</span></p>
<p>The Porsche eBikes, both of which are manufactured in Dieburg, Germany, will be available this spring in three frame sizes at Porsche dealers and select specialist bicycle outlets.</p>
<p>The Porsche eBike Sport is priced at $10,700, while the &#8216;cheaper&#8217; Porsche eBike Cross costs $8,549.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120944" style="width: 3850px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120944" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120944 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg" alt="Porsche eBike CROSS_side-view-left" width="3840" height="2560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Porsche-eBike-CROSS_side-view-left.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Porsche</p></div></p>
<p>The Porsche eBike Sport is designed as a daily rider. The bike is equipped with a new Shimano EP8 motor, which provides motor support up to 25 km/h (about 15 mph), an Shimano electronic gear shifting system and Magura high-performance brakes that are integrated into the handlebars. The Sport bike also has M99 LED lights from Supernova, which are embedded in the handlebar stem and aerodynamic seat post.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In addition, high-quality suspension components such as the Magura upside-down suspension fork and the Fox rear shock absorber, in combination with smooth-running tires, provide a sporty and balanced ride on asphalt or gentle terrain.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Porsche eBike Cross is aimed at riders who might be seeking rougher roads. The Cross has a new motor developed by Shimano,<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Magura-MT Trail high-performance brakes with extra-large, heat-resistant brake discs for</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> deceleration and a mechanical Shimano XT 12-fold shifting system for quick gear changes. The seat post is hydraulically adjustable from Crankbrothers</span>. The handlebars also have a Shimano color display, which shows not only speed but also distance and range in real time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 25th of January, Techstars Seattle <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/2021-techstars-seattle-accelerator-companies">announced its 12th class</a> featuring 10 startups from different parts of the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator, which has accepted only a handful of African startups, included one from Zimbabwe in this class</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://afriblocks.com/">AfriBlocks</a> is a global pan-African marketplace of vetted African freelance professionals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://zw.linkedin.com/in/tongayi-choto"> Tongayi Choto</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerroman">Roger Roman</a> in July 2020 and has offices in Harare and Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is trying to address the high unemployment rate that plagues many African countries by making it easier for people to find work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> international and local freelance websites exist to meet these needs. Still, according to CEO, Choto, most of them offer too many options with no adequate vetting process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can be very hard to find African freelancers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a customer is lucky enough to get past those hurdles and find a freelancer to work with, they often don&#8217;t have the proper collaboration tools to complete the project in a precise and timely manner,&#8221; he told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a global freelance market worth more than $800 billion, AfriBlocks says it is doing this different by equipping African freelancers with intuitive collaboration tools and a secure payment system that makes it easy to get remote contract projects completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a job </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is posted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its platform, the company claims that they save the customer the trouble of perusing thousands of freelancers profiles and portfolios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they use automation tools to match three freelancers who fit the user&#8217;s qualifications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, AfriBlocks assigns a project manager to the selected freelancer who manages the project through completion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the job is complete, AfriBlocks collect a transaction fee, and the payment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is released</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from escrow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensures that expectations are clear and deadlines </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are met</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for freelancers and customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Choto says the company offers community and development resources that help them upskill and remain competitive in the global marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in partnership with edtech company Coursera and African non-profit Ingressive for Good</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also in talks with online learning platform, Datacamp, to do the same for data scientists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121003" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121003" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121003" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RogerRomanOffice.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121003" class="wp-caption-text">Roger Roman (co-founder)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As peculiar to most African startups, funding has been hard to come by for the team. Bootstrapping seemed like the only course of action to take, and it seems to have taken them far. In less than a year, the company has onboarded over 2,000 freelancers and more than 400 buyers. It has also completed up to 250 jobs generating over $60,000 in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This progress has attracted the likes of Techstars and Google to provide them with funding and network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve encountered the problems that many Black founders face, such as scarce fundraising sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, organizations like Techstars Seattle, Transparent Collective, and Google for Startups have helped us by providing mentorship, networking opportunities, and investor demo days showcases,&#8221; Roman said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AfriBlocks joins African startups like Farmcrowdy, OnePipe, Risevest, Eversend, OjaExpress, who have participated in different <a href="https://www.techstars.com/portfolio?category=unicorns">Techstars accelerators</a> worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before AfriBlocks, Choto, who grew up in Zimbabwe, served as a product manager at BillMari, a pan-African remittance service leveraging bitcoin technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For Roger, whose upbringing was on the westside of Chicago, he doubles as an active angel investor and a VC scout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is predicted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that freelancers will account for as much as 80% of the entire workforce worldwide by 2030</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelance work has become a viable source of employment and has shifted from being a vocation people engage in to supplement their income to being a full-time source of jobs for Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long term goal for AfriBlocks is to build the tech infrastructure for the future of work in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, participating in Techstars is the right path to that destination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In anticipation of the impending global human talent shortage that could result in 85 million jobs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being unfilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the loss of $85 trillion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our long-term goal is to make Africa the global hub for technical and creative freelancers by providing the rails for companies to work in Africa and with remote African talent,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Choto said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency exchange company <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com">Bitfinex</a> is launching <a href="https://pay.bitfinex.com">Bitfinex Pay</a>, a cryptocurrency payment gateway. With this new product, online merchants can accept payments in various cryptocurrencies. It should make cross-border transactions easier in particular.</p>
<p>While there are a few crypto payment gateways already, Bitfinex Pay has the advantage of working seamlessly with the company’s exchange. Merchants can create a widget and start accepting payments in Ethereum and bitcoin. Payments are deposited on your exchange wallet.</p>
<p>Bitfinex’s widget works a bit like the “Buy Now with PayPal” button. When you click on the Bitfinex Pay button, you’re redirected to the cryptocurrency company’s website. Once your payment is approved, you’re redirected back to the original merchant website. Payments are capped at the equivalent of $1,000 in cryptocurrencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You don’t pay any fee with Bitfinex Pay transactions. Of course, there are some network fees involved with sending crypto tokens. Merchants will also end up paying fees if they want to convert their cryptocurrency holdings on the exchange and transfer fiat money out of their account.</p>
<p>Bitfinex Pay also lets you accept Tether payments. Tether is a stablecoin, which means that one unit of Tether is supposed to be worth one USD — it doesn’t fluctuate over time.</p>
<p>That statement has been challenged as the attorney general in New York <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal?ref">has concluded that</a> Tethers weren’t fully backed by USD sitting in bank accounts at all times. At some point, Bitfinex <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3ac4809e-7c4d-4d9f-83ea-7112bfd3480a">couldn’t access</a> $850 million held in a Panamanian bank.</p>
<p>As a result, Tether and Bitfinex are currently banned in the state of New York. So you’ll have to determine whether you trust Bitfinex enough to use it as part of your checkout process on your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is exploring building a second U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant with its joint-venture partner Seoul, South Korea-based LG Chem.</p>
<p>If the plant moves forward, it would be the latest in a series of investments aimed at building out the auto giant’s portfolio of electric vehicles. The company’s joint venture with LG, Ultium Cells LLC, is already at work <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/gm-starts-construction-on-the-cornerstone-of-its-ev-strategy/">constructing a $2.3 billion battery cell manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>The companies hope to have a decision on the factory in the first half of 2021, GM spokesman Dan Flores told TechCrunch. He declined to specify possible locations for the site but Tennessee is high on the list, according to reporting from the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-looking-to-build-second-battery-factory-in-u-s-11614853806">Wall Street Journal</a></em>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM has set ambitious targets for decarbonizing its operations and pledged steep investments to get there. Through 2025 alone the company said it would bring thirty EV models across its brands to the global market and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">spend $27 billion on electrification and automated technology</a>—a 35% increase from 2020 spending. By the mid-2030s, GM said its fleet will be all-EV.</p>
<p>“Clearly, with our commitment to an all-electric future, we will need a lot of battery cells,” Flores said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on the ongoing shortage of battery cells, which has affected EV manufacturers Tesla and Nikola. President Joe Biden issued an executive order at the end of February instructing federal agencies to identify risks in the supply chains for batteries, semiconductors, and other critical items, including where supply chains are dependent on “competitor nations.”</p>
<p>GM CEO Mary Barra said in a <a href="https://investor.gm.com/events/event-details/general-motors-participate-wolfe-research-global-auto-auto-tech-and-mobility">virtual investor presentation last week</a> that the battery shortage is one reason the company is investing in its own battery cell manufacturing. She alluded to plans to grow the company’s battery cell manufacturing operations but did not go into specifics.</p>
<p>“There’s more coming than we’ve announced already,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global air transport data giant SITA has confirmed a data breach involving passenger data.</p>
<p>The company said <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-statement-about-security-incident/">in a brief statement</a> on Thursday that it had been the &#8220;victim of a cyberattack,&#8221; and that certain passenger data stored on its U.S. servers had been breached. The cyberattack was confirmed on February 24, after which the company contacted affected airlines.</p>
<p>SITA is one of the largest aviation IT companies in the world, said to be serving around 90% of the world&#8217;s airlines, which rely on the company&#8217;s passenger service system Horizon to manage reservations, ticketing, and aircraft departures.</p>
<p>But it remains unclear exactly what data was accessed or stolen.</p>
<p>When reached, SITA spokesperson Edna Ayme-Yahil declined to say what specific data had been taken, citing an ongoing investigation. The company said that the incident &#8220;affects various airlines around the world, not just in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>SITA confirmed it had notified several airlines — Malaysia Airlines; Finnair; Singapore Airlines; and Jeju Air, an airline in South Korea — which have already made statements about the breach, but declined to name other affected airlines.</p>
<p>In an email to affected customers seen by TechCrunch, Singapore Airlines said it was not a customer of SITA&#8217;s Horizon passenger service system but that about half a million frequent flyer members had their membership number and tier status compromised. The airline said that the transfer of this kind of data is &#8220;necessary to enable verification of the membership tier status, and to accord to member airlines&#8217; customers the relevant benefits while traveling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The airline said passenger itineraries, reservations, ticketing, and passport data were not affected.</p>
<p>SITA is one of a handful of companies in the aviation market providing passenger ticketing and reservation systems to airlines, alongside Sabre and Amadeus.</p>
<p>Sabre reported <a href="https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-update-on-cybersecurity-incident/">a major data breach</a> in mid-2017 affecting its hotel reservation system, after hackers scraped over a million customer credit cards. The U.S.-based company agreed in December to a $2.4 million settlement and to make changes to its cybersecurity policies following the breach.</p>
<p>In 2019, a security researcher found a vulnerability in Amadeus&#8217; passenger booking system, used by Air France, British Airways, and Qantas among others, which made it easy to alter or access traveler records.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aero.com/na">Aero</a>, a startup backed by Garrett Camp&#8217;s startup studio Expa, has raised $20 million in Series A funding — right as CEO Uma Subramanian said demand for air travel is returning &#8220;with a vengeance.&#8221;</p>
<p>I last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/expa-backed-aero-is-a-premium-air-travel-startup-with-16m-in-funding/">wrote about Aero in 2019</a>, when it announced Subramanian&#8217;s appointment as CEO, along with the fact that it had raised a total of $16 million in funding. Subramanian told me that after the announcement, the startup (which had already run test flights between Mykonos and Ibiza) spent the next few months buying and retrofitting planes, with plans for a summer 2020 launch.</p>
<p>Obviously, the pandemic threw a wrench into those plans, but a smaller wrench than you might think. Subramanian said that as borders re-opened and travel resumed in a limited capacity, Aero began to offer flights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We had a great summer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We sold a lot of seats, and we were <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/04/042804.asp#gross-profit-margin">gross margin positive</a> in July and August.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vhwmUNVKI8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/expa-backed-aero-is-a-premium-air-travel-startup-with-16m-in-funding/">Backed by Expa, Aero is a premium air travel startup with $16M in funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Backed by Expa, Aero is a premium air travel startup with $16M in funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/expa-backed-aero-is-a-premium-air-travel-startup-with-16m-in-funding/embed/#?secret=vhwmUNVKI8" data-secret="vhwmUNVKI8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup describes its offering as &#8220;semi-private&#8221; air travel — you fly out of private terminals, on small and spacious planes (Subramanian said the company has taken vehicles with 37 seats and retrofitted them to hold only 16), with a personalized, first-class experience delivered by its concierge team. Aero currently offers a single route between Los Angeles and Aspen, with one-way tickets costing $1,250.</p>
<p>Subramanian was previously CEO of Airbus&#8217; helicopter service Voom, and she said she approached the company &#8220;very skeptically,&#8221; since the conventional wisdom in the aviation industry is that the business is all about &#8220;putting as many people into a finite amount of square footage&#8221; as possible. But she claimed that early demand showed her that &#8220;the thesis is real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a set of people who want this,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Air travel used to be aspirational, something people got dressed up for. We want to bring back the magical part of the travel experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, if you&#8217;re the kind of &#8220;premium traveler&#8221; who might already spend &#8220;thousands of dollars a night&#8221; on a vacation in Amangiri, Utah, it seems a little silly to be &#8220;spending hours trying to find the a low-cost flight out of Salt Lake City.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120973" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120973" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2120973" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?w=680" alt="Aero interior" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120973" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aero</p></div></p>
<p>Subramanian suggested that while demand for business travel may be slow to return (it sounds like she enjoyed the ability to fundraise without getting on a plane), the demand for leisure travel is already back, and will only grow as the pandemic ends. Plus, the steps that Aero took to create a luxury experience also meant that it&#8217;s well-suited for social distancing.</p>
<p>Speaking of fundraising, the Series A was led by Keyframe Capital, with Keyframe&#8217;s chief investment officer John Rapaport joining the Aero board. Cyrus Capital Partners and Expa also participated.</p>
<p>The new funding will allow Aero to grow its team and to add more flights, Subramanian said. Next up is a route between Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas scheduled to launch in April, and she added that the company will be returning to Europe this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a horrendous time to be Lufthansa, but counterintuitively, it&#8217;s the best time to start something from scratch,&#8221; she said — in large part because it&#8217;s been incredibly affordable to buy planes and other assets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What investors will be willing to pay for ThredUp is going to be very interesting. A bit like Oscar Health, it's a hard company to price. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another venture-backed IPO filing. Today it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thredup.com/">ThredUp</a>, a used-goods marketplace that is approaching the public markets in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">Poshmark&#8217;s own strong debut</a>.</p>
<p>Both companies have a related market focus, albeit different approaches to selling used goods. Poshmark allows users to sell clothing items through its app. ThredUp, in contrast, acquires goods from users and sells them itself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But while Poshmark had profits to brag about in its own IPO filing, ThredUp does not and is also growing more slowly, expanding revenues just 13.6% in 2020. Reading <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1484778/000162828021003857/thredups-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a>, it&#8217;s clear ThredUp did not have the best 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s get into the numbers posted by the company backed by Trinity Ventures, Redpoint, Highland Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs to decide if it&#8217;s just merely to catch Poshmark&#8217;s wave, or if its business is a fine machine in its own right.</p>
<h2>ThredUp&#8217;s model</h2>
<p>To understand ThredUp&#8217;s business, we have to get into the mechanics of how it sells things. The company has two methods: direct sales and consignment. In the former, ThredUp buys goods and sells them. It then &#8220;recognize[s] revenue on a gross basis&#8221; and generates gross profit after deducting &#8220;inventory cost, inbound shipping and inventory write-downs, as well as outbound shipping, outbound labor and packaging costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the model that ThredUp is leaving behind. After shifting to &#8220;primarily consignment sales&#8221; in 2019, the company&#8217;s business has skewed sharply in that direction. Consignment works by having consumers send ThredUp their goods, which it holds, and perhaps sells, remitting to the user a portion of the sale price. The method reduces write-downs and boosts gross margins.</p>
<p>Consignment sales at ThredUp &#8220;recognize revenue net of seller payouts,&#8221; deducting &#8220;outbound shipping, outbound labor and packaging costs&#8221; to reach gross profit results.</p>
<p>The revenue-mix focus change can be seen in how ThredUp generated gross profit in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In those years, consignment gross profit came to 38%, 67% and 81% of total gross profit. ThredUp&#8217;s business today is effectively a large, digital consignment effort.</p>
<p>What impact has that shift had on the company&#8217;s financial health? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>ThredUp&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>ThredUp posted $129.6 million in 2018 revenue, a figure that grew to $163.8 million in 2019 and $186 million in 2020. The company&#8217;s growth slowed from 26.4% in 2019 to 13.6% in 2020, a sharp deceleration. But at the same time, the portion of ThredUp revenues that came from consignment sales grew to 74% from 60%. Did that change have a material impact on the company&#8217;s gross margins, thus rendering its slow growth more palatable?</p>
<p>Not really. The company&#8217;s gross margins came to 68.7% in 2019 and 68.9% in 2020. That&#8217;s about as flat as Texas. And notably the number stayed flat despite the company noting that consignment revenues had stronger gross margins in 2019 and 2020 (77% and 75%, respectively) than its other model (57% and 51%, respectively).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are not only shopping digitally more than ever. They’re also shopping using their mobile phones more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for mobile-first companies like </span><a href="http://snapcommerce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is good news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly known as SnapTravel, has raised $85 million in what the company is describing as a “Pre-IPO” growth round to help further its mission of “changing the way people shop on their phones.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toronto, Ontario-based startup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built out an AI-driven, vertical-agnostic platform that uses messaging in an effort to personalize the mobile shopping experience and “deliver the best promotional prices.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it was initially focused on the travel industry, the company is now branching out into other consumer verticals – hence its name change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inovia Capital and Lion Capital co-led the new growth round, which included participation from Acrew DCF, Thayer Ventures, Full In Partners as well as existing backers Telstra Ventures and Bee Partners. The financing brings Snapcommerce’s total raised since its 2016 inception to over $100 million. Its last raise &#8212; a $7.2 million round from Telstra and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/01/startups-net-more-than-capital-with-nba-players-as-investors/?pix=451_0_0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA star Steph Curry </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; took place in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded by tech entrepreneurs </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/hussein-fazal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hussein Fazal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose prior company AdParlor grew to $100+ million in revenue,</span><a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2011/11/01/adknowledge-acquires-facebook-ad-management-platform-adparlor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then sold to AdKnowledge back in 2011</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/henry-shi#/entity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Shi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who previously built </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/umentioned/people"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uMentioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and worked at Google, where he helped launch YouTube Music Insights, according to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/snaptravel-raises-8-million-for-a-hotel-booking-service-that-works-over-chat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous TechCrunch reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce launched its first, travel-focused product in 2017. It works by using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbots to interact with customers via messaging apps such as SMS, Facebook and Whatsapp. But the company also has human agents ready to help if people need more assistance, in the past essentially serving as on-demand travel agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its service is not just for hotels and flights, but also to help people book restaurants and activities too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus has been on building that personal relationship,” Fazal said. “Many people end up coming back to us when they travel again.” In fact, over 40% of its sales in 2020 came from repeat customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the company claims to have helped more than 10 million users globally save over $75 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It expects to cross over $1 billion in total mobile sales this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now it’s ready to branch out into helping consumers save money on goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When shopping, it’s hard to find the right product and even if you do, it’s hard to find a good deal,” he said. “On a desktop, there’s ways around it. But on mobile, it’s virtually impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company turned the corner to profitability three months into the pandemic in 2020, seeing a 60% spike in sales in the second half of the year compared to H2 2019, according to CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fazal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It then decided to re-invest its profits to continue growing the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The profitability during the pandemic gave us confidence that we could turn to profitability whenever we needed to and gave us control of our own destiny, which enabled this fundraise,” Fazal told TechCrunch. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third quarter of 2020 ended up being our greatest quarter ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic, naturally, only accelerated its growth as more consumers turned to mobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe the next wave of power purchasers will be via mobile,” Fazal said. “Some of the new generation don’t even have desktops or laptops, and they spend all their time on their mobile phone and messaging. So we’re able to be at the forefront.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce has an IPO in its sights although no specific timeline. The company did not reveal its current valuation or hard revenue figures.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company makes money by either marking up prices provided by a merchant or charging the merchant a commission.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.inovia.vc/people/chris-arsenault"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Arsenault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partner at Inovia and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lead investor, said his firm “tripled up” on its investment in the startup after witnessing its success in the travel space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other companies out there only care about the transaction, and force consumers to look through several services to see if they got the best price, all the while telling them ‘there’s only 2 seats left,’ ” he told TechCrunch. “We believe that consumers aren’t going to accept that type of pressure-selling in the future. And Snapcommerce’s ability to build trust with its customers and service providers has attracted us to them as they are defining what the future of commerce is going to be like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the company plans to use its fresh capital to continue to scale with the goal of streamlining the entire mobile search, purchase and fulfillment process and make finding “the right item at the right price as sending a message to a trusted friend.”</span></p>

<p>Led by Greenoaks Capital Partners, this Series C also includes significant participation from IVP Ventures and Alkeon Capital. Previous backers Insight Venture Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, Dynamic Loop, New Era and Workday Ventures, Access Ventures and Group 11 also chipped in. The new investment brings Papaya’s total funding to $190 million.</p>
<p>Papaya has been on a fundraising tear in the last 18 months. Today&#8217;s news comes less than six months after it raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/papaya-global-raises-40m-for-a-payroll-and-hr-platform-aimed-at-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million Series B</a>. And that round came less than a year after a $45 million Series A.</p>
<p>Why so much, so quickly? Partly because of the demands on the business, but possibly also to capitalize on an opportunity at a time when so many others are also going after it as well.</p>
<p>The opportunity is that companies and other organizations are finding themselves needing tools to address the current state of play: Workforce growth today doesn&#8217;t look like it did in 2019, and so incumbent solutions like ADP, or cobbled together solutions covering multiple geographies, either don&#8217;t cut it, or are too costly to maintain.</p>
<p>Papaya Global, in contrast, says it has built an AI-based platform that automates a lot of work and removes much of the manual activity that comes out of trying to right-size a lot of legacy payroll products to work in new paradigms.</p>
<p>“The major impact of COVID-19 for us has been changing attitudes,” CEO Eynat Guez, who co-founded the company with Ruben Drong and Ofer Herman, told me in an interview last September. &#8220;People usually think that payroll works by itself, but it’s one of the more complex parts of the organization, covering major areas like labor, accounting, tax. Eight months ago, a lot of clients thought, it just happens. But now they realize they didn’t have control of the data, some don’t even have a handle on who is being paid.”</p>
<p>One challenge, however, is that many others are also chasing these customers in hopes of becoming the ADP of distributed and global work.</p>

<p>And as we have pointed out before, these are just some of the HR startups that have raised money in the last year. There are many, many more.</p>
<p>Investors here are hoping that as we see some consolidation emerge out of this mix, there will be a few leaders and that Papaya will be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papaya Global has built a best in class solution to onboard new employees, automate payroll, and manage a global workforce through a single pane of glass. Both growing and established companies have dramatically changed their working practices in recent years, and Papaya has seen impressive growth as a result. We’re excited to continue supporting them as they seek to simplify an increasingly complex challenge for some of the world’s biggest companies,&#8221; said Patrick Backhouse, partner at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m excited for any opportunity to talk about soft robotics. There’s something other-worldly about the world of inflatable robotic bladders. Human beings are wont to develop robotics in their own image. The world of soft robots are something akin to what the technology would be like if it was developed by a sea creature.</p>
<p>Certainly cephalopods like octopi and squid have been a major inspiration for the category, along with other invertebrates. The benefits of the technology is clear. These far less rigid structures are more compliant and are able to squeeze into more places and conform to different shapes. We have seen a number of models deployed for different tasks, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/mit-researchers-develop-a-much-better-way-to-optimize-the-control-of-soft-robots/">picking and placing fragile products</a> like foodstuffs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120376" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120376" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2120376" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT CSAIL</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another major benefit is the safety. As human-robot collaborations increase, companies are looking for ways to ensure that their big, hulking machines don’t accidentally hurt their workers. That appears to be a big part of the inspiration behind<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/cables-could-help-soft-robots-transform-into-harder-structures/"> this MIT project</a> designed to create robots that can alternate between hard and soft structures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>It’s still very much in the early stages, but the research presents a compelling idea, with a series of cables that help the soft structure become more rigid. The team likens the tech to the muscles in a human arm. When flexed, it becomes much more difficult to move.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8k7HVkIqCQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>New research published by researchers at National University of Singapore and the University of Lincoln (U.K.) in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03153-z">the journal Nature</a> show ocean-inspired soft robots in a seemingly more natural environment: the Marina Trench. The soft structure (this time drawing more direct inspiration from rays) was able to withstand the extreme pressure that comes with being nearly 11,000 meters below the surface of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Per the team:</p>
<blockquote><p>This self-powered robot eliminates the requirement for any rigid vessel. To reduce shear stress at the interfaces between electronic components, we decentralize the electronics by increasing the distance between components or separating them from the printed circuit board.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another entirely different &#8212; but equally fascinating &#8212; swimming robot comes out of UC San Diego. The 2 cm long fish-shaped robots have platinum tales, which propel through bubbles created by a reaction to the hydrogen peroxide in their petri dishes. After researchers cut the little robots in half or thirds, magnetic interaction makes the pieces “heal” back together. The hope is that such application could be put to use in larger swimming robots, which are frequently made of fragile material.</p>

<p>The big robotics investment of the week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/autonomous-drone-maker-skydio-raises-170m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/"> is Skydio</a>. Not the first time that sentiment has been uttered, of course. The Series D brings the drone makers total funding up to $340 million, as it expands to additional commercial applications. There’s also the fact that the company is U.S.-based, which likely makes it all the more appealing to investors following DJI’s addition to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">DoC’s “entity list” in December.</a></p>

<p>That was one of those initiatives the Trump administration took on its way out the door. Like a number of recent entity list additions, this will hopefully be scrutinized under the new administration. Thus far, however, it hasn’t appeared to impact DJI’s ability to sell drones in the States, including the new FPV.</p>

<p>I got my hands on the new model this week. It’s an interesting new category the drone giant has only dipped its toes in thus far. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/dji-launches-an-all-in-one-fpv-drone-system/"> DJI FPV</a> bundles goggles for a first-person flight experience that has largely been the domain of racers and high-end hobbyist models. Given that DJI current controls roughly 70% of the global market, this marks an important moment for the burgeoning category.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/__trashed-12/">SkyMul</a>, meanwhile, is one of the more interesting applications I&#8217;ve seen in the drone space for a bit. The startup is one of a deluge of robotics companies in the construction space. Specially, it uses quadcopters for the extremely thankless job of tying rebar.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119637" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119637" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2119637" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119637" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT</p></div></p>
<p>On the research side of the category, we’ve got these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/mits-insect-sized-drones-are-built-to-survive-collisions/">adorable little buggers</a> out of MIT. At 0.6 grams, they weigh roughly the size of a large bumble bee. And unlike previous models, these “cassette tapes with wings” are designed to survive mid-air collisions. Turns out bumble bees tend to crash into each other a bunch while flying. That’s one of those little pieces of nature trivia that make perfect sense when you think about it for a second.</p>

<p>The drones are “are built with soft actuators, made from carbon nanotube-coated rubber cylinders. The actuators elongate when electricity is applied at a rate up to 500 times a second. Doing this causes the wings to beat and the drones to take flight.”</p>
<p>After I posted that article, someone asked if I knew about a “kids&#8217; book about a boy who becomes an insect drone and solves mysteries?” I did not. But I asked the occasionally usual social media platform and it nearly instantly responded with the extremely 70s kids book title, &#8220;Danny Dunn, Invisible Boy.&#8221; The thirteenth book in a long-running series, the book offered a glimpse into the future of drones. Per a <a href="https://medium.com/message/the-politics-of-personal-drones-perfectly-predicted-in-a-ya-novel-from-1974-3c171601b82b">2014 Medium article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You control the drone using a keyboard box, a thoroughly funky virtual-reality helmet, and what look like a pair of souped up Nintendo Power Gloves. With head inside the helmet, the pilot sees what the dragonfly sees, and even feels what the dragonfly feels via haptic feedback in the gloves.</p></blockquote>
<p>In less fun “science fiction predicts the future” news, a follow up from all of the hubbub surrounding Boston Dynamics last week. Once again, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/robot-police-dogs-are-here-should-we-be-worried/">ACLU is weighing in on the matter</a>, as it did when the company debuted footage of a Spot unit in the field with the Massachusetts state PD on our stage a while back.</p>
<p>The org reiterates questions it and others have raised before, including some of the generally ominous images and ideas around weaponized robotics that have been floating around for a long time. Here, however, it combines these with existing conversations around policing, AI and bias:</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewed narrowly, there’s nothing wrong with using a robot to scout a dangerous location or deliver food to hostages. But communities should take a hard look at expensive, rare-use technologies at a time when the nation is increasingly recognizing the need to invest in solving our social problems in better ways than just empowering police.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot to untangle here, but as I said week, it’s a net positive that we’re discussing these things now, while they’re still largely hypothetical. If drones have taught us anything, it’s that technology comes at you fast. I can appreciate that last week’s art instillation was not the framing Boston Dynamics wanted to enter into this conversation &#8212; and I do think the company’s an easy target due to its profile and the framing of fiction like Black Mirror.</p>
<p>But having this ongoing conversation is a net positive for robotics, going forward.</p>
