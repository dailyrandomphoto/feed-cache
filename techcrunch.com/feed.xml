					<description><![CDATA[Founders aren’t flocking to build just another SaaS tool or Airtable copycat — they're trying to disrupt the only thing possibly more annoying than e-mail: the work meeting.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than a year into the coronavirus pandemic, early-stage startups across the world are re-inventing how we work. But founders aren’t flocking to build just another SaaS tool or Airtable copycat — they&#8217;re trying to disrupt the only thing possibly more annoying than e-mail: the work meeting.</p>
<p>On an episode of this week&#8217;s podcast, Equity hosts Alex Wilhelm, Danny Crichton and Natasha Mascarenhas discussed a flurry of funding rounds related to the future of work.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1f003db3-c3b6-4a9b-9bd9-7d4082236cd9?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rewatch, which makes meetings asynchronous, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/zoom-fatigue-no-more-rewatch-raises-20m-to-index-transcribe-and-store-enterprise-video-content/">raised $20 million from Andreessen Horowitz</a>, AnyClip <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/anyclip-snaps-up-47m-for-its-video-search-and-analytics-technology/">got $47 million in a round led by JVP</a> for video search and analytics technology, Interactio, a remote interpretation platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/interactio-a-remote-interpretation-platform-grabs-30m-after-seeing-12x-growth-during-covid-19/">landed $30 million from Eight Roads Ventures and Silicon Valley-based Storm Ventures</a>, and Spot Meetings got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spot-meetings-seed/">Kleiner Perkins on board in a $5 million seed.</a></p>
<p>We connected the dots between these funding rounds to sketch out three perspectives on the future of workplace meetings. Part of our reasoning was the uptick of investment as mentioned above, and the other is that our calendars are full of them. We all agree that the traditional meeting is broken, so below you’ll find each of our arguments on where they go next and what we’d like to see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: Meetings should be ongoing, not in calendar invites</li>
<li>Danny Crichton: Redesign meetings for flow</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please</h2>
<p>I’ve worked for companies that were in love with meetings, and for companies where meetings were more infrequent. I prefer the latter by a wide margin. I’ve also worked in offices full-time, half-time and fully remote. I immensely prefer the final option.</p>
<p>Why? Work meetings are often a waste of time. Mostly you don’t need to align, most folks taking part are superfluous and as accidental team-building exercises they are incredibly expensive in terms of human-hours.</p>
<p>I am not into wasting time. The more remote I’ve been and the less time I’ve spent in less-formal meetings &#8212; the usual chit-chat that pollutes productive work time, making the days longer and less useful &#8212; the more I’ve managed to get done.</p>
<p>But I’ve been the lucky one, frankly. Most folks were still trapped in offices up until the pandemic shook up the world of work, finally giving more companies a shot at a whole-cloth rebuild of how they toil.</p>
<p>The good news is that CEOs are taking note. Chatting with Sprout Social CEO Justyn Howard this week, he explained how we have a unique, new chance to not live near where we work in 2021, but to instead bring work to where we live. He’s also an introvert, which meant that as a pair we’ve found a number of positives in some of the changes to how tech and media companies operate. Perhaps we’re a little biased.</p>
<p>A number of startups are rushing to fill the gap between the new expectations that Howard noted and our old digital and IRL realities.</p>
<p>Tandem.chat might be one such company. The former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/">Y Combinator launch-day darling</a> has spent its post-halo period building. Its CEO sent me a <a href="https://blog.tandem.chat/the-virtual-office-is-here-to-stay/">manifesto of sorts</a> the other day, discussing how his company approaches the future of work meetings. Tandem is building for a world where communication needs to be both real-time and internal; it leaves asynchronous internal communication to Slack, real-time external communications to Zoom and asynchronous external chats to email. I agree, I think.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the Daily Crunch for May 28, the last edition before a long weekend here in the United States. But impending holiday or not, there’s plenty to catch up on, not the least of which today is Elon Watch in our top-three rundown. Let’s get into it! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>All about Elon:</strong> The only thing more certain than more venture rounds and SPAC news in the tech game these days is the inevitably of Elon Musk making news. This week was no exception, with the Tesla boss in the media today for <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">turning on in-car cameras when their driver assistance is switched on</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">his Boring company’s Las Vegas tunnel challenges</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The EU examines TikTok: </strong>The tech-and-government theme we’ve tracked all week continued today <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/eu-to-review-tiktoks-tos-after-child-safety-complaints/">with the European Union launching</a></strong> “what it described as ‘a formal dialogue’ with the video sharing platform over its commercial practices and policy.” The social media giant’s kid-focused policies appear to be in the EU’s crosshairs.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare can be lucrative startup ground: </strong>That’s what we learned reading Doximity’s IPO filing this morning. The venture-backed health tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/doximitys-s-1-may-explain-why-healthcare-exits-are-heating-up/">grew like a weed during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and is capitalizing on its gains by going public while markets are hot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Let’s wrap this week with startups that are challenging the status quo, shall we?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/penfold-closes-8-5m-to-provide-a-full-stack-pension-in-an-app-aimed-at-freelancers/"><strong>Penfold just raised $8.5 million to keep pensions alive</strong></a><strong>: </strong>In your part of the world the pension may be dead, but Penfold wants to keep the retirement plan alive in the U.K. With a mobile app. Sure, your company has probably given up on the idea that it should materially provide for workers’ post-work existence, but Penfold is betting that its freelancer-friendly pension system will find purchase in its market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/kitt-an-office-outfitter-as-a-service-raises-5m-seed-round-led-by-barclay-ventures/"><strong>Kitt put together a $5 million round to build out your next office</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Parts of the world are slowly circling back to the idea of going to the office. Kitt wants to take advantage of the trend by “a ‘fully customizable’ workspace solution to tenants via its landlord partners,” TechCrunch reports. Everyone seems to agree that post-COVID office life will look different. Here’s a startup trying to help design that future.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/anthropic-is-the-new-ai-research-outfit-from-openais-dario-amodei-and-it-has-124m-to-burn/"><strong>Anthropic pulls together $124 million to make AI more steerable</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Some of the folks behind GPT-3 have a pile of new money for their AI-focused startup. But unlike most AI-centered startups, the company appears to be working on model <em>tuning</em> over building something to, say, do one particularly focused task.</p>
<p>“Today [in AI] the general rule is: The more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions,” Devin reports, adding that that’s “not exactly a good trend.” Perhaps Anthropic can build the AI tuning dials we’ve long needed. It certainly now has the money to pursue its vision.</p>
<h2>Dismantling the myths around raising your first check</h2>
<p>The growing complexity of fundraising has the opportunity to make tech either inclusive or exclusive. For new founders looking to raise money, let’s dismantle the myths about raising your first check and instead focus on how investors and other successful founders describe the nuance needed to secure money.</p>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas spoke to Elizabeth Yin, founding partner of Hustle Fund, and Leslie Feinzaig, founder of Female Founders Collective, to get their candid thoughts about the challenges first-time founders face when fundraising.</p>
<p>According to Yin, all startups should be able to reach one of two goals: by the fifth year, achieve $100 million ARR or a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>“This is hard to do,” she said. “And most businesses will never get there — not for a lack of trying — but there’s a lot of luck whether your idea has that much demand that quickly.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Closing this week with a mote of Big Tech news, once again centered around the rising tension between technology companies and the Indian government. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/">own Manish Singh reports that</a> “Google, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn and Tiger Global-backed Indian startups ShareChat and Koo have either fully or partially complied with the South Asian nation’s new IT rules, according to two people familiar with the matter and a government note obtained by TechCrunch.”</p>
<p>Singh goes on to note that “Twitter has yet to comply with the rules.” We saw earlier this week how Twitter is pushing back against the Indian government after it tried to use force to intimidate the American social network into going against its own policies in defense of its party’s political goals.</p>
<p>American social networks born in an environment where they had plenty of room to experiment and maneuver have a history of running afoul of foreign governments with either <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">rising autocratic tendencies</a> or a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/chinese-app-that-let-users-access-google-facebook-has-disappeared.html">fondness for full-blown control</a>. This is no exception. The question is whether Twitter will wind up a cautionary tale in its argument with the Indian government, or a guiding light.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The notion of digital transformation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/31/digital-transformation-requires-total-organizational-commitment/">evolved from a buzzword</a> joke to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/">critical and accelerating fact</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">The changes wrought by</a> a global shift to remote work and schooling are myriad, but in the business realm they have yielded a change in corporate behavior and consumer expectation &#8212; changes that showed up in a bushel of earnings reports this week.</p>
<p>TechCrunch may tend to have a private-company focus, but we do keep tabs on public companies in the tech world as they often provide hints, notes and other pointers on how startups may be faring. In this case, however, we’re working in reverse; startups have told us for several quarters now that their markets are picking up momentum as customers shake up their buying behavior with a distinct advantage for companies helping customers move into the digital realm. And public company results are now confirming the startups’ perspective.</p>
<p>The accelerating digital transformation is real, and we have the data to support the point.</p>
<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce. We’ll approach each in micro to save time, but as always there’s more digging to be done if you have time. Let’s go!</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nY1rwBEZXR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/">Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/embed/#?secret=nY1rwBEZXR" data-secret="nY1rwBEZXR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Enterprise earnings go up</h2>
<p>Kicking off with <a href="http://yext.com">Yext</a>, the company beat expectations in its most recent quarter. Today its shares are up 18%. And a call with the company’s CEO Howard Lerman underscored our general thesis regarding the digital transformation’s acceleration.</p>
<p>In brief, Yext’s evolution from a company that plugged corporate information into external search engines to building and selling search tech itself has been resonating in the market. Why? Lerman explained that consumers more and more expect digital service in response to their questions &#8212; &#8220;who wants to call a 1-800 number,&#8221; he asked rhetorically &#8212; which is forcing companies to rethink the way they handle customer inquiries.</p>
<p>In turn, those companies are looking to companies like Yext that offer technology to better answer customer queries in a digital format. It’s customer-friendly, and could save companies money as call centers are expensive. A change in behavior accelerated by the pandemic is forcing companies to adapt, driving their purchase of more digital technologies like this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s proof that a transformation doesn&#8217;t have to be dramatic to have pretty strong impacts on how corporations buy and sell online.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[We're off on Monday, May 31 in observance of Memorial Day; I hope you have a relaxing weekend!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This may seem like a great time to launch a SaaS startup, but the landscape is crowded with well-designed applications that promise &#8220;blazingly fast and delightfully simple&#8221; experiences, according to seed-stage investor John Chen of Fika Ventures.</p>
<p>Most SaaS startups will fail, but not because of a sour marketing campaign or server downtime. The majority of these companies will fall victim to what Chen calls &#8220;the myth of frictionless onboarding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the hype about ease of use, enterprise companies always ask customers to abandon familiar tools so they can learn something new.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just like with a new fitness program, participants feel good after completing the workout, but it takes a lot of activation energy to start and hard work to get there,&#8221; Chen notes.</p>

<p>Instead of putting the onus on customers to roll up their sleeves, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/saas-needs-to-take-a-page-out-of-the-crypto-playbook/">he suggests that SaaS startups learn from cryptocurrency culture</a> and find ways to &#8220;incentivize users to do the necessary work to have the right experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>But how do you encourage users to put in the time and effort required to produce an optimal customer experience?</p>
<p>&#8220;In a world where there is a surplus of alternatives for every job to be done, the scarce resource is not content, tooling, or hacks and tricks,&#8221; says Chen. &#8220;It’s attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>As startups and venture capital grow in tandem, fundraising has gone from a formal affair on Sand Hill Road to a process that can happen anywhere from Twitter to Zoom.</p>
<p>While fundraising may no longer require a trip to California, it might depend on whether you got an invite to a private audio app. And while you may not need to be an insider, second-time founders — largely male and white — still have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The growing complexity of fundraising has the opportunity to make tech either inclusive or exclusive.</p>
<p>VC is the flashy gold medal, but the rapid growth of emerging fund managers means that a first check can be piecemealed together from a variety of different sources. The options for financing are seemingly endless: syndicates, public crowdfunding, VC firms, accelerators, debt financing, rolling funds, and, for the profitable few, bootstrapping.</p>

<p>Telehealth startup Doximity filed to go public earlier today. Notably, the company has not fundraised since 2014, a year in which it attracted just under $82 million at a valuation of $355 million, per PitchBook data.</p>
<p>How has it managed to not raise money for so long? By generating lots of cash and profit over the years. Healthtech communications, it turns out, can be a lucrative endeavor.</p>

<p>The spin-out of video platform Vimeo from IAC completed this week, and the smaller company is now trading as an independent entity under the ticker &#8216;VMEO&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you missed the news that the internet conglomerate was spinning out the video service, don’t feel bad; it slipped past many radars. But with the company now trading, our access to its historical results, and our minds still enthralled by YouTube’s recent financial performance for Alphabet, it’s worth taking a moment to digest the company’s health.</p>

<p>The Flywire IPO is neat from a financial perspective and notable in that it’s a Boston exit as opposed to yet another New York or San Francisco-based flotation. It’s nice to see some other cities put points on the board.</p>
<p>But more than that, this IPO is a useful measuring stick for keeping tabs on the IPO market as a whole. This year and the last are shaping up to be key exit periods for startups and unicorns of all shapes and sizes; many a venture capital fund return rests on these public debuts.</p>

<p>In just a few short years, Vise has gone from launching on the Disrupt Battlefield stage to a unicorn. Co-founders Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra met Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire at an after-party at the event, and Maguire ended up leading a seed and Series A round while Sequoia led the Series B.</p>
<p>Last week, Vise raised its Series C of $65 million and was officially valued at $1 billion post-money.</p>

<p>Another day, another unicorn public offering.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it was Acorns, a consumer fintech service that blends saving and investing into a freemium product.</p>
<p>Acorns fits inside the larger savings-and-investing boom seen over the last four or five quarters as consumers buffeted by the economic changes brought on by COVID-19 turned to stashing cash and boosting their equities investing cadence.</p>
<p>By now this is old news, but we haven’t had a clear picture of the economics of consumer fintech startups accelerated by the pandemic. Now that Acorns has decided to list via a SPAC — more on that in a moment — we do.</p>
<h2>Poor onboarding is the enemy of good hiring</h2>

<p>The world of hybrid work is here, and the usual 10-minute intro call, swag bag and first-day team lunch are just not enough to make your new employee feel welcome.</p>
<p>While many companies have found a way to interview and select candidates in a fully remote environment, few have spent time and resources on aligning the &#8220;pre-boarding&#8221; and onboarding process for the new hybrid world of work. Many employers still rely on old ways of welcoming new hires, despite our totally changed work environment.</p>
<p>It’s important to capitalize on candidates’ enthusiasm and eagerness from the moment the offer is signed instead of when they log in on Day One, because first impressions can make or break a candidate’s chances of staying at a company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the U.S. the concept of using a driver’s data to decide the cost of auto insurance premiums is not a new one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in markets like Brazil, the idea is still considered relatively novel. A new startup called Justos claims it will be the first Brazilian insurer to use drivers’ data to reward those who drive safely by offering “fairer” prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now Justos has raised about $2.8 million in a seed round led by Kaszek, one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America. Big Bets also participated in the round, along with the CEOs of seven unicorns, including Assaf Wand, CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; David Vélez, founder and CEO of Nubank; Carlos Garcia, founder and CEO of Kavak; Sergio Furio, founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist, founder of iFood; and Fritz Lanman, CEO of ClassPass. Senior executives from Robinhood, Stripe, Wise, Carta and Capital One also put money in the round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha, Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Molins co-founded Justos, having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass, Netflix and Airbnb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we have been friends for a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">while, it was a coincidence that all three of us were thinking about building something new</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Latin America,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadha said. “We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent two months studying</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">possible paths, talking to people and investors in the United States, Brazil and Mexico, until</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">we came up with the idea of creating an insurance company that can modernize the sector,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">starting with auto insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the trio decided that the auto insurance market would be an ideal sector considering that in Brazil, an estimated more than 70% of cars are not insured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to get insurance in the country, by any accounts, is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy. Insurers also take their time in resolving claims related to car damages and loss due to accidents, the entrepreneurs say. They also charge that pricing is often not fair or transparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos aims to improve the whole auto insurance process in Brazil by measuring the way people drive to help price their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance policies. Similar to Root here in the U.S., Justos </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intends to collect users&#8217; data through their mobile phones so that it can “more accurately and assertively price different types of risk.” This way, the startup claims it can offer plans  that are up to 30% cheaper than traditional plans, and grant discounts each month, according to the driving patterns of the previous month of each customer. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Latin America&#8217;s digital transformation is making up for lost time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/embed/#?secret=qzant5dPXG" data-secret="qzant5dPXG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We measure how safely people drive using the sensors on their cell phones,” Chadha said. “This allows us to offer cheaper insurance to users who drive well, thereby reducing biases that are inherent in the pricing models used by traditional insurance companies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos also plans to use artificial intelligence and computerized vision to analyze and process claims more quickly and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">machine learning for image analysis and to create bots that help accelerate claims processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are building a design-driven, mobile first and customer experience that aims to revolutionize insurance in Brazil, similar to what Nubank did with banking,” Chadha told TechCrunch. “We will be eliminating any hidden fees, a lot of the small text and insurance-specific jargon that is very confusing for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos will offer its product directly to its customers as well as through distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">channels like banks and brokers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By going direct to consumer, we are able to acquire users cheaper than our competitors and give back the savings to our users in the form of cheaper prices,” Chadha said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers will be able to buy insurance through Justos’ app, website or even WhatsApp. For now, the company is only adding potential customers to a waitlist but plans to begin selling policies later this year..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, the auto insurance sector in Brazil declined by 1%, according to Chadha, who believes that indicates “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there is latent demand raring to go once things open up again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos has a social good component as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos intends to cap its profits and give any leftover revenue back to nonprofit organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has an ambitious goal: to help make insurance become universally accessible around the world and the roads safer in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People will face everyday risks with a greater sense of safety and adventure. Road accidents will reduce drastically as a result of incentives for safer driving, and the streets will be safer,” Chadha said. “People, rather than profits, will become the focus of the insurance industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos plans to use its new capital to set up operations, such as forming partnerships with reinsurers and an insurance company for fronting, since it is starting as an MGA (managing general agent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working on building out its products such as apps, its back end and internal operations tools, as well as designing all its processes for underwriting, claims and finance. Justos’ data science team is also building out its own pricing model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup will be focused on Brazil, with plans to eventually expand within Latin America, then Iberia and Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek’s Andy Young said his firm was impressed by the team’s previous experience and passion for what they’re building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a huge space, ripe for innovation and this is the type of team that can take it to the next level,” Young told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as taken an approach to building an insurance platform that blends being consumer-centric and data-driven to produce something that is not only cheaper and rewards safety but as the brand implies in Portuguese, is fairer.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook made a few noteworthy changes to its misinformation policies this week, including the news that the company will now allow claims that COVID was created by humans — a theory that contradicts the previously prevailing assumption that humans picked up the virus naturally from animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made from our apps,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is adjusting its rules about pandemic misinformation in light of international investigations legitimating the theory that the virus could have escaped from a lab. While that theory clearly has enough credibility to be investigated at this point, it is often interwoven with demonstrably false misinformation about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/the-pandemic-is-already-reshaping-techs-misinformation-crisis/">fake cures</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-5g-covid-19-conspiracy-theory-misinformation/">5G towers causing COVID</a> and most recently the false claim that the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-astrazeneca-bluetooth-idUSL2N2NC2G9"> AstraZeneca vaccine implants recipients with a Bluetooth chip</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, President Biden ordered a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/26/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19/">multi-agency intelligence report</a> evaluating if the virus could have accidentally leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, China. Biden called this possibility one of two &#8220;likely scenarios.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech&#8217;s role in the COVID-19 response: Assist, don&#8217;t reinvent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/techs-role-in-the-covid-19-response-assist-dont-reinvent/embed/#?secret=GHEP9FIvj0" data-secret="GHEP9FIvj0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Shortly after I became President, in March, I had my National Security Advisor task the Intelligence Community to prepare a report on their most up-to-date analysis of the origins of COVID-19, including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident,&#8221; Biden said in an official White House statement, adding that there isn&#8217;t sufficient evidence to make a final determination.</p>
<p>Claims that the virus was man-made or lab-made have circulated widely since the pandemic&#8217;s earliest days, even as the scientific community largely maintained that the virus probably made the jump from an infected animal to a human via natural means. But many questions remain about the origins of the virus and the U.S. has yet to rule out the possibility that the virus emerged from a Chinese lab — a scenario that would be a bombshell for international relations.</p>
<p>Prior to the COVID policy change, Facebook announced that it would finally implement <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/taking-action-against-people-who-repeatedly-share-misinformation/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">harsher punishments</a> against individuals who repeatedly peddle misinformation. The company will now throttle the News Feed reach of all posts from accounts that are found to habitually share known misinformation, restrictions it previously put in place for Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts and websites that repeatedly break the same rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As AI has grown from a menagerie of research projects to include a handful of titanic, industry-powering models like GPT-3, there is a need for the sector to evolve — or so thinks Dario Amodei, former VP of research at OpenAI, who struck out on his own to create a new company a few months ago. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, as it&#8217;s called, was founded with his sister Daniela and its goal is to create &#8220;large-scale AI systems that are steerable, interpretable, and robust.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge the siblings Amodei are tackling is simply that these AI models, while incredibly powerful, are not well understood. GPT-3, which they worked on, is an astonishingly versatile language system that can produce extremely convincing text in practically any style, and on any topic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hDo1z2rXH9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/">Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/embed/#?secret=hDo1z2rXH9" data-secret="hDo1z2rXH9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But say you had it generate rhyming couplets with Shakespeare and Pope as examples. How does it do it? What is it &#8220;thinking&#8221;? Which knob would you tweak, which dial would you turn, to make it more melancholy, less romantic, or limit its diction and lexicon in specific ways? Certainly there are parameters to change here and there, but really no one knows exactly how this extremely convincing language sausage is being made.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to not know when an AI model is generating poetry, quite another when the model is watching a department store for suspicious behavior, or fetching legal precedents for a judge about to pass down a sentence. Today the general rule is: the more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions. That&#8217;s not exactly a good trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large, general systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues,&#8221; reads the company&#8217;s self-description. &#8220;For now, we’re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for public benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to announce what we’ve been working on this year &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnthropicAI</a>, an AI safety and research company.

<p>&mdash; Daniela Amodei (@DanielaAmodei) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielaAmodei/status/1398306463945158656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The goal seems to be to integrate safety principles into the existing priority system of AI development that generally favors efficiency and power. Like any other industry, it&#8217;s easier and more effective to incorporate something from the beginning than to bolt it on at the end. Attempting to make some of the biggest models out there able to be picked apart and understood may be more work than building them in the first place. Anthropic seems to be starting fresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthropic’s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,&#8221; said Dario Amodei, CEO of the new venture, in a short post announcing the company and its $124 million in funding.</p>
<p>That funding, by the way, is as star-studded as you might expect. It was led by Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and included James McClave, Dustin Moskovitz, Eric Schmidt and the Center for Emerging Risk Research, among others.</p>
<p>The company is a public benefit corporation, and the plan for now, as the limited information on the site suggests, is to remain heads-down on researching these fundamental questions of how to make large models more tractable and interpretable. We can expect more information later this year, perhaps, as the mission and team coalesces and initial results pan out.</p>
<p>The name, incidentally, is adjacent to anthropocentric, and concerns relevancy to human experience or existence. Perhaps it derives from the &#8220;Anthropic principle,&#8221; the notion that intelligent life is possible in the universe because&#8230; well, we&#8217;re here. If intelligence is inevitable under the right conditions, the company just has to create those conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company (TBC) to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk&#8217;s first underground transportation system.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/lvcc">Loop system</a> at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) is supposed to use more than 60 fully autonomous high-speed vehicles to transport 4,400 passengers an hour between exhibition halls. However, TechCrunch has been told that Clark County regulators have approved just 11 human-driven vehicles so far, set strict speed limits and forbidden the use of on-board collision-avoidance technology that is part of Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; Autopilot advanced driver assistance system. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system technically does not rise to the level of fully autonomous, even though it is branded as such. It is considered — even internally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/tesla-refutes-elon-musks-timeline-on-full-self-driving/">according to exchanges between Tesla and California regulators</a> — an advanced driver assistance system that can automate certain functions.</p>
<p>LVCC’s parent body, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor’s Authority, created a contract aimed at incentivizing Musk and ensuring promises are met. The contract is for a fixed price, and TBC has to hit specific milestones to receive all of its payments. The contract provides payments at different points in the process, such as completing the bare tunnels, the entire working system, finishing a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">test period and safety report and then demonstrating it can carry passengers. The final three milestones relate to how many passengers it can carry. If the Loop can demonstrate moving 2,200 passengers an hour, TBC will get $4.4 million, then the same payment again for hitting 3,300, and the same again for 4,400 passengers an hour. Together, these capacity payments represent 30% of the fixed-price contract.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of moving more than 4,000 passengers an hour, the constrained system could limit the capacity to less than 1,000, exposing TBC to hefty penalties for missing contractual targets. TBC doesn&#8217;t generate revenue from charging passengers (the rides are free).</p>
<p>For instance, during a large trade show like CES, the LVCC will pay TBC $30,000 for every day it operates and manages the system, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20702362-2021-1-management-agreement-feb-4-final">management agreement</a> newly obtained by TechCrunch. However, the original contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour.</p>
<p>This means that over the course of a three- or four-day event, TBC stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, above and beyond the cost of running the system. In a typical pre-pandemic year, LVCC would host around a dozen such large shows. It&#8217;s unclear if TBC is planning on another means of making money such as revenue from advertising in its cars.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/16/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store/embed/#?secret=Nf5h7wegCw" data-secret="Nf5h7wegCw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This capacity issue is already costing TBC money. The contract states that if TBC misses its performance target by such a margin, Musk’s company will not receive more than $13 million of its construction budget. The convention center authority confirmed to TechCrunch that, per its contract, it is withholding that construction fee until TBC can demonstrate moving thousands of people an hour.</p>
<p>Smaller shows, numbering about 20 a year, carry no capacity penalties but earn TBC a much smaller fee of just $11,500 a day, according to the agreement. TBC also receives a monthly payment of $167,000 to keep the system ticking over, regardless of how many conventions are running.</p>
<p>A capacity test of the Loop this week <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/las-vegas-convention-center-prepares-for-return-of-business">reportedly involved just 300 people</a>; a Convention Center official did say the 4,400 people-per-hour figure was &#8220;well within our sights.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as its team of human drivers, TBC has to staff an operations center and a maintenance and charging facility, and provide uniformed customer service personnel, security staff and a full-time resident manager, according to the management agreement.</p>
<p>The fee structure is set to be renegotiated &#8212; presumably downwards &#8212; by the end of 2021, to incorporate the &#8220;expected transition to autonomous vehicle operations.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Collision warnings out</h2>
<p>Some of the restrictions on the Loop&#8217;s initial operation came from the Clark County Department of Building and Fire Prevention. These reportedly include a 40 mph overall speed limit, dropping to 10 mph within each of the Loop&#8217;s three stations, and a restriction to just 11 vehicles.</p>
<p>Deputy Fire Chief Warren Whitney of the Clark County Fire Department said that TBC had told him the company wasn&#8217;t allowed to use Tesla&#8217;s collision warning systems within the Loop. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20792266-2021-5-11-ats-certificate">transportation system certificate</a> issued by Clark County this week specified that the Loop must use &#8220;non-autonomous&#8221; &#8220;manually driven&#8221; vehicles. It was issued for the planned 62 vehicles. Neither Clark County officials nor TBC provided responses to detailed questions on the operational restrictions, nor indicated when or if they could be lifted.</p>
<p>Toyota has previously warned that its radar-based collision warning system may not function correctly within tunnels.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the Teslas are capable of safe and &#8220;fully autonomous operation&#8221; without their collision-warning radars, although Musk has suggested &#8212; and now executed on a plan &#8212; to remove radar sensors from its vehicles and only use cameras. Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in May that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/">do not have radar sensors</a>. The lack of radar sensors has prompted the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration to say that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021 will no longer receive the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">agency&#8217;s check mark</a> for automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and dynamic brake support. The decision also prompted Consumer Reports to no longer list the Model 3 as a Top Pick, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said it plans to remove the Model 3&#8217;s Top Safety Pick+ designation.</p>
<p>The Fire Department also had concerns about dealing with emergencies within the tunnels, including battery fires that can potentially last many hours. &#8220;There have been cases where electric cars have caught fire without an accident,&#8221; Whitney told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our plan right now would be just to get the people out, then pull back and let the fire continue to burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitney noted the system has many cameras and smoke alarms, as well as a &#8220;robust&#8221; ventilation system that can move 400,000 cubic feet of air per minute in either direction down the tunnels. This should allow passengers and drivers to escape on foot around the cars. For less serious incidents, TBC has a tow vehicle (also a Tesla) to extract broken-down cars.</p>
<p>Neither TBC nor Clark County replied to TechCrunch queries about whether the Loop would be allowed to transport wheelchair users, children or infants usually requiring car seats, people with other mobility issues or pets and support animals.</p>
<p>Firefighters have already conducted multiple drills in the underground system, including simulated accidents far from a station, with two or three other vehicles in the way. &#8220;Eleven cars is definitely doable,&#8221; says Whitney. &#8220;But when you start increasing numbers of cars, it may be a problem. [TBC] is a for-profit company and is going want to maximize the efficiency, so there may be further discussions as they try to increase the capacity.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Expansion plans</h2>
<p>Not only does TBC want to use more vehicles in the existing Loop, it is already planning to expand the system. At the end of March, TBC told Clark County that it had broken ground on an extension from one LVCC station to the new Resorts World hotel, and it is has permission for a similar spur to the Encore nearby.</p>
<p>More significantly, TBC also wants to build a transit system covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations connecting dozens of hotels, attractions and, ultimately, the airport. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.</p>
<p>The viability of those expansions could depend on how soon TBC can meet the technological and operational promises it made for its relatively simple LVCC Loop, and demonstrate whether taxis in tunnels can generate as much revenue as they do column inches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn and Tiger Global-backed Indian startups ShareChat and Koo have either fully or partially complied with the South Asian nation’s new IT rules, according to two people familiar with the matter and a government note obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>, unveiled in February this year, require firms to appoint and share contact details of representatives tasked with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">compliance, nodal point of reference and grievance redressals to address on-ground concerns. </span></p>
<p>The aforementioned firms have complied with this requirement, the government note and a person familiar with the matter said. The firms were required to comply with the new IT rules by this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter has yet to comply with the rules. “Twitter sent a communication late last night, sharing details of a lawyer working in a law firm in India as their Nodal Contact Person and Grievance Officer,” a note prepared by New Delhi said, adding that the rules require the aforementioned officials to be direct employees.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between Twitter and the government of India of late. This week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices to “serve a notice” about an investigation</a> into its intel on classifying Indian politicians’ tweets as misleading. Twitter called the move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">a form of intimidation</a>, cited concerns about its employees and requested the government to respect citizens&#8217; rights to free speech.</p>

<p>WhatsApp has complied with the aforementioned rules, but not with the requirement about traceability, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government earlier this week</a> over the requirement about bringing a way to trace the originator of messages. WhatsApp said it would have to compromise every users&#8217; privacy to be able to comply with this rule.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this point whether Apple, which operates iMessage, and Signal have complied with the rules.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Wednesday had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance/">asked the social media firms for an update on their compliant status</a>, TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for several technology giants, including Facebook and Google, both of which identify the nation as its biggest market by users. Neighboring nation Pakistan, which had proposed similar rules as India last year, had to withdraw them after tech giants united and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law/">threatened to leave the nation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great news for typo-prone tweeters: Twitter Blue, a $2.99 monthly subscription, appears to be coming soon to a Timeline near you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, researcher Jane Manchun Wong </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Twitter’s new subscription service is in the works. But yesterday, Twitter’s iOS App Store listing updated to list Twitter Blue as an in-app purchase, confirming earlier findings from this unofficial source. Though users can’t yet subscribe to Twitter Blue – even after downloading the app update – Wong dug up details about the service, signaling that its launch could be imminent.  </span></p>

Plus, users will be able to change the color of the Twitter app icon, as well as the color theme of their Timeline, a feature that’s already available on the web. Twitter Blue subscribers can also organize tweets into <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911">Collections</a> – this feature looks like an updated version of Bookmarks, but with the added ability to organize tweets into folders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/twitter-teases-its-upcoming-premium-service-which-it-plans-to-release-globally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter ads make up 85%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the company’s revenue.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week at J.P. Morgan’s Global Technology, Media, and Communications conference, Twitter CFO Ned Segal </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/twitter-teases-its-upcoming-premium-service-which-it-plans-to-release-globally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">indicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company views Twitter Blue and Super Follows as two separate types of subscriptions. On Google Play, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">the Twitter app</a> page lists an in-app product priced at $4.99 per item, which might indicate the upcoming launch of Super Follows, too. Segal also said that Twitter would offer more information about the service in the coming months, then “ultimately roll it out to people around the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, for those of us wondering – no, there’s no indication of plans for an “edit tweet” button at this time. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. Naturally, we do this by having candid conversations with founders and their investors.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll sit down with MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool co-founder and CEO Chris Bennett. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-mac-venture-capital-and-wonderschool">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p>
<p>Not only will we discuss how they came together for Wonderschool&#8217;s seed round in 2017, but how that translated into what has become a total of $24 million in funding from VCs like a16z and First Round Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can pitch their startup to Nichols and Bennett to get their live feedback.</p>
<p>Nichols is a former Kauffman Fellow and Investment Director at Intel Capital. His portfolio includes Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool. Nichols knows more than most of us will ever learn about seed-stage fundraising, and even gave a chat at TechCrunch Early Stage in April that outlines four strategies for securing seed funding.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll get even deeper on that subject with Nichols, and hear the perspective from the other side of the table with Bennett.</p>
<p>Wonderschool is a network of early childhood programs that combine the quality of top-notch early education with an in-home setting.</p>
<p>Bennett can talk extensively on edtech as a sector, and we&#8217;ll pick both his and Nichols&#8217; mind on that fast-growing space.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that this episode will feature an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, so founders in the audience should be ready to &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; and get in the mix.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on Wednesday, June 16 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. Extra Crunch Live is accessible to anyone who wants to attend, but on-demand access to the content, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire library of ECL episodes</a>, is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join now to check out what Aileen Lee, Roelof Botha, Mark Cuban and more had to say on earlier episodes of ECL. </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has a month to respond to concerns raised by European consumer protection agencies earlier this year, EU lawmakers <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_2744">said today</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission has launched what it described as &#8220;a formal dialogue&#8221; with the video sharing platform over its commercial practices and policy.</p>
<p>Areas of specific concern include hidden marketing, aggressive advertising techniques targeted at children and certain contractual terms in TikTok&#8217;s policies that could be considered misleading and confusing for consumers, per the Commission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting in a statement, justice commissioner Didier Reynders added: “The current pandemic has further accelerated digitalisation. This has brought new opportunities but it has also created new risks, in particular for vulnerable consumers. In the European Union, it is prohibited to target children and minors with disguised advertising such as banners in videos. The dialogue we are launching today should support TikTok in complying with EU rules to protect consumers.”</p>
<p>The background to this is that back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">February</a> the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) sent the Commission a report calling out a number of TikTok&#8217;s policies and practices &#8212; including what it said were unfair terms and copyright practices. It also flagged the risk of children being exposed to inappropriate content on the platform, and accused TikTok of misleading data processing and privacy practices.</p>
<p>Complaints were filed around the same time by consumer organisations in 15 EU countries &#8212; urging those national authorities to investigate the social media giant’s conduct.</p>
<p>The multi-pronged EU action means TikTok has not just the Commission looking at the detail of its small print but is facing questions from a network of national consumer protection authorities &#8212; which is being co-led by the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (which handles privacy issues related to the platform).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the BEUC queried why the Commission hasn&#8217;t yet launched a formal enforcement procedure.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">“</span><span lang="EN-GB">We hope that the authorities will stick to their guns in this &#8216;dialogue&#8217; which we understand is not yet a formal launch of an enforcement procedure. It must lead to good results for consumers, tackling all the points that BEUC raised. BEUC also hopes to be consulted before an agreement is reached,&#8221; a spokesperson for the organization told us. </span></p>
<p>Also reached for comment, TikTok sent us this statement on the Commission&#8217;s action, attributed to its director of public policy, Caroline Greer: <b><br />
</b></p>
<blockquote><p>As part of our ongoing engagement with regulators and other external stakeholders over issues such as consumer protection and transparency, we are engaging in a dialogue with the Irish Consumer Protection Commission and the Swedish Consumer Agency and look forward to discussing the measures we&#8217;ve already introduced. In addition, we have taken a number of steps to protect our younger users, including making all under-16 accounts private-by-default, and disabling their access to direct messaging. Further, users under 18 cannot buy, send or receive virtual gifts, and we have strict policies prohibiting advertising directly appealing to those under the age of digital consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company told us it uses age verification for personalized ads &#8212; saying users must have verified that they are 13+ to receive these ads; as well as being over the age of digital consent in their respective EU country; and also having consented to receive targeted ads.</p>
<p>However, TikTok&#8217;s age verification technology has been criticized as weak before now &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-will-recheck-the-age-of-every-user-in-italy-after-dpa-order/">recent emergency child-safety-focused enforcement action</a> by the Italian national data protection agency has led to TikTok having to pledge to strengthen its age verification processes in the country.</p>
<p>The Italian enforcement action also resulted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">TikTok removing more than 500,000 accounts</a> suspected of belonging to users aged younger than 13 earlier this month &#8212; raising further questions about whether it can really claim that under-13s aren&#8217;t routinely exposed to targeted ads on its platform.</p>

<p>In further background remarks it sent us, TikTok claimed it has clear labelling of sponsored content. But it also noted it&#8217;s made some recent changes &#8212; such as switching the label it applies on video advertising from &#8220;sponsored&#8221; to &#8220;ad&#8221; to make it clearer.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s working on a toggle that aims to make it clearer to users when they may be exposed to advertising by other users by enabling the latter users to prominently disclose that their content contains advertising.</p>
<p>TikTok said the tool is currently in beta testing in Europe but it said it expects to move to general availability this summer and will also amend its ToS to require users to use this toggle whenever their content contains advertising. (But without adequate enforcement that may just end up as another overlooked and easily abused setting.)</p>
<p>The company recently announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/tiktok-to-open-a-transparency-center-in-europe-to-take-content-and-security-questions/">transparency center in Europe</a> in a move that looks intended to counter some of the concerns being raised about its business in the region, as well as to prepare it for the increased oversight that&#8217;s coming down the pipe for all digital platforms operating in the EU &#8212; as the bloc works to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">update its digital rulebook</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The events of the past year have only served to accelerate interest in all things robotics and automation. It’s a phenomenon we’ve seen across a broad range of categories, and automotive is certainly no different.</p>
<p>Of course, carmakers are no strangers to the world of robotics. Automation has long played a key role in manufacturing, and more recently, robotics have played another central role in the form of self-driving vehicles. For this panel, however, we’re going to look past those much-discussed categories. Of late, carmakers have been investing heavily to further fuel innovation in the category.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating space &#8212; and one that covers a broad range of cross-sections, from TRI’s (Toyota) Woven City project to Ford’s recent creation of a research facility at U of M to Hyundai’s concept cars and acquisition of Boston Dynamics. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hyundaispeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hyundaispeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9, we will be joined by a trio of experts from these companies for what’s sure to be a lively discussion on the topic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Max Bajracharya</strong> is Vice President of Robotics at Toyota Research Institute. Previously serving as its Director of Robotics, he leads TRI’s work in robotics. He previously served at Alphabet’s X, as part of the Google Robotics team.</p>
<p><strong>Mario Santillo</strong> is a Technical Expert at Ford. Previously serving as a Research Engineer for the company, he’s charged with helping lead the company’s efforts at a recently announced $75 million research facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The work includes both Ford’s own robotics work, as well as partnerships with startups like Agility.</p>
<p><strong>Ernestine Fu</strong> is a director at Hyundai Motor Group. She heads development at the newly announced New Horizons Studio, a group tasked with creating Ultimate Mobility Vehicles (UMVs). She also serves as an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where she received a BS, MS, MBA and PhD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collaborative software is so hot right now, but the space is also incredibly crowded. It can be hard to rise above the noise, but Coda has managed to do so with $140 million in funding and a valuation topping $600 million.</p>
<p>So it should go without saying that we&#8217;re excited to hear from Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra and Madrona investor S. Somasegar, who invested in the company&#8217;s Series C round, on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-madrona-and-coda">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Soma is a managing director at Madrona, responsible for investments in Snowflake, UIPath, Coda, Pulumi, Seekout and more. He invests in a broad array of categories, including machine learning, next-gen cloud infrastructure, future of work, robotic process automation and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Madrona, Soma spent 27 years at Microsoft as SVP of the Developer Division. He&#8217;s got experience both as an operator and investor and will have plenty of wisdom to impart on the episode.</p>
<p>Mehrotra, for his part, has built a pretty massive business that has not only scaled well, but competes directly with giants like Google. Coda is a collaborative doc/spreadsheet software that looks to take on the G Suite. Before Coda, Mehrotra was an executive at YouTube and, prior to that, held leadership roles at Microsoft working on Windows, Office and SQL Server.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about fundraising for a product like Coda, what attracted Soma to the platform and how they work alongside one another today. We&#8217;ll also have an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where folks in the audience can come on &#8220;stage&#8221; and pitch their wares. Mehrotra and Soma will give their live feedback and, let&#8217;s face it, make all of us better at pitching in general.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on June 2 at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT and is accessible to anyone. However, only Extra Crunch members can access this episode (and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire ECL library</a>) on-demand.

					<description><![CDATA[By generating lots of cash and profit, Doximity hasn't raised a round since 2014.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There was a time when this column was more than a never-ending run of IPO coverage. Then the unicorn liquidity cycle kicked off and it’s been a long run of public offerings ever since. This morning is no exception.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm">filed to go public</a> earlier today. You likely haven’t heard of the company because it exists in the modestly obscure world of telehealth. But it’s a venture-backed startup all the same that raised more than $80 million from investors like Emergence, InterWest Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures and Threshold, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doximity/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Doximity has not fundraised since 2014, a year in which it attracted just under $82 million at a valuation of $355 million, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>. How has it managed to not raise for so long? By generating lots of cash and profit over the years. Health tech communications, it turns out, can be a lucrative endeavor.</p>

<p>Doximity is a social network that allows doctors to speak to each other while complying with HIPAA, a federal law that promotes medical privacy. The network, originally defined as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/24/doximity/">LinkedIn for medical professionals</a>, gives doctors a Rolodex for specialists, a newsfeed for healthcare updates, a communication tool to talk to patients and a job search tool.</p>
<p>In 2017, Doximity claimed that it <a href="https://press.doximity.com/articles/doximity-reaches-70-percent-of-all-us-doctors">reached 70% of all U.S. doctors</a>, more than 800,000 licensed professionals.</p>

<p>Let’s chat briefly about the larger health tech exit market and then dig into Doximity’s IPO filing and get our heads around how the company managed to avoid private-market dilution for seven years &#8212; and what the company may be worth.</p>
<h2>Health tech exits</h2>
<p>The global digital health market is estimated to hit <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/22/2196996/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Size-Will-Grow-to-USD-220-94-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAccording%20to%20the%20research%20report,%25%20from%202019%20to%202026%E2%80%9D.">$221 billion by 2026</a>, underscoring how large an opportunity the sector may present to venture capitalists. But investors aren’t merely just paying attention to estimates; they are seeing a number of exits in digital health (read: liquidity) that are warming up their checkbooks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-state-of-healthcare-q1-2021?utm_campaign=marketing_state-healthcare_q1_2021-03&amp;campaignid=270202443&amp;adgroupid=117808669574&amp;utm_term=digital%20health&amp;utm_campaign=Reports&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=adwords-reports-americas&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-298908580986&amp;hsa_grp=117808669574&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_ad=504603262549&amp;hsa_acc=5728918340&amp;hsa_kw=digital%20health&amp;hsa_cam=270202443&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqcKFBhAhEiwAfEr7zQdT0BFLIg3HewliBws-2hV2X2unUNEGFwZr2facbrhdzX_Rj6jWNBoCXEQQAvD_BwE">CB Insights</a> estimates that there were 79 healthcare IPOs and M&amp;A transactions in Q1 2021 alone, a 60% increase from the quarter prior. <a href="https://rockhealth.com/reports/whats-ahead-for-digital-health-in-2021/">Another report</a> says that there were 145 acquisitions of digital health companies in 2020, up from a solid 113 in 2019.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H9Ipq71LBg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=H9Ipq71LBg" data-secret="H9Ipq71LBg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While still growing, it’s fair to say that those figures describe a healthy exit environment.</p>
<p>The list of deals in the market is straight fire. Earlier this year, Everlywell, founded in 2015, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/everlywell-acquires-two-healthcare-companies-and-forms-parent-everly-health/">acquired two healthcare companies</a> to expand its digital health service and distribution. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Modern Fertility was bought by Ro for north of $225 million</a> in a majority-equity deal. Before you start complaining that it&#8217;s not an IPO, consider this: A less than four-year-old company just got bought for a quarter of a billion dollars by another company that is less than four years old.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1f003db3-c3b6-4a9b-9bd9-7d4082236cd9?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week had the whole crew aboard to record: Grace and Chris making us sound good, Danny to provide levity, Natasha to actually recall facts and Alex to divert us from staying on topic. It&#8217;s teamwork, people &#8212; and our transitions are proof of it.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s good that we had everyone around the virtual table, as there was quite a lot to get through:</p>
<ul>
<li>The team felt all kinds of ways about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">the Amazon-MGM deal</a>. Some of us are more positive than the rest, but what gists out from the transaction is that for Amazon, the purchase price is modest and the company is famously playing a supposedly long-game. Let&#8217;s see how James Bond fits into it. Alex receives four points for not bringing up F1 thanks to the Bond-Aston Martin connection.</li>
<li>Turning to the SPAC game, we chatted through the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">Lordstown Motors earnings results</a>, and what we can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/?tpcc=ECTW2020">parse from them regarding blank-check companies</a>, promises and reality.</li>
<li>After launching last June with just $2 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">Collab Capital has closed its debut fund at its target goal</a>: $50 million. The Black-led firm invests exclusively in Black-led startups, and got checks from Apple, PayPal and Mailchimp to name a few. We talk about this feat, and note a few other Black-led venture capital firms making waves in the industry lately.</li>
<li>We Resolved our transition puns and eventually spoke about the Affirm spin-out, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-platform/">$60 million in a funding round for BNPL for businesses.</a> There are bigger questions there around the accessibility and point of BNPL, and if it&#8217;s really re-inventing the wheel or just repackaging it with simpler UX.</li>
<li>Next up, we got into a can of worms about the future of meetings thanks to Rewatch, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/zoom-fatigue-no-more-rewatch-raises-20m-to-index-transcribe-and-store-enterprise-video-content/">a $20 million Series A</a> this week led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup helps other startups create internal, private YouTubes to archive their meetings and any video-based comms. We could only spend a second on this, so if you want our longer thoughts in the form of text, check out our three views on the topic on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe?tpcc=homepagetout">Extra Crunch!</a> <em>(Discount Code: Equity)</em></li>
<li>From there we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/interactio-a-remote-interpretation-platform-grabs-30m-after-seeing-12x-growth-during-covid-19/">had Interactio</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/fireflies-ai-raises-14m-for-its-meeting-transcription-and-automation-service/">and Fireflies.ai</a>, two more startups that are tackling the complexities of meetings in the COVID-19 era, and whatever comes next. Both recently raised new funding, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/kudo-raises-6m-for-its-real-time-translation-and-video-conference-platform/">Alex brought up Kudo</a> to add one more upstart to the mix.</li>
<li>Noom, a weight loss platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/weight-loss-platform-noom-bulks-up-on-540-million-in-new-funding/">bulked up with $540 million in funding</a> after nearly doubling its revenue from 2019 to 2020. The pandemic has made many people gain weight, but we chew into why Noom&#8217;s moment might be right now after a decade in the works.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MotoRefi has raised another $45 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs just five months after investors poured $10 million into the fintech startup to help turbocharge its auto refinancing business.</p>
<p>The startup developed an auto refinancing platform that handles the entire loan process, including finding the best rates, paying off the old lender and re-titling the vehicle. MotoRefi says using its platform saves consumers an average of $100 a month on their car payments, a goal achieved partly because it works directly with lending institutions. The company&#8217;s refinancing tools had seen steady growth until the COVID-19 pandemic popped into in higher gear. CEO Kevin Bennett said MotoRefi is on track to issue $1 billion in loans by the end of the year, a fivefold increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Bennett said the short timeline between rounds was driven by investor confidence in its metrics, which have continued on to grow at a fast pace, and the basic economics around the business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We candidly weren&#8217;t planning on raising yet, but they (Goldman Sachs) were comfortable given the relationship we have built and the track record and success of the business, to preempt the round and move that calendar up,&#8221; Bennett said.</p>
<p>MotoRefi&#8217;s platform is available in 46 states and Washington, DC, with plans to be live in all 50 states by the end of the year. The startup has ramped up hiring to help support that growth. By the first quarter of 2021, it had more than doubled its headcount to 187 employees from the same period last year. Its workforce has now popped to 250 employees. The company has hired several senior-level executives, opened a new headquarters and partnered with SoFi. Goldman Sach&#8217;s VP of venture capital and growth equity Jade Mandel has joined MotoRefi&#8217;s board.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MotoRefi raises $10M to keep pedal on auto refinancing growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/motorefi-raises-10m-to-keep-pedal-on-auto-refinancing-growth/embed/#?secret=ufLT5VHLRA" data-secret="ufLT5VHLRA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And Bennett sees plenty of room to grow as consumers seek ways to rebalance their debts. The auto refinance market in the United States is $40 billion. However, overall auto loan debt is $1.3 trillion. With 40 million auto loans originated every year, MotoRefi is promised a consistent flow of potential new customers.</p>
<p>The fresh injection of capital, which included investor IA Capital as well as returning backers Moderne Ventures, Accomplice, Link Ventures, Motley Fool Ventures and CMFG Ventures, will be used to continue to build out its products and services and hire more people. MotoRefi has raised $60 million since its inception in 2016.</p>
<p>Bennett believes the company is now in self-sustaining position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, we moved beyond the world where we are raising capital and then raising more capital as we run out of capital,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think we have a great sustainable business and so we, in some sense runway is infinite, and we are building a great profitable business. That&#8217;s not to say that we won&#8217;t ever raise again, but it will be based on strategic considerations, as opposed to out of necessity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://at.cafe">Café</a>, a new French startup founded by two brothers that wants to help companies switch to a hybrid remote-and-office workplace model. Café isn’t a traditional desk-booking tool. Instead, the company helps you see when people in your team are coming to the office so that you can plan when you should go to the office as well.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on workspace, Café focuses on people first. “We decided that we wouldn’t let you book a desk directly,” co-founder and CTO Arthur Lorotte de Banes told me.</p>
<p>When you open the app, you get a simplified calendar view. For each day, you can see your team members divided by groups — people coming to the office, people working from home, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In just a few taps, you can tell your other co-workers what you plan to do. This way, it becomes much easier to schedule meetings, have in-person conversation and more generally hang out with your co-workers. It also makes it easier to find a common day with a specific co-worker if you’re working on the same project.</p>
<p>“We interviewed 150 companies and we realized companies faced the same issue after interviewing the first five companies. They all use spreadsheets,” co-founder and CEO Tom Nguyen told me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158738" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158738" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2158738" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png" alt="" width="1024" height="698" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=2048,1395 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158738" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Café</p></div></p>
<p>Using a tool like Café also gives you insights about your office. For instance, you can see the average number of persons in your office depending on the day of the week or the day of the month. Admins can configure a weekly reminder to make sure that everybody fills out information.</p>
<p>In addition to its mobile app and web app, Café integrates with your existing tools. For instance, you can connect your Café account with Slack so that your status on Slack reflects your status in Café. Teammates can hover over your name to know that you’re in the office or you’re at home.</p>
<p>The company is also working on integrations with human resource information systems, such as <a href="https://payfit.com/en/">PayFit</a>, so that your vacation is automatically synchronized with Café.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158739" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2158739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png" alt="" width="1024" height="698" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=2048,1395 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Café</p></div></p>
<p>As companies start hashing out a plan to return to the office, Café arrives on the market at the right time. Companies can create custom statuses to fit their specific needs. For instance, a Café customer has created a status so that they know who has the office keys to make sure that the office remains open.</p>
<p>The company raised a $1 million seed round from 122West, Kima Ventures, Jonathan Widawski, Guillaume Lestrade, Jacques-Edouard Sabatier and various business angels who work or have worked for WeWork, Dropbox, Github, Snapchat, Intercom, Stripe, Alan and PayFit.</p>
<p>Like Typeform, Doodle or Slido, Café has chosen a freemium strategy. Teams can sign up for free and start using the product with their immediate co-workers. You don’t need to enter card information to sign up.</p>
<p>If you want to roll it out across the organization with more users, you have to start paying — existing clients include Livestorm, Jellysmack and Yubo. The startup believes employees will become product advocates for the entire organization. And it seems like the right strategy for a product that is supposed to make employees happier at work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon, in its ever-growing desire to become a super app in India, is testing a new category to persuade users to spend more time on the shopping service: Feature articles.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce giant has quietly launched “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/kindle-dbs/alp/articles">Featured Articles</a>” on its shopping app and website in India that showcases feature articles, commentary and analysis on a wide-range of topics including politics, governance, entertainment, sports, business, finance, health, fitness, books and food. The articles are sourced from several large local media houses and magazines.</p>
<p>Some of these articles are &#8220;exclusively&#8221; available on Amazon, the company says on the website. To drive engagement, Amazon is also sending notifications to some Kindle users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2158722" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158722" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2158722 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="515" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=1536,772 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158722" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Himanshu Gupta</p></div></p>
<p>The latest addition, which was spotted and shared with TechCrunch by <a href="https://twitter.com/HalfRebel">Himanshu Gupta</a>, comes days after Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">launched a free video streaming service</a> within the shopping app in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the new feature to TechCrunch, adding, “we remain focused on creating new and engaging experiences for our customers and as part of this endeavour, we have been testing a new service that brings articles on different topics like current affairs, books, business, entertainment, sports and lifestyle amongst others for readers.”</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Amazon has explored integrating some reading material to its shopping service in India. In 2018, Amazon India started to feature some gadget reviews and listicles, sourced from local media houses.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by partners <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/khaledtalhouni">Khaled Talhouni</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAS9shMBvkrmI5B6Dw9eWArXXVBf40VwKCg?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3Bzl1V0LmCR6GUSeqqO6KDTA%3D%3D">Sarah Abu Risheh</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAALH0BkB5TGrtk7e1BXXYMve3LFlsB7HMTE?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_company%3B9c8CGLTiTW%2Bb7lno%2BaCeRA%3D%3D">Stephanie Nour Prince</a>, Nuwa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targets markets in the Middle East and the wider GCC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://nuwacapital.io/who-we-are/">partners</a> have a track record of investing in Middle Eastern companies &#8212; Careem, Mumzworld, Golden Scent and Nana Direct</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they have also invested in Twiga Foods and AZA, two East African startups.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have cut checks for three companies with this new fund: two Dubai-based companies, Eyewa and Flexxpay, and one Egypt-based company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/egyptian-furniture-marketplace-homzmart-raises-15m-series-a-to-expand-across-mena/">Homzmart</a>. And d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">espite having a strong focus on the Middle East and the GCC, the firm wants to double down on investing in more African startups, particularly in Egypt and East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with the partners to discuss their past investments, why they are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa and the similarities and differences between the regions they operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This interview has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been edited</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for length and clarity.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Why is Nuwa Capital choosing Sub-Saharan Africa as one of its target markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Khaled</strong>: I mean, it&#8217;s not our primary market, but it&#8217;s an area of secondary focus for us, which we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there are a lot of learnings from the Middle East that we can take from our experience of investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here that we can use for investing in Africa, particularly in East Africa, especially as the digital adoption increases very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Nuwa Capital invested in Homzmart recently. Are there any other startups Nuwa has invested in or plans to in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: So there is a lot of the deal flow we&#8217;ve seen in North Africa, and we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started in December. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeing a lot of companies in Egypt, Morocco, across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Africa, and in the coming months, we will be investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across that geography</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for now, Homzmart is our only African investment.</span></p>

<p><strong>TC: How do you plan to make the transition in investing in Sub-Saharan Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: We have a network in East Africa because, in our previous fund, we did invest in two companies in Kenya. One was Twiga and the other was BitPesa, which is now AZA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve invested in those, and as part of our due diligence and network that we&#8217;ve built in Africa, that&#8217;s why </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity is there because we got to see it and understood the market with those two companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: From your perception of how the African market is, how is it different from the GCC?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: There are different ways to look at it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Africa is different from the GCC markets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the population sizes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the purchasing power of people and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies that get a lot of attraction </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on mass volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the success of the company sometimes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on volume. So like a large number of people signing up to a company, for example. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Twiga, for example, it was bridging the gap between farmers and vendors, so they had a large number of farmers, and that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had a lot of power. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s where we see opportunity in Africa &#8212; in the power of the population</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: From a VC standpoint, many funds have cropped up in the GCC region in the past couple of years, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o there&#8217;s a lot more capital flowing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the market. That may not be exactly mirrored yet in East Africa if </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I guess what we see from where we are in East Africa is that the capital seems to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be concentrated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around a particular set of founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: What will be the investment strategy for Nuwa Capital in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: We look for companies that fit into our thesis. So I can talk a bit more about the sectors that we invest in. So fintech is a large one that we look at. And then, we have a big focus on SaaS across different industries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like e-commerce and marketplaces, the top of private label angle and private brands selling through e-commerce marketplaces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then we also have, we also look at something that we call the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digitizing industries, and that&#8217;s companies that are disrupting the traditional industries through technology in education, health tech, agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So these are the theses we look at, and that&#8217;s how we drive our investment strategy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticket sizes and stages, we focus on seed and Series A, and then we could also follow on in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: So when it particularly comes to Africa, what we&#8217;ve seen, which is also very interesting for us, is an increase of companies pitching to us in healthcare, in agritech, in different variations of financial services or intersection of fintech and something else</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be very interesting also for us as we move forward, as we start looking a bit more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Since you are relatively new to African investment, will you be looking to partner or liaise with other VCs based on the continent?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s a very common practice for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re quite collaborative as a fund, and that&#8217;s also due to the nature of the region where you end up co-investing with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds, and sometimes they tend to be the same funds that you have a similar mindset with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that happens quite a bit; I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s very likely also to happen with funds we&#8217;ve co-invested with in the past in Africa.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Egypt has been one of the exciting countries in both Africa and the Middle East region. What do you think is going for the market?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: Egypt is one of the primary markets that we focus on. We are seeing a large part of our pipeline coming from Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve also seen a great shift in Egypt over the past few years where the type of entrepreneurs, the type of founders that are coming to us, are more mature and more experienced and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a higher calibre than before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e used to see a lot of earlier-stage companies with inexperienced founders. But today, what we&#8217;re seeing is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">amazing. We are very bullish on the market when it is one of our primary focus markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: When companies come out of Egypt, their expansion strategy is usually either to the rest of North Africa or East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some will come to the GCC, while some will stay in Africa, depending on what industry they&#8217;re in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that as we invest more in Egypt and then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into our East Africa strategy will give us </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good exposure in Africa, and as we grow, our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds will look more into Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there a portion of the fund dedicated to the African market?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Khalid</strong>: I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have a specific percentage, but the continent is part of the major strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a significant </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the fund targeted at Egypt but we&#8217;d like to do at least 5-10% of the fund in Africa, excluding Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It depends on the final fund size but we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bullish on Africa.</span></p>
