										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup by an Apple alum that has become home to millions of low-skilled workers in India said on Tuesday it has raised an additional $12.5 million, just five months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/apple-alums-jobs-app-for-indias-workers-secures-8-million/">after securing $8 million from high-profile investors</a>.</p>
<p>One-year-old Apna said Sequoia Capital India and Greenoaks Capital led the $12.5 Series B investment in the startup. Existing investors Lightspeed India and Rocketship VC also participated in the round. The startup, whose name is Hindi for &#8220;ours,&#8221; has now raised over $20.5 million.</p>
<p>More than 6 million low-skilled workers such as drivers, delivery personnel, electricians, beauticians have joined Apna to find jobs, and upskill themselves. But there’s more to this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An analysis of the platform showed how workers are helping one another solve problems &#8212; such as a beautician advising another beautician to perform hair dressing in a particular way that tends to make customers happier and tip more, and someone sharing how they negotiated a hike in their salary from their employer.</p>
<p>“The sole idea of this is to create a network for these workers,” said Nirmit Parikh, Apna founder and chief executive told TechCrunch in an interview. “Network gap has been a very crucial challenge. Solving it enables people to unlock more and more opportunities,” he said. Harshjit Sethi, Principal at Sequoia India, said Apna was making inroads with “building a professional social network for India.”</p>
<p>The startup has become an attraction for several big firms including Amazon, Flipkart, Unacademy, Byju&#8217;s, Swiggy, BigBasket, Dunzo, BlueStar, and Grofers who have joined as recruiters to hire workers. Apna offers a straightforward onboarding process &#8212; thanks to support for multiple local languages &#8212; and allows users to create a virtual business card, which is then shown to the potential recruiters.</p>
<p>The past six months have been all about growth at Apna, said Parikh. The app, available on Android, had 1.2 million users in August last year, for instance. During this period, there have been 60 million interactions between recruiters and potential applicants, he said. The platform has amassed over 80,000 employers.</p>
<p>“Apna has taken a jobs-centric approach to upskilling that we are very excited about. Lack of accountability has been the core issue with current skill / vocational learning alternatives for grey and blue-collar workers. Apna has turned the problem on its head by creating net-positive job outcomes for anyone who chooses to upskill on the platform,” said Vaibhav Agrawal, Partner at Lightspeed India, in a statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119367" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119367" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nirmit Parikh</p></div></p>
<p>Parikh got the idea of building Apna after he kept hearing about the difficulty his family and friends faced in India in hiring people. This was puzzling to Parikh as he wondered how could there be a shortage of workers in India when there are hundreds of millions of people actively looking for such jobs. The problem, Parikh realized was that there wasn&#8217;t a scalable networking infrastructure in place to connect workers with employers.</p>
<p>Before creating the startup, Parikh met workers and worked with them to understand where the core challenges they faced. That journey has not ended. The startup talks to over 15,000 users each day to understand what else Apna could do for them.</p>
<p>“One of the things we heard was that users were facing difficulties with interviews. So we started groups to practice them with interviews. We also started upskilling users, which has made us an edtech player. We plan to ramp up this effort in the coming months,” he said.</p>
<p>Parikh said the startup is overwhelmed each day with the response it is getting from its customers and the industry. Each day, he said, people share how they were able to land jobs, or increase their earnings. In recent months, several high-profile executives from companies such as Uber and BCG have joined Apna to scale the startup’s vision, he said.</p>
<p>The app currently has no ads, and Parikh said he intends to not change that. &#8220;Once you get in the ad business, you start doing things you probably shouldn&#8217;t be doing,&#8221; he said. The startup instead plans to monetize its platform by charging recruiters, and offering upskill courses. But Parikh maintained that Apna will always offer its courses to users for free. The premium version will target those who need extensive assistance, he said.</p>
<p>As is the case elsewhere, millions of people lost their livelihood in India in the past year as coronavirus shut many businesses and workers migrated to their homes. There are over 250 million blue and grey-collar workers in India, and providing them meaningful employment opportunities is one of the biggest challenges in our country, said Sethi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google over the weekend began to update many of its flagship iOS apps after a lengthy delay caused by the company&#8217;s failure to add Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3wann9gh">newly required privacy labels</a> in a timely fashion. Though Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">earlier this year</a> said it would &#8220;soon&#8221; begin to add the labels to its apps as they were updated, it has still yet to do so for a number of key properties &#8212; including Search, Photos, Assistant, Maps, Pay, Chrome, and others.</p>
<p>Per Apple&#8217;s policy, developers cannot issue further updates until privacy labels are applied. That prevented Google from updating many of its top apps for a much longer period of time than usual &#8212; especially for a company of its size where minor updates containing bug fixes and performance improvements are issued on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, hadn&#8217;t been updated for three months before the update that rolled out this weekend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According their iOS App Store listings, Slides, Docs, Sheets and Calendar all received updates this weekend, as well. And over the past couple of weeks, updates for other newly labeled Google apps have also been restarted &#8212; including YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, Google Tasks, and Google Podcasts, for example.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been tracking Google&#8217;s app updates <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OmRV-FPmtTNng9vCe_5sIlbejR0Gth6tQruQCNEhveQ/edit#gid=0">here</a> in Google Sheets. (Appfigures confirmed our spreadsheet&#8217;s accuracy by running it against its own data.)</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s set of newly updated apps aren&#8217;t the only ones from Google to have received their privacy labels in 2021. Labels can be applied without issuing an app update which makes them harder to spot, sometimes.</p>
<p>Across Google&#8217;s full suite of iOS apps, those apps with labels now include:</p>
<p>Google One, Google Podcasts, Google Stadia, Google Fit, Google Fi, Google Tasks, Google Chat, Onduo, Project Baseline, YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, YouTube Kids, YouTube Studio, Google Meet, Google Smart Lock, Motion Stills, Google Fiber, Google Ads, Wear OS, Google Calendar, Google Classroom, Google Slides, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Play Movies, Google Home, Fiber TV, Google Translate, and Google Authenticator.</p>
<p>Google has not said why it taking so long to apply its labels. It initially attributed its delay to add the privacy labels to its annual holiday code freeze &#8212; a time of the year when the company pauses updates on its apps while many people take time off.</p>
<p>But as the weeks turned into months, it was clear that Google was taking a much more cautious and methodical approach to applying the labels than other large tech companies. As a result, it&#8217;s received increased attention and scrutiny of its app updates.</p>
<p>In fact, every time a new Google app was updated with a label, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label">made</a> <a href="https://www.imore.com/heres-how-much-data-youtube-collects-you-ios?amp">headlines</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ios-apps-update-gmail-meet-sheets-docs-calendar-tasks-200335624.html">Engadget today reported</a> on Gmail and other apps being updated over the weekend, for example.</p>
<p>In mid-January, Google officially responded to the curiosity over its delays <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-and-control-your-privacy">with a blog post</a> explaining that its iOS apps would receive privacy labels as it received its next update. But the two have not necessarily gone hand-in-hand. Gmail <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/">received</a> its privacy label back on Feb. 22, according to reports, but hadn&#8217;t been updated until just now.</p>
<p>And the list of labeled apps is far longer than the list of updated ones.</p>
<p>Google has not responded to a request for comment at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“You’re seeing a lot of large companies … are now investing significant amounts into really trying to understand their emissions profile and prioritize emission reductions in a data-driven way."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commitments to carbon neutrality keep coming from all corners of the business world &#8212; over the past few weeks, companies ranging from the fast-casual restaurant chain Sweetgreen to the security-focused networking IT company Palo Alto Networks to the online craft retailer Etsy committed to net-zero carbon emission plans.</p>
<p>As the companies look for ways to reduce their energy consumption, they&#8217;re turning to carbon offset programs as a stopgap measure until the energy grid decarbonizes, they implement technologies to reduce their energy consumption, or both.</p>
<p>This push toward corporate sustainability is creating all kinds of strange bedfellows and startup opportunities, with major corporate offset programs and the establishment of new startups focused on offsets creating channels for sustainable technologies to get to market.</p>
<p>The latest example of a company leveraging a sustainability angle to tie a corporate partner even closer to their business is the <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-and-deloitte-commit-reducing-carbon-emissions-sustainable-fuel-agreement">agreement between Delta and Deloitte</a>, which involves the accounting and consulting firm paying Delta for renewable jet fuel to offset the emissions of its corporate travel.</p>
<p>To be clear, a better policy for Deloitte would be to cut back on non-essential travel significantly and focus on doing as much remote work as possible to reduce the need for flights. But in some cases business travel is unavoidable, and most folks want to get back to a pre-pandemic normal, which &#8212; at least in the U.S. and other countries &#8212; will include significantly ramping up air travel for a percentage of the population.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200218-climate-change-how-to-cut-your-carbon-emissions-when-flying">As the BBC noted</a>, air travel accounts for roughly 5 percent of the emissions that contribute to global climate change, but only a small percentage of the world actually uses air transport. <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/co2-emissions-commercial-aviation-2018">According to one analysis from the International Council on Clean Transport</a>, just 3 percent of the world&#8217;s population flies regularly. And if everyone in the world did fly, aircraft emissions would top the CO2 emissions of the entire U.S.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Deloitte and Delta and startups.</p>
<p>Delta&#8217;s deal to buy sustainable aviation fuel that would offset a portion of the carbon emissions associated with Deloitte&#8217;s business travel is one small step toward greening the airline industry, but the question is whether it&#8217;s a significant first step or just an attempt to greenwash the unsustainable travel habits of a consulting industry that prides itself on such perks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://aws.com">AWS</a> launched the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/amazon-debuts-a-scale-model-autonomous-car-to-teach-developers-machine-learning/">DeepRacer League in 2018</a> as a fun way to teach developers machine learning, and it&#8217;s been building on the idea ever since. Today, it announced the latest league season with two divisions: Open and Pro.</p>
<p>As Marcia Villalba wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepracer-leagues-2021-season-launches-with-new-open-and-pro-divisions/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new league, &#8220;AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test [reinforcement learning] models by racing virtually in the AWS DeepRacer console or physically on a track at AWS and customer events. AWS DeepRacer is for developers of all skill levels, even if you don’t have any ML experience. When learning RL using AWS DeepRacer, you can take part in the AWS DeepRacer League where you get experience with machine learning in a fun and competitive environment.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the company started these as in-person races with physical cars, the pandemic has forced them to make it a virtual event over the last year, but the new format seemed to be blocking out newcomers. Because the goal is to teach people about machine learning, getting new people involved is crucial to the company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it created the Open League, which as the name suggests is open to anyone. You can test your skills and if you&#8217;re good enough, finishing in the top 10%, you can compete in the Pro division. Everyone competes for prizes, as well, such as vehicle customizations.</p>
<p>The top 16 in the Pro League each month race for a chance to go to the finals at AWS re:Invent in 2021, an event that may or may not be virtual, depending on where we are in the pandemic recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook was <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-facebook-privacy-settlement-approval-20210227-okljqhsiargl7ijvzzfcotpyby-story.html">ordered to pay $650 million Friday</a> for running afoul of an Illinois law designed to protect the state&#8217;s residents from invasive privacy practices.</p>
<p>That law, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bipa/">Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)</a>, is a powerful state measure that&#8217;s tripped up tech companies in recent years. The suit against Facebook was first filed in 2015, alleging that Facebook&#8217;s practice of tagging people in photos using facial recognition without their consent violated state law.</p>
<p>1.6 million Illinois residents will receive at least $345 under the final settlement ruling in California federal court. The final number is $100 higher than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/facebook-will-pay-550-million-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-over-privacy-violations/">$550 million Facebook proposed in 2020</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/illinois-facebook-users-to-get-more-than-300-each-in-privacy-settlement/">which a judge deemed inadequate</a>. Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/update-face-recognition/">disabled the automatic facial recognition tagging features in 2019</a>, making it opt-in instead and addressing some of the privacy criticisms echoed by the Illinois class action suit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A cluster of lawsuits accused Microsoft, Google and Amazon of breaking the same law last year after Illinois residents&#8217; faces were used to train their facial recognition systems without explicit consent.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="71UZWCkE1J"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/">Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/embed/#?secret=71UZWCkE1J" data-secret="71UZWCkE1J" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Illinois privacy law has tangled up some of tech&#8217;s giants, but BIPA has even more potential to impact smaller companies with questionable privacy practices. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/class-action-suit-against-clearview-ai-cites-illinois-law-that-cost-facebook-550m/">controversial facial recognition software company Clearview AI</a> now faces its own BIPA-based class action lawsuit in the state after the company <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210116/12585446068/appeals-court-rejects-clearviews-attempt-to-dodge-state-lawsuit-trying-to-make-it-federal-case.shtml">failed to dodge the suit by pushing it out of state courts</a>.</p>
<p>A $650 million settlement would be enough to crush any normal company, though Facebook can brush it off much like it did with the FTC&#8217;s record-setting $5 billion penalty in 2019. But the Illinois law isn&#8217;t without teeth. For Clearview, it was enough to make the company <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-no-facial-recognition-private-companies">pull out of business in the state altogether</a>.</p>
<p>The law can&#8217;t punish a behemoth like Facebook in the same way, but it is one piece in a regulatory puzzle that poses an increasing threat to the way tech&#8217;s data brokers have done business for years. With regulators at the federal, state and legislative level proposing aggressive measures to rein in tech, the landmark Illinois law provides a compelling framework that other states could copy and paste. And if big tech thinks navigating federal oversight will be a nightmare, a patchwork of aggressive state laws governing how tech companies do business on a state-by-state basis is an alternate regulatory future that could prove even less palatable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter announced Monday that it would begin injecting new labels into users&#8217; timelines to push back against misinformation that could disrupt the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. The labels, which will also appear as pop-up messages in the retweet window, are the company&#8217;s latest product experiment designed to shape behavior on the platform for the better.</p>
<p>The company will attach notices to tweeted misinformation warning users that the content &#8220;may be misleading&#8221; and linking out to vetted public health information. These initial vaccine misinformation sweeps, which begin today, will be conducted by human moderators at Twitter and not automated moderation systems.</p>
<p>Twitter says the goal is to use these initial determinations to train its AI systems so that down the road a blend of human and automated efforts will scan the site for vaccine misinformation. The latest misinformation measure will target tweets in English before expanding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter also introduced a new strike system for violations of its pandemic-related rules. The new system is modeled after a set of consequences it implemented for voter suppression and voting-related misinformation. Within that framework, a user with two or three &#8220;strikes&#8221; faces a 12-hour account lockout. With four violations, they lose account access for one week, with permanent suspension looming after five strikes.</p>
<p>Twitter introduced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">first pandemic-specific policies a year ago</a>, banning tweets promoting false treatment or prevention claims along with any content that could put people at higher risk of spreading COVID-19. In December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/twitter-will-force-users-to-delete-covid-19-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/">Twitter added new rules focused on popular vaccine conspiracy theories</a> and announced that warning labels were on the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the next Y Combinator demo day approaches, more startups from the current Winter 2021 batch are showing up in our inboxes. One of the most interesting from the mix is <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a>, which is building human resources (HR) software for Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The company fits into a theme I&#8217;ve noticed amongst startups, namely a focus on taking proven software genre approaches to specific parts of the world, localizing them and building in-region winners. This theme is not new, of course, but it does feel slightly more pronounced amongst recent accelerator batches than before (TechCrunch covers Techstars, Y Combinator, 500 Startups and other accelerators as part of our startup focus). Perhaps this is the impact of so many accelerators going virtual, widening the founder pool from whom they might matriculate to include a more global group of founders.</p>
<p>Back to BrioHR itself, the company is announcing $1.3 million in fundraising, inclusive of its YC check. The investment was led by <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/">Global Founders Capital</a>, and saw participation from <a href="https://east.vc/">East Ventures</a> and angel investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-croc-93669426">Benjamin Croc</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, who is located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (the city pictured in the image at the top of this post). The time zones were tricky to navigate, but the company&#8217;s vision was simple enough: A software-as-a-service (SaaS) HR software suite, tailored to fit the laws of the Southeast Asian region.</p>
<p>Croc and his co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabil-oudghiri-870372b5/">Nabil Oudghiri</a>, founded the company in 2018, incorporating in the second half of the year after talking over their idea for a few months. BrioHR did not launch its product until the fourth quarter of 2019, opening for what Croc described as early adopters. The startup launched more broadly in the first quarter of 2020, right in time for COVID-19 to shake up the world.</p>
<p>Its fundraising came in two chunks, one in the middle of 2020 and one that came in the third quarter of the year; the first chunk of the raise was larger than the second. BrioHR raised the capital using a convertible note, with terms that Croc described as near to standard.</p>
<p>In our conversation, TechCrunch was curious about how prevalent SaaS as a model is in Malaysia and the other countries the startups wants to sell into. The co-founder said that while SaaS is not as well known in his part of the world as it is in the United States &#8212; not a huge surprise given that the U.S. is the largest SaaS market in the world &#8212; he praised the speed at which Southeast Asian countries adopt business trends; if Croc is right, his view could point to a very active subscription software market in the region in coming years.</p>
<p>BrioHR competes with local companies that are more focused on providing single solutions, like payroll management. From our discussion, it appears that Croc hopes that by going broad, in a feature sense, BrioHR will surpass legacy competitors. The startup is itself still building out its regional tooling, providing payroll support in only a handful of countries. It intends to expand that service to new countries this year, and be everywhere with its payroll product in two to three years, its co-founder said.</p>
<p>Notably, even though it has already raised capital, BrioHR intends to take part in Y Combinator&#8217;s demo day. Croc said it is taking part for optionality. TechCrunch read that as the company isn&#8217;t actively looking to raise more capital at the moment, but wouldn&#8217;t turn down another convertible note at a comfortable cap. Then again, what company at any demo day would?</p>
<p>Since launching out of its early-adopter program, Croc said that the company has grown 10x. That&#8217;s not hard from a small base, so the company&#8217;s 2021 growth will be more illustrative of its true near-term potential. Let&#8217;s see what new metrics it breaks out in a few weeks&#8217; time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab packed a ton of news into Monday to kick off this week: It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/">going public via a SPAC merger</a>, for one, and it&#8217;s also building a new, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/">larger launch vehicle called Neutron</a> to support heavier payloads. I spoke to Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck about why it&#8217;s building Neutron now, and why it&#8217;s also choosing to go public at the same time. Unsurprisingly, the two things are tightly linked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the benefit of flying Electron [Rocket Lab&#8217;s current, smaller launch vehicle] for a lot of customers. and we also have a Space Systems Division that supplies components into a number of spacecraft, including some of the mega constellations,&#8221; Beck told me. &#8220;So we have very strong relationships with a lot of different customers, and I think we get unique insight on where the industry is going, and where the where the pain points are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those pain points informed Neutron, which is a two-stage reusable rocket. Rocket Lab already broke with Beck&#8217;s past thinking on what the launch market needed by developing partial reusability for Electron, and it&#8217;s going further still with Neutron, which will include a first stage that returns to Earth and lands propulsively on a platform stationed at sea, much like SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9. But the market has shifted since Rocket Lab built Electron — in part because of what it helped unlock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The creation of Neutron came from two discrete factors: One, the current need in the marketplace today. Also, if you project it forward a little bit, Neutron will deliver the vast majority — over 90% of — all the satellites that are around or in some form of planning. And if you look at those satellites, 80% of them are megaconstellations by volume. So, in talking with a bunch of different customers, it was really, really apparent that a megaconstellation-building machine is what the market really needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beck says that combining that market need with a historical analysis that showed most large launch vehicles have taken off half-full resulted in them arriving at Neutron&#8217;s eight metric ton (just over 17,600 lbs.) total cargo mass capacity. It should put it in the sweet spot where it takes off full nearly every time, but also can still meet the mass requirement needs of just about every satellite customer out there, both now and in the future.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rocket Lab to go public via SPAC at valuation of $4.1 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/embed/#?secret=99rJ1gG5lj" data-secret="99rJ1gG5lj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re covered in scars and battle wounds from the development of Electron. The one thing that Elon and I agree on very strongly is by far the hardest part of a rocket is actually scaling it — getting to orbit is hard, but actually scaling manufacturing is ridiculously hard. Now, the good news is that we&#8217;ve been through all of that, and manufacturing isn&#8217;t just as product on the floor; it&#8217;s ERP systems, quality systems, finance, supply chain and so on and so forth. So all that infrastructure is is built.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the factory and manufacturing processes and infrastructure, Beck notes that Electron and Neutron will share size-agnostic elements like computing and avionics, and much of the work done to get Electron certified for launch will also apply to Neutron, realizing further cost and time savings relative to what was required to get Electron up and flying. Beck also said that the process of making Electron has just made Rocket Lab extremely attuned to costs overall, and that will definitely translate to how competitive it can be with Neutron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because electron has a $7.5 million sticker price, we&#8217;ve just been forced into finding ways to do things hyperefficiently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got a $7.5 million sticker price, you can&#8217;t spend $2 million on flight safety analysis, payload environmental analysis, etc. — you just can&#8217;t do that. With a $60 million or $80 million vehicle you can amortize that. So we&#8217;ve kind of been forced into doing everything hyperefficiently. And it&#8217;s not just systems; it includes fundamental launch vehicle design. So when we apply all of those learnings to Nutron, we really feel like we&#8217;re gonna bring a highly competitive product to the marketplace.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the SPAC merger, Beck said that the decision to go public now really boils down to two reasons: The first is to raise the capital required to build Neutron, as well as fund &#8220;other&#8221; projects. The other is to acquire the kind of &#8220;public currency&#8221; to pursue the kinds of acquisitions in terms of business that Rocket Lab is hoping to achieve. Why specifically pursue a SPAC merger instead of a traditional IPO? Efficiency and a fixed capital target, essentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were actually sort of methodically stepping toward an IPO at the time and, we were just sort of minding our own business, but it was clear we were pursued very vigorously by a tremendous number of potential SPAC partners,&#8221; Beck told me. &#8220;Ultimately, on the balance of timelines, this just really accelerated our ability to do the things we want to do. Because, yes, as you pointed out, this kind of streamlined the process but also provided certainty around proceeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SPAC transaction, once complete, will result in Rocket Lab having approximately $750 million in cash to work with. One of the advantages of the SPAC route is that how much you raise via the public listing isn&#8217;t reliant on how the stock performs on the day — Beck and company know and can plan on that figure becoming available to them, barring any unexpected and unlikely barriers to the transaction&#8217;s closing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having all the capital we need, sitting there ready to go, that really sets us up for a strong execution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you look at Rocket Lab&#8217;s history, we&#8217;ve only raised spend a couple of hundred million dollars to date, within all the things we&#8217;ve done. So capitalizing the company with $750 million — I would expect big things at that point.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might call <a href="https://capp.fm">Cappuccino</a> the anti-Clubhouse, but the company has been iterating on its app concept for a couple of years — its CEO doesn’t have any strong opinions on Clubhouse. And it’s true that Cappuccino is an interesting social app on its own. It has been attracting a loyal user base, especially after a TikTok video went viral.</p>
<p>The startup says it is building an app that helps you record podcasts with friends. Many people have discovered podcasts over the past few years. Podcasts let you subscribe to audio shows and listen to episodes on demand.</p>
<p>At first, people subscribe to podcasts because of their interests. But if you talk about podcasts with your friends, they’ll tell you that they like a show in particular because of the personalities of the hosts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Listening to a podcast is a content consumption experience that feels like nothing else out there. You might watch all videos released by a particular YouTuber and you might think you know a lot about someone’s personal life by following them on Instagram.</p>
<p>But listening to someone for hours at a time with earbuds in your ears is a very intimate experience. When a podcast works, it feels like you’re sitting in a room with a few friends and just listening to what they have to say.</p>
<p>And yet, chances are your favorite podcast hosts are not your friends.</p>
<p>This is where Cappuccino fits. The app lets you create groups with your friends or your families. Members of the group can record a short audio message — a bean, as the startup calls it. They talk about what’s on their mind for a couple of minutes. The next morning, group members receive a notification saying that your morning cappuccino has been brewed.</p>
<p>When you hit play, a chill intro music starts playing followed by audio messages from your friends. It isn’t just a succession of voice memos — it feels like a relaxing mix of happy, funny, caring, thoughtful messages from your friends.</p>
<p>While Cappuccino is a social app, it is focused on your close friends and your family. You aren’t trying to get more followers and you are not sharing public posts. Everything is private by design and focused on groups of real-life friends.</p>
<p>In many ways, it reminds me of Snapchat’s group stories. But Snapchat wasn’t the main inspiration for Cappuccino — it was podcasting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119170" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119170" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2119170" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png" alt="" width="1024" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119170" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cappuccino</p></div></p>
<h2>Prototype early, iterate often</h2>
<p>I talked with the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Gilles Poupardin about the origin story of the app. Cappuccino isn’t Poupardin’s first startup. He had worked on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/whyd/">Whyd</a> for several years and lived the full startup experience — he raised founding rounds, chose to pivot, attended Y Combinator in the Bay Area, parted ways with his company’s CTO and chose to shutter the startup.</p>
<p>Among other things, Whyd worked on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/whyd-announces-its-voice-controlled-connected-speaker-for-299/">voice-controlled connected speaker</a> before Amazon’s Echo product lineup and Google’s Nest speakers really took off. It’s hard to compete with tech giants, even harder when you’re competing on the hardware front.</p>
<p>After that, the Whyd team worked on a service that lets you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/whyd-now-helps-companies-create-their-custom-voice-assistant/">create your own voice assistant</a>. That didn’t really take off as expected either.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2019, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierdesmoulin/">Olivier Desmoulin</a> reached out to Poupardin. Back then, Desmoulin was heading design for <a href="https://www.jumboprivacy.com">Jumbo</a>, an app that helps you stay on top of your online privacy.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy assistant Jumbo raises $8 million and releases major update&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/privacy-assistant-jumbo-raises-8-million-and-releases-major-update/embed/#?secret=JpZiVPgpMU" data-secret="JpZiVPgpMU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“At the time, I didn’t know if I wanted to start a company again — I pivoted 15 times [with Whyd],” Poupardin told me.</p>
<p>But they started discussing about podcasts and AirPods — and audio at large — as the next frontier for social apps. The basic premise was simple. A lot of people were listening to podcasts, but very few people were creating their own podcasts.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why your neighbor doesn’t have its own podcast but sometimes posts stuff on Instagram and Snapchat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podcasts are long-form content.</li>
<li>It’s technically complicated to record and release a podcast.</li>
<li>You are trying to attract an audience of people who don’t know you.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Cappuccino, the idea is to take a reverse stance on these three points: short content, easy to record and personal. It’s supposed to be a better experience for both people recording audio and people listening to audio.</p>
<p>The first version of Cappuccino isn’t an app, it’s a side project. “We created a group on WhatsApp, we invited 10 to 15 people and we asked them to record voice memos and send them all to Olivier,” Poupardin told me.</p>
<p>Every night, Olivier Desmoulin would fire up GarageBand and create a mix of all voice memos. In the morning, he would send a message to the group conversation on WhatsApp and write: “Hey, your cappuccino is here.”</p>

<p>After getting some positive feedback from group members, Pouparding and Desmoulin chose to move forward and create something that feels more like an app. But they both knew that creating a social app was incredibly hard when it comes to attracting users. They developed something quickly so that they weren&#8217;t wasting time developing something that nobody would use.</p>
<p>“We built the first version of the app in four days by using a hack — we were using <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a> as the backend service,” Poupardin said.</p>
<p>Once again, feedback from beta users was pretty good. They showed the app to some investors and ended up raising $1.2 million from Alexia Bonatsos (Dream Machine, also a former TechCrunch editor), SV Angel, Kevin Carter (Night Capital), Niv Shrug Capital, Jean de La Rochebrochard (Kima Ventures), Kevin Kuipers, Willy Braun, Marie Ekeland, Solomon Hykes (founder of Docker), Pierre Valade (founder of Sunrise and Jumbo Privacy), Moshe Lifschitz (Basement Fund), Anthony Marnell, Bryan Kim and a bunch of others.</p>
<p>Gawen Arab who was the CTO at Whyd teamed up once again with Poupardin, proving that time is a flat circle. He&#8217;s now co-founder and CTO at Cappuccino.</p>

<h2>Letting people talk about you</h2>
<p>The Cappuccino team hasn’t been active when it comes to press relations or ads. It’s been a slow build up with some interesting spikes.</p>
<p>Last summer, Product Hunt super user <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@chrismessina">Chris Messina</a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cappuccino-4">created a post</a> about Cappuccino. It was a bit of a surprise as the startup wasn’t trying to get featured on Product Hunt. Still, the co-founders diligently answered questions from the Product Hunt community.</p>
<p>The following day, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/5868">Product Hunt’s newsletter</a> featured Cappuccino. It was titled “The next big audio social network?” That brought some new users to the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119163" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119163" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2119163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?w=279" alt="" width="279" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=768,827 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=632,680 632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cappuccino</p></div></p>
<p>But things really started to take off when Brittany Kay Collier <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brittanykaycollier/video/6927809320109247749">shared a video on TikTok</a> about Cappuccino a few weeks ago. She sent a direct message to Poupardin on Instagram, telling him that it was attracting a lot of views. The video ended up attracting around 3.8 million views and 850,000 likes.</p>
<p>Two days later, Poupardin sent her a job offer to join the team. He was secretly hoping she would say yes, and she was secretly dreaming about getting a job at a company like Cappuccino.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, Cappuccino attracted 225,000 new users. They created 130,000 groups and sent around one million audio stories.</p>
<p>When the team is reading public posts about Cappuccino <a href="https://twitter.com/cappuccino_fm/likes">on Twitter</a>, it feels like the app has found its core user base. The most loyal users seem to be young women in their twenties. They want to keep in touch with long-distance best friends.</p>
<p>They might be graduating from college and moving to a different part of the country. They might be stuck at home because of the current pandemic.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And it seems like new users have no issue hitting the record button and telling stories — everybody is familiar with voice messages on WhatsApp and iMessage after all.</p>
<p>“Something that is interesting with audio messages as a medium is that you tell different stories from what you would tell by taking a photo for Instagram, sending a Snap or creating a video on TikTok,” Poupardin said.</p>
<p>But what about the elephant in the room then? Clubhouse has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">topped 8 million downloads</a> already. Poupardin listed all the differences in social graph, audio format and user base. According to him, there’s enough room for multiple audio apps.</p>
<p>“With video, you have YouTube, Twitch and TikTok — those are all different formats. Audio is potentially going to follow the same trend,” Poupardin said. Social apps first took advantage of the camera in your smartphone, because the camera was <i>the</i> killer hardware feature. And audio seems like the natural next step.</p>
<p>He feels like he isn’t competing with other audio startups for now. He wants people to wake up and listen to Cappuccino instead of random music on Spotify. “It’s going to help people who feel lonely,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As building in public continues to gain popularity with early-stage startup founders, Murmur, coming out of stealth today, wants to leverage that natural transparency to a louder frequency.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/aarondignan">Aaron Dignan</a>, Murmur helps startups create work agreements based on the policies of other startups. &#8220;Work agreements&#8221; is an intentionally broad phrase, but encapsulates everything that a team decides about how work works, from paternal leave strategies to strategic priorities to how hiring works.</p>
<p>“It’s everything you’ve ever argued about [within your startup],” Dignan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It requires a healthy level of transparency within the ecosystem, meaning that a startup would have to be open with sharing its policies to the public in the first place. But, if Murmur works, it could help early-stage founders save time on the pain-staking process of figuring out how to build policies from scratch around hiring, OKR goals and vacation policies.</p>
<p>Instead, a new founder could just rely on other, seasoned founders, who have shared their policies for anyone to enjoy, and customize their own plan based around those practices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 10 benefits and policies any modern workplace should have&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/the-10-benefits-and-policies-any-modern-workplace-should-have/embed/#?secret=P44zqTRQni" data-secret="P44zqTRQni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Murmur <a href="https://www.notion.so/Murmur-raises-1-8M-to-scale-the-magic-of-working-agreements-c82e95c4c5584b84937f8a87d148db42">announced</a> that it has raised $1.8 million to scale its working agreements platform in a round led by Lerer Hippeau, with participation from SemperVirens, Human Ventures and Remote First Capital. Other investors include Steve Schlafman, Mariano Suarez-Battan (the CEO of Mural), Brian Sugar (the CEO of PopSugar) and Adam Pisoni (the co-founder of Yammer).</p>
<p>The company, still in private beta, will be launching to the public in early summer 2021.</p>
<p>Murmur is a web-based platform that allows startups to author, customize and plan policies that will shape a team’s culture. The platform helps teams go from proposal to decision with features like voting, edits and feedback throughout the process of creating an agreement. Instead of pushing a copy and paste of another startup’s policy, Murmur prompts founders to use the outsourced policies as seeds, and add customization as they go.</p>
<p>“Anybody can Google and find some company’s years-old processes; the trick is in making an inclusive ‘agreement’ with a real team all participating [and] the magic of keeping it and iterating it, and improving it,” Dignan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119098" style="width: 965px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119098" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2119098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg" alt="" width="955" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg 3250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=2048,1418 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Murmur</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, it is free for anyone to see listed company public agreements. But it costs money to use the Murmur platform to create and customize your own agreements off of this information. With this format, you can see that Dignan thinks that the conversion power of the company lies more in its platform than the content.</p>
<p>Dignan tells me that the team is still testing pricing strategies, but the current plan is a free trial followed by a monthly per-seat fee of $12 to $15 per month, per user. One day, companies could charge a premium for a “kit” of tools on their platform.</p>
<p>Murmur’s initial target for customers are startups that are growing fast and already work in public, such as Buffer, Basecamp, Lattice and Blinkist, but in the future, big enterprises could also see it useful.</p>
<p>Murmur is launching amid a general trend of companies that are pitching themselves as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/">best-practices-as-a-service.</a> Companies in this space aren’t simply enabling other startups to use a fancy SaaS tool, they are not-so-gently pushing them to use those tools in the best possible way for the best possible outcome. Murmur, if it hits scale, could help the next generation of startups figure out the best way to start companies.</p>
<p>Dignan says that the startup “aims to do for working practices what GitHub did for code.”</p>
<p>Remote work is obviously a key catalyst for the company, since the transition has reminded teams that transparency, standards and communication is vital to a functioning organization.</p>
<p>While the startup currently only has Murmur working agreements on the platform, it plans to onboard the agreements of dozens of companies in the coming months. Even though the platform is what makes Murmur special, it’s clear that curating agreements from top companies plays a vital role in Murmur’s success.</p>
<p>It is not paying companies to publicly list their agreements, and the branding benefit of transparency is well worth the confidentiality cost of sharing due to recruitment benefits.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Best practices as a service is a key investment theme to watch in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/embed/#?secret=JIH1rqBhkm" data-secret="JIH1rqBhkm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dignan says connections from his <a href="https://www.bravenewwork.com/">book about the future of work</a> will help land those agreements. Writing a book about a changing world of work before a global pandemic turned everything upside down is ironic, but Dignan, it appears, doesn’t view Murmur as a pandemic pivot.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been thinking about this tool for seven years,” he said. But he didn’t think an opinionated tool would have a large enough total addressable market, and that anything that would scale would just reinforce the status quo. He didn’t build Murmur for a while because he thought that the ecosystem didn’t need “yet another customer engagement tool.”</p>
<p>So, he waited. And the pandemic, another peak of the Black Lives Matter movement and the election happened within one year.</p>
<p>“It was all signaling that the complexity is too much,” he said. “We need new ways of working, making decisions and organizing as people. And that felt like this huge moment where we plant the seed and in a few years&#8217; time, the market will be huge.”</p>

		Ethan Eismann is the Vice President of Design at Slack, leading design and engineering teams to deliver exceptional product experiences.

	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">At Slack, every one of our processes and features has been designed with the primary goal of making Slack a workplace tool that feels human. We see ourselves as our users’ hosts, and we want them to feel comfortable and happy every time they’re in Slack. Our product isn’t just built for work — it’s built for people doing work, and everything we create is meant to forward our mission of making work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive.</p>
<p>Our job is to understand what people want, and then translate that value through thoughtfully designed, well-functioning products and features.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of an unprecedented shift to remote work, we’ve seen an influx of people turning to Slack to make the <a href="https://slack.com/solutions/remote-work#slack-channels">transition to a digital-first workplace</a>. Building thoughtful, intuitive products that add value, delight and human-centric experiences into peoples’ working lives has never been more important.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Product principles are essential guidelines that help teams evaluate work across functions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To ensure we’re meeting our customers where they’re at, we created a set of guiding &#8220;product principles&#8221; that inform everything we build, and which serve as the foundation for our entire product decision-making process.</p>
<p>There’s business value in improving an organization&#8217;s processes, and we’ve been able to provide better experiences for our customers by enacting ever-evolving product principles and using them to evaluate our products and features. Any company can benefit from having product principles — it’s all about how you develop and deploy them across your organization.</p>
<h2>First, what are product principles?</h2>
<p>Product principles are essential guidelines that help teams evaluate work across functions, as well as up and down the decision-making chain, by ensuring all work ladders up to the organization’s ultimate goals. Better alignment, in turn, leads to better and faster product decisions.</p>
<p>Product principles should always evolve to keep up with the changing ways you work and what your customers need. At Slack, we currently have five principles that guide us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t make me think.</li>
<li>Be a great host.</li>
<li>Prototype the path.</li>
<li>Don’t reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>Make bigger, bolder bets.</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these principles into all we build across teams — design, legal, marketing and more — they provide a shared framework for decision-making that keeps us aligned and therefore able to make better decisions, faster.</p>
<p>The idea of having principles themselves isn’t a new concept, but the creation process behind building and promoting these principles is often overlooked or underdeveloped.</p>
<h2>Start with your product philosophy</h2>
<p>Before building the principles themselves, it’s important to first establish your product philosophy, which will inform how your organization will ultimately view and abide by its principles.</p>
<p>At Slack, we embrace an approach we call &#8220;getting to the next hill.&#8221; While there is a long-term product strategy, we don’t spend a lot of time debating exactly where we’ll be in one or two years from now. Instead, we focus on more immediate, incremental moves to improve our customers’ working lives.</p>
<p>We’ve found that because Slack is used in so many different ways by so many different companies, it&#8217;s better to learn from how our customers use our features than from endlessly debating aspirational future ideas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a move designed to directly challenge Amazon, Walmart today announced it&#8217;s dropping the $35 minimum order requirement for its two-hour &#8220;Express&#8221; delivery service, a competitor to Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://primenow.amazon.com/">Prime Now</a>.&#8221;  With Walmart Express Delivery, customers can order from Walmart&#8217;s food, consumables or general merchandise assortment, then pay a flat $10 fee to have the items arrive in two hours or less.</p>
<p>The service is useful for more urgent delivery needs &#8212; like diapers or a missing ingredient for a recipe, SVP of Customer Product, Tom Ward, noted in an <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/03/01/walmart-drops-35-minimum-for-express-delivery">announcement</a>. They&#8217;re not meant to sub in for larger shopping trips, however &#8212; Express orders are capped at 65 items.</p>
<p>Today, Express Delivery is available in nearly 3,000 Walmart stores reaching 70% of the U.S. population, Walmart says. It builds on top of stores&#8217; existing inventory of pickup and delivery time slots as a third option, instead of giving slots away to those with the ability to pay higher fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like Walmart&#8217;s grocery and pickup orders, Express orders are shopped and packaged for delivery by Walmart&#8217;s team of 170,000 personal shoppers and items are priced the same as they are in-store. This offers Walmart a potential competitive advantage against grocery delivery services like Instacart or Shipt, for example, where products can be priced higher and hurried or inexperienced shoppers aren&#8217;t always able to find items or search the back, having to mark them as &#8220;out of stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>In theory, Walmart employees will have a better understanding of their own store&#8217;s inventory and layout, making these kind of issues less common. It will also have direct access to the order data, which will help it better understand what sells, what replacements customers will accept for out-of-stocks, when to staff for busy times and more.</p>
<p>In addition to grocery delivery, Express Delivery competes with Amazon&#8217;s Prime Now, a service that similarly offers a combination of grocery and other daily essentials and merchandise. Currently, Prime Now&#8217;s 2-hour service has a minimum order requirement of $35 without any additional fees in many cases for free delivery&#8211; though the Prime Now app explains that some of its local store partners will charge fees even when that minimum is met, and others may have higher order minimums, which makes the service confusing to consumers.</p>

<p>Starting today, no more $35 min. order requirement for Express delivery. Another way we’re making it easier than ever to get what you need when you need it. <a href="https://t.co/lCgQItLeRn">https://t.co/lCgQItLeRn</a> <a href="https://t.co/HONlL0SzxG">pic.twitter.com/HONlL0SzxG</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Walmart Inc. (@WalmartInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/WalmartInc/status/1366405938366791683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Walmart&#8217;s news comes at a time when Amazon appears to be trying to push consumers away from the Prime Now standalone app, too.</p>
<p>When you open the Prime Now app, a large pop-up message informs you that you can now shop Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh from inside the Amazon app. A button labeled <em>&#8220;Make the switch&#8221;</em> will then redirect you. Meanwhile, on Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=15247183011&amp;ref=acq_slash_prime&amp;ms3_c=278baea1880c041f3de99b1cf7ea0ca7">website touting Prime&#8217;s delivery perks</a>, the &#8220;Prime Now&#8221; brand name isn&#8217;t mentioned at all. Instead, Amazon touts free same-day (5-hour) delivery of best sellers and everyday essentials on orders with a $35 minimum purchase, or free 2-hour grocery delivery from Whole Foods and Fresh.</p>
<p>When asked why Amazon is pushing Prime Now shoppers to its main app, Amazon downplayed this as simply an ongoing effort to &#8220;educate&#8221; consumers about the option.</p>
<p>Walmart, on the other hand, last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/walmart-grocery-is-merging-with-walmarts-main-app-and-website/">merged</a> its separate delivery apps into one.</p>
<p>After items are picked, Walmart works with a network of partners, including DoorDash, Postmates, Roadie and Pickup Point, as well as its in-house delivery services, to get orders to customers&#8217; doorsteps. This last-mile portion has become a key area of investment for Walmart and competitors in recent months &#8212; Walmart, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/walmart-is-buying-joyrun-assets-to-add-peer-to-peer-product-delivery/">acquired</a> assets from peer-to-peer delivery startup JoyRun in November. And before that, a former Walmart delivery partner,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/target-is-looking-to-buy-delivs-same-day-delivery-tech/"> Deliv, sold to Target.</a></p>
<p>This is not the first time Walmart has dropped order minimums in an attempt to better compete with Amazon and others.</p>
<p>In December, Walmart announced its Prime alternative known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/walmart-takes-on-prime-by-dropping-35-minimum-on-walmart-com-purchases/">Walmart+ would remove the $35 minimum on non-same day Walmart.com orders</a>. But it had stopped short of extending that perk to same-day grocery until now.</p>
<p>To some extent, Walmart&#8217;s ability to drop minimums has to do with the logistics of its delivery operations. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/walmart-to-ramp-up-automated-fulfillment-at-its-stores-as-online-grocery-grows.html">Walmart has been turning more of its stores into fulfillment centers</a> by converting some into small, automated warehouses in partnership with technology providers and robotics companies, including Alert Innovation, Dematic and Fabric.</p>
<p>And because its stores are physically located closer to customers than Amazon warehouses, it has the ability to deliver a broad merchandise selection, faster, while also turning large parking lots into picking stations &#8212; another thing that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2021/02/28/why-amazon-should-be-worried-about-walmarts-micro-fulfillment-centers/?sh=6795ad587033">could worry Amazon</a>, which is now <a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2021/02/amazon-to-open-fulfillment-center-at-site-of-former-sears-store-mayor-says.html">buying up closed mall stores</a> for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-and-giant-mall-operator-look-at-turning-sears-j-c-penney-stores-into-fulfillment-centers-11596992863">its own fulfillment operations. </a></p>
<p>Walmart today still carries a $35 minimum on other pickup and delivery orders and same-day orders from Walmart+ subscribers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a recent episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, Bain Capital Ventures&#8217; Matt Harris said that if you had asked him a year ago what would happen to venture capital during a pandemic lockdown, he would have replied &#8220;it would have fallen off a cliff.&#8221; Before the world changed so fundamentally, VCs and founders alike believed they needed to meet in person to build trust before signing paperwork that would financially and emotionally bond them together for years and years.</p>
<p>Today, the landscape is very different. More institutional capital is flowing into startups at much faster rates and a good deal of credit must go to the virtual pitch meeting. Founders can now take 30+ meetings in a single day, but are they making the most of those meetings?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TechCrunch Early Stage in April</a>, Melissa Bradley will talk us through how to nail your virtual pitch meeting and take questions from the audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bradley is the co-founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ureeka/">Ureeka</a>, a venture-backed mentorship platform for SMBs that pairs founders with experts and mentors. Bradley is also founder and managing partner of 1863 Ventures, a business development program that accelerates underrepresented entrepreneurs (a group Bradley calls the New Majority) into their hyper-growth phase.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also a professor at Georgetown University&#8217;s business school, teaching impact investing, social entrepreneurship, P2P economies and innovation.</p>
<p>In short, Bradley deeply understands what it&#8217;s like to sit on both sides of the table, as a VC and a founder, and even more deeply understands what it takes to have a successful virtual meeting from her experience building Ureeka (which is entirely virtual).</p>
<p>Bradley joins an all-star cast of speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>, an event that is packed with breakout sessions focused on all the core competencies that a startup needs to be successful. Here&#8217;s a preview of some of the sessions going down at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buzzy mega-rounds and high-profile IPOs often dominate headlines. But many of those companies were once early-stage and scrapping to raise a seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="http://www.chicagoventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a VC firm that often leads seed-stage rounds, announced the close of its third fund &#8212; a $63 million vehicle that it’s already put to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures (which is based in Chicago, where else?) has a very specific set of criteria when it looks to back companies. For one, as mentioned, it not only wants to back seed-stage startups, it usually leads those rounds. The firm is targeting 25 investments out of its new fund with an average check size of $1.5 million to $2 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidence, it has so far backed 11 companies out of this third fund, leading 10 of those rounds. The startups include </span>CognitOps<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>CoPilot<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Forager<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Interior Define<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>NOCD<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>OneRail<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>PreFix and<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Ureeka<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also is focused on investing in companies located out of the traditional hotspots of Silicon Valley and New York. Six of its most recent investments were in Chicago-based startups, two in Austin (where it recently opened an office), one in Orlando, Florida, and one in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures prides itself in identifying, and backing, “overlooked” companies. It was founded in 2012 under the premise that enduring companies could be built “anywhere” and not restricted to “a few select area codes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Only a handful of funds consistently lead seed rounds. Tag-along, momentum-based investing is the norm,” the firm said in a statement. “The industry’s attention still converges on industries and geographies with rich histories of innovation. We fill these gaps. We lead seed rounds before it’s obvious, and serve as active, operationally-involved partners during a company’s earliest days. We invest off the coasts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the firm’s portfolio companies have raised more than $1.5 billion in follow-on capital. Seventeen of those companies are now valued over $100 million, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">Cameo</a>, business software marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/g2-crowd-a-business-software-marketplace-raises-another-55m-at-just-under-a-500m-valuation/">G2</a> and logistics software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/early-stage-saas-vc-slip-snaps-recovery-as-public-software-stocks-soar/">project44</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures closed its second fund in 2016 &#8212; which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included a $60 million main </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001644873-16-000002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a $6 million sidecar fund. The firm opted not to go the sidecar route this time around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the new fund, Chicago Ventures also announced that it has promoted </span><a href="http://chicagoventures.com/team/peter-christman/">Peter Christman</a> and <a href="http://chicagoventures.com/team/lindsay-knight/">Lindsay Knight</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner. Christman leads investments in companies rebuilding old-line enterprise workflows and consumer products expanding access to care and financial well-being. Knight leads the firm’s post-investment operations, including talent, business development and functional best practice sharing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures has also named Jackie DiMonte to the team as a new partner. DiMonte comes from Hyde Park Venture Partners, where she led early-stage, enterprise investments. An engineer by training, DiMonte is based in Austin, where Chicago Ventures has made 10 investments since 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the dollars invested into seed-stage startups in the United States had an up-and-down year that TechCrunch explored </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, the pattern of </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/more-supergiant-seed-rounds-are-sprouting-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising seed-check sizes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seen in prior years continued, despite the tumultuous business climate.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech companies are no stranger to controversy and workplace issues. Over the years, it&#8217;s become clear that no company is immune from diversity issues. But it&#8217;s the job of those in the diversity, equity and inclusion departments to create and foster environments that are welcoming to all.</p>
<p>Last year, in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, many companies spoke out in support of Black lives and the Black Lives Matter movement. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=justice2021&amp;utm_content=arlanhamilton&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=uberfbnetflixpost&amp;display=TRUE">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a>, we&#8217;ll examine what some companies said at the time and how those statements align with where they are today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also dive in to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">myth of the pipeline problem,</a> as well as the idea of imposter syndrome and <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome">how companies can help</a> to shift the onus from the person experiencing feelings of doubt to the systems and cultures that perpetuate biases, sexism and racism. We&#8217;ll also, of course, talk about each company&#8217;s DEI efforts over the years, where progress has been made and where there&#8217;s still room for improvement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To have this conversation, we&#8217;ve called on three DEI leaders from Uber, Facebook and Netflix to share their experiences, struggles and wins leading the charge for genuine inclusivity in tech.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit about the three of them:</p>
<p><strong>Bo Young Lee, Uber Chief Diversity Officer</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1712901" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1712901" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1712901" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="633" height="422" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1712901" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Lee became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/uber-has-hired-a-chief-diversity-officer/">Uber&#8217;s first-ever chief diversity officer in early 2018</a>. Lee joined about one year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/11/ubers-board-votes-unanimously-to-adopt-all-recommendations-of-holder-report/?_ga=2.229786132.962186928.1614100640-1057749772.1591641289">former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm recommended</a> Uber have a chief diversity officer. Holder and his firm were tapped in the aftermath of former Uber engineer Susan Fowler&#8217;s allegations of sexual harassment at the company.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I&#8217;ll chat with Lee about where Uber is today, as well as how it is doing in its mission to double Black representation in leadership by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Altine, VP of Workforce Diversity and Inclusion </strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116848" style="width: 544px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116848" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2116848 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="534" height="534" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sandra-Altine.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116848" class="wp-caption-text">(Photo courtesy of Facebook)</p></div></p>
<p>Altine joined Facebook last April after previously serving as the managing director of global diversity and inclusion for investor service Moody&#8217;s.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/tech-at-work-dei-at-facebook-prop-22-and-gig-worker-earnings/">Last year</a>, Facebook committed to having 50% of its workforce be members of underrepresented groups, which includes BIPOC, women, disabled people and veterans. Over the next five years, Facebook also said it’s committed to increasing its Black employee base by 30%; currently 3.8% of its U.S.-based employees are Black.</p>
<p><strong>Wade Davis, VP of Inclusion Strategy for Product</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110931" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110931" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2110931 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="513" height="513" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wade-Davis.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110931" class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>Davis, who joined Netflix in this role in September 2019, works directly with product leaders at the company to implement inclusive policies and practices into the workplaces. He also works alongside other VPs at Netflix to improve upon diversity and inclusion within the workforce. Prior to joining Netflix, Davis consulted for Google, P&amp;G and others.</p>
<p>Netflix released its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/netflix-releases-latest-diversity-numbers/">first-ever diversity report just this year</a>. Netflix had previously disclosed its data but had yet to make a full report out of it. Netflix did not lay out any concrete goals, but said it’s generally wanting to increase representation by hiring more inclusively and building out its recruiting networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace</a>, the company&#8217;s productivity platform you&#8217;ll forever refer to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/g-suite-is-now-google-workspace/">as G Suite</a> (or even &#8220;Google Docs&#8221;), is launching a large update today that touches everything from your calendar to Google Meet and how you can use Workspace with Google Assistant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119041" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Assistant-in-Workspace.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119041" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2119041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Assistant-in-Workspace.gif" alt="" width="311" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, the highlight here is probably that you can now use Assistant in combination with Google Workspace, allowing you to check your work calendar or send a message to your colleagues. Until now, this feature was available in beta and even after it goes live, your company&#8217;s admins will have to turn on the &#8220;Search and Assistant&#8221; service. And this is a bit of a slow rollout, too, with this capability now being generally available on mobile but still in beta for smart speakers and displays like Google&#8217;s own Nest Hub. Still, it&#8217;s been a long time coming, given that Google promised these features a very long time ago now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other new feature that will directly influence your day-to-day work is support for recurring out-of-office entries and segmentable working hours, as well as a new event type, Focus Time, to help you minimize distractions. Focus Time is a bit cleverer than the three-hour blocks of time you may block off on your calendar anyway in that it limits notifications during those event windows. Google is also launching a new analytics feature that tells you how much time you spend (waste) in meetings. This isn&#8217;t quite as fully featured (and potentially creepy) as Microsoft&#8217;s Productivity Score, since it only displays how much time you spend in meetings, but it&#8217;s a nice overview of how you spend your days (though you know that already). None of this data is shared with your managers.</p>
<p>For when you go back to an office, Google is also adding location indicators to Workspace so you can share when you will be working from there and when you&#8217;ll be working from home.</p>
<p>And talking about meetings, since most of these remain online for the time being, Google is adding a few new features that now allow those of you who use their Google Nest Hub Max to host meetings at home and to set up a laptop as their own second-screen experience. What&#8217;s far more important, though, is that when you join a meeting on mobile, Google will now implement a picture-in-picture mode so you can be in that Meet meeting on your phone and still browse the web, Gmail and get important work done during that brainstorming session.</p>
<p>Mobile support for <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10058482?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">background replace</a> is also coming, as well as the addition of Q&amp;As and polls on mobile. Currently, you can only blur your background on mobile.</p>

<p>For frontline workers, Google is adding something it calls Google Workspace Frontline, with new features for this group of users, and it is also making it easier for users to build custom AppSheet apps from Google Sheets and Drive, &#8220;so that frontline workers can digitize and streamline their work, whether it&#8217;s collecting data in the field, reporting safety risks, or managing customer requests.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zetaglobal.com">Zeta Global</a>, the marketing technology company founded by David A. Steinberg and former Apple CEO John Sculley, is announcing an additional $222.5 million in new debt financing.</p>
<p>The company has gone down the debt route before — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/marketing-tech-company-zeta-global-raises-140m-at-a-1-3-billion-valuation/">a Series F raised in 2017</a> combined $115 million funding with $25 million in debt. BofA Securities served as lead arranger and bookrunner for the new financing, with participation from Barclays, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding.</p>
<p>“For this round, we were able to both refinance our debt and add in a large amount of capacity for current operations and future initiatives,” Steinberg (Zeta’s CEO) told me via email. “We were able to work with our syndicate to capture a low interest rate and take advantage of the strong credit markets.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company emphasizes its data-driven approach to marketing, combining companies’ first-party data with artificial intelligence and what it says are more than 2.4 billion customer identifiers. Steinberg said this approach has only become more crucial, with 2020 delivering “a five-year acceleration” as brands face the challenge of “digitally transforming their business structure to be data-centric.”</p>
<p>“Zeta’s capabilities are helping marketers engage customers across the entire digital ecosystem more intelligently and efficiently, with individualized messages, offers, and content by way of our identity-based data and predictive AI,” Steinberg continued. “Our challenge is to continue to keep up with our customers’ needs and maintain our competitive advantage around data and AI.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding announcement notes that previous loans have been used to finance acquisitions and integrations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">commenting platform Disqus</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/zeta-global-acquires-boomtrain-to-bring-more-machine-learning-to-its-marketing-automation-platform/">machine learning-powered marketing platform Boomtrain</a>. Asked whether this new debt will also be used for acquisitions, Steinberg said the company continues to “organically innovate,” with a focus on its customer data platform and connected TV capabilities.</p>
