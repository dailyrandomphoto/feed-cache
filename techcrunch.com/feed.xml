										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When the third minute of Apple’s first product event of 2021 ticked over and they had already made 3 announcements we knew it was going to be a packed one. In a tight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today/">single hour this week</a>, Apple launched a ton of new product including AirTags, new Apple Card family sharing, a new Apple TV, a new set of colorful iMacs, and a purple iPhone 12 shade.</p>
<p class="p1">Of the new devices announced, though, Apple’s new 12.9” iPad Pro is the most interesting from a market positioning perspective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This week I got a chance to speak to Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak and Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus about this latest version of the iPad Pro and its place in the working universe of computing professionals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">In many ways, this new iPad Pro is the equivalent of a sprinter being lengths ahead going into the last lap and just turning on the afterburners to put a undebatable distance between themselves and the rest of the pack. Last year’s model is still one of the best computers you can buy, with a densely packed offering of powerful computing tools, battery performance and portability. And this year gets upgrades in the M1 processor, RAM, storage speed, Thunderbolt connection, 5G radio, new ultra wide front camera and its Liquid Retina XDR display.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This is a major bump even while the 2020 iPad Pro still dominates the field. And at the center of that is the display.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple has essentially ported its enormously good $5,000 Pro Display XDR down to a 12.9” touch version, with some slight improvements. But the specs are flat out incredible. 1,000 nit brightness peaking at 1,600 nits in HDR with 2,500 full array local dimming zones — compared to the Pro Display XDR’s 576 in a much larger scale.</p>
<p class="p1">Given that this year’s first product launch from Apple was virtual, the media again got no immediate hands on with the new devices introduced, including iPad Pro. This means that I have not yet seen the XDR display in action. Unfortunately, these specs are so good that estimating them without having seen the screen yet is akin to trying to visualize “a trillion” in your head. It’s intellectually possible but not really practical.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">It’s brighter than any Mac or iOS device on the market and could be a big game shifting device for professionals working in HDR video and photography. But even still, this is a major investment to ship a micro-LED display in the millions or tens of millions of units with more density and brightness than any other display on the market.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I ask both of them why there’s a need to do this doubling down on what is already one of the best portable displays ever made — if not one of the best displays period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2143477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">“We&#8217;ve always tried to have the best display,” says Ternus. “We&#8217;re going from the best display on any device like this and making it even better, because that&#8217;s what we do and that&#8217;s why we, we love coming to work every day is to take that next big step.</p>
<p class="p1">“[With the] Pro Display XDR if you remember one thing we talked about was being able to have this display and this capability in more places in the work stream. Because traditionally there was just this one super expensive reference monitor at the end of the line. This is like the next extreme of that now you don&#8217;t even have to be in the studio anymore you can take it with you on the go and you can have that capability so from a, from a creative pro standpoint we think this is going to be huge.”</p>
<p class="p1">In my use of the Pro Display and my conversations with professionals about it one of the the common themes that I’ve heard is the reduction in overall workload due to the multiple points in the flow where color and image can be managed accurately to spec now. The general system in place puts a reference monitor very late in the production stage which can often lead to expensive and time consuming re-rendering or new color passes. Adding the Liquid Retina XDR display into the mix at an extremely low price point means that a lot more plot points on the production line suddenly get a lot closer to the right curve.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One of the stronger answers on the ‘why the aggressive spec bump’ question comes later in our discussion but is worth mentioning in this context. The point, Joswiak says, is to offer headroom. Headroom for users and headroom for developers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“One of the things that iPad Pro has done as John [Ternus] has talked about is push the envelope. And by pushing the envelope that has created this space for developers to come in and fill it. When we created the very first iPad Pro, there was no Photoshop,” Joswiak notes. “There was no creative apps that could immediately use it. But now there&#8217;s so many you can&#8217;t count. Because we created that capability, we created that performance — and, by the way sold a fairly massive number of them — which is a pretty good combination for developers to then come in and say, I can take advantage of that. There&#8217;s enough customers here and there&#8217;s enough performance. I know how to use that. And that&#8217;s the same thing we do with each generation. We create more headroom to performance that developers will figure out how to use.</p>
<p class="p1">“The customer is in a great spot because they know they&#8217;re buying something that&#8217;s got some headroom and developers love it.”</p>

<p class="p1">The iPad Pro is now powered by the M1 chip — a move away from the A-series naming. And that processor part is identical (given similar memory configurations) to the one found in the iMac announced this week and MacBooks launched earlier this year.</p>
<p class="p1">“It&#8217;s the same part, it&#8217;s M1,” says Ternus. “iPad Pro has always had the best Apple silicon we make.”</p>
<p class="p1">“How crazy is it that you can take a chip that&#8217;s in a desktop, and drop it into an iPad,” says Joswiak. “I mean it&#8217;s just incredible to have that kind of performance at such amazing power efficiency. And then have all the technologies that come with it. To have the neural engine and ISP and Thunderbolt and all these amazing things that come with it, it&#8217;s just miles beyond what anybody else is doing.”</p>
<p class="p1">As the M1 was rolling out and I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">began running my testing</a>, the power per watt aspects really became the story. That really is the big differentiator for M1. For decades, laptop users have been accustomed to saving any heavy or intense workloads for the times when their machines were plugged in due to power consumption. M1 is in the process of resetting those expectations for desktop class processors. In fact, Apple is offering not only the most powerful CPUs but also the most power-efficient CPUs on the market. And it’s doing it in a $700 Mac Mini, a $1,700 iMac and a $1,100 iPad Pro <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/322120-apples-m1-positioning-mocks-every-x86-cpu-amd-and-intel-have-ever-launched">at the same time</a>. It’s a pretty ridiculous display of stunting, but it’s also the product of more than a decade of work building its own architecture and silicon.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your battery life is defined by the capacity of your battery and the efficiency of your system right? So we&#8217;re always pushing really really hard on the system efficiency and obviously with M1, the team&#8217;s done a tremendous job with that. But the display as well. We designed a new mini LED for this display, focusing on efficiency and on package size, obviously, to really to be able to make sure that it could fit into the iPad experience with the iPad experience’s good battery life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We weren&#8217;t going to compromise on that,” says Ternus.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the marquee features of the new iPad Pro is its 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage. An auto-centering and cropping video feature designed to make FaceTime calling more human-centric, literally. It finds humans in the frame and centers their faces, keeping them in the frame even if they move, standing and stretching or leaning to the side. It also includes additional people in the frame automatically if they enter the range of the new ultra-wide 12MP front-facing camera. And yes, it also works with other apps like Zoom and Webex and there will be an API for it.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve gotten to see it in action a bit more and I can say with surety that this will become an industry standard implementation of this kind of subject focusing. The crop mechanic is handled with taste, taking on the characteristics of a smooth zoom pulled by a steady hand rather than an abrupt cut to a smaller, closer framing. It really is like watching a TV show directed by an invisible machine learning engine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“This is one of the examples of some of our favorite stuff to do because of the way it marries the hardware and software right,” Ternus says. “So, sure it&#8217;s the camera but it&#8217;s also the SOC and and the algorithms associated with detecting the person and panning and zooming. There&#8217;s the kind of the taste aspect, right? Which is; how do we make something that feels good it doesn&#8217;t move too fast and doesn&#8217;t move too slow. That’s a lot of talented, creative people coming together and trying to find the thing that makes it Apple like.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2143483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It also goes a long way to making the awkward horizontal camera placement when using the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. This has been a big drawback for using the iPad Pro as a portable video conferencing tool, something we’ve all been doing a lot of lately. I ask Ternus whether Center Stage was designed to mitigate this placement.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, you can use iPad in any orientation right? So you&#8217;re going to have different experiences based on how you&#8217;re using it. But what&#8217;s amazing about this is that we can keep correcting the frame. What&#8217;s been really cool is that we&#8217;ve all been sitting around in these meetings all day long on video conferencing and it&#8217;s just nice to get up. This experience of just being able to stand up and kind of stretch and move around the room without walking away from the camera has been just absolutely game changing, it&#8217;s really cool.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s worth noting that several other video sharing devices like the Portal and some video software like Teams already offer cropping-type follow features, but the user experience is everything when you’re shipping software like this to millions of people at once. It will be interesting to see how Center Stage stacks up agains the competition when we see it live.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">With the ongoing chatter about how the iPad Pro and Mac are converging from a feature-set perspective, I ask how they would you characterize an iPad Pro vs. a MacBook buyer? Joswiak is quick to respond to this one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“This is my favorite question because you know, you have one camp of people who believe that the iPad and the Mac are at war with one another right it&#8217;s one or the other to the death. And then you have others who are like, no, they&#8217;re bringing them together — they&#8217;re forcing them into one single platform and there&#8217;s a grand conspiracy here,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">“They are at opposite ends of a thought spectrum and the reality is that neither is correct. We pride ourselves in the fact that we work really, really, really hard to have the best products in the respective categories. The Mac is the best personal computer, it just is. Customer satisfaction would indicate that is the case, by a longshot.”</p>
<p class="p1">Joswiak points out that the whole PC category is growing, which he says is nice to see. But he points out that Macs are way outgrowing PCs and doing ‘quite well’. He also notes that the iPad business is still outgrowing the tablets category (while still refusing to label the iPad a tablet).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“And it’s also the case that it&#8217;s not an ‘either or’. The majority of our Mac customers have an iPad. That&#8217;s an awesome thing. They don&#8217;t have it because they&#8217;re replacing their Mac, it&#8217;s because they use the right tool at the right time.</p>
<p class="p1">What&#8217;s very cool about what [Ternus] and his team have done with iPad Pro is that they&#8217;ve created something where that&#8217;s still the case for creative professionals too — the hardest to please audience. They’ve given them a tool where they can be equally at home using the Mac for their professional making money with it kind of work, and now they can pick up an iPad Pro — and they have been for multiple generations now and do things that, again, are part of how they make money, part of their creative workflow flow,” says Joswiak. “And that test is exciting. it isn&#8217;t one or the other, both of them have a role for these people.”</p>
<p class="p1">Since converting over to an iPad Pro <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro/">as my only portable computer</a>, I’ve been thinking a lot about the multimodal aspects of professional work. And, clearly, Apple has as well given its launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/">of a Pro Workflows team</a> back in 2018. Workflows have changed massively over the last decade, and obviously the iPhone and an iPad, with their popularization of the direct manipulation paradigm, have had everything to do with that. In the current world we’re in, we’re way past ‘what is this new thing’, and we&#8217;re even way past ‘oh cool, this feels normal’ and we’re well into ‘this feels vital, it feels necessary.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Contrary to some people&#8217;s beliefs, we&#8217;re never thinking about what we should not do on an iPad because we don&#8217;t want to encroach on Mac or vice versa,” says Ternus. “Our focus is, what is the best way? What is the best iPad we can make what are the best Macs we can make. Some people are going to work across both of them, some people will kind of lean towards one because it better suits their needs and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s all good.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">If you follow along, you’ll know that Apple studiously refuses to enter into the iPad vs. Mac debate — and in fact likes to place the iPad in a special place in the market that exists unchallenged. Joswiak often says that he doesn’t even like to say the word tablet.</p>
<p class="p1">“There’s iPads and tablets, and tablets aren’t very good. iPads are great,” Joswiak says. “We&#8217;re always pushing the boundaries with iPad Pro, and that&#8217;s what you want leaders to do. Leaders are the ones that push the boundaries leaders are the ones that take this further than has ever been taken before and the XDR display is a great example of that. Who else would you expect to do that other than us. And then once you see it, and once you use it, you won&#8217;t wonder, you’ll be glad we did.”</p>

<p>The current rave about newsletters and so-called or social audio is just the latest version of the story of podcasting. Take the idea that podcasting is experiencing a new wave of popularity and scaffolding. Are you sure? Apple is bent on turning the space into a subscription model, and we&#8217;re all going to twist again like we did last summer. Somehow I doubt it. The basic attraction for me is not paying for podcasts. Subscription startups may be an important step forward, but the heart of the matter is talent formation.</p>
<p>Back when they first started, the real charge was the ability to own the whole stack: writer, producer, editor, star, and marketer. Making money for this may have been a future goal, but right now the real power was in figuring out what might work without the intrusion of what people other than yourself thought about the product. Only if something made itself apparent was it necessary to address the needs and wants of the audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Luckily, that ruled out about ninety percent of the resulting wave of stuff.  There were Ted talks, or what became Ted talks, well thought out verbal slide decks in an 8 minute payload that grabbed, shook, and exacted payment in credibility and validation of the expertise of the artist. Always lurking was the question of what day job the author was moonlighting from. Many self help business books emerged from this.</p>
<p>Then there were the professionals, the public radio folks who knew how to do this in their sleep but were looking for a role not dependent on grant writing or public liberal funding. Reporters who knew how to squeeze out a story, producers who mined their rolodex to fashion a conversation, screenwriters looking for momentum to bank a shot off studio executives to get a pilot or series starter commitment. Eventually this added up to enough successful podcasts to attract sponsorship support from audiobooks and publishing services. Scripted shows became farm clubs for independent talent aiming for the Big Show. This endured for 20 years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Beatles transformed the music business from a vaudeville-like zero-sum game to a Renaissance of control over writing, performing, promoting, and touring. Aspiration was the fuel of the business model, obviating the need for incremental success in favor of explosive momentum and dominance of the media. Hair, boots, sex, striking fear in the hearts of parents and then politicians everywhere. Sgt. Pepper and Kubrick created a version of the future that made everything else pale by comparison. That it all crashed and burned was just one of the risks of what became the startup culture in Silicon Valley and Route 128.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world of NFTs and Decacorns, free still has a reason for believing. The old guard of the blogging world have reinvented themselves as Lone Rangers in the creator economy. Slap a badge on that podcast and hitch a ride on the promise of endless subscription growth, minus 10% per newsletter sub or 30% for the first year in the AppStore. It&#8217;s not the long tail, so what is it? To be sure, the world will endorse the talented solitary surfers, armed with MG Sieglerian talent for the suite spot of the tech zeitgeist, the revolutionary zeal of the breakthrough synthesists of the political, lyrical, and comic survivalists.</p>
<p>How will the media compensate for the loss of their gatekeeper status? For starters, the more the stampede accelerates, the bundlers will storm the economics with constructs that look very much like the magazines and social destinations they replace. As crypto enters the bloodstream, streaming will generate a new measure of success and equity for the artists. Free will still be the driver of the form, but transitional models like tip jars will migrate to social capital to be banked by investors betting on the future success of the talent.</p>
<p>Even this early, some things have to change. The no recording conceit is an artifact of the launch stage, soon to be jettisoned when the effort reaches escape velocity. Clubhouse gains much of its critical mass from who rather than how many are swarming; interesting combinations of speakers and listeners weigh more tellingly than the raw numbers of name guests and moderators. Live is important, but committing to the voice of the artist is a calculation of time, window of opportunity, relevance to the emotion and tenor of the times. And the competitive landscape for that attention spans so many of the medias being replaced or transformed by the application of free.</p>
<p>None of this means the newsletter and conversation startups won&#8217;t succeed. Subscribing gives us something to consume to justify the tithe, and most people who drop streaming subs replace them with another service. As these services proliferate, competition drives innovation and expansion into events and paradigm shifts like Netflix and SPACs. Witness TechCrunch, built on just the dynamics Substack and Revue-Twitter now make accessible to a new wave of Arringtons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em></p>
<p>A week ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/pico-2-0/">TechCrunch covered</a> Pico’s $6.5 million funding round and described it as “a New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data.” The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/as-media-revenue-struggles-subscription-startups-see-growth/">has also covered Pico before</a>, most recently during a mid-2020 dive into the world of indie pubs and subscription media.</p>
<p>While our own Anthony Ha did an inimitable job covering the <a href="https://trypico.com/">Pico</a> round, I got on a Zoom call with the company, as well, as their new capital came with <a href="https://trypico.com/blog/company/2-0">a relaunch of sorts</a> that I wanted to better understand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="44A5cEGiR1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">European VC soars in Q1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;European VC soars in Q1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/embed/#?secret=44A5cEGiR1" data-secret="44A5cEGiR1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Pico team walked me through what’s changed at their business by describing the historical progress of creative digital tooling. They said earlier eras in the space focused on content hosting and distribution. In the startup’s view, a new generation of creative-focused tooling will bring the market to an era in which content management systems, or CMSs &#8212; say, Substack or WordPress &#8212; will not own the center of tooling. Instead, monetization will.</p>
<p>That’s Pico’s bet, and so it’s building what it considers to be an operating system for the creator market. My gut read is that a creative digital world that centers around monetization sounds like one that is more lucrative than what preceding eras brought us.</p>
<p>Pico’s view is that regardless of where someone first builds their audience, they eventually go multi-SKU &#8212; or multi-platform, perhaps &#8212; so keeping a single, centralized register of customer data may prove critical.</p>
<p>The startup’s revamped service is a bit of a monetization tool, as before, along with a creator-focused CRM that sits atop your CMS or other digital output on any particular platform. So far customer growth at the company looks good, growing by about 5x in the last year. Let’s see how far Pico can ride its vision, and if it can help build out a <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class">middle class in the creator economy</a>.</p>
<h2>The grocery revolution will be IRL</h2>
<p>Somewhat lost in our circles amid the hype regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">Instacart’s epic COVID period</a> is the fact that most folks still go to stores to buy their fruit and veg, as our friends in the UK might say.</p>
<p>Grocers did not forget the fact. But their historically thin margins and rising competition for customer ownership in the Instacart era hasn’t left them too secure. How can they pursue a more digitally enabled strategy without outsourcing their customer relationship to a third party?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swiftly.com/">Swiftly</a> might be part of the answer. The startup is building technology that may help grocery chains of all sizes go digital, take advantage of modern mobile technology, and generate more incomes via ads, while offering consumers more shopping options. Neat, yeah?</p>
<p>The startup has raised a little over $15 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swiftly-7640/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, but came back into our minds thanks to the launch of <a href="https://www.swiftly.com/assets/built/dollar-tree-inc-press-release-chesapeake-media-group-final.pdf">a deal with the Dollar Tree company</a>, a consumer retailer that has around one zillion stores in America.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="R13W2bRu5p"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/how-are-vcs-handling-diligence-in-a-world-where-deals-open-and-close-in-days-not-months/">How are VCs handling diligence in a world where deals open and close in days, not months?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How are VCs handling diligence in a world where deals open and close in days, not months?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/how-are-vcs-handling-diligence-in-a-world-where-deals-open-and-close-in-days-not-months/embed/#?secret=R13W2bRu5p" data-secret="R13W2bRu5p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I’ve been aware of Swiftly for ages, having met its co-founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/henry-kim">Henry Kim</a> back when he was building <a href="http://www.sneakpeeq.com/">Sneakpeeq</a>, which later became <a href="https://www.symphonycommerce.com/">Symphony Commerce</a>. The latter company was eventually <a href="https://www.symphonycommerce.com/blog/quantum-retail-technology-inc-announces-acquisition-of-symphony-commerce/">bought by Quantum Retail</a>. But during my chats with Kim over the years in and around San Francisco, he consistently brought up the grocery market, a space he’d had experience in before building Symphony Commerce.</p>
<p>After hearing Kim hype up the possibilities for grocery and digital for a half decade or so, to see the company that came out of his hopes and planning land a major partner is fun.</p>
<p>Swiftly provides two main products, a retail system and a media service. The retail side of its business provides checkout services, loyalty programs, personalized offers and the like for mobile shoppers. And the media side allows IRL grocers to snag a bit of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) ad spend that they often miss out on, while looping in analytics to provide better attribution to the impact of ads sold.</p>
<p>I expect that Swiftly will raise more capital in the next few quarters now that it has a big, public deal out. More when we have it.</p>
<h2>UiPath, SPACs, and a neat venture capital round</h2>
<p>Over the past two weeks The Exchange has written quite a lot about the UiPath IPO. Probably too much. But to catch you up just in case, the company’s first IPO pricing range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">looked like a warning</a> for late-stage investors as the resulting valuations were a bit lower than anticipated. Next the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised that range</a>, ameliorating if not eliminating our earlier concern. Then the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">priced above its raised range</a>, though still at a discount to its final private round. Then it gained ground after starting to trade, and its CFO was like, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">we did good</a>.</p>
<p>To dig even more into the company’s private-public valuation saga, The Exchange asked B2B investor <a href="https://twitter.com/dthakker02?lang=en">Dharmesh Thakker</a>, a general partner at Battery Ventures, about his take on the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">final private round</a> in the context of it landing a bit higher than where the company eventually priced its IPO. Here’s what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]here was smart money involved in that round. These are people who understand that material value creation happens 3-5 years post IPO, as we have seen with Twilio, Atlassian, MongoDB, Okta, and Crowdstrike who have increased value 5-10x post IPO.</p>
<p>Right now, UIPath has only 1% penetration at $608M revenue in a $60B automation market, and the urgency around intelligent process automation for repetitive tasks is only increasing post-COVID. Companies need help managing their costs with automation. So, as the company penetrates its target market and grows over time, UIPath will drive ongoing value, which pre-IPO and IPO stage investors realize. They will be patient.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s bullish, in other words. A more acerbic take on the UiPath IPO came in from PitchBook analyst <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanmcburke/">Brendan Burke</a>. Here’s what he had to say about the company and its market:</p>
<blockquote><p>RPA has scaled rapidly due to the demand for automation yet remains a limited solution that may lack durable value. Due to its reliance on custom scripts, we view RPA as a bridge technology to cloud-native AI automation that faces competitive risk from AI-native challengers. The future of enterprise automation is for front-line users to deploy cloud-native machine learning models that can adapt to dynamic data streams and make accurate decisions. UiPath’s implementations are not cloud-native and require third party integrations with around 75 AI model vendors for intelligent decision-making. Additionally, the company lists the ability to recruit AI engineers as a risk factor for the business. UiPath’s ability to expand across the AI value chain will be critical for its long-term prospects.</p></blockquote>
<p>I include that remark as it can be, at times, hard to get actual negative commentary out of the broader analyst world, as people are so terrified of being rude.</p>

<p>Scooting along, there’s a new SPAC deal out this week that I wanted to flag for you: SmartRent is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smartrent-to-go-public-in-2-2-billion-merger-with-fifth-wall-acquisition-corp-i-accelerating-growth-of-category-leading-smart-home-technology-for-the-global-real-estate-industry-301274559.html">merging</a> with Fifth Wall Acquisition Corp. I. SmartRent raised more than $100 million while private, according to Crunchbase data, from RET Ventures, Spark Capital and Bain Capital Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>So this particular SPAC deal, which puts a $2.2 billion equity valuation on SmartRent, is a material venture-backed exit. You can check its investor deck <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/632832908/files/doc_presentations/Investor-Presentation.pdf">here</a>. We care about the company as it appears to work in a similar space to Latch, which is also going out via a SPAC. Dueling OS companies for rental units? This should be fun. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">More on Latch’s SPAC deal here</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally for our main work today, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">HYPR</a> raised $35 million this week. Among all the venture capital rounds that I wish I could have written about this week but didn’t get to, HYPR is up there because it promises a password-free future. And having just raised a Series C, it may have a shot at pulling it off. Please god, let it happen.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>I got to cover a few rounds raised by recent Y Combinator graduates this week, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">Queenly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-imagery-startup-albedo-closes-10m-seed-round/">Albedo’s</a> recent funding events. Check ‘em out.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-reports-record-sales-in-q3-2021-301272314.html">Afterpay’s recent earnings</a> show that the buy-now-pay-later market is still growing like all hell,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MasterClass, which sells a subscription to celebrity-taught classes, sits on the cusp of entertainment and education. It offers virtual, yet aspirational learning: an online tennis class with Serena Williams, a cooking session with Gordon Ramsay. While there’s the off chance that an instructor might actually talk to you &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/masterclass-just-raised-100-million-for-celebrity-fueled-content/">it has happened before</a> &#8212; the platform mostly just offers paywalled documentary-style content.</p>
<p>The vision has received attention. MasterClass is raising funding that would value it at $2.5 billion, as scooped by Axios and confirmed independently by a source to TechCrunch. But while MasterClass has found a sweet spot, can the success be replicated?</p>
<p>Investors certainly think so. Outlier, founded by MasterClass’ co-founder,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/outlier-series-b/"> closed a $30 million Series C this week</a>, for affordable, digital college courses. The similarities between Outlier and its founder’s alma mater aren’t subtle: It’s literally trying to apply MasterClass’ high-quality videography to college classes. This comes a week after I wrote about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/garry-kasparov-launches-a-community-first-chess-platform/">&#8220;MasterClass for Chess lovers&#8221;</a> platform launched by former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparov.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two back-to-back MasterClass copycats raising millions in venture capital makes me think about if the model can truly be verticalized and focused down into specific niches. After 2020 and the rise of Zoom University, we know<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/"> edtech needs to be more engaging</a>, but we don’t know the exact way to get there. Is it by creating micro-learning communities around shared loves? Is it about gamification? Aspirational learning has different incentives than for-credit learning. In order to be successful, Outlier needs to prove to universities it can use MasterClass magic for true outcomes that rival in-person lectures. It&#8217;s a harder, and more ambtious promise.</p>
<p>My riff aside, I turned to two edtech founders to understand how they see the MasterClass effect panning out, and to cross-check my gut reaction.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Taylor_Nieman">Taylor Nieman</a>, the founder of language learning startup Toucan:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Although I do love how these models try to lean into this theme of &#8220;invisible learning&#8221; like we leverage with Toucan, it faces the same issues as so many other consumer products that try to steal time out of people&#8217;s very busy days. Constantly competing for time leads to terrible engagement metrics and very high churn. That leads me to question what true learning outcomes could occur from little to no usage of the product itself.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaDoAmanda">Amanda DoAmaral</a>, the founder of Fiveable, a learning platform for high school students:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Masterclass is important for showing us why educational content should be treated more like entertainment. All of our bars for content quality is much higher now than it ever was before and I’m excited to see how that affects learning across the board.</em></p>
<p><em>For students, it’s about creating environments that support them holistically and giving them space to collaborate openly. It feels so obvious that these spaces should exist for young people, but we’ve lost sight of what students actually need. At my school, we built policies that assumed the worst in students. I want to flip that. Assume the best, be proactive to keep them safe, and create ways to react when we need to.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Anyways, that’s just some nuance to chew on during this fine day. In the rest of this newsletter, we will focus a lot on tactical advice for founders, from the money they raise to the peacock dance they might want to do one day. Make sure to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> so we can talk during the week, too!</p>

<h2><strong>The peacock dance</strong></h2>
<p>You know when male peacocks fan their feathers to court a lover? That, but for startups trying to get acquired. As one of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/remote-work-space/">many rabbit holes on Equity</a> this week, we talk about Discord walking away from a Microsoft deal, and if that deal ever existed in the first place or if it was just a way to drum up investor excitement in the audio gaming platform.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/ ">Discord is reportedly pursuing an IPO</a> after walking away from talks with multiple companies that were looking to acquire the audio gaming giant.</p>

<h2><strong>Even venture capital knows that the future isn’t simply venture capital </strong></h2>
<p>Clearbanc, a Toronto-based fintech startup that gives non-dilutive financing to businesses, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/ ">rebranded alongside a $100 million financing that valued it at $2 billion.</a> Now rebranded as Clearco, the startup wants to be more than just a capital provider, but a services provider, too.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The startup has been on a tear of product development for the past year, launching services such as valuation calculators or runway tools. It’s a step away from what Clearbanc originally flexed: the 20-minute term sheet and rapid-fire investment. I talk about some of the levers at play in my piece:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Many of Clearco’s newest products are still in their infancy, but the potential success of the startup could nearly be tied to the general growth of startups looking for alternatives to venture capital when financing their startups. Similar to how AngelList’s growth is neatly tied to the growth of emerging fund managers, Clearco’s growth is cleanly related to the growth of founders who see financing as beyond a seed check from Y Combinator.</em></p></blockquote>

		Dr. Yifat Aran is a visiting scholar at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, and an incoming Assistant Professor in Haifa University Faculty of Law. She earned her JSD from Stanford Law School where her dissertation focused on equity-based compensation in Silicon Valley startups.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Imagine that you get a job offer at your dream company. You start to negotiate the contract and everything sounds great except for one detail — your future employer refuses to say in what currency your salary would be paid. It could be U.S. dollars, euros, or perhaps Japanese yen, and you are expected to take a leap of faith and hope for fair pay. It sounds absurd, but this is exactly how the startup equity compensation market currently operates.</p>
<p>The typical scenario is that employers offer a number of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of an offer letter, but do not mention the company’s total number of shares. Without this piece of information, employees cannot know whether their grants represent a 0.1% ownership stake, 0.01%, or any other percentage. Employees can ask for this information, but the employer is not required to provide it, and many startups simply don’t.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the end of it. Due to lack of proper disclosure requirements, employees are completely oblivious to the most salient form of startup valuation information — data describing the firm’s capitalization table and aggregate liquidation preferences (which determine, in case the company is sold, how much money will be paid to investors before employees receive any payout). By not accounting for the debt-like properties of venture capital financing, employees tend to overestimate the value of their equity grants. This is <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/squaring-venture-capital-valuations-reality">especially relevant to employees of unicorn companies</a> because the type of terms that are common in late-stage financing have a dramatic and often misleading impact on the value of the company’s common stock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What have regulators done to fix this? Not much. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.701">Under the current regulation</a>, the vast majority of startups are exempted from providing any information to their employees other than a copy of the options plan itself. A small percentage of startups that issue their employees more than $10 million worth of securities over a year period are required to provide additional disclosures including updated financial statements (two years of consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity). These disclosures are likely to contain sensitive information about the startup but are only remotely related to the question of valuation that employees want answered. The company’s most recent fair market valuation and the description of the employee’s anticipated payout across various exit scenarios would convey far more useful information.</p>
<p>The problem with the current regulation is not merely that it provides employees with either too much or too little information—it is both and more. As the lyrics of Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams’ song go, it is “too much, too little, too late.” The regulation mandates the disclosure of too much irrelevant and potentially harmful information, too little material information, and the disclosure is delivered in a timeframe that does not permit efficient decision-making by employees (only after the employee has joined the company).</p>
<p>This situation is unhealthy not only for employees themselves but also for the high-tech labor market as a whole. Talent is a scarce resource that companies of all sizes depend on. Lack of information impedes competition and slows down the flow of employees to better, more promising, opportunities. In the long run, employees’ informational disadvantage can erode the value of equity incentives and make it all the more difficult for startups to compete for talent.</p>
<p>In an article I published in the Columbia Business Law Review, titled, &#8220;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3492151">Making Disclosure Work for Startup Employees</a>,&#8221; I argue that these problems have a relatively easy fix. Startups that issues over 10% of any class of shares to at least 100 employees should be required to disclose employees’ individual payout according an exit waterfall analysis.</p>
<p>Waterfall analysis describes the breakdown of cash flow distribution arrangements. In the case of startup finance, this analysis assumes that the company’s equity is sold and the proceeds are allocated in a “waterfall” down the different equity classes of shares, according to their respective liquidation preferences, until the common stockholders finally receive the residual claim, if any exists. While the information the model contains can be extremely complicated, the output is not. A waterfall model can render a graph where for each possible “exit valuation” plotted on the x-axis, the employee’s<b> </b>individualized “payout” is indicated on the y-axis. With the help of a cap table management platform, it is as simple as pressing a few mouse clicks.</p>
<p>This visual representation will allow employees to understand how much they stand to gain across a range of exit values even if they don’t understand the math and legal jargon that operate in the background. Armed with this information, employees would not need the traditional forms of disclosures now mandated by Rule 701, and startups could be relieved of the risk that the information contained in their financial statements would fall into the wrong hands. Critically, I also argue that employees should receive this information as part of the offer letter – before they choose whether to accept a job opportunity that includes an equity compensation component.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/33-10891.pdf">the SEC released proposed revisions to Rule 701</a>. The proposal includes many developments &#8211; among them the introduction of an alternative to the disclosure of financial statements. For startups that hit the threshold of issuing employees over $10 million worth of securities, the proposal allows choosing between disclosing financial statements and providing an independent valuation report of the securities’ fair market value. According to the proposal, the latter should be determined by an independent appraisal consistent with the rules and regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.</p>
<p>This is a step in the right direction — fair market valuation is far more useful to employees than the firm’s financial statements. However, the disclosure of a 409A valuation in and of itself is just not enough. It is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html">well-known secret in Silicon Valley that 409A valuations are highly inaccurate</a>. Because the appraisal firm wishes to maintain a long-lasting business relationship with the company, and given that the valuation is based on information provided by the management team and is subject to board approval, the startup maintains nearly full control over the result. Therefore, the company’s 409A valuation has informational value only when it includes the waterfall analysis that was used to generate the outcome. Moreover, the SEC&#8217;s proposal still allows the vast majority of startups (as long as they avoid the $10 million threshold) to offer equity grants without providing any meaningful disclosures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For over 30 years, the SEC has almost completely deregulated startup equity compensation in order to accommodate the ever growing need of startups to rely on equity in the war for talent. However, the SEC has and still is paying little attention to the other side of the employment equation—employees’ need for information regarding the value of their equity compensation. The time is ripe to revisit the protection of employees in their investor capacity under the securities regulatory regime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found</a> features The SMART Tire Company co-founder and CEO Earl Cole, a one-time Survivor champion whose startup is working with NASA to commercialize some of its space-age tech. Cole won a NASA startup competition seeking entrepreneurs to work with its scientists and researchers on applications of innovations it created for space exploration that could work right here on Earth, helping people while also forming the basis for a commercially-viable business.</p>
<p>For Cole, that resulted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/startup-founded-by-survivor-champ-debuts-airless-bike-tires-based-on-nasa-rover-tech/">The SMART Tire Company, a venture that&#8217;s using tech NASA developed to create more durable, puncture-proof tires to equip future rovers</a>. NASA turned to shape memory alloys (SMAs), which is a type of metal that can be flexed or bent, but that also has elastic properties to return to its original shape, to handle the unique task of building a tire that wouldn&#8217;t require inflation, but that would be able to handle rocky Martian terrain with aplomb. Cole&#8217;s startup is using the same technology to tackle the more than $100 billion tire industry — starting with bike tires, but eventually moving on to address other kinds of vehicles as well.</p>
<p>We talked to Cole about the process of working with NASA, including its challenges and what the agency has to offer in terms of unique access to cutting-edge technology. He also shared his perspective on entrepreneurship from decades of experience, including difficulties with traditional VC and access to funding, and why he chose to initially raise money for his own startup through newly-available equity crowdsourcing. Cole also told us about why being a Survivor champ (and the first unanimous winner) provides crucial lessons for not only being a founder, but also running a company and being an effective leader, too.</p>
<p>We had a great time chatting with Cole, and we hope you have just as much fun listening. And of course, we&#8217;d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has taken down dozens of tweets in India, some of which were critical of New Delhi&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus, to comply with an emergency order from the Indian government at a time when South Asian nation is grappling with a globally unprecedented surge in Covid cases.</p>
<p>New Delhi made an emergency order to Twitter to censor over 50 tweets in the country, Twitter disclosed on Lumen database, a Harvard University project. The social network has complied with the request, and withheld those tweets from users in India.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has learned that Twitter is not the only platform affected by the new order. Facebook didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment. (Credit where it&#8217;s due: Twitter is one of the handful of companies that timely discloses takedown actions and also shares who made those requests.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The world&#8217;s second largest nation &#8212; which has also previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">ordered Twitter to block some tweets and accounts</a> critical of its policies and threatened jail time to employees in the event of non-compliance &#8212; comes as the country reports a record of <a href="http://covid19india.org">over 330,000 new Covid cases a day</a>, the worst by any country. Multiple news reports, doctors, and academicians say that even these Covid figures, as alarmingly high as they are, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/even-record-death-toll-may-hide-extent-of-india-s-covid-crisis">are underreported</a>.</p>
<p>Amid an unprecedented collapse of the nation&#8217;s health infrastructure, Twitter has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-becomes-platform-hope-amid-despair-indias-covid-crisis-2021-04-21/">become a rare beam of hope</a> in what it describes as one of its &#8220;priority markets&#8221; as people crowdsource data to help one another find medicines and availability of beds and oxygen supplies.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Experts believe the data-lake market will hit a massive <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-lake-market">$31.5 billion</a> in the next six years, a prediction that has led to much concern among large enterprises. Why? Well, an increase in data lakes equals an increase in public cloud consumption — which leads to a soaring amount of notifications, alerts and security events.</p>
<p>Around 56% of enterprise organizations handle <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/56--of-large-companies-handle-1000+-security-alerts-each-day/d/d-id/1338318">more than 1,000 security alerts</a> every day and 70% of IT professionals have seen the volume of alerts double in the past five years, according to a 2020 Dark Reading report that cited research by Sumo Logic. In fact, many in the ONUG community are on the order of 1 million events per second. Yes, per second, which is in the range of tens of peta events per year.</p>
<p>Now that we are operating in a digitally transformed world, that number only continues to rise, leaving many enterprise IT leaders scrambling to handle these events and asking themselves if there’s a better way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Why isn’t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud — something so fundamental now to the operation of our society?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Compounding matters is the lack of a unified framework for dealing with public cloud security. End users and cloud consumers are forced to deal with increased spend on security infrastructure such as SIEMs, SOAR, security data lakes, tools, maintenance and staff — if they can find them — to operate with an “adequate” security posture.</p>
<p>Public cloud isn’t going away, and neither is the increase in data and security concerns. But enterprise leaders shouldn’t have to continue scrambling to solve these problems. We live in a highly standardized world. Standard operating processes exist for the simplest of tasks, such as elementary school student drop-offs and checking out a company car. But why isn’t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud — something so fundamental now to the operation of our society?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://onug.net/">ONUG</a> Collaborative had the same question. Security leaders from organizations such as FedEx, Raytheon Technologies, Fidelity, Cigna, Goldman Sachs and others came together to establish the Cloud Security Notification Framework. The goal is to create consistency in how cloud providers report security events, alerts and alarms, so end users receive improved visibility and governance of their data.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the security challenges with public cloud and how CSNF aims to address the issues through a unified framework.</p>
<h2>The root of the problem</h2>
<p>A few key challenges are sparking the increased number of security alerts in the public cloud:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rapid digital transformation sparked by COVID-19.</li>
<li>An expanded network edge created by the modern, work-from-home environment.</li>
<li>An increase in the type of security attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two challenges go hand in hand. In March of last year, when companies were forced to shut down their offices and shift operations and employees to a remote environment, the wall between cyber threats and safety came crashing down. This wasn&#8217;t a huge issue for organizations already operating remotely, but for major enterprises the pain points quickly boiled to the surface.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7GW42s23Sq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/is-there-still-room-in-the-cloud-security-market/">Is there still room in the cloud-security market?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is there still room in the cloud-security market?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/is-there-still-room-in-the-cloud-security-market/embed/#?secret=7GW42s23Sq" data-secret="7GW42s23Sq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Numerous leaders have shared with me how security was outweighed by speed. Keeping everything up and running was prioritized over governance. Each employee effectively held a piece of the company’s network edge in their home office. Without basic governance controls in place or training to teach employees how to spot phishing or other threats, the door was left wide open for attacks.</p>
<p>In 2020, the FBI reported its cyber division was receiving nearly 4,000 complaints per day about security incidents, a <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Enterprise-cybersecurity-threats-spiked-more-to-come">400% increase from pre-pandemic</a> figures.</p>
<p>Another security issue is the growing intelligence of cybercriminals. The Dark Reading report said <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/56--of-large-companies-handle-1000+-security-alerts-each-day/d/d-id/1338318">67%</a> of IT leaders claim a core challenge is a constant change in the type of security threats that must be managed. Cybercriminals are smarter than ever. Phishing emails, entrance through IoT devices and various other avenues have been exploited to tap into an organization&#8217;s network. IT teams are constantly forced to adapt and spend valuable hours focused on deciphering what is a concern and what’s not.</p>
<p>Without a unified framework in place, the volume of incidents will spiral out of control.</p>
<h2>Where CSNF comes into play</h2>
<p>CSNF will prove beneficial for cloud providers and IT consumers alike. Security platforms often require integration timelines to wrap in all data from siloed sources, including asset inventory, vulnerability assessments, IDS products and past security notifications. These timelines can be expensive and inefficient.</p>
<p>But with a standardized framework like CSNF, the integration process for past notifications is pared down and contextual processes are improved for the entire ecosystem, efficiently reducing spend and saving SecOps and DevSecOps teams time to focus on more strategic tasks like security posture assessment, developing new products and improving existing solutions.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the benefits a standardized approach can create for all parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End users</strong>: CSNF can streamline operations for enterprise cloud consumers, like IT teams, and allows improved visibility and greater control over the security posture of their data. This enhanced sense of protection from improved cloud governance benefits all individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud providers</strong>: CSNF can eliminate the barrier to entry currently prohibiting an enterprise consumer from using additional services from a specific cloud provider by freeing up added security resources. Also, improved end-user cloud governance encourages more cloud consumption from businesses, increasing provider revenue and providing confidence that their data will be secure.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud vendors</strong>: Cloud vendors that provide SaaS solutions are spending more on engineering resources to deal with increased security notifications. But with a standardized framework in place, these additional resources would no longer be necessary. Instead of spending money on such specific needs along with labor, vendors could refocus core staff on improving operations and products such as user dashboards and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working together, all groups can effectively reduce friction from security alerts and create a controlled cloud environment for years to come.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>CSNF is in the building phase. Cloud consumers have banded together to compile requirements, and consumers continue to provide guidance as a prototype is established. The cloud providers are now in the process of building the key component of CSNF, its Decorator, which provides an open-source multicloud security reporting translation service.</p>
<p>The pandemic created many changes in our world, including new security challenges in the public cloud. Reducing IT noise must be a priority to continue operating with solid governance and efficiency, as it enhances a sense of security, eliminates the need for increased resources and allows for more cloud consumption. ONUG is working to ensure that the industry stays a step ahead of security events in an era of rapid digital transformation.</p>

The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Apple this week held a big spring event where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today/">announced a number of new products</a>, including a new lineup of colorful M1-powered iMacs and M1-powered iPad Pros, a next-gen Apple TV 4K with a way less terrible Siri remote (buttons, hooray!), a very pretty purple iPhone 12 and 12 mini, its long-awaited UWB lost item finder AirTag, Apple Card Family and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">a new Podcasts app with a paid subscription option for creators</a>.</p>

<p>The new iPad Pro, which brings a 50% performance increase over the previous Pro model, has a ton of upgrade specs, including Thunderbolt and USB 4 support, up to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM, and a “Liquid Retina XDR” display on the 12.9-inch model that will make it ideal for creative pursuits involving photography, video and even AR. But now it&#8217;s time for iPadOS to catch up &#8212; and that may be in store with iPadOS 15, which will reportedly at least have an upgraded Home Screen but hopefully more.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t bother to offer a real launch date for iOS 14.5, although we know it&#8217;s next week thanks to Apple&#8217;s reminders about getting ready for ATT.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/first-findings-with-apples-new-airtag-location-devices/">launch of AirTag,</a> meanwhile, played right into the other big Apple event this week: a Senate antitrust hearing over App Stores.</p>

<h3>Apple and Google defend the app store business model in antitrust hearing</h3>
<p>This week&#8217;s hearing brought three chief Apple critics to testify: Tile, Match and Spotify. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">The companies argued that the app stores&#8217; hold on the ecosystem was too tight.</a></p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not allowed to tell their customers inside their own app how to purchase a subscription to their services outside the App Store</strong>, where they could keep 100% of the revenues, they said. And, they argued, these IAP &#8220;taxes&#8221; have to be passed along to the consumer, leading to higher prices. In Spotify&#8217;s case, this puts them at a disadvantage when having to compete against a direct rival, like Apple Music, which doesn&#8217;t have the same impediment.</p>
<p>The companies also argued how little power they had to fight against any changes enacted by the platform makers. <strong>Tile&#8217;s General Counsel Kirsten Daru noted that her company&#8217;s relationship with Apple used to be symbiotic</strong>, saying Apple &#8220;sold our devices in their retail stores, and they even featured us on stage at their Worldwide Developer conference in 2018. But that all changed when Apple decided that it wanted to take over this category,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ujhPtdvM2t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/embed/#?secret=ujhPtdvM2t" data-secret="ujhPtdvM2t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Spotify spoke of the times Apple threatened to pull it from the App Store over rule violations</strong>. And how Apple told Spotify it couldn&#8217;t email customers to tell them how they could upgrade via its website instead of through IAP. Apple, meanwhile, defended its position equating it to coming in a Verizon store to advertise that the new iPhone was available for sale down the street at an Apple Store. &#8220;No retailer is going to allow us to do that,&#8221; Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer argued.</p>
<p><strong>Match talked about app rejections and Apple dictating how it can run its business</strong>. It said it wanted to verify IDs for a dating app in Taiwan and Apple wouldn&#8217;t allow this. Match also mentioned an app rejection that kept it from releasing its LGBTGQ+ safety update for two months. (But we&#8217;ve learned that Apple&#8217;s rejection was not related to the LGBTQ+ feature itself.)</p>
<p>Match Chief Legal Officer &amp; Secretary Jared Sine also threw out a pretty big bomb when it alerted lawmakers to the fact that they received a call the night before their testimony. <strong>Google wanted to know why Match&#8217;s testimony appeared to differ from what it said during earnings,</strong> he said. (On the earnings call, Match said they believed they could work through the issues of Google&#8217;s 30% tax.) Google&#8217;s Senior Director Public Policy &amp; Government Relations Wilson White said &#8220;it sounds as if some business development folks who are working on commercial conversations&#8221; called Match and that Google doesn&#8217;t &#8220;view that as a threat&#8230;we would never threaten our partners.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Tile argues for a level playing field</h3>
<p><strong>Immediately after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">launching its lost item finder AirTag</a>, Apple had to defend its product against antitrust claims made by <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/">Tile</a>.</strong> From what we&#8217;ve seen, there are mixed feelings out there as to whether Tile has a case. Tile carved out a market for lost item finders and has many years&#8217; worth of a head start on Apple. Some say it wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about Apple if it had continued to innovate. After all, <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/products?utm_campaign=382442024&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=tile%20app-e&amp;adgroup=1222657374215262&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;msclkid=32b3b356b0a212a79d92d3d5b82009f6">just look at the AirTag hardware design</a> and the clever way it guides you to a lost item with directional arrows.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zrYDUdLxqx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">Tile bashes Apple&#8217;s new AirTag as unfair competition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tile bashes Apple&#8217;s new AirTag as unfair competition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/embed/#?secret=zrYDUdLxqx" data-secret="zrYDUdLxqx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Tile points out there were areas where it believes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">Apple didn&#8217;t level the playing field</a>.</p>
<p>Tile has asked since 2019 for access to the U1 chip for UWB (ultra wideband) access, like AirTag has, so it can roll out its own UWB device. But Apple only this month, April 2021, announced a draft specification for chipset manufacturers that will arrive later this spring (AFTER AirTag debuts) which will allow third-party device makers to take advantage of ultra wideband technology in U1-equipped Apple devices.</p>
<p>And while Apple opened up Find My to third-parties &#8212; a move it&#8217;s using to fend of antitrust claims &#8212; that means Tile wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue its direct relationship with its customers through its own iOS app, if it made the switch. As to what other details that Find My agreement forces upon developers, Tile couldn&#8217;t say. When pressed by lawmakers in the antitrust hearing this week, Tile&#8217;s Daru said she couldn&#8217;t talk about it, because Apple makes companies sign an NDA. Apple CCO Andeer declined to allow Daru to answer questions about the nature of the agreement for the purpose of the hearing either.</p>
<p>Tile had several other grievances as well, like how its app had to ask permission to do things like track location or run in the background or use Bluetooth, when Apple&#8217;s Find My did not.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They took away one of our critical permissions, which requires our customers to go deep, deep, deep into their settings to turn Tile on. Find my, by contrast, is on by default&#8230;when you set up your operating system. And in order to turn it off you have to go deep into your Settings and actually enter a password. Apple also started serving prompts with that same update to our users &#8212; once they figured out how to turn Tile on, they started serving these prompts encouraging them to turn Tile off. But they didn&#8217;t serve up those prompts for Find My. Our Bluetooth network &#8212; of course, people need to opt in to the Bluetooth network; I think that&#8217;s great. We are complete supporters of consumer transparency. But the Find my Bluetooth network in the new Find My app is on by default. And then with these AirTags, as I discussed, we have the UWB issue, which I won&#8217;t repeat. But there&#8217;s something else. It&#8217;s called..they call the &#8216;magic onboarding flow.&#8217; To connect your AirPods or your AirTags with your phone, you don&#8217;t even have to open the Find My app. You just put them near. But that magic flow isn&#8217;t available to third-parties like Tile.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>Apple questioned about the problem with App Store subscription scams</h3>
<p>During the hearing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing/">Apple was also specifically pressed on its failure to police app store scams</a>. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.</p>
<p>One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">has made it his mission</a> to highlight some of the most egregious scams on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses. Georgia&#8217;s Senator Ossoff asked why we had to rely on independent reports (presumably referring to these efforts by Kosta) to route out scams? Apple defended itself by saying security was a cat-and-mouse game and consumers were refunded when scammed.</p>

<h3>Apple and Google questioned on use of app store data</h3>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/apple-and-google-pressed-in-antitrust-hearing-on-whether-app-stores-share-data-with-product-development-teams/">an interesting line of questioning</a> put to Apple and Google asked the companies if they had an internal firewall between sharing data gleaned from their app stores with their own product development teams working on other initiatives. Apple&#8217;s answer left room for doubt. Andeer initially responded that Apple has separate teams, which was clearly not what Senator Blumenthal wanted to know. After the Senator clarified what a &#8220;data firewall&#8221; was, Apple&#8217;s response was &#8220;we have controls in place.&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>The App Store will be adding a second advertising slot in its Suggested Apps section on the Search page, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5527ddd1-77a8-4cd0-82fd-4568be5da80f">FT reports</a>.</strong> The slot was previously spotted during testing and may arrive by the end of the month. The advantage of this slot is that it will allow developers to advertise to all users who end up on that tab, not just those who have already performed a search.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tell me you&#8217;re launching iOS 14.5 on April 26 without telling me you&#8217;re launching iOS 14.5 on April 26</em>.</strong> Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ecvrtzt2">says</a> all apps must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to request the user’s permission to track them or to access their device&#8217;s advertising identifier as of&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;April 26, 2021. Apple hasn&#8217;t officially announced the iOS 14.5 launch date, but this indicates the launch will likely be on April 26 or perhaps the following day.</p>
<p><strong>Apple alerts developers that, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ib31uj1j">starting April 26</a>, iPhone and iPad apps must be built with Xcode 12 and the iOS 14 SDK or later.</strong> Watch apps will need to be built with Xcode 12 and the watchOS 7 SDK or later.</p>

The update is expected to be announced at this year&#8217;s WWDC on June 7.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qfoid1d">extended the waiver on IAPs</a> for apps offering paid online group events instead of in-person events</strong> due to the pandemic. The waiver now continues through the end of 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Google this week <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/how-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html">touted its technologies</a> that keep its Play Store safe. It says Google Play Protect scanned over 100 billion installed apps for malware each day in 2020</strong>. Its machine-learning detection capabilities and app review process stopped over 962,000 policy-violating apps from being published and it banned 119,000 spammy or malicious apps. It also increased focus on SDK enforcement, which impacts security and privacy violations.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>PayPal will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/paypal-to-launch-wallet-in-china-focused-on-cross-border-payments.html">launch a local wallet in China </a>focused on cross-border payments.</strong> The U.S. company in January became the first foreign firm to have 100% ownership of a payments platform in China. The app will not compete with local players like Alipay or WeChat Pay for domestic payments.</p>
<p><strong>Google Pay added its privacy nutrition label to its iOS app.</strong> The app&#8217;s references to third-party advertising are due to its &#8220;Explore&#8221; tab where users find merchant offers they can add to their card, which is optional. The app&#8217;s personalization features are off by default and, when turned on, are used to surface relevant merchant offers within Google Pay only.</p>

Parler Interim CEO Mark Meckler, on Fox News, referred to the changes it had to make as &#8220;censorship.&#8221; He said Google had also reached out but the company is less concerned with making amends there as the app can be sideloaded on Android devices.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Belfast is among one of the U.K.'s fastest growing tech hubs, so we reached out to investors, founders and executives for an inside look at the city's startup ecosystem.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Things have been looking up for Belfast since the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">the Troubles</a>. The city has undergone infrastructure improvements over the past two decades, tourism has boomed thanks to attractions such as the shipyard where the RMS Titanic was built and Game of Thrones shooting locations, and employment has risen steadily in the city since 2016, according to <a href="https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/annual-employee-jobs-surveys/business-register-and-employment-survey">Northen Ireland&#8217;s Department for the Economy</a>. The city also has the famed <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/">Queen’s University</a> and low living costs to count in its favor, and gentrification is starting to take place, which shows things are looking up for Northern Ireland&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>And as far as the local startup scene goes, the U.K.&#8217;s Tech Nation <a href="https://technation.io/insights/report-2018/belfast/">found</a> in 2018 that about 26% of Belfast’s workforce was employed in tech, and it is among cities in the country with the <a href="https://technation.io/scale-ratio/investment-balance/">highest growth potential</a> for 2021.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we reached out to founders, investors and executives in the city to get an inside look at the state of the current tech startup ecosystem. According to the survey, the city is strong in sectors such as fintech, agritech, hospitality tech, emerging tech, cybersecurity, SaaS and medtech. <a href="https://www.igniteni.com/">Ignite NI</a> emerged as an important native incubator and accelerator.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interesting startups that our respondents mentioned include: CropSafe, SideQuest, Aflo, Material Evolution, Cloudsmith, LegitFit, Continually, Gratsi, 54 North Design, Animal Manager, Kairos Sports Tech, Budibase, Incisiv, Automated Intelligence, loyalBe, Konvi, Lane 44, Teamfeepay.com, Axial3D, Neurovalens, Payhere, and Civic Dollars.</p>

<p>The tech investment scene was characterized as being strong in software and life sciences, but sometimes too conservative or risk-averse. However, this seems to be changing for the better, and foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important growth factor for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Although there remains uncertainty around how Brexit will affect Northern Ireland, one executive said, “If we play our cards right, we can capitalize on it. Being positioned both in the EU and U.K. markets gives us advantages that we would be foolish to waste.”</p>
<p>One of the founders foresees more private capital flowing into Belfast as global investors realize that &#8220;the combination of great local universities and very strong FDI has attracted some brilliant engineers.&#8221; The low cost of living is also encouraging for talent to stay put in the city, which makes for a tech scene that&#8217;s poised to take off, this founder added.</p>

<h2>Cormac Quinn, founder &amp; CEO, loyalBe</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re strong in cybersecurity and (to an arguably lesser extent) fintech. I&#8217;m excited by the droves of new startups being created here in all sorts of sectors — traditionally, Belfast hasn&#8217;t had a lot of tech startups, but I can see that changing right before my eyes, which is very exciting. I always anticipated having to leave Belfast for the U.S. to be able to start a tech company, but I&#8217;m glad this is no longer a requirement or even the standard any more.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
There are a few that stand out: Cloudsmith (devtools), LegitFit (scheduling), Continually (chatbots/marketing), and Automated Intelligence (data management). This is certainly not an exhaustive list of interesting startups, just a few that come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Investors here can be somewhat conservative and slightly traditional. If you&#8217;re raising investment north of £1 million, you would likely need to look outside the jurisdiction. There also just isn&#8217;t enough private capital at the moment, which is a shame, as Belfast has some fantastic talent combined with a very low cost of living, which means investor money tends to go further (no crazy rents, reasonable salaries, etc.). It feels we&#8217;re at the beginning of a cycle in Belfast, however — I expect to see many more local exits over the coming years, which will likely lead to new private capital inflows.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I understand the city was growing pre-pandemic, and I believe this trend will continue once life returns to a semi-normal state. For a long time, Belfast was a city people didn&#8217;t want to live in due to historical issues, but that has been slowly changing. New developments are popping up all over the city, from student accommodation to hotels and nice apartments. 15-20 years ago, Belfast had hardly any of this.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Chris McClelland, MD of Ignite NI: He&#8217;s a mentor on the city&#8217;s top accelerator program. Co-founded BrewBot.<br />
Ian Browne, COO of Ignite NI: Entrepreneur and another mentor to startups in the city.<br />
Mark Dowds: Venture partner at Anthemis, co-founder at Ormeau Baths (in my opinion it&#8217;s the city&#8217;s best co-working space).</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re in uncertain times due to Brexit, but I think if we play our cards right, we can capitalize on it. Being positioned both in the EU and U.K. markets gives us advantages that we would be foolish to waste. I do think we will see more private capital flowing into Belfast as global investors realize that the combination of great local universities and very strong FDI has attracted some brilliant engineers. Combine that with the fact that cost of living remains quite low, which means their capital can go much further (rather than going to landlords) and you have a tech scene that&#8217;s poised for take-off.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Cloudsmith.</p>

<h2>Susan Kelly, CEO, Respiratory Analytics</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Cybersecurity, fintech, digital — strong medtech — needs building. Great incubator and accelerator in Ignite, but needs expansion to the Northwest where deprivation and poor infrastructure need to be addressed. Public funding supports are good, but too fragmented and hard to access.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
CropSafe, SideQuest, Aflo (my startup!), Material Evolution.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Too conservative, &#8220;stale, pale, male&#8221;, and risk-averse. But changing for the better, slowly. Legal&#8217;s far too costly. Needs to shift to a more U.S. type model. Too few women on the scene. Focus on software, which is great, but too risk-averse in hardware. Needs more experienced angel investors. Halo Business Angel Network feels staid.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Huge shift back to Belfast and Northern Ireland in general as a result of COVID.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Ignite NI is driving the startup scene via Propel (Pre-Accelerator) and the Accelerator — doing an amazing job. Clarendon, Techstart, various angels, and Catalyst. Big Motive is a key design engine.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
With more support from Invest NI, the whole of Northern Ireland can be an innovation hub linked to Ireland via the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
CropSafe.</p>
<h2>Ryan Crown, co-founder, Hill Street Hatch</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re strong in the tech industry. We&#8217;re excited by changing how we launch hospitality ventures. Belfast is weak in investment and investors.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Payhere, Civic Dollars, and Konvi.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re lacking proper investors in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
The cost of living and quality of life is fantastic in Northern Ireland/Belfast. COVID-19 will see a huge influx of people moving from expensive cities such as London, Manchester, or Dublin and relocating to Belfast.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Chris McClelland.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Booming.</p>
<h2>Fearghal Campbell, founder, Pitchbooking</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Cybersecurity, SaaS, sportstech. Most excited by a range of early-stage tech companies — [there has been] an explosion in pre-seed and seed level companies over the past two to three years. Weaker at scaling up; relative lack of indigenous scale-up companies. Large number of foreign direct investment from U.S.-based companies into the city.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
In the sportstech sector, teamfeepay.com are growing fast. loyalBe are a seed-stage fintech company with big plans for reinventing retail loyalty programs that we always keep an eye on. Later-stage companies like medtech mainstays Axial3D and Neurovalens are doing great things too!</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
We have a mix of angel and institutional investors in Belfast. Hard to say a specific focus on a particular industry, but there are a couple of sectors that are strong in the city given the focus of the local universities. Medtech and cybersecurity both feature heavily in the startup scene.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Belfast benefits from a relatively low cost of living in relation to the rest of the U.K., meaning that we are seeing an increase in startups moving here from other major cities. The support for early-stage startups has also contributed to this influx. As a city, we are well set up for moving to a hybrid way of working. You can traverse across the center of the city in 15 mins on foot, which means popping into a city center office isn&#8217;t a big undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Invest NI &#8211; Government support agency.<br />
Ignite NI &#8211; Seed-stage accelerator program.<br />
UlsterBank Accelerator &#8211; Early-stage accelerator program.<br />
Aurient Investments &#8211; Angel investment group with a diverse investment portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
I believe we will see the strongest seed-stage companies from 2017-2020 becoming established companies within our tech scene to match the influx of FDI companies from further afield.</p>
<h2>Jack Spargo, co-founder &amp; CEO, Gratsi</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in: Fintech, agritech, hospitality tech, and emerging tech.<br />
Most excited by: support (financial, mentoring, etc.) is available and the cost to build and grow is low.<br />
Weakest in: geographical barriers to rest of UK and EU.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
loyalBe, Konvi, and Lane 44.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Great — good support and intros facilitated by accelerators such as Ignite NI, Catalyst, Techstart, Ormeau Baths, etc.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
More likely to move in: low cost of living and well set up for being remote already.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Chris McClelland and Ian Browne of Ignite NI; Mark Dowds of anthemis, and Cormac Quinn of loyalBe.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Stronger: a tech hub for the UK and the EU.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bobby Goodlatte has only been an investor for about a decade, but he appears to have already made tens of millions of dollars, contrary to the expectations of some traditional VCs who have privately, and publicly, griped that too many novice investors have flooded into the industry.</p>
<p>“I remember a very prominent investor saying at the time, ‘All these new angel investors, they&#8217;re all going to lose all their money; they&#8217;re fools for doing this&#8217;,&#8221; recalls Goodlatte, who was recruited out of college to become a product designer at Facebook and left four years later, when the company went public. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t get shaken off of it.”</p>
<p>As it happens, Goodlatte’s second check went to Coinbase. It was an auspicious start for Goodlatte, who more recently formed his first institutional fund, <a href="https://www.formcapital.com/">Form Capital</a>, with entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gowalla-raises-4-million-from-gv-and-spark-for-its-ar-social-app/">Josh Williams</a>, an outfit that offers up to 40 hours of design help with logos or packaging or whatever else a team might need, with each check that it writes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with Goodlatte this week about the venture firm and its $12 million debut fund, which is largely funded by Goodlatte (it also counts the fund of funds Cendana Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/cendana-has-raised-a-30-million-fund-of-funds-for-vcs-managing-15-million-or-less/">as a limited partner</a>). He shared why he thinks the biggest returns in the coming years will flow to very small funds that feature a big financial commitment from the general partners. He talked about investing in other small funds to ensure strong deal flow. He also shared why three months ago he moved to Miami, where he believes a &#8220;movement&#8221; is afoot. Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You were an early designer on Facebook&#8217;s user growth team, working with Chamath Palihapitiya, among others. It&#8217;s interesting that you stayed for just four years, leaving in 2012 when the company went public. </strong></p>
<p>BG: I had given some thought to staying longer, and obviously many of my friends are still there and have risen in the ranks and done extremely well. I was just very eager to get started as an investor . . . and at the time, Facebook was saying, &#8216;Well, you can&#8217;t stay here and do angel investing.&#8217; Little did I know that some people skirted the rules a bit and ended up angel investing [without leaving]. But I was very excited to dig in and quite glad that I got started when I did [because] my second-ever angel investment was in Coinbase and had I stayed longer, maybe I would have missed that one.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve mentioned in the past that you&#8217;d been a Bitcoin nerd and followed some of the discussion threads that others might have missed. What sparked that early interest?</strong></p>
<p>BG: There&#8217;s that famous William Gibson <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/681-the-future-is-already-here-it-s-just-not-evenly">quote</a>: &#8220;The future is already here &#8212; it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.&#8221; I think about that in quite literal terms in the sense that there are sort of pockets of the future, these bubble hiding all around. In 2012, I think the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/">Bitcoin subreddit</a> was this bubble where, within it, people were talking very excitedly about Bitcoin and if you weren&#8217;t in it, you would kind of scratch your head about it.  . . . I felt a similar feeling about Facebook back in the day. I was a college student when Facebook launched, and everyone who was in college at the time was kind of privy to this future that was quite obvious amongst college students. But if you weren&#8217;t in college, people would kind of scratch their heads and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t really understand what&#8217;s going on.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you comment on your return from Coinbase? You were an investor in the A, C and E rounds. Is there anything you can say about the cash on cash return?</strong></p>
<p>BG: A lot of this is fairly <a href="https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1354827309421883393">public knowledge</a> at this point, but the Series A cost basis was 20 cents, so folks can kind of do math based on that.</p>
<p>I think so much of startup investing is [that] you can kind of have a prepared mind about things, but there&#8217;s also an element of luck about it. I don&#8217;t think I had complete foresight when I made the investment that Coinbase was going to be an $80 billion-plus company. I thought it was going to be successful. But it has clearly eclipsed even my greatest expectations, and I feel very lucky and fortunate to have to realized that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: There are various on-ramps to VC these days, including AngelList syndicates and rolling funds. Did you ever take advantage of these or did you keep writing checks from your own pocket before founding Form Capital?</strong></p>
<p>BG: I don&#8217;t know if I should should be embarrassed to say this or not, but when I first got my start as an angel, I got advice from financial advisors and who said, &#8216;When it comes to angel investing, only invest a tiny percentage of your overall net worth into this.&#8217; And to be honest, I maybe foolishly ignored that advice. Obviously, it has netted out in the long term, [but] it was large risk I took. I did 40 deals out of my own pocket. I was sort of getting closer to the end of running out of tape.</p>
<p>[At that point] I wound up investing through a small scout-like fund for a few deals and hit some incredible deals through that [and] I was able to play around, investing at a larger check size. It also helped me sort of step-stone up to doing [Form Capital]. But yeah, I kind of ignored a lot of the advice and put a lot of my own personal net worth into seed-stage investing and thankfully, it all worked out. Otherwise, I could have been in trouble. I think the advice is well-considered.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How might you advise someone just spinning out of, say, Coinbase and thinking about jumping into angel investing? Go it alone? Use one of these other products?</strong></p>
<p>BG: I think it depends on their risk profile and their own appetite and whether they truly enjoy this type of work, because it can become a lot of work. If you want to develop a real portfolio, you have to take a lot of meetings, you have to make yourself available and put yourself out there in a way that I think a lot of folks who wind up getting a very meaningful personal exit may not want. <span style="font-weight: 400;">For those folks who are trying to break into venture who haven&#8217;t had this sort of exit, I say go for it. I say welcome. Let&#8217;s go invest together. Honestly, there&#8217;s a lot of space for small check investors. I think the folks writing small collaborative checks have an incredible opportunity to post some insane multiples.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: You stress collaboration. Are people more or less collaborative when you started in 2012? Seed-size checks are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">getting bigger</a>, which suggests things have grown more competitive.</strong></p>
<p>BG: There was a period where it was extremely competitive, and for some folks who are deploying out of a certain fund size, it might feel extremely competitive right now. To me, it feels at its most collaborative, including because I am personally an LP in a number of tiny funds [headed by] tremendously talented managers who are just getting their start . . .</p>
<p>I do think there are a number of funds that raised more than they should have; I think there&#8217;s a danger zone somewhere around $80 million where you&#8217;re forced to be a lead investor and you can&#8217;t be a collaborative investor and so it becomes this slug-it-out, duke-it-out [situation] with other other funds as to who&#8217;s going to be the lead writer on a given deal . . .</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re aiming to write a large check, let&#8217;s say $1.5 million, and the founder comes back to you and says, &#8216;We can&#8217;t do that, but we can give you a $150,000 allocation,&#8217; that&#8217;s just absolutely fatal to somebody trying to deploy a very large seed fund, versus if my target check size is something like $250,000. If I get squeezed down to $150,000, I can actually make that work economically within the fund math.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you&#8217;ll write a check as small as $150,000. What&#8217;s the upper boundary, and how much ownership are you targeting when you fund a startup?</strong></p>
<p>BG: It&#8217;s upwards of $500,000, give or take, and our target is 3%. But, again, part of the joy of being a small fund manager is more flexibility in terms of constructing a portfolio. In the cases where we may get squeezed down a little bit, or we want to invest at a slightly higher valuation than is typical, we can paint outside the lines a tiny bit more.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Meaning bigger checks? Do you typically raise special purpose vehicles, or SPVS, in order to take a bigger bite of certain companies?</strong></p>
<p>BG: One pattern for that was my personal investment in Coinbase. By being close to the company, by helping on a few very minor things over the years in terms of design, in terms of making connections to design firms and helping recruit some designers, they gave me follow-on allocations. And then in the Series E, I was able to raise an SPV into the deal based on the idea of building a deep relationship with the company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s essentially the model going forward. We may or may not continue to pursue SPVs. We may pick a different vehicle in the future for how to deploy that follow-on capital. But the idea is: wedge in early with a small check, put a lot of skin in the game on that check [with a bigger general partner commitment in the fund than is typical], and build a relationship and try to be disproportionately helpful relative to our check size.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You tweeted that for that SPV, you pitched 50 different parties, and only three said yes.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I invested a total of 3 times into Coinbase, including an SPV I raised into the last round.</p>
<p>I pitched the SPV to almost 50 different parties. Only three said yes. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>— Bobby Goodlatte (@rsg) <a href="https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1339715725506748416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>BG: Yeah, it was amazing in late 2018 how in the dumps the crypto market was, and people thought that the overall stock market was going to be heading that way, so this was a very, very difficult SPV to raise. I wasn&#8217;t the only person who had one, and so there was some amount of market competition. Then just the nature of SPVs is such that you get your allocation, and bang goes the starting gun, and you need to very quickly talk to a lot of people.</p>
<p>[Still] it is remarkable how quickly the perception of that company has changed over just two short years, give or take. I give a lot of credit to the investors who backed us on that SPV because they they took the risk with us. I&#8217;ve had a number of people [since] say, &#8216;Oh, you should have called me, I would have invested.&#8217; And maybe they would, maybe they wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You talked at the outset about communities and bubbles and I can&#8217;t help but wonder if you think you are hearing about more interesting deals, having moved recently to Miami three months ago, than you would in the Bay Area. </strong></p>
<p>BG: It does really feel like that&#8217;s the case, and I started seeing this maybe in late November, and then very quickly said, &#8216;Okay, why not? This feels fun, this feels exciting.&#8217; And I&#8217;m glad I made the jump, because while I love San Francisco &#8212; I think San Francisco is a tremendous place [that] will always be one of the great tech epicenters of the world &#8212; I think a lot of folks moved here because they were looking to change things up. And the energy that comes from that, where everyone&#8217;s trying to make this work, is really quite exciting.</p>
<p>A lot of people said, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re going to miss out on things by moving to Miami, you&#8217;re going to take a step back in your career.&#8217; And really, it&#8217;s been the opposite of that. It&#8217;s been a total accelerant of my career and investing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re an interesting fit for Miami because Miami is known as being a design capital, and we&#8217;re a really design-driven fund, and there&#8217;s a lot of parallels there. [But I also realized that] I can be one of many thousands of new funds based in the Bay Area, or I can be one of a tiny handful based here in Miami and get all these tailwinds and have the mayor hype us up, and that sounds like a good deal to me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Click Studios, the Australian software house that develops the enterprise password manager Passwordstate, has warned customers to reset passwords across their organizations after a cyberattack on the password manager.</p>
<p>An email sent by Click Studios to customers said the company had confirmed that attackers had &#8220;compromised&#8221; the password manager&#8217;s software update feature in order to steal customer passwords.</p>
<p>The email, posted <a href="https://twitter.com/niebezpiecznik/status/1385563976004681730">on Twitter</a> by Polish news site Niebezpiecznik early on Friday, said the malicious update exposed Passwordstate customers over a 28-hour window between April 20-22. Once installed, the malicious update contacts the attacker&#8217;s servers to retrieve malware designed to steal and send the password manager&#8217;s contents back to the attackers. The email also told customers to &#8220;commence resetting all passwords contained within Passwordstate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Click Studios did not say how the attackers compromised the password manager&#8217;s update feature, but emailed customers with a security fix.</p>
<p>The company also said the attacker&#8217;s servers were taken down on April 22. But Passwordstate users could still be at risk if the attacker&#8217;s are able to get their infrastructure online again.</p>

<p>Enterprise password managers let employees at companies share passwords and other sensitive secrets across their organization, such as network devices — including firewalls and VPNs, shared email accounts, internal databases and social media accounts. Click Studios claims Passwordstate is used by &#8220;more than 29,000 customers,&#8221; including in the Fortune 500, government, banking, defense and aerospace, and most major industries.</p>
<p>Although affected customers were notified this morning, news of the breach only became widely known several hours later after Danish cybersecurity firm CSIS Group published a <a href="https://www.csis.dk/newsroom-blog-overview/2021/moserpass-supply-chain/">blog post</a> with details of the attack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We get up close with a robotic Groot, SpaceX has a successful astronaut launch and cryptocurrency prices tumble. This is your Daily Crunch for April 23, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Meet Disney Imagineering&#8217;s new robot</strong></p>
<p>Disney Imagineering&#8217;s Project Kiwi represents a real robotics milestone — a free-walking robot that seems to fully capture the personality of the original character. In this case, the original is Groot, the beloved tree character from &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not just saying that based on the demo video, either. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/">Matthew Panzarino has seen Project Kiwi in person</a> and reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pint-sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on how Snap had acquired Berlin-based Fit Analytics, an AI-based fitting technology startup, as part of a wider push into e-commerce services, specifically to gain technology that can help prospective online shoppers get a better sense of how a particular item or size would fit them. A <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001564408/9f8cb681-bb0d-474b-801f-4e85df9906eb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-Q filing</a> from Snap today has now put a price tag on that deal.</p>
<p>Snap paid a total of $124.4 million, covering technology, IP, customer relationships and payouts to the team. The filing also noted that Snap spent a total of $204.5 million on acquisitions in 2020, but did not break them out.</p>
<p>The news comes ahead of Snap &#8212; whose flagship app Snapchat now has 280 million daily active users &#8212; preparing for its Snap Partner Conference in May. Sources say the company plans to announce, among other news, deeper commerce features for Snapchat &#8212; specifically tools to make it easier for Snapchat users to interact with and buy items that appear in the app, either in ads or more organically in content shared by other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the exact details of those commerce tools, and the timing of when they might come online, are not yet known, Snap has hardly kept its interest in commerce a secret.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snap acquires Fit Analytics, a fitting technology startup, to double down on fashion and e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/embed/#?secret=pbZVMOUttX" data-secret="pbZVMOUttX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Snap has been hiring for roles to support its commerce efforts. Currently it&#8217;s advertising for a variety of engineering, marketing and product roles in commerce, to, in the words of one of the listings, for a <a href="https://wd1.myworkdaysite.com/recruiting/snapchat/snap/job/Los-Angeles-California/Product-Manager--Commerce_R0018013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Manager</a>, &#8220;develop and launch shopping experiences and services that make shopping fun for Snapchatters and drive results for brands.&#8221; The listings also include a role specifically to work on Snapchat-based e-commerce efforts for direct-to-consumer (D2C) businesses.</p>
<p>And it has been making other recent acquisitions in addition to Fit Analytics that also line up with that.</p>
<p>They have included <a href="https://screenshopit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Screenshop</a>, an app that describes itself as &#8220;the first AI-back style lens,&#8221; which can identify shoppable items in photos and then build a custom catalog of similar products that you can buy (akin to &#8220;shop the look&#8221; features that you will have come across in fashion media). And it&#8217;s also acquired Ariel AI, which has built technology to quickly render people in 3D, technology that can be used in a diverse set of applications, from games to virtual try-ons of clothing, makeup or accessories.</p>
<p>Snap confirmed the Ariel acquisition to CNBC in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/snap-acquires-ariel-ai-to-boost-snapchat-augmented-reality-features.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>. And while Screenshop deal was first reported earlier this month by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-acquires-screenshop-app-to-fuel-shopping-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a>, Snap has declined to comment on it, although we have found people who worked at the startup now working at Snap.</p>
<p>Both acquisitions closed in 2020, according to reports, meaning that they came out of that year&#8217;s $204.5 million acquisition run. (Snap also noted a smaller acquisition, for $7.6 million, in the most recent quarter, but it did not disclose any further details.)</p>
<p>Even before all this, Snap had been making smaller efforts and tests in commerce going back years, although none of them have tipped into mainstream efforts.</p>
<p>Among them, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/01/snapchat-snap-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> it launched a <a href="https://store.snapchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap Store</a> &#8212; but that so far has not progressed beyond selling merchandise based on Bitmoji characters. And work on a Gucci shoe campaign last year, where Snapchat users could try shoes on in AR and then buy them, was seen by some as its big step into commerce &#8212; &#8220;we&#8217;ve moved from pure entertainment and expanded the use-case. And so with brands, it&#8217;s a really exciting time, especially in fashion and beauty. The Snapchat camera is connecting brands to their audiences in new ways,&#8221; a Snapchat AR executive said at the time &#8212; but that also didn&#8217;t develop into much beyond a one-off effort.</p>
<p>But with the pandemic leading to a surge of shopping online, and technology continuing to improve, the iron may finally be hot here.</p>
<p>As we said around the Fit Analytics acquisition, the idea of diversifying Snapchat&#8217;s revenue streams by building in more commerce experiences makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/embed/#?secret=ekPoDIGft1" data-secret="ekPoDIGft1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It gives the company another revenue stream at a time when Apple is <a href="https://t.co/19FXV09gwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing changes</a> that might well affect how advertising can run and be monetized in the future. (The company most recently posted average revenues per user of $2.74, a figure Wall Street will be hoping will grow, not shrink.) It also plays into the demographics that Snapchat targets, where younger consumers are using social media apps to discover, share and shop for goods.</p>
<p>And specifically in the case of fashion, building experiences to shop for items on Snapchat leans into the augmented reality, image-altering, hyper-visual technology that has become a well-known and much-used hallmark of Snapchat and its owner, self-titled &#8220;camera company&#8221; Snap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Honda&#8217;s new goal is to achieve 100% EV sales in North America by 2040 as part of its broader target of being carbon neutral by 2050. CEO Toshihiro Mibe announced the planned shift away from internal combustion engines at a news conference on Friday, his first since taking over executive leadership of the company in early April.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a stream of pledges from legacy car manufacturers to introduce high percentages of zero-emissions vehicles into their fleets and achieve carbon neutrality. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/">General Motors plans to eliminate gas and diesel light-duty cars and SUVs by 2035</a> and be carbon neutral by 2040, and Mazda, Mitsubishi and Nissan have all said they plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Honda&#8217;s goals are also in alignment with Japan&#8217;s electrification strategy, which aims for a 46% cut in emissions by 2030.</p>

<p>Honda will start on this road immediately, expecting EVs to account for 40% of sales by 2030, and 80% by 2035 in all major markets. By the second half of 2020, Japan&#8217;s second-largest automaker will launch a series of new electric models in North America based on the company&#8217;s in-house e:Architecture platform, which &#8220;increases the commonality of the body and three primary EV components (battery, motor and inverter) while also featuring high space efficiency and battery mounting efficiency,&#8221; according to a Honda spokesperson.</p>
<p>Honda, and its subsidiary Acura, will also introduce two large-sized EV models using GM&#8217;s Ultium batteries by 2024. The company will further its collaboration with GM by using fuel cell technology for a range of vehicles and applications, like commercial trucks and power sources.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This past year has brought many new developments to a historically traditional process: taking a company public. Many of the standard levers in an initial public offering (IPO) are being redefined as we write.</p>
<p>The emergence of direct listings is just one example. Even in more traditional IPOs, we have seen unique lock-up provisions, different auction approaches, virtual and rapid roadshows become the norm, and company-centric approaches to investor allocations.</p>
<p>But clearly the most disruptive trend of the past 12 months has been the predominance of the special purpose acquisition company, commonly known as a SPAC. A SPAC is a company with no commercial operations that is formed strictly to raise capital through an IPO for the purpose of acquiring an existing, private company.</p>
<p>Also known as &#8220;blank check companies,” these entities typically have 24 months to find a company to buy or merge with.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The fundamental thing to remember about the SPAC process is that the result is a publicly traded company open to the regulatory environment of the SEC and the scrutiny of public shareholders.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That process essentially makes the acquired company a publicly traded one. SPACs can, and generally do, raise additional capital in the form of a PIPE (private investment in public equity) in order to reaffirm the SPAC valuation and raise additional capital with the identified target company.</p>
<p>SPACs have been around for decades, but they took the 2020 IPO market by storm. For some context: 2020 had more than 248 SPACs — more than the sum of the SPACs in the previous decade. While SPACs and the general sentiment around them continue to evolve, 2021 started off strong with 298 newly formed blank-check companies to date that have raised a collective $95 billion (versus $83 billion in 2020). It’s worth noting that there has since been some slowdown in new SPAC formation and an uptick in regulatory caution. We expect such shifts to continue in these early days.</p>
<p>For a SPAC, finding a company to merge with in 24 months might sound like a good amount of time, but in reality, the diligence and SEC process can easily consume six months or more. So identifying the target company relatively quickly becomes critical. As a result of this new trend, many private companies are being approached and courted by a number of newly formed SPACs.</p>

<p>At Madrona, we invest in companies early in their journey (often Day One), and walk with them through the years of opportunities, challenges and financing goals. As such, for many of our companies, the conversation around raising capital via a SPAC transaction has come up, and more than once.</p>
<p>How to evaluate the pros and cons of SPACs relative to other financing options can be convoluted and confusing, to say the least.</p>
<h2>Are you ready to be a public company?</h2>
<p>The fundamental thing to remember about the SPAC process is that the result is a publicly traded company open to the regulatory environment of the SEC and the scrutiny of public shareholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hawkeventures.com/team/">Hawke Ventures</a>, the investment arm of marketing consultancy <a href="https://hawkemedia.com/">Hawke Media</a>, is announcing that it has closed its first $5.6 million venture fund.</p>
<p>Managing Partner Drew Leahy acknowledged that the firm&#8217;s focus on marketing technology isn&#8217;t exactly in high demand among other VCs right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are running away from martech [&#8230;] but that&#8217;s our circle of confidence,&#8221; Leahy told me. &#8220;If you look at the biggest companies in the world, even Walmart now, they are all martech companies at the end of the day.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While some might quibble with that description, it&#8217;s hard to deny the central role that marketing and advertising play for the internet&#8217;s biggest platforms. As for how that translates to Hawke&#8217;s strategy, Leahy said the firm is writing checks of between $100,000 and $250,000, with the possibility of follow-on investments.</p>
<p>Leahy, who was previously co-founder and CMO at SnapSuits.com, said that the fund has its roots in the strategic angel investing that he was doing for Hawke Media, ultimately working with the company&#8217;s CEO Erik Huberman and COO Tony Delmercado to raise a fund to make bigger bets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RB7G4QGsF6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">Postscript raises $35M to give Shopify stores SMS superpowers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Postscript raises $35M to give Shopify stores SMS superpowers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/embed/#?secret=RB7G4QGsF6" data-secret="RB7G4QGsF6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He added that beyond writing checks, the firm can offer access to a network of 51 limited partners who invested in the fund. Those LPs include Deathwish Coffee founder Michael Brown, MVMT Watches founder Jack Kassan, former VaynerMedia executive Jeff Nicholson, husband-and-wife Holly (an actress) and Rodney Pete (a former NFL player), Jill Zarin of &#8220;The Real Housewives of New York City,&#8221; Video Genome Product founder Xavier Kochhar and MarketShare founder Jon Vein.</p>
<p>And while most firms would say that they&#8217;re trying to fund the next Facebook or Google, Leahy said he has a slightly different focus: &#8220;We’re trying to build a different venture firm, that’s not about what we think the next the big idea is, but is focused on building actual technology that we can use ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>That also means the firm is mostly focused on products that can be used by small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not an enterprise martech fund, we’re a small- and medium-sized business martech fund,&#8221; Leahy said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for pieces of technology that hundreds of thousands of users can be a part of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early investments include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">SMS marketing company Postscript</a> and analytics company Yaguara (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/">acquired by Chord</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;As one of the earliest investors in Postscript, Hawke Ventures has worked with us since the beginning,&#8221; said Postscript President Alex Beller in a statement. &#8220;The entire Hawke org has been value-add since day one, and we&#8217;re proud to continue our partnership with Hawke as we build the definitive platform for Conversational Commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Origin stories are satisfying because we already know the hero will overcome the odds — and in doing so, they&#8217;ll reveal their core strengths.</p>
<p>This week, we published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">a four-part series</a> about how Klaviyo co-founders Andrew Bialecki and Ed Hallen bootstrapped their startup into an e-commerce marketing automation platform now valued at $4.15 billion.</p>
<p>Neither founder was bitten by a radioactive spider or received a serum that enhanced their entrepreneurial skills; instead, they focused on outreach to prospective customers to find out what they were willing to pay for and largely ignored the competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Bootstrapping Klaviyo, it came out of this: &#8216;Hey, if we are super disciplined about finding a problem that someone will pay us to solve, we have a real company,'&#8221; said Hallen.</p>

<p>Several micromobility companies once operated in my city, but consolidation has reduced that to a small handful.</p>
<p>Now that many consumers are buying their own e-bikes and e-scooters, shared dockless micromobility &#8220;just hasn’t proven itself to be a profitable line of business,&#8221; Puneeth Meruva, an associate at Trucks Venture Capital, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one dockless electric moped provider in my town, so price is no longer a consideration. Instead, my first priority is to find a vehicle with the best-charged battery. (San Francisco has a lot of hills, and you never know where the day might take you.)</p>
<p>Larger players like Lime and Bird have vertically integrated tech stacks for fleet management features like this, but there are also opportunities for startups — imagine a &#8220;phantom scooter&#8221; that drives itself to a neighborhood with high demand or a moped that alerts drivers if there&#8217;s traffic ahead.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/micromobilitys-next-big-business-is-software-not-vehicles/">This in-depth industry analysis</a> shows how increased regulation on the local level and changing consumer habits are pushing micromobility providers to adapt and innovate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you want to stack regulatory compliance on the vehicles, do safety features like ADAS or add mapping content, you kind of need this platform where you can actively develop and launch new apps on the vehicle without having to bring it back to the factory,&#8221; Meruva said.</p>

<p>If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, then one might say the cybersecurity industry is insane.</p>
<p>Criminals continue to innovate with highly sophisticated attack methods, but many security organizations still use the same technological approaches they did 10 years ago. The world has changed, but cybersecurity hasn’t kept pace.</p>

<p>By 2025, 463 exabytes of data will be created each day, according to some estimates. It’s now easier than ever to translate physical and digital actions into data, and businesses of all types have raced to amass as much data as possible in order to gain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>However, in our collective infatuation with data (and obtaining more of it), what’s often overlooked is the role that storytelling plays in extracting real value from data.</p>
<p>The reality is that data by itself is insufficient to really influence human behavior. Whether the goal is to improve a business’ bottom line or convince people to stay home amid a pandemic, it’s the narrative that compels action, not the numbers alone.</p>
<p>As more data is collected and analyzed, communication and storytelling will become even more integral in the data science discipline because of their role in separating the signal from the noise.</p>

<p>We all need to be taking precautionary measures, not just in light of COVID, but to ensure our firms can continue to thrive when faced with unexpected tragedy.</p>
<p>So ask yourself this question: “What would happen if I or my partner(s) checked into the hospital tomorrow and had no phone and/or was too sick to call anyone, and that went on for two or three weeks (or longer)?”</p>
<p>If the answer is “I’m really not sure,” then you don’t have a business continuity plan.</p>

<p>After years of sustained growth, the pandemic supercharged the outdoor recreation industry. Startups that provide services like camper vans, private campsites and trail-finding apps became relevant to millions of new users when COVID-19 shut down indoor recreation, building on an existing boom in outdoor recreation.</p>
<p>Startups like Outdoorsy, AllTrails, Cabana, Hipcamp, Kibbo and Lowergear Outdoors have seen significant growth, but to keep it going, consumers who discovered a fondness for the great outdoors during the pandemic must turn it into a lifelong interest.</p>

<p>Many emerging and mature organizations survive or die based on their ability to scale. Scale quicker. Scale cheaper. Scale right.</p>
<p>Typically the IT team bears that burden — on top of countless other demands. IT teams move mountains for their organizations while scaling the tech platform as fast as possible, putting out the latest infrastructure fire and responding to countless day-to-day requests.</p>
<p>The most helpful gift any chief information officer or chief technology officer can give their IT teams is more time. Many people think that means adding another team member. But it could be as simple as introducing a low-code integration platform.</p>

<p>A stunning first quarter in venture capital funding was not restricted to the United States; Europe also had one hell of a start to the year.</p>
<p>The venture capital world kicked off its 2021 European investing cycle with enough activity to set the continent on the path that would crush yearly records.</p>
<p>Inside the data, there’s lots to unpack, including which sectors of European startups stood out in terms of capital raised, rising seed and late-stage deals, and dollar volume. We’ll also need to discuss exits — the Deliveroo IPO and its various woes was not the only transaction from the period worth understanding.</p>
<p>We’ll keep in mind that all venture capital data lags reality somewhat, as many deals from a particular period are not disclosed or discovered until long after they actually occurred.</p>
<p>In this case, it makes the numbers all the more impressive.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath went public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.</p>
<p>UiPath raised its last private round when the markets were most interested in public offerings and is now going public in a slightly altered climate.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, UiPath raised its IPO range from $43 to $50 per share to $52 to $54 per share. That’s a 21% jump in the value of the lower end of its range and an 8% gain to the value of the upper end of its per-share IPO price interval.</p>
<p>UiPath is also selling more shares than before, which should make its total valuation slightly larger at the top end than a mere 8% gain. So let’s go through the math one more time.</p>

<p>But, as anyone who’s familiar with startups that offer insurance-related products and services knows, the sector is enough of a mixed bag that one needs to segment down to get clarity on how constituent companies are performing.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss insurtech’s 2020 as a whole, peek at some preliminary 2021 venture data and then dive deep into what we’ve collected regarding growth among insurtech marketplace players.</p>
<p>Covering longitudinal progress of specific startup categories is one of our favorite things to do. So, please, walk with us!</p>

<p>This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>This week, we dove into &#8220;introspective failure prediction,&#8221; using ML to identify dangerous moles, and spotting cows from space.</p>

<p>With strict privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA already listing big-ticket penalties — and a growing number of countries following suit — businesses have little option but to comply.</p>
<p>It’s not just bigger, established businesses offering privacy and compliance tech; brand-new startups are filling in the gaps in this emerging and growing space.</p>
<p>Privacy isn’t dead, as many would have you believe. New regulations, stricter cross-border data transfer rules and increasing calls for data sovereignty have helped the privacy startup space grow thanks to an uptick in investor support.</p>
<p>This is how we got here, and where investors are spending.</p>

<p>UiPath is <em>not</em> worth $36 billion, as we might have expected, but at a figure below $30 billion.</p>
<p>At $29.1 billion, UiPath has a roughly 35x run-rate multiple. That just about ties it for eighth-best overall. Among all public cloud companies. That means that UiPath is insanely valuable, just not <em>that</em> insanely valuable.</p>
<p>So what went wrong with the company’s final private round? The Exchange&#8217;s hunch is that UiPath’s final private investors expected the market to stay as hot as it once was, but it has cooled since the first two months of the year. So, instead of UiPath coming to the market in the expected climate, the company instead had to price where it did because the weather predicted by its final private price had already chilled.</p>
<p>Those investors gambled, in other words, hoping that a last-minute, pre-IPO round could snag them a rapid return on a company going public in a hot market. That didn’t work out.</p>
<p>And how bad is that? Not very! UiPath’s IPO is more a meeting of private-market exuberance and modestly more conservative public markets. It’s nothing to cry about.</p>

<p>The second half of 2021 will bring incredible growth, the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Here’s how marketing in tech will shift — and what you need to know to reach more customers and accelerate growth this year.</p>
<p>First and foremost, differentiation is going to be imperative. It’s already hard enough to stand out and get noticed, and it’s about to get much more difficult as new companies emerge and investments and budgets balloon in the latter half of the year.</p>
<p>Additionally, tech companies need to be mindful not to ignore the most important part of the ecosystem: people. Technology will only take you so far, and it’s not going to be enough to survive the competition.</p>
<p>Tactically, the most successful tech companies will embrace video and experimentation in their marketing — two components that will catapult them ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Ignoring these predictions, backed by empirical evidence, will be detrimental and devastating. Fasten your seatbelts: 2021 is going to be a turbocharged year of growth opportunities for marketing in tech.</p>

<p>Despite a somewhat circuitous route, UiPath closed its first day as a public company worth more than it was in its Series F round — when it sold 12,043,202 shares at $62.27576 apiece, per SEC filings. More simply, UiPath closed on Wednesday worth more per-share than it was in February.</p>
<p>How you might value the company, whether you prefer a simple or fully diluted share count, is somewhat immaterial at this juncture. UiPath had a good day.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO Ashim Gupta, curious about the company’s choice of a traditional IPO, its general avoidance of adjusted metrics in its SEC filings and the IPO market’s current temperature.</p>

<p>The global venture capital market had a cracking start to the year. Coming off a 2020 high, VC totals in the United States, in Europe, and among competitive verticals like insurtech and AI are on pace to set new records in 2021.</p>
<p>The rapid-fire deal-making and trend of larger venture checks at higher valuations that The Exchange has tracked for some time require private-market investors to make decisions faster than ever. For venture capitalists, the timeline for reaching conviction around a startup’s thesis and executing due diligence has become compressed.</p>
<p>Some venture capitalists are turning to data to move more quickly. Some are spending more time preparing to be vetted themselves. And some investors are simply doing the work beforehand.</p>
<p>We were tipped off to the concept of pre-diligence during the reporting process for a look into recent fundraising trends in the AI/ML space. Sapphire investor Jai Das, when asked about how he was handling a competitive and swiftly moving market for AI startup investments, said that “most firms are completing their due diligence way before the financing actually happens.”</p>
<p>How does that work in practice?</p>

<p>Your clients might not demand 24/7 customer service yet, but they’re certainly hoping for it.</p>
<p>But how can a startup with a lean staff provide round-the-clock customer care? There are several options available, but more than ever, outsourcing is one of them.</p>
<p>When should your startup consider outsourcing its customer care? And what should you look for in a provider?</p>

<p>The clock begins ticking on a startup the day the doors open. Regardless of a young company’s struggles or success, sooner or later the question of when, how or whether to sell the enterprise presents itself. It’s possibly the biggest question an entrepreneur will face.</p>
<p>For founders who self-funded (bootstrapped) their startup, a boardroom full of additional factors comes into play. Some are the same as for investor-funded firms, but many are unique.</p>
<p>After 18 years of bootstrapping a BI software firm into a business that now serves 28,000 companies and 3 million users in 75 countries, here’s what I’ve learned about myself, my company, about entrepreneurship and about when to grab for that brass ring.</p>
<p>Put happiness at the center of the decision, and let your intuition — the instincts that made you the person you are today — be your guide.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year was a record 12 months for venture-backed biotech and pharma companies, with deal activity rising to $28.5 billion <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-biotech-went-to-work-as-the-world-stayed-home">from $17.8 billion in 2019</a>. As vaccines roll out, drug development pipelines return to normal, and next-generation therapies continue to hold investor interest, 2021 is on pace to be another blockbuster year.</p>
<p>The median step up in valuations from seed to Series A is now 2x, higher than in all later rounds. As a result, biotech startups will continue to attract more investment at earlier stages from a larger, more diverse pool of venture capitalists.</p>
<p>This may also change the nature of biotech founders themselves: As a blog post from Y Combinator <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4L-how-biotech-startup-funding-will-change-in-the-next-10-years">suggests</a>, these founders are trending younger and perhaps less willing to cede control to VCs and hired executives than they might have in years past (i.e., via the “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/28/venture-creation-model-biotech/">venture creation</a>” model so predominant among early-stage biotech companies).</p>

			Founders are some of the most creative people out there, but legal documentation should be anything but.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As longtime members of the biotech startup community — as executives, entrepreneurs, advisors and legal counsel — we’ve seen our fair share of founder missteps early in the fundraising journey result in severe consequences.</p>
<p>In this exciting moment, when younger founders will likely receive more attention, capital and control than ever, it’s crucial to avoid certain pitfalls.</p>
<h2>Clarity trumps creativity</h2>
<p>Founders are some of the most creative people out there, but legal documentation should be anything but. Keep it as simple and clear as possible. That means using National Venture Capital Corporation documents that everyone knows and understands, as well as keeping organized documentation for employee intellectual property (IP) assignment and NDAs, option grants, independent contractor agreements, tax documents and other key contracts and paperwork.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that harsh? I mean, companies are going to company, and partnerships with major record labels is a common sense move for a social media app all about honing the art of short, clever combinations of sound and video. And fair dues to the creators, many of them in college or high school, for jumping at the chance to make some money and get a little bit of fame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s probably not too harsh when you consider what else is possible when catchiness is weaponized. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221297912_Detecting_and_Tracking_Political_Abuse_in_Social_Media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2756406.2756941"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: whether it’s internet memes or political slogans or Megan Thee Stallion’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what drives information dissemination is not the truthfulness of the content or the credibility of the speaker but 1) how easy it is to remember and 2) how quickly it sparks conversations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And would you look at that! Those are exactly the variables music producers optimize for today. What the Bloomberg story highlights, inadvertently or not, is how a No. 1 pop hit and a piece of political disinformation are not all that different, aesthetically. Everyone’s an entertainer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now read to the end of the Bloomberg story. Get to the part where it’s revealed that ByteDance (the Chinese company that owns TikTok), in response to threats of a U.S. ban on the app, recruited creators to orchestrate a seemingly grassroots lawsuit against the proposed ban. And I think: damn. Attention really is the most precious commodity in the world. And we’re just…giving it away.</span></p>
