										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot could not have been engaged on the stretch of road where a Model S crashed last month in Texas, killing the two occupants, according to a preliminary report released Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
<p>The results help clear up some of the mysteries around the crash, which has received widespread attention after police reported that there was no one in the driver&#8217;s seat, leading to speculation that Autopilot was functioning at the time.</p>
<p>Only adaptive cruise control, one of the functions in Autopilot, could be engaged in that section of the road, according to the NTSB. Autosteer, another feature that keeps the vehicle in the lane, was not available on that part of the road, the report says. The preliminary report supports comments made during Tesla&#8217;s vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy, who said during an earnings call that adaptive cruise control was engaged and accelerated to 30 miles per hour before the car crashed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NTSB also confirmed there were only two occupants in the vehicle. When the two men were found, one was in the passenger seat and the other was in the back seat, which led to speculation about whether Autopilot was engaged and even conspiracy theories that there was a third occupant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Footage from the owner’s home security camera shows the owner entering the car’s driver’s seat and the passenger entering the front passenger seat,&#8221; the report reads. &#8220;The car leaves and travels about 550 feet before departing the road on a curve, driving over the curb, and hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole, and a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NTSB said it will continue to collect data to analyze the crash dynamics, postmortem toxicology test results, seat belt use, occupant egress and electric vehicle fires. All aspects of the crash remain under investigation, the NTSB said.</p>
<p>The NTSB&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HWY21FH007-preliminary-report.aspx">preliminary report</a> also indicated that the crash of the Tesla Model S, which caught fire after hitting a tree, destroyed an onboard storage device and damaged the restraint control module — two components that could have provided important information about the cause of the incident. The car’s restraint control module, which can record data associated with vehicle speed, belt status, acceleration, and airbag deployment, was recovered but sustained fire damage, the agency said. The NTSB has taken the restraint control module to its recorder laboratory for evaluation.</p>
<p>The NTSB is investigating the crash with support from Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Harris County Texas Precinct 4 Constable’s Office is conducting a separate, parallel investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years after popping open a Pandora&#8217;s box of bad behavior, social media companies are trying to figure out subtle ways to reshape how people use their platforms.</p>
<p>Following Twitter&#8217;s lead, Facebook is trying out a new feature designed to encourage users to read a link before sharing it. The test will reach 6% of Facebook&#8217;s Android users globally in a gradual rollout that aims to encourage &#8220;informed sharing&#8221; of news stories on the platform.</p>
<p>Users can still easily click through to share a given story, but the idea is that by adding friction to the experience, people might rethink their original impulses to share the kind of inflammatory content that currently dominates on the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today, we’re testing a way to promote more informed sharing of news articles. If you go to share a news article link you haven’t opened, we’ll show a prompt encouraging you to open it and read it, before sharing it with others. <a href="https://t.co/brlMnlg6Qg">pic.twitter.com/brlMnlg6Qg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1391816265891778560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter introduced last June prompts urging users to read a link before retweeting it, and the company quickly found the test feature to be successful, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">expanding it to more users</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook began trying out more prompts like this last year. Last June, the company rolled out pop-up messages to warn users<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/facebook-old-content-notification-screen/"> before they share any content that&#8217;s more than 90 days old</a> in an an effort to cut down on misleading stories taken out of their original context.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ayx9QaYeqp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">Twitter plans to bring prompts to &#8216;read before you retweet&#8217; to all users</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter plans to bring prompts to &#8216;read before you retweet&#8217; to all users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/embed/#?secret=ayx9QaYeqp" data-secret="ayx9QaYeqp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time, Facebook said it was looking at other pop-up prompts to cut down on some kinds of misinformation. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-pop-up-warnings-coronavirus-articles-200556011.html?guccounter=1">A few months later</a>, Facebook rolled out similar pop-up messages that noted the date and the source of any links they share related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The strategy demonstrates Facebook&#8217;s preference for a passive strategy of nudging people away from misinformation and toward its own verified resources on hot-button issues like COVID-19 and the 2020 election.</p>
<p>While the jury is still out on how much of an impact this kind of gentle behavioral shaping can make on the misinformation epidemic, both Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/our-progress-on-leading-the-fight-against-online-bullying/">have also explored prompts</a> that discourage users from posting abusive comments.</p>
<p>Pop-up messages that give users a sense that their bad behavior is being observed might be where more automated moderation is headed on social platforms. While users would probably be far better served by social media companies scrapping their misinformation and abuse-ridden existing platforms and rebuilding them more thoughtfully from the ground up, small behavioral nudges will have to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voyager Space Holdings has added X.O. Markets, the parent of commercial space service venture Nanoracks, to its growing catalogue of space companies. The agreement was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/voyager-space-holdings-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-commercial-space-leader-nanoracks/">first announced last December</a>.</p>
<p>This is Voyager’s fourth majority stake acquisition of a space company since its founding in October 2019, and it won’t be its last. Voyager CEO Dylan Taylor told TechCrunch that he anticipates the company will announce two to four more acquisitions this year. It’s an aggressive strategy but key to understanding Voyager’s business model.</p>
<p>“A lot of people confuse us with a fund or private equity strategy, or some kind of a financial instrument, for lack of a better word, and we&#8217;re really none of those things,” Taylor said. “We&#8217;re an operating company.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voyager wants to reach the same level of capability as the space “primes,” or primary companies, in seven to ten years. To get there, it’s pursued a majority stake in a series of space ventures to build out its portfolio of capabilities. Notably, Voyager has always never opted for 100% equity in these companies and it operates in a relatively decentralized way. These business decisions help keep innovation flourishing amongst Voyager’s many ventures, Taylor said.</p>
<p>The typical strategy in private equity – to purchase two competing companies, merge them, and sell them onto another financial buyer – doesn’t ultimately spur growth of the new space economy, he pointed out.</p>
<p>“[That strategy is] really not how you capture value in space,” he said. “You capture value in space by Capability A, marrying it with Capability B and unlocking a new Capability C that’s higher up on the food chain.”</p>
<p>The company also plans to go public via a traditional initial public offering sometime around the third quarter of this year. It anticipates filing the S-1 at some point this summer, Taylor said. He declined to provide further details of the recent acquisition.</p>

<p>Voyager’s previous major acquisitions have been with Pioneer Astronautics, an R&amp;D company that performs, amongst other things, research into supporting life in space; advanced robotics startup Altius Space Machines; and The Launch Company, a launch support company that provides standardized hardware and equipment to launch providers.</p>
<p>The newest acquisition, Nanoracks, has been involved in more than 1,000 projects with the International Space Station, most importantly installing the first commercial airlock on the ISS. Last November, the company also entered into a partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office to research agricultural solutions in challenging physical environments, like the desert – or space.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting of Nanoracks’ endeavors is what it calls its Outpost program: building and operating completely commercial space stations out of the spent upper stages of launch vehicles and other space debris. Nanoracks will be launching a demonstration mission on board a SpaceX mission next month.</p>
<p>The four acquisitions taken together – launch support, advanced robotics, a research company, and now Nanoracks – clearly point to a future in which Voyager is primed to build and operate commercial space stations. While that future is still far off, it&#8217;s closer than one might think.</p>
<p>“The last ten years of the industry was defined by getting to orbit,” Taylor said. “I think the next 10 years will be about destinations. I think it’s highly likely we’re going to have somewhere between 8-12 space stations in orbit by 2030.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a new letter, attorneys general representing 44 U.S. states and territories are pressuring Facebook to walk away from new plans to open Instagram to children. The company is working on an age-gated <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13">version of Instagram for kids</a> under the age of 13 that would lure in young users who are currently not permitted to use the app, which was designed for adults.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one, as this platform appeals primarily to children who otherwise do not or would not have an Instagram account,&#8221; the coalition of attorneys general <a href="https://www.naag.org/social-media/press-releases/attorneys-general-urge-facebook-to-abandon-launch-of-instagram-kids/">wrote</a>, warning that an Instagram for kids would be &#8220;harmful for myriad reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state attorneys general call for Facebook to abandon its plans, citing concerns around developmental health, privacy and Facebook&#8217;s track record of prioritizing growth over the well-being of children on its platforms. In the letter, embedded below, they delve into specific worries about cyberbullying, online grooming by sexual predators and algorithms that showed dieting ads to users with eating disorders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Concerns about social media and mental health in kids and teens is a criticism we&#8217;ve been hearing more about this year, as some Republicans join Democrats in coalescing around those issues, moving away from the claims of anti-conservative bias that defined politics in tech during the Trump years.</p>
<p>Leaders from both parties have been openly voicing fears over how social platforms are shaping young minds in recent months amidst calls to regulate Facebook and other social media companies. In April, a group of congressional Democrats <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/markey-letter-instagram-kids/">wrote Facebook with similar warnings</a> over its new plans for children, pressing the company for details on how it plans to protect the privacy of young users.</p>
<p>In light of all the bad press and attention from lawmakers, it&#8217;s possible that the company may walk back its brazen plans to boost business by bringing more underage users into the fold. Facebook is already in the hot seat with state and federal regulators in just about every way imaginable. Deep worries over the company&#8217;s future failures to protect yet another vulnerable set of users could be enough to keep these plans on the company&#8217;s back burner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week activist investor Starboard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">delivered a public letter</a> rebuking Box for what it perceives as underperformance. Today the firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">owns 8% of Box stock</a>, making it the company&#8217;s largest stock holder, took it a step further with an official slate of four candidates it will be putting up at the next stockholder&#8217;s meeting.</p>
<p>While the company rehashed many of the same complaints as <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_Box_Stockholders_05.03.2021.pdf">in last week&#8217;s letter</a>, this week it explicitly stated its intent to run its own slate of candidates for the Box board. &#8220;Therefore, in accordance with the Company’s governance deadlines and in order to preserve our rights as stockholders, we have delivered a formal notice to Box nominating four highly qualified director candidates (the “Nominees”) for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting,&#8221; Starboard wrote in a public letter to Box.</p>
<p>Box responded in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210510005514/en/Box-Outlines-Significant-Progress-and-Reiterates-Commitment-to-Stockholder-Value-Creation-Responds-to-Starboard%E2%80%99s-Statement">a press release</a> that the Board as currently constituted categorically rejects this attempt by Starboard to take over additional seats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Box Board of Directors does not believe the changes to the Board proposed by Starboard are warranted or in the best interests of all stockholders. The Box Board has been consistently responsive to feedback from all of its stockholders, including suggestions from Starboard, and open-minded toward all value enhancing opportunities. Furthermore, Starboard’s statements do not accurately depict the progress Box has made,&#8221; the Board wrote in a statement this morning.</p>
<p>Box further points out that the company overhauled the Board last year with three new board members specifically receiving Starboard approval.</p>
<p>What is driving Starboard to take this action? Like any good activist investor it wants a higher stock price and is seeking more growth from Box. Activist investors often come in and try to extract value by brute force when they perceive the company is underperforming. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">end game, were they to be successful</a>, could involve removing Levie as CEO or more likely selling the company and grabbing its profit on the way out.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/embed/#?secret=kNGp8Qfbic" data-secret="kNGp8Qfbic" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Box asserted that “Starboard’s statements do not accurately depict the progress Box has made,” highlighting some of its recent financial performance, including “a $127 million increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2021.” The former private-market darling also argued that its fiscal 2021 “revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin [came to more than] 26%,” which beat its own target of 25% and was “nearly double” what it managed in its fiscal 2020.</p>
<p>This is a good time for a &#8220;<em>yes, but</em>&#8220;: Yes, but Box’s ability to improve its profitability does not change the fact that its growth rate has been in steady decline for years. And while a company’s growth rate can cover nearly any sin, slowing growth that has already slipped into the single digits doesn’t cut Box much slack. (For reference, in its most recent quarter, the fourth of its fiscal 2021, <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2021-Revenue-of-771-Million-Up-11-Percent-Year-Over-Year/default.aspx">Box grew just 8%</a> on a year-over-year basis.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the company did promise “accelerated growth and higher operating margins in the years ahead” in <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/02/box-inc-box-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">its most recent earnings call</a>, but the company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/"> recent $500 million investment from KKR</a> particularly irked Starboard, which asserts that it was akin to &#8220;buying the vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>“[Box] made several poor capital allocation decisions, including its recent entry into a financing transaction that we believe serves no business purpose and was done in the face of a potential election contest with Starboard at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s becoming a battle over more board seats. Box is putting up Levie, Verisign CFO Dana Evan and Peter Leav, CEO of McAfee and former CEO of BMC. Evan sits on the boards of Domo and Survey Monkey in addition to Box, while Leav previously served on the board of ProofPoint, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">acquired last month by Thoma Bravo</a> for over $12 billion.</p>
<p>While Starboard&#8217;s nominees come with impressive resumes, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that they mostly lack direct experience working with an enterprise SaaS company like Box. The folks on the slate include Deborah S. Conrad, former executive at Intel; Peter A. Feld, Starboard&#8217;s head of research; John R. McCormack, former CEO of WebSense and Xavier D. Williams, a director of American Virtual Cloud Technologies, a public company on $170 million run rate. Box made $771 million last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The vote will take place at the Box stockholder&#8217;s meeting, which has traditionally been held in late June or early July. To this point, the company has not put out the exact date publicly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houston-based startup Axiom Space and NASA unveiled more details Monday about the forthcoming Axiom Mission 1 (AX-1), the first fully private human mission to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The Axiom Mission 1 spaceflight mission will ferry four private astronauts to the International Space Station in January 2022. The eight-day mission will be launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida using a SpaceX Crew Dragon. While in space, the crew will be living and working in the U.S. segment of the ISS.</p>
<p>NASA will be paying Axiom $1.69 million for services associated with the mission, such as transporting supplies to the ISS, though that does not include other reimbursable agreements between the two entities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There’s a “high degree of confidence in the late January date” for the launch, Axiom CEO Michael Suffredini said.</p>
<p>Axiom in January released the identity of the crew members: Canadian investor Mark Pathy, investor Larry Connor and former Israeli pilot Eytan Stibbe. Leading the crew as mission commander is former NASA astronaut and Axiom Space VP Michael López-Alegría, who has four spaceflights under his belt.</p>
<p>Pathy, Connor and Stibbe will engage in research missions while onboard. Pathy will be collaborating with the Montreal Children’s Hospital and the Canadian Space Agency; Connor, the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic; and Stibbe will conduct scientific experiments coordinated by the Israel Space Agency at the Ministry of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>“Larry and Mark are very serious individuals who are dedicated to being the best they can be in the mold of a NASA astronaut and they&#8217;re not interested in being tourists,” López-Alegría said during the media briefing. “They want to do their part to improve humankind.”</p>
<p>To prepare for the mission, the four crew members will go on a “camping trip” in the Alaskan foothills for training in July, López-Alegría said. He will start full-time training around August, with Larry starting in September. The rest of the crew will start in October, with around two-thirds of their time dedicated to ISS-specific training and the rest dedicated to training with SpaceX. The staggered schedule is due to the differing responsibilities between the crew members while onboard. Axiom will be using the same contractor that NASA uses to train its astronauts.</p>
<p>While Suffredini declined to specify how much the private astronauts paid for their space on the flight, he said he “wouldn’t argue with” widely reported figures in the tens of millions. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/26/private-space-flight-axiom/">The Washington Post</a> in January reported that the ticket prices came in at $55 million each.</p>
<p>Prices may not always be so high, but Suffredini said that the industry is likely at least a decade away from serious price drops that might make space travel feasible for the average space-goer.</p>
<p>Axiom intends to offer astronaut flights &#8212; both private and national &#8212; to the International Space Station and eventually its own privately funded space station. While Axiom has &#8220;things lined up&#8221; for AX-2, AX-3 and AX-4, &#8220;like everyone we have to compete for the opportunity,&#8221; Suffredini said. The number of missions to the ISS is limited because there are only two docking ports on the ISS, Station deputy manager Dana Weigel added. That suggests that additional stations will be necessary to meet the burgeoning demand for both commercial and scientific space missions.</p>

<p>Phil McAlister, NASA’s director of commercial spaceflight development, said that recent announcements on commercial spaceflights from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/you-can-bid-for-a-seat-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-on-july-20/">Blue Origin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/virgin-galactic-debuts-its-first-third-generation-spaceship-vss-imagine/">Virgin Galactic</a> in addition to the Axiom mission have heralded “a renaissance in U.S. human spaceflight.”</p>
<p>“A lot of times history can feel incremental when you&#8217;re in it, but I really feel like we are in it this year. This is a real inflection point with human spaceflight,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With Procore's range feeling bullish thus far and Kaltura back in the mix, it's hard to not be at least modestly bullish on today's IPO market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, construction tech unicorn Procore Technologies <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001611052/000119312521155561/d564161ds1a.htm">set a price range</a> for its impending public offering. The news comes after the company initially filed to go public in February of 2020, a move delayed by the pandemic. As TechCrunch reporter Mary Ann Azevedo reported at the time, the hiatus came <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/procore-reportedly-pulls-ipo-raises-150m-at-5b-valuation-instead/">with a large check</a> to see the company through its public-offering pause.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Procore filed again for a public offering, but its second shot ran into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">a cooling IPO market</a>. The company filed another S-1/A in April, and then another in early May. Today&#8217;s filing is the first that sets a price for the Carpinteria, California-based software upstart.</p>

<hr />
<p>Procore&#8217;s filing sets a price range of $60 to $65 per share for its equity.</p>
<p>But Procore is not the only company that filed and later put on hold an IPO to get back to work on floating. Kaltura, a software company focused on video distribution, also recently got its IPO back on track. Are we seeing a reacceleration of the IPO market? Perhaps.</p>

<h2>Procore&#8217;s IPO price range</h2>
<p>While private Procore raised well over a half-billion dollars from a host of investors, including ICONIQ, Dragoneer, Tiger Global and D1 Capital Partners, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/procore-technologies/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, it most recently raised $150 million last year after its IPO delay at a valuation of just over $5 billion calculated on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001611052/000119312521155561/d564161ds1a.htm">latest S-1/A filing</a>, Procore will sell 9,470,000 shares in its IPO, providing it with a post-IPO share count of 128,134,774. At $60 per share, the company&#8217;s simple valuation comes to $7.69 billion. At $65 per share, that figure rises to $8.33 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you want a shot to compete against some of the most innovative early-stage startups in the world, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before the application window closes on <strong>May 13 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. Still need a nudge? Keep reading.</p>
<p>Founders from these three startups took a chance, gave it their all and ended up winning the championship — and $100,000 — in their respective years: <a href="https://www.canix.com/">Canix</a> (2020), <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> (2019) and <a href="https://www.forethought.ai/">Forethought</a> (2018). Oh, and Forethought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/forethought-snares-9m-series-a-in-wake-of-battlefield-win/">scored a $9 million Series A investment</a> after it won. Food for thought.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch vets every application and will select roughly 25 startups to compete. It costs nothing to apply or compete — no fees, no equity slice. Participants receive weeks of (free!) training with the TC Battlefield team to make sure they’re primed and ready to face a panel of expert VC judges.</p>
<p>Speaking of judges — you know, the peeps you need to impress, the folks who determine the winner? Yeah, them. We recently announced the first of our Startup Battlefield judges — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/gv-partner-terri-burns-is-joining-us-to-judge-the-startup-battlefield/">Terri Burns</a>, a partner at GV (formerly known as Google Ventures). We’re thrilled to have her on board.</p>

<p>Each startup team gets six minutes to pitch and present their demo — and then they’ll answer probing questions from the judges. Teams that move on to the final round do it all over again in front of a new panel of experts&#8230; one last major push — pitch, demo, Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>One team will emerge as the Startup Battlefield 2021 champion, win the Disrupt Cup and take home a whopping $100,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>Beyond the actual competition, all Battlefield competitors receive a VIP experience — free demo space in the virtual Startup Alley, a free membership to Extra Crunch, complimentary tickets to future TC events and a private reception with members of the Startup Battlefield alumni community.</p>
<p>Don’t forget — everyone wants to learn more about the Battlefield contenders. Whether or not you win the whole shooting match, you’ll receive plenty of invaluable exposure to global investors, media outlets and potential customers.</p>
<p>Not a bad return for a small investment of your time and energy, amirite? Want a few more details about how Startup Battlefield works? You’ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/applications-for-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021-are-now-open/">find them here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford confirmed Monday that its all-electric pickup truck will be named the F-150 Lightning, resurrecting a name that once donned the SVT F-150 in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t said much about the powertrain, range or other specs. However, Ford President and CEO Jim Farley provided new details about the electric pickup that is coming to market next year. Most notably, it seems that the battery on the Ford F-150 Lightning will have the ability to power a home during an outage. Ford has touted the capability of its Hybrid F-150 to power a job site or tools, but this is the first time the company has said one of its vehicles could act as a backup generator to a home.</p>
<p>Farley also said the electric truck will have the capability to handle over-the-air software updates and will be quicker than the original F-150 Lightning performance truck, the V8-powered truck that debuted in 1993.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Every so often, a new vehicle comes along that disrupts the status quo and changes the game … Model T, Mustang, Prius, Model 3. Now comes the F-150 Lightning,&#8221; Farley said in a statement. &#8220;America&#8217;s favorite vehicle for nearly half a century is going digital and fully electric. F-150 Lightning can power your home during an outage; it&#8217;s even quicker than the original F-150 Lightning performance truck; and it will constantly improve through over-the-air updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Production of the electric pickup truck is expected to begin next spring at the company&#8217;s Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Ford F-150 Lightning will be revealed via a livestream May 19 at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. </span></p>
<p>The Ford F-150 Lightning follows the introduction of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E. The E-Transit, a configurable all-electric cargo van focused on commercial customers, is also part of the automaker&#8217;s $11.5 billion investment in electrification.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">expanded partnership with Facebook</a>, Spotify this morning <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-10/3-new-ways-to-share-the-music-and-podcasts-you-love-on-social/">announced</a> new sharing features that broaden the way Spotify content, including both music and podcasts, can be shared across social media. As part of this, Spotify&#8217;s Canvas feature, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/get-ready-to-see-spotifys-looping-videos-on-instagram/">adds a looping, visual art experience to songs</a>, is being improved. Spotify will also now allow users to share a timestamped link to a podcast, which allows users to tune into a particular moment of the podcast episode.</p>
<p>Previously, if you wanted to share a podcast episode, you could only post the link to the entire episode. But many times, people want to comment on or discuss a particular part of an episode. Now, they&#8217;ll be able to do so by using the &#8220;switch to share&#8221; feature at the current playtime, after tapping the &#8220;share&#8221; button while listening to the show.</p>
<p>This is a toggle switch that lets you share from the timestamp where you&#8217;ve paused the show. After turning this on, you&#8217;re able to choose where you want to share to &#8212; like Instagram, Facebook (Stories or Feed), Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, SMS and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2149798" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149798" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2149798 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="486" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png 923w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sharing-Updates-Image2.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149798" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The feature also could potentially be used for podcast marketing purposes. Typically, creators post an interesting clip from their latest episode that includes a link to the episode. But Spotify&#8217;s new feature could entice someone to tune in at a particular part, then continue listening. They may even choose to follow the podcast after doing so, as they&#8217;ll have already found themselves in the Spotify app. While it may not replace other marketing &#8212; not everyone uses Spotify, after all &#8212; it could serve as a handy supplement to the creator&#8217;s existing promotional activity.</p>
<p>The update to Spotify&#8217;s Canvas, meanwhile, is a smaller improvement. Now, users are able to preview their social share across Instagram Stories and now Snapchat, to see how it will appear. Before today, Canvas art could only be shared to Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>Spotify notes that social sharing features had become a more important aspect of using its service <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-08-13/3-ways-to-feel-close-to-your-favorite-artists-while-social-distancing/">during the pandemic</a>, as in-person concerts and fan events had been shut down. Artists and creators still want to engage with their fans, but have had to do so remotely and digitally. And fans want to support their favorites by posting their content to social networks where others can discover them, too.</p>

<p>The new sharing features are a part of Spotify&#8217;s larger investment in expanded social media distribution, which recently led to its partnership with Facebook on something<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/"> the social network called &#8220;Project Boombox.</a>&#8221; Facebook in April introduced a new miniplayer that streams Spotify&#8217;s music and podcasts from the Facebook app. That way, users can listen while they scroll, with Spotify playing in the background. But Spotify&#8217;s deal with Facebook doesn&#8217;t limit it from making it easier to share to other platforms, as well, as these new features indicate.</p>
<p>Spotify says the new features are rolling out now to global users on both iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karapenn11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara Penn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the mother of four daughters and owner of Mission Spark, a management and strategy consulting company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, thanks to Hustle Fund, she is also an angel investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hustle Fund is coming out of stealth today with </span><a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/angelsquad"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel Squad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new initiative aimed at making angel investing more accessible to more people, like Colorado-based Penn.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that in order to increase diversity in the startup ecosystem, one thing that we must do is increase diversity &#8212; whether it be in regard to gender, race or geography &#8212; amongst angel investors,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Hustle Fund co-founder and general partner Elizabeth Yin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via Angel Squad, Hustle Fund specifically aims to build an inclusive investor community, make minimum check sizes low and accessible (think as little as $1,000), provide “angel education” and give investors a way to invest alongside Hustle Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s been this misnomer, or at least I had this incorrect assumption that in order to become an angel investor, you have to be super rich and write $25,000 checks,” Yin told TechCrunch. “But the reality is actually in Silicon Valley, there are all these people running around investing $1,000 checks&#8230;and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a lot more accessible than most people might think. And, part of the value of having this group is then we can accumulate a bunch of smaller checks to then write one larger check for a company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Penn has invested in five startups across a range of sectors, including real estate, food, apparel and finance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She describes herself as “a complete novice&#8221; in angel investing, and so far, she’s loving the experience.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love Hustle Fund&#8217;s perspective that great hustlers can look like anyone and come from anywhere,” Penn told TechCrunch. “I&#8217;ve enjoyed being in a supportive community with differing levels of expertise, but where every question is welcomed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience is also broadening her exposure to technology and AI, the collection and use of data and the creation of new marketplaces in ways she never would have been exposed to before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As someone whose own company focuses exclusively on strategy in social impact organizations, I am also looking for how founders identify and bring to market creative solutions to complex problems, as well as exposure to a network of innovative people looking to solve hard issues in smart ways,&#8221; Penn said. &#8220;This exposure is helping me begin to think about applications of these approaches to difficult social problems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hustle Fund is a venture firm founded by Elizabeth Yin and Eric Bahn, two former 500 Startups partners, with the goal of investing in pre-seed software startups. The firm has traditionally operated by investing $25,000 in a company, usually with a minimum-viable product, and then works with the team to help them grow. It does around 50 investments per year, </span><a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/faq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to its website.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hustle-fund-a-pre-seed-firm-closes-30m-for-a-new-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed on $33.6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a new fund.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Krukx0dIfn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hustle-fund-a-pre-seed-firm-closes-30m-for-a-new-fund/">Hustle Fund, a pre-seed firm, closes $30M for a new fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hustle Fund, a pre-seed firm, closes $30M for a new fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hustle-fund-a-pre-seed-firm-closes-30m-for-a-new-fund/embed/#?secret=Krukx0dIfn" data-secret="Krukx0dIfn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things most important to us is this bigger mission of wanting to change the way the startup ecosystem is,” Yin said. “I noticed both as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an entrepreneur and while running an accelerator, if you have a certain resume, went to certain schools, or were a certain race or gender, you have advantages in starting a company and getting funding. For many people, if you don’t tick those boxes, it can be very challenging. That’s why we’re investing in a lot of founders from all walks of life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hustle Fund Venture Partner Brian Nichols had started a syndicate of Lyft alumni on AngelList. After doing a few deals, he opened the syndicate to people outside of AngelList.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I found there was a wide range of people looking to diversify into private markets, from all over the world with all types of backgrounds,” he said. “Hustle Fund and I had similar taste in companies I was investing in and I built a relationship with them in co-investments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, he’s helping run the fund’s Angel Squad initiative. So far, it has had two cohorts with more than 150 investors total, and, true to the fund’s mission, those investors have been more diverse than typical angel syndicates: 46% of the members are female, 9% are underrepresented minorities and 32% are people who work outside of tech with professional roles such as lawyers, doctors and artists. Just one-third are based in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every week, Angel Squad hosts an event that ranges from networking to a peek behind the curtain at opportunities in which Hustle Fund is considering investing to talking through why or why not to take a meeting with a founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine starting from zero, and if you could skip a bunch of steps and have Elizabeth (Yin) tell you how to do this before you lose a bunch of money in the process of evaluating a startup,” Nichols told TechCrunch. “Angel Squad is exactly what I wish had existed three or four years ago when I became interested in investing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley, Yin acknowledges, can be intimidating, but the reality is that no one is an expert in everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re trying to cultivate an environment where people are very kind &#8212; we have a &#8216;no asshole&#8217; rule, and that is a safe space where people can learn and feel like they can ask questions, and not have to know everything about angel investing. The reality is most people don&#8217;t. And we want to bring new people into this system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides not being an a-hole, other criteria in becoming a Squad Member includes being able to add value and being an accredited investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With rounds as competitive as they are today, we are looking for people who want to be actively supportive of the portfolio companies we’re investing in,” Nichols said. “Every person who wants to join the program is interviewed by someone from our team, who asks questions such as ‘What can you help a founder with?’ We are not looking for passive capital. That’s not super helpful at this point in the ecosystem.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend was all about memecoins. And I am sorry about that. But Equity doesn&#8217;t run the world, sadly, it merely notes what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogecoin dropped during Elon Musk&#8217;s SNL appearance. Which was somewhat ironic. Also there&#8217;s another memecoin that is skyrocketing.</li>
<li>Palantir, DoorDash, Airbnb and Alibaba will report earnings this week, amongst others.</li>
<li>Clubhouse is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">finally coming to Android</a>. In the United States. By invite. So, if that&#8217;s you, congrats, welcome to the app.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/top-us-fuel-pipeline-operator-pushes-recover-cyberattack-2021-05-09/">major cyberattack</a> and ransom situation in the United States is a data point, yet again, that we&#8217;re woefully unprepared for cyber risk.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/">StuDocu raised $50 million</a> which was cool, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/telkomsel-invests-an-additional-300-million-in-gojek/">Gojek raised another $300 million</a>, which was the very opposite of surprising.</li>
<li>This week&#8217;s Extra Crunch Live is going to be really good. I will see you there!</li>
</ul>
<p>It is going to be a busy week! Already since we recorded this show there&#8217;s more drama from Box, and more. Strap in!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It is clear that Black, women, Latinx and LGBTQ+ startup founders face an uphill battle when it comes to getting a share of the VC investment pie in Silicon Valley. Perhaps that&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.sixty8.capital/">Sixty8 Capital</a>, a firm based in Indianapolis, Indiana, smack dab in the middle of the country, has chosen to launch a new $20 million fund aimed at providing early-stage funding for underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>The fund&#8217;s investors include The Indiana Next Level Fund, 50 South Capital, Bank of America, Eli Lilly and Company, First Internet Bank and the Central Indiana Community Foundation. It&#8217;s working with another Indy-based VC firm, <a href="https://www.allosventures.com/">Allos Ventures</a>, and Paul Ehlinger from Allos will be a venture partner at Sixty8.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this fund, what we&#8217;ll get to do is really start to empower people of color, women and other diverse communities by putting capital directly into their hands. Being able to invest directly into companies that are building amazing solutions that just so happen to be founded by diverse people. So that is why we launched Sixty8. I think there&#8217;s a unique opportunity we can address, and I&#8217;m really excited to have an impact both in our community in Indiana, but also around the Midwest and parts of the South as well,&#8221; Kelli Jones, managing partner at the firm, explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones told me that she grew up in Indianapolis, and after moving to New York and later LA to work at the intersection of music, tech and entertainment, she returned to Indy in 2016 to begin helping Black people in the community where she grew up get trained to get decent jobs both in and out of tech. That led to the development of a startup incubator focused on Black founders and later a pitch competition.</p>
<p>She said at that point, it was clear the founders she was working with needed access to capital to have a chance to grow the businesses they were starting as part of the incubator and pitch competition, and the idea of an early-stage fund began to take shape. She said that Indiana is known for B2B SaaS and she wanted to tap into that energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we&#8217;re known as B2B SaaS and we&#8217;ve had some amazing exits here with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">ExactTarget and Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/angi/">Angie&#8217;s List</a> and <a href="https://www.genesys.com/en-gb/company/newsroom/announcements/genesys-to-acquire-interactive-intelligence2">Interactive Intelligence and Genesys</a>, and so we&#8217;ve had a lot of really amazing things happening in the tech realm locally, but there&#8217;s not a lot of conversations being had around diversity and seeing more people of color and women and LGBTQ founders,&#8221; Jones told me.</p>

<p>The plan is to provide seed, pre-seed and maybe piggyback on an occasional A round with investments that range between $250,000 and $500,000 per company. She says that there is a ready pipeline from her other ventures, including the incubator and pitch competitions, and she is also plugged into the community where there is lots of startup energy.</p>
<p>She says that they wanted to set up a fund not only to address issues of diversity and having diverse people making decisions on investments, but also based on a strategy where the firm was able to invest in companies that may not always be perceived as typical venture-backed business targets.</p>

<p>The first investment is with a B2B SaaS company called <a href="https://www.qualifi.hr/">Qualifi</a>, which uses AI to help companies with high-volume hiring loads get through the qualification round much faster, taking from seven to 10 days down to three or less, Jones told me.</p>
<p>The name of the firm hails back to 1968, a time in history when there was a lot of protest bubbling up around the country and calls for more equality for people of color, women and Gay rights. Jones says they had a different name when the firm first launched in 2019, but this seemed so much more appropriate for a company focused on empowering diverse groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re still marching and trying to survive the same way we were in 1968 during the Civil Rights [movement] where we lost big leaders, and where the fire in everyone was just so big. We were fighting for women&#8217;s rights and Latino rights and Black rights and there was just so much happening, and it seems like in 2021 like we really still are in that same space,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thesnackapp.com/">Snack</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/snack-where-tiktok-meets-dating-gets-3-5-million-in-funding/">video-first mobile dating app</a> designed with a younger generation in mind, is opening itself up to Gen Z investors. The startup today announced the launch of its own <a href="https://angel.co/i/0N91X">Gen Z Syndicate</a> on AngelList, which will allow Gen Z community members, influencers, creators and others to participate in the company&#8217;s upcoming $2 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_agreement_for_future_equity">SAFE</a>, alongside other funds and angel investors.</p>
<p>The company in February <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/snack-where-tiktok-meets-dating-gets-3-5-million-in-funding/">announced $3.5 million</a> in seed funding for its modern, TikTok-style dating app, where users post videos to a feed which others then like in order to be matched. Snack believes videos allow users to better showcase their interests and lifestyle, as well as show off their personalities in ways static photos cannot. When two people like each other&#8217;s videos, they&#8217;re invited to direct message one another.</p>
<p>The experience is very much like engaging with a TikTok that&#8217;s built for dating. In fact, Snack is one of the first apps that will be adopting<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/tiktok-expands-integrations-with-third-party-apps-for-logins-sharing-sounds-and-more/"> TikTok&#8217;s new Login SDK for third-party apps,</a> which gives Snack&#8217;s users the ability to reshare their TikTok videos to their dating profiles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Snack&#8217;s founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlykaplan">Kim Kaplan</a>, has a history in the dating app market. She previously led product, marketing and revenue at Plenty of Fish, which later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/14/match-group-buys-plentyoffish-for-575m-to-bag-more-singles/">sold to Match Group for $575 million</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about Plenty of Fish, we really launched off of Google SEO,&#8221; Kaplan explains. &#8220;Then you had Zoosk and Badoo, which launched off of Facebook &#8212; when it was a really early platform and it was easy to get traffic from it. Then you had Tinder and Bumble, which launched off of mobile-first. They were the first apps to come out and design and build with mobile in mind versus the rest of us which were desktop, trying to cram everything into a mobile phone,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok&#8217;s new developer tools allow apps to offer &#8216;Login with TikTok,&#8217; sound sharing, and more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/tiktok-expands-integrations-with-third-party-apps-for-logins-sharing-sounds-and-more/embed/#?secret=wakqfhqLYX" data-secret="wakqfhqLYX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;And I fundamentally believe now that the right opportunity is the distribution on TikTok, as well as influencers. I think that combination of TikTok being the new distribution channel is going to be a massive opportunity &#8212; and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to leverage,&#8221; Kaplan says.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Snack is likely to grow beyond the young, Gen Z demographic. Already, the app is attracting users in their 20s and early 30s, thanks to its TikTok ties. But as TikTok naturally ages up, so will Snack.</p>
<p>Snack began fundraising in September of last year, then hired the team, built the app and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/snack-where-tiktok-meets-dating-gets-3-5-million-in-funding/">launched</a> in late February.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149736" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149736" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2149736" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149736" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snack</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re only about eight weeks into this right now, but we&#8217;re seeing a lot of excitement, a lot of user growth,&#8221; Kaplan says. &#8220;Because of that excitement that&#8217;s kind of building, people &#8212; a lot of really interesting people &#8212; came to the table and said they wanted to invest. But I didn&#8217;t have any room left in the previous rounds, so I decided to open up a SAFE.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of that SAFE, Snack is carving out a certain amount to create its own syndicate. That way, Kaplan notes, &#8220;we don&#8217;t have any carry fees with another person, and [we&#8217;re] opening it up to Gen Z investors that want to participate in the round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Originally, the carve-out began at $100,000 but there is already enough interest that Kaplan says she expects it to go higher &#8212; perhaps a couple hundred thousand or larger, based on demand.</p>
<p>Among the Gen Z investors are VCs that have heard about Snack, but whose fund primarily invests at a later stage. Others are just people the company has been working with and getting advice from while building out the the app.</p>

<p>For example, Kaplan had reach out to the <a href="https://genzmafia.com/">Gen Z Mafia</a>, a group of technologists working to make venture capital and startups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/style/gen-z-tech-mafia.html">more inclusive</a>, to help consult on Snack. The group&#8217;s leaders, <a href="https://twitter.com/emmalsalinas?lang=en">Emma Salinas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhuebecker/">Nicholas Huebecker</a>, are credited with helping Kaplan come up with Snack&#8217;s pretzel logo and its brand name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Video-first dating allows a unique sense of expression that you can&#8217;t portray with a few well-crafted words and filtered pictures,&#8221; said Huebekcer, of his interest in Snack. “For a mobile-first generation, this new form of authenticity will grow to be necessary. Snack allows users to express their real selves just like they do on TikTok, Snapchat, and other platforms we love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Technology investor and founder at The Innovation Armory, Samuel Natbony, is also joining the SAFE, alongside Monique Woodard (Cake Ventures), Backbone Angels, SHAKTI, Christian Winklund (previously CEO of dating app Skout <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160627006328/en/MeetMe-to-Acquire-Skout">which sold to Meet Group</a>), Andrew Wilkinson and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Gen Z to have a seat at the table and help shape what Snack becomes,&#8221; says Kaplan. &#8220;I want them to have that voice and participate, and be a champion for Snack,&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s make it clear from the outset that this story is about an expense management SaaS business called <strong>Expensify</strong>. As you&#8217;d expect, yes, this is about the expense management market and how Expensify has grown, its technology and all of that. Normally, that would make us change the channel. But this is also a story about pirates; peer-to-peer hackers who asked, &#8220;Why not work from Thailand and dozens of countries across the globe?&#8221; and actually did it using P2P hacker culture as a model for consensus-driven decision-making — all with pre-Uber Travis Kalanick in a guest-starring role.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, this is a story about just not giving a damn about what anyone goddamn thinks, an approach to life and business that led to more than $100 million in annual revenue, and an IPO incoming on what looks to be a very quick timetable. Prodigious revenues, 10 million users and only 130 employees running the whole shebang — that&#8217;s a hell of an achievement in only 13 years.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going a bit &#8220;WTF,&#8221; well, we’d concur. Expensify is as contradictory as they come in the enterprise world. It’s managed to take what might well be the most boring part of the corporate business stack and turn it into something special. It doesn’t borrow its culture from other startups, it built its own tech stack from the ground up, and even hires in a completely radical way. Oh, and no one really has job titles either, because why the hell bother with hierarchy anyway? They’re pirates after all.</p>
<p>If expense management is about avoiding corporate plunder, then letting the pirates and hackers run the ship is probably the best approach. And now, Expensify is plundering the corporate spend world one travel ticket and business meal at a time just as the world is rebuilding in the wake of COVID-19.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s natural to think an expense report management business would play it by the book. But one look at Expensify is enough to tell you that this is a company that never even looked for the book.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Individuality often has no place in the enterprise software space. In a market where a single contract can easily run into the millions, homogeneity is the herald of reliability and serves to reassure buyers of the worth of their potential purchase.</p>
<p>So it’s natural to think a company in the expense report management business would keep it simple and play it by the book. But one look at Expensify is enough to tell you that this is a company that never even looked for the book.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Expensify&#8217;s origin story is one of a scrappy group of developers who turned travel into a catalyst for ideas and stuck together through highs and lows, ending up building one of the most unexpectedly original companies in enterprise software today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Right from its famous &#8220;workcations,&#8221; to its management structure and its decision-making policies, Expensify has it in its DNA to eschew so-called best practices for its own ideas — a philosophy rooted in its founder and early team’s P2P hacker background and do-it-yourself attitude. As a result, Expensify is atypical of startups in many ways, inside and out.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO David Barrett made it clear his company was different in our first call itself: &#8220;We hire in a super different way. We have a very unusual internal management structure. Our business model itself is very unusual. We don’t have any salespeople, for example. We’re an incredibly small company. We focus on the employees over the bosses. Our technology stack is completely different. Our approach toward product design is very different.&#8221;</p>
<p>That description would make some people call Expensify weird even by startup standards, but this essential difference has set it apart in a space dominated by giants such as <a href="https://www.concur.com/">SAP Concur</a> and Coupa. And that’s ultimately been to its benefit: Expensify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue</a> in 2020, with hefty 25% EBITDA margins to boot. There were also rumors of the company planning to go public during our interviews for this EC-1, but they stopped speaking to us in March, and now we know why: <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">Expensify confidentially filed to go public on May 3</a>.</p>
<p>Expensify&#8217;s origin story is one of a scrappy group of developers who turned travel into a catalyst for ideas and stuck together through highs and lows, ending up building one of the most unexpectedly original companies in enterprise software today.</p>
<h2>When David met Travis …</h2>
<p>To truly understand Expensify, you first need to take a close look at a unique, short-lived, P2P file-sharing company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Swoosh">Red Swoosh</a>, which was Travis Kalanick&#8217;s startup before he founded Uber. Framed by Kalanick as his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QrX5jsiico"> &#8220;revenge business&#8221;</a> after his previous P2P startup<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scour_Inc."> Scour</a> was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/scour-sued-over-downloaded-movies/">sued</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/12/scour-going-going-gone/">into oblivion</a> for copyright infringement, Red Swoosh would be the precursor for Expensify&#8217;s future culture and ethos. In fact, many of Expensify’s initial team actually met at Red Swoosh, which was eventually acquired by Akamai Technologies in 2007 for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/04/12/payday-for-red-swoosh-15-million-from-akamai/"> $18.7 million</a>.</p>
<p>Barrett, a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-barrett">self-proclaimed alpha geek</a> and lifelong software engineer, was actually Red Swoosh&#8217;s last engineering manager, hired after the failure of his first project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122173504/http://www.iglance.com/faq.html">iGlance.com</a>, a P2P push-to-talk program that couldn&#8217;t compete against Skype. &#8220;While I was licking my wounds from that experience, I was approached by Travis Kalanick who was running a startup called Red Swoosh,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.sramanamitra.com/2014/08/24/building-a-profitable-steady-growth-subscription-business-expensify-ceo-david-barrett-part-1/">recalled</a> in an interview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bankwithfair.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a multilingual digital bank and financial services platform, is launching to the public after raising $20 million in 40 days earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Khalid Parekh raised the capital primarily from the very demographic that Houston-based Fair aims to serve: from a group consisting of a number of immigrants, many of whom were first-time investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was not a single check from a VC or bank or from a family office,” Parekh told TechCrunch. “Ninety percent of our investors are minorities or are immigrants like myself that believed in the concept of Fair.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could say that it’s also fitting that Fair’s headquarters are in Houston, which at the time of the last census was the most ethnically diverse city in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parekh is not your traditional fintech founder. He doesn’t have banking or financial services experience, although he <em>does</em> have experience founding and running a successful company: AMSYS Group, which is valued at nearly $350 million. His mission with Fair is largely personal. Upon arriving in the U.S. from India with just $100 in his pocket 22 years ago, he struggled to not only get a loan but also to open a bank account. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149136" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149136" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2149136" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png 1100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Khalid-Parekh_Fair-Fintech_May-2020.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149136" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Founder and CEO Khalid Parekh / Fair</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was an engineer by background, but was very confused with the American banking system. There is not a lot of help for immigrants who don’t understand it well,” Parekh recalls. “My biggest challenge was sending money back home. There was just a lack of welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, he used his own cash to build out the technology behind Fair, which is designed to be an option to those who are new to the country, have no credit or need access to interest-free loans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair operates with Coastal Community Bank as its sponsor bank.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Parekh’s goal with Fair is to provide “ethical, transparent banking” – to anyone – via a membership model that eliminates all banking fees. Members can pay a one-time membership fee of $99 (paid in full or in installments) to have access to all of Fair’s online banking and financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another challenge that I saw is that there were hardly any options for insurance and retirement services for immigrants and low-income people,” Parekh said. “All big institutions catered to people with a lot of money. But we want to create an institution where we are fair to everybody, regardless of religion, race, color, net worth or how much is in their bank account. We want everyone to be treated the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, the nation has seen a surge of neobanks emerge aimed at specific demographics, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/first-boulevard-raises-5m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-black-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/softbank-bets-big-on-a-digital-ellis-island/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome Technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also aimed at serving the immigrant population. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair aims to differentiate itself, according to Parekh, by offering interest-free lending, as well as the ability to invest, get insurance and plan for retirement in one platform that is available in English, Arabic and Spanish (with more languages to come). Ultimately, his goal in Fair is to help address</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the “longstanding racial income inequalities and widening wealth disparities in the U.S.” He won’t get a salary for his role as CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Fair’s features are free international transfer, early access to paycheck funds, “instant, interest-free” microloans &#8212; essentially buy now, pay later at the register &#8212; an annual dividend account, debit card accounts for kids and interest-free loans for home, auto and business that are equity-based. Those equity-based loans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are <a href="https://www.guidanceresidential.com/resources/faith-based-financing/what-is-an-islamic-mortgage-and-how-does-it-work/">Sharia compliant</a>, meaning that it’s not kosher to take interest. They also comply </span><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4108763/jewish/Moneylending-and-Jewish-Law.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Jewish law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, if a member wants to buy a home, they can put 20% down, and Fair will provide 80% via an LLC, of which the member and bank will be co-owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The members will have the option of buying out our shares on whatever schedule they wish,” Parekh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with Avibra, Fair is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering free supplemental life, accident medical and AD&amp;D insurance to all members as part of its banking services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair aims to practice socially responsible investing (SRI), an approach to investing</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that reduces exposure to companies that are deemed to have a negative</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">social impact. The fintech also practices ESG investing, which measures the sustainability of an investment</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and its overall impact in three specific categories: environmental, social and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate governance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And, it’s also working with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations High Commissioner for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Refugees and World Relief, and will donate 2.5% of profits to refugee</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">missions globally, as well as racial economic empowerment initiatives.</span></p>
<p>Among Fair&#8217;s advisors are <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manolo Sánchez, a director at Fannie Mae and Stewart Information Systems and former chair &amp; CEO of BBVA Compass, and Samuel Golden, managing director at management consulting firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal and founder of A&amp;M’s Financial Industry practice.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three years after its inception, crypto financial service provider Babel Finance is racking up fundings and partnerships from major institutional investors. The startup said Monday that it has closed a $40 million Series A round, with lead investors including Zoo Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Dragonfly Capital, Bertelsmann and its Asian fund BAI Capital, and Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>For years, traditional investors were reluctant to join the cryptocurrency fray. But in 2020, Babel noticed that many institutions and high net worth individuals began to consider crypto assets as an investment class.</p>
<p>Babel, with offices in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore, wanted to capture the window of opportunity and be one of the earliest to help allocate crypto assets in investors&#8217; portfolios. But first, it needed to win investors&#8217; trust. One solution is to have reputable private equity and venture capital firms on its cap table.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more of a brand boost so we can attract more institutions and build up credibility,&#8221; Yulong Liu, Babel&#8217;s head of global partnerships, said of the financing which is a strategic round as Babel had<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;reached profitability&#8221; and &#8220;wasn&#8217;t actively looking for funding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>To vie for institutional customers and wealthy individuals, Babel plans to spend its fresh proceeds on product development, compliance and talent acquisition, seeking especially banking professionals and lawyers to work on regulatory requirements. It currently has a headcount of 55 employees.</p>
<p>Mainstream investors are jumping into the crypto scene partly because many see bitcoin as a way to hedge against &#8220;solvency and credibility risks&#8221; amid global economic uncertainties caused by Covid-19, said Liu. &#8220;Bitcoin is not something controlled by the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other trigger, Liu explained, was what shock the industry in February: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Elon Musk bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin</a> and declared Tesla would begin accepting the digital token as payments. That sparked a massive rally around bitcoin, sending its price to over $40,000.</p>
<p>Babel&#8217;s evolution has been in line with the trajectory of the industry. In its early days, the startup was a &#8220;crypto-native&#8221; company offering deposit and loan products to crypto miners and traders. These days, it also runs a suite of asset management products and services tailored to enterprise clients around the world. It&#8217;s applying for relevant financial licenses in North America and Asia.</p>
<p>As of February, Babel&#8217;s crypto lending business had reached an outstanding balance of $2 billion in equivalent cryptocurrency, the firm says. It has served more than 500 institutional clients and sees about $8 billion in direct trading volume each month. 80% of its revenues are currently derived from institutions.
