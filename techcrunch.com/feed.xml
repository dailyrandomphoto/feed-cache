										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethena co-founders Roxanne Petraeus and Anne Solmssen began their company with a clear goal: There needs to be a more modern, and effective, way to deploy anti-harassment training to employees. Ethena’s solution is to send employees bite-sized monthly “nudges” or pings with five-minute lessons, replacing the usual one-hour annual workshop with more flexible learning.</p>
<p>The startup raised $2 million off of that vision in June, and today has announced it has raised follow-on funding with the same exact amount, led by GSV. The startup currently has $5 million in venture capital, with investors including Homebrew, Neo and Village Global.</p>
<p>The follow-on capital comes right after Ethena has had some solid growth itself. The startup closed a couple major contracts with companies including Netflix, Zoom and Zendesk, and tells TechCrunch that more than 20,000 active employees complete its monthly training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solid growth and new cash is where the story could stop for now, but Petraeus tells TechCrunch that early momentum has also inspired a shift of sorts in what Ethena is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>“When we initially launched in Feb 2020, we thought that for our first year, we’d focus entirely on scaling companies because only startups would be interested in an innovative approach to compliance training,” she said. “What’s changed is we’ve learned that even large enterprises want a better approach, deeper impact and are willing to be innovative in a space historically dominated by lawyers and legacy e-learning providers.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MNRxxTMmbL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/">Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ethena raises $2 million in seed funding for smarter anti-harassment software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/ethena-raises-2-million-in-seed-funding-for-smarter-anti-harassment-software/embed/#?secret=MNRxxTMmbL" data-secret="MNRxxTMmbL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup is expanding its offering from anti-sexual harassment training to a wide variety of training courses focused on compliance, from financial compliance to code of conduct measures. The shift wasn’t because of a lack of interest from customers, the co-founder said, but instead demand from existing enterprise customers to offer more than just a singular topic.</p>
<p>“We think taking a specific sector-based approach can actually narrow the impact we’re having,” Petraeus said. “So we are trying to take a really inclusive approach,” from the start on what kind of topics should be treated as more than “just checking off a box.”</p>
<p>Petraeus, an army veteran, says that Ethena’s confidence in effectiveness and outcomes comes from military data on how adults learn.</p>
<p>“We know that traditional training just isn&#8217;t effective at behavior change, and there are some studies that show that it&#8217;s a pretty big backlash with increased unconscious bias after training versus before.” The startup differentiates from other micro-learning plays in its curriculum.</p>
<p>The curriculum is designed to be consumed over the course of a year instead of in an annual hour-long session. This tiny iteration is enough to give employees a repetitive way to understand the content. “We&#8217;re experimenting with things like graphic novels and podcasts to present training,” Petraeus said. “Just making sure whatever we’re doing yesterday is important tomorrow, because I think it’s important for us to be agile content creators.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1998055" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1998055" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1998055 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg?resize=1536,1027 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ethena-Training-Hub.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1998055" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Ethena</p></div></p>
<p>But Ethena’s biggest differentiation, Petraeus says, is its content. The pandemic has boasted a whole new sort of situation that employees need help, or proactive guidance, navigating. Petraeus says that Ethena’s monthly cadence gives it flexibility to adopt “modern” scenarios like Slack culture and Zoom etiquette. Ethena’s top performing training nudges in 2020 included lessons on online harassment prevention and mental health inclusivity.</p>
<p>The micro-learning approach has long been popular among edtech companies as a way to sneak or gamify small lessons into a workflow. So far, Ethena says over 90% of 150,000 in-app learner feedback notes are positive, saying the information is engaging and relevant. In Q4, Ethena saw learner growth of more than 250% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>GSV&#8217;s Deborah Quazzo, who led Ethena&#8217;s seed and now this follow-on financing, said that it&#8217;s &#8220;not a coincidence that they&#8217;ve picked up some of the best logos in the world at an early stage,&#8221; referring to Ethena&#8217;s big customers. Quazzo thinks the compliance market has had very limited innovation so far, even though it&#8217;s a massive opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are seeing such strong product market fit and customers are pulling them into areas of content extension, so having more room to run faster made total sense,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past two decades, there has been a complete revolution in software engineering driven by the rise of open source. Proprietary tools and libraries have widely given way to open-source libraries and editors shared on sites like GitHub. The result has been an explosion of new software engineers who can both learn from and contribute to the most cutting-edge software in the world.</p>
<p>That open model remains mostly a pipe dream in the silicon world. The pipeline and tooling for designing and engineering chips remains almost entirely proprietary, and while new architectures like <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> and new specifications like <a href="https://telecominfraproject.com/openran/">OpenRAN</a> have made some headway in recent years, the industry is still almost hermetically sealed to open innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://chipsalliance.org">CHIPS Alliance</a> was started in March 2019 with the mission to open that ecosystem up and encourage the development of open-source practices throughout the hardware silicon world. It’s hosted as a member of the Linux Foundation, and shares a similar ethos of using openness to spur further innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Alliance announced today that it has hired Rob Mains as its new executive director. Mains joined the organization last month as general manager, and previously, had a multi-decade career across the silicon industry at companies like Qualcomm, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and IBM.</p>
<p>Mains sees those experiences as being formative for understanding the current ecosystem, but understands that the silicon world has to change. “Obviously, it’s a very different mindset from silicon companies have had in the past,” Mains said. CHIPS Alliance is “creating a platform that different companies and members can contribute to … and bridge us to the next stage of innovation.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109059" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109059" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2109059" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg 2039w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rob-Mains-headshot.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109059" class="wp-caption-text">New CHIPS Alliance executive director Rob Mains. Photo via CHIPS Alliance.</p></div></p>
<p>Currently, the organization has more than two dozen corporate and university members, including Intel, Google, Alibaba and RISC-V darling SiFive.</p>
<p>Compared to the RISC-V Foundation and other orgs focused on specific open-source technologies, Mains sees CHIPS Alliance trying to create a more open ecosystem holistically. “There are a number of different areas where we can promote standards and examples,” he said, pointing to examples like bus protocols and interfaces between chiplets. CHIPS Alliance hosts the <a href="https://github.com/chipsalliance/omnixtend">OpenXtend protocol</a> first developed at Western Digital, which is designed to provide a consistent interface between processor caches and memory controllers, and it is <a href="https://chipsalliance.org/announcement/2020/07/16/aib-2-0-draft-specification/">also backing the Advanced Interface Bus (AIB) standard</a> first developed at Intel to connect multiple semiconductor dies together.</p>
<p>Mains has a particular background in electronic design automation (EDA) tools, which help chip designers translate their models into actual transistors on physical silicon. He sees a real opportunity to further expand open-source tools in the EDA space. In addition, the organization is interested in further exploring progress on Open PDK (process design kit) infrastructure such as a <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">recent experimental preview offered by Google and Skywater</a>.</p>
<p>Mains hopes that by being a community and a champion for open-source methodologies in hardware, this cloistered industry can open up and expand the range and efforts of innovation happening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The IPO frenzy is not letting up, Bumble informed the world this morning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The IPO frenzy is not letting up, Bumble informed the world this morning.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521031442/d20761ds1a.htm">new SEC filing</a>, the dating company raised its target IPO price range, indicating that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">its previous attempt</a> to quantify its per-share value was an undershoot. This means we&#8217;ll need to calculate a host of new valuations and revenue multiples for the company.</p>
<p>But more than that, we have a question to answer: Is Bumble aiming for a Match.com price, despite not being as profitable as its already-public rival? The last time we covered the pair, Bumble&#8217;s implied revenue multiples were discounted compared to Match, but with this new price, has the smaller company gained ground?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And if so, does it mean that we&#8217;re seeing more public market enthusiasm for private companies? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>
<p>When it comes to the frenetic demand for IPO shares from public investors, I am reminded <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/1994-10-01">of a particular Dilbert</a>. In this particular strip, Wally gets fired and is then hired back as a consultant. People outside the company appear smarter, he said, so he&#8217;s now back and getting paid more money than before.</p>
<p>This, but for private companies going public. Some companies appear to have huge promise while private, only to fizzle slowly while public. Or they manage huge price gains during their IPO process, only to cede those wins after they have a few trading months under their belt.</p>
<p>Is that what&#8217;s going to happen with Bumble?</p>
<h2>Bumble&#8217;s new IPO pricing range</h2>
<p>Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">targeted a $28 to $30 per-share IPO price</a> when it first set a range, implying a greater-than $1 billion raise. Now the company is selling more shares at an even higher price. From 34.5 million shares to 45 million, and at a new $37 to $39 per share price range, Bumble could raise $1.66 billion to $1.76 billion in its IPO.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not counting its underwriters&#8217; option of 6.75 million shares, which might bring its total raise to $2.02 billion at the top end of its new pricing interval.</p>
<p>What is Bumble worth at those new prices? Using its simple, shares-outstanding post-IPO count of 112,745,301 &#8212; inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option &#8212; the company would be worth $4.17 billion to $4.40 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Chicago-based startup, <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/">Jiobit</a>, wanted to make a better child location tracker than the bulky smartwatches and other insecurely designed products already on the market. So in 2018, it launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/jiobit-launches-its-more-secure-modular-child-location-tracker-starting-at-99/">own modular kid tracker</a> &#8212; a small dongle of sorts that could be tied to shoelaces, belt loops, or school backpack, for example. Today, the company is out with a new generation of this device, the Jiobit Next, which aims to improve the accuracy, battery life, reliability, and more.</p>
<p>The company says it took its two years&#8217; of learning and customer feedback into account, when developing the new design, which is today used not only by parents, but also by pet owners.</p>
<p>The updated version of the Jiboit, now $129.99, is a small device that weighs less than four quarter coins, and includes a combination of radios &#8212; Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, and GPS &#8212; as well as sensors including an accelerometer/pedometer, temperature sensor, and barometer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The upgraded version now includes a new antenna system designed to increase performance inside schools, stores, high rises, and other challenging signal environments, the company claims.</p>
<p>It also leverages the reach of low-power, wide-area (LPWA) wireless networks in order to better serve rural regions where cellular coverage is limited and spotty. This allows the device to still be tracked when outside of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth mesh networks.</p>
<p>The new Jiobit is also waterproof (IPX8) up to 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes and includes an alert button that instantly notifies loved ones that the user is lost or in danger. This button can be customized through the Jiobit app as to which family members will receive the alert, or it can even be turned off &#8212; which may be useful if the child is too young to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Jiobit owners can continue to monitor the device through the app or now, a web app that includes alerting and notification controls. This opens the service up to more than just families &#8212; it could be used by organizations to deploy Jiobit into the field.</p>
<p>Like some software-based tracking apps, the device supports features like &#8220;Trusted Places,&#8221; which are geofenced areas where you expect the device to be at certain times, like school or maybe a doggie day care. When the device is not in a Trusted Place, you can enable &#8220;Live Mode&#8221; to watch its movement in real-time.</p>

<p>Another improvement focuses on battery life. The upgraded version offers 50% longer battery life than the prior version, the company says. Under typical use cases, the Jiobit will last up to 10 days between charges, though it last longer when on standby and not in active use. (That may be why pet owners are seeing slightly longer battery life of 10-20 days, for instance.)</p>
<p>The original idea for Jiobit had come about because founder John Renaldi, a previous VP at Motorola, was shocked to find that most child trackers on the market were strong their certificate keys in the clear and were hackable. He wanted to build a more secure alternative, and brought on co-founder and CTO, Roger Ady, a previous director of engineering at Motorola, to help.</p>
<p>Today, the Jiobit has its own dedicated security chip to communicate with the company&#8217;s servers, and uses its AES-256 <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/blog/kickstarter-gadget-crowdfunded-hacked-iot-security-jiobit">&#8220;Jiobit TrustChip&#8221; technology</a> to encrypt data both at rest and in transit with TLS1.2 encryption. It also refuses to download any software that&#8217;s not cryptographically signed by Jiobit in order to prevent malware or other &#8220;rogue&#8221; software from being installed.</p>

<p>The service itself, meanwhile, is compliant with U.S. children&#8217;s privacy regulations (COPPA).</p>
<p>The new Jiobit Next will work only within the U.S., while the 1st generation works internationally across 146 countries. But both will continued to be supported by way of <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/product">subscriptions</a>. Users can choose between a 2-year subscription plan ($8.99/month), a 6-month subscription plan ($12.99/month) or a month-to-month subscription plan ($14.99/month). These don&#8217;t require a cellular plan or SIM card from your existing carrier, like other child trackers and smartwatches, though.</p>
<p>To date, the startup says it&#8217;s raised $12 million in outside investment, including from Netgear and other midwest VC firms. Jiobit isn&#8217;t disclosing how many devices its sold to date, specifically, but says it&#8217;s in the &#8220;mid-five figure range.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new device is on pre-order starting today and will be sold later this month on its website, and then Amazon, Chewy, and Target. It has also partnered with family tracking app Life360 to offer special pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Atlanta-based <a href="https://www.bip-capital.com/">BIP Capital</a> has a new name for its venture capital operations (<a href="https://panoramic.vc/">Panoramic Ventures</a>); a new partner (Paul Judge); and is launching a $300 million new fund in its bid to plant a flag as the premier venture fund among the rising startup cities across the country.</p>
<p>Miami may have grabbed headlines recently as a new hub for venture capital and technology startups, but like other cities across the Southeast it&#8217;s lacked venture funds of a significant size since the early days of the dot-com bubble. Panoramic wants to be the fundraising destination for entrepreneurs outside of traditional tech hubs like Boston, Silicon Valley and New York as these new tech hubs emerge.</p>
<p>Atlanta, which already boasts several startup companies that have achieved billion-dollar valuations including Greenlight Financial and Calendly, has an equally burgeoning startup scene and an opportunity to become the central hub for venture capital investment in a region that encompasses several other rising tech hubs in the Southeast like Birmingham, Miami, Nashville, and New Orleans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a strategy similar to the one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">Drive Capital has employed</a> to become a leading fund in the Midwest and across the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ryhokvXMPq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most &#8216;compelling emerging market&#8217; may be America, outside of Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/embed/#?secret=ryhokvXMPq" data-secret="ryhokvXMPq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the new partnership, which will include famed early stage Atlanta investor, Paul Judge, BIP Capital&#8217;s venture activities will operate under the Panoramic Ventures brand.</p>
<p>Should the firm manage to raise the $300 million it has targeted for Panoramic&#8217;s inaugural investment vehicle it would become the largest venture fund in the Southeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to have a fund at that scale,&#8221; said Mark Buffington, a co-founder of BIP Capital and Panoramic Ventures. &#8220;You see the venture activity that is increasing in the region [and] one thing that&#8217;s been missing is a really active venture fund that can scale up as companies grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Panoramic intends to be active at the seed stage while having the capacity to make investments in later stage venture backed companies as well, according to the two co-founders. And the firm will also try to focus on a more diverse group of entrepreneurs, thanks to the addition of Paul Judge.</p>
<p>Judge, a Black serial entrepreneur and investor, was the co-founder of the Atlanta-based voice recognition tech developer <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/">Pindrop</a>, the Wi-Fi startup Luma Home, and security tech developer Purewire.  He&#8217;s also an investor several startups across the Southeast through his own venture initiatives, including <a href="https://techsquare.co/about/">Techsquare Labs</a> and Judge sits on the investment committee for the SoftBank Opportunity Fund, focused on Black, Hispanic and Native American founders. His portfolio includes companies like LeaseQuery, Cove.tool, OncoLens and Eventeny.</p>
<p>About $125 million has already been soft-circled for the new Panoramic Ventures fund, which expects to work closely with some of the other investment firms that have cropped up or established a presence in the Southeast. That includes firms like <a href="https://www.outlanderlabs.com/">Outlander Labs</a>, founded by the husband and wife investment team of Paige and Leura Craig, and the LA-based firm, Mucker Labs, which has an investment partner working out of Nashville.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;There’s been an absence of this type of energy and this type of heft in a venture fund in Atlanta,&#8221; said Judge. &#8220;That’s the hole that we’ve been aiming to fill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panoramic will invest in Seed, Series A, and Series B funding rounds, the company said in a statement. Investment areas will focus on include business-to-business software as a service companies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare software, financial technologies, digital media, cybersecurity, and frontier technologies. </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and be sure to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/a-lake-house-architect-a-miami-vc-and-homeowner-walk-into-a-wine-bar/">last week&#8217;s main ep</a> that dug into Robinhood, Miami, and a host of other topics.</p>
<p>This morning we had a pile of news to get through. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/07/pony-ai-raises-100-million-more-to-advance-its-autonomous-vehicle-tech/">Pony.ai raised another $100 million</a>, which underscores our growing thesis that there is no amount of money yet that will produce the tech required for self-driving cars to work. Perhaps we will get there, but it is going to cost a pretty penny or two.</li>
<li>Sticking to cars, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/hyundai-kia-say-they-aren-t-in-ev-discussions-with-apple?sref=gni836kR">the Apple-Kia tieup is kaput</a>, which we should have known the moment it became known. Apple previously bought startup Drive.ai back in 2019, of course.</li>
<li>Vroom, a 2020 IPO, bought a Super Bowl ad. Who would have expected that? Its shares are up, however, after the ad.</li>
<li>Still on the car beat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla bought $1.50 billion in bitcoin</a>, and may accept the stuff as tender to buy its vehicles in the future. The move sent the price of bitcoin higher.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">Clubhouse got banned in China</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/indian-healthtech-startup-phable-raises-12-million-to-serve-patients-with-chronic-conditions/">Phable raised $12 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/nexthink-nabs-180m-series-d-on-1-1b-valuation/">Nexthink raised $180 million</a>, and Bumble is targeting a higher share price in its impending IPO.</li>
<li>And we may have figured out the ∆ between what investors are saying about the Seed market, and what data has largely said.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getaway.house">Getaway</a> CEO Jon Staff said that while the startup&#8217;s offerings weren&#8217;t designed with a pandemic in mind, they turned out to be well-suited for a time when people were eager to find safe ways to get off Zoom and out of their homes.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Getaway builds &#8220;Outposts&#8221; — collections of tiny cabins in rustic locations within a two-hour drive of major cities like Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles and New York. Those cabins sound perfect for socially distanced retreats, with guests checking themselves in, each cabin built with its own fire pit and spaced 50 to 150 feet from the others and there were no common areas.</p>
<p>Staff told me that rather than promoting traditional tourist activities, Getaway emphasizes disconnecting from all the stresses and distractions of modern life. So its cabins don&#8217;t include WiFi, and they also have lockboxes where visitors can hide their phones for the duration of their visits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We try to get you to do nothing, quite literally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How few moments are there in life when really have enough free time that you could do nothing? And if not nothing, have a deep conversation with your partner, or take the time to cook a good meal and really enjoy the experience with people who are there sitting next to the campfire with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Staff acknowledged that some investors were skeptical about Getaway&#8217;s insistence on building the cabins and Outposts itself. He recalled talking to tech-focused venture capitalists who would ask, &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t this a platform? Why isn&#8217;t it going to be worth $1 billon a year from now?&#8221; while potential investors from the real estate world would want to know, &#8220;How tall of a skyscraper do you want to build?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a while, I had this anxiety that we don’t fit in any box,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I learned to appreciate the benefits of not fitting in any box — that’s where innovation really lies.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110114" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?w=680" alt="Getaway lifestyle image" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Getaway-Lifestyle-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getaway</p></div></p>
<p>And the Getaway approach seemed to resonate in 2020, with bookings increasing 150% year-over-year and the startup&#8217;s Outposts operating at nearly 100% occupancy. Today it&#8217;s announcing that it has raised $41.7 million in Series C funding — first revealed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1699380/000169938021000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">in a regulatory filing</a> and led by travel- and hospitality-focused firm <a href="https://certares.com">Certares</a>.</p>
<p>Getaway plans to use the funding to expand to at least 17 Outposts this year, up from 12 in 2020 and nine in 2019. The startup has now raised more than $81 million in total funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/getaway-2">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Staff said that eventually, Getaway could also add other products and services, because, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The brand is not about </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">tiny houses or tiny cabins, The brand is about [the fact that] the world is too noisy and too connected over the long haul. Getaway could be doing other things to solve that problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At the same time, he said it&#8217;s crucial to to remain clear and focused on the experience that Getaway wants to provide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always try to remind ourselves that we are not creating the experience at Getaway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re creating the experience and, if we’re doing it well, we&#8217;re facilitating it, we&#8217;re giving you everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t &#8230; There’s a lot of freedom to make of it what you want as the guest, but there are also boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Staff said that there have been requests to offer Getaway Outposts for work retreats, but that&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re designed for: &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to police it, but we&#8217;re not going to put in WiFi.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.beyondid.com/">BeyondID</a>, a cloud identity consulting firm, announced a $9 million Series A today led by Tercera. It marked the first investment from Tercera, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/tecera-launches-with-225m-to-fund-cloud-consulting-firms/">a firm that launched earlier this month</a> with the goal of investing in service startups like Beyond.</p>
<p>The company focuses on helping clients manage security and identity in the cloud, taking aim specifically at Okta customers. In fact, the firm is a platinum partner for Okta. As they describe their goals, they help clients in a variety of areas including identity and access management, secure app modernization, Zero Trust security, cloud migration and integration services.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Arun Shrestha has a deep background in technology including working with Okta from its early days. Shrestha came on board in 2012 as the head of customer success. When he began, the startup was in early days with just 50 customers. When he left five years later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/identity-management-software-provider-okta-seeks-to-raise-187m-with-ipo-pricing/">just before the IPO</a>, it had over 3500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along the way, he gained a unique level of expertise in the Okta tool set, and he decided to put that to work to help Okta customers implement and maximize Okta usage, especially in companies with complex implementations. He launched BeyondID in 2018 with the intention of focusing on systems integrations and managing a company&#8217;s identity in the cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we are becoming a managed identity service provider, so managing anything identity, anything related to cybersecurity. We&#8217;re helping these companies by being a one-stop shop for companies acquiring, deploying and managing identity services,&#8221; Shrestha explained.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tercera launches with $225M to fund cloud consulting firms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/tecera-launches-with-225m-to-fund-cloud-consulting-firms/embed/#?secret=HTDonPCURP" data-secret="HTDonPCURP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It seems to be working. The last couple of years the company revenues grew at 300% and as it matures, and the growth rates settle a bit, it&#8217;s still expected to grow between 70 and 100% this year. The firm has 250 customers including FedEx, Major League Baseball, Bain Capital and Biogen.</p>
<p>It currently has 75 employees serving those customers with plans to grow that number in the next year with the help from today&#8217;s investment. As Shrestha adds new employees, he sees building a diverse workforce as a crucial goal for his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is absolutely critical to our long term sustainable success, and it&#8217;s also the right thing to do,&#8221; he said. He says that building an organization that promotes women and people of color is a key goal of his as the leader of the company and something he is committed to.</p>
<p>Chris Barbin, who is managing partner and founder at lead investor Tercera, says that he chose BeyondID as the firm&#8217;s first investment because he believes identity is central to the notion of digital transformation. As more companies move to the cloud, they need help understanding how security and identity work differently in a cloud context, and he sees BeyondID playing a critical role in helping clients get there.</p>
<p>&#8220;BeyondID is in a rapidly growing space and has an impressive customer list that represents nearly every industry. Arun and the leadership team have a strong vision for the firm, deep ties into Okta, and they&#8217;re incredibly passionate about what they do,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based Isotropic Systems has raised a $40 million funding in an &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221; round that the startup says will help it get its next-generation broadband terminal to the production phase by its 2022 target. The funding, a Series B that brings the company&#8217;s total raised to $60 million, was led by SES and included participation form Boeing HorizonX, Space Angels, Orbital Ventures on the venture side, and that includes UK government grant support as well.</p>
<p>Isotropic&#8217;s business is centred around a new type of broadband terminal it&#8217;s developing that can communicate across multiple frequencies, making it possible for it to connect to more than one satellite network at the same time without any loss in signal quality or network speed for any individual connection. The final product would then offer ground connectivity to customers that could potentially maintain connections with more than one of the emerging satellite broadband networks in development, including those being set up by OneWeb, SpaceX, Intelsat, SES, Amazon and more.</p>
<p>The startup will be stand-in cup a 20,000 square-foot testing and prediction facility near Reading in the UK, and expects to have the first operational version of its ground terminal in production by 2022. If its final product works as advertised, it could be a major boon both for satellite network connectivity providers and for clients, since it would mean that customers who can afford the service don&#8217;t have to either select from among the available options, and can instead use one hardware solution to connect to multiple in order to take advantage of potential speed benefits, as well as network redundancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The benefits are obvious, provided the financials make sense. Imagine, for instance, using onboard wifi on an international flight. Typically, these networks have been unreliable to say the least. Coverage and quality drop-outs are common, and speeds tend to be weak in even the best of cases. Networks like Starlink aim to correct a lot of these legacy problems, but even better would be a solution that offers connection to multiple satellite networks simultaneously, switching between each connection as necessary to maintain the best possible network quality – and potentially combining available bandwidth when possible to boost speeds.</p>
<p>Isotropic&#8217;s potential customer list for such an offering spans military, government, and civilian markets, across both broadband and low-data IoT networks. This latest funding should help it prove its groundbreaking technology can attain the production scale and efficacy required to live up to its promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">an SEC filing</a>, Tesla disclosed that it has acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency. Moreover, the company noted that it may also accept bitcoin in the future as a form of payment for its cars, though it did allow that there is some regulatory uncertainty around that effort.</p>
<p>As the news broke, the price of bitcoin instantly rose by around 7% to more than $40,000 per coin.</p>
<p>Tesla had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN28U0XM">previously telegraphed</a> that it had an interest in the cryptocurrency, however to purchase such a large block of the coin is notable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K6hFHygGcd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/embed/#?secret=K6hFHygGcd" data-secret="K6hFHygGcd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In its filing, Tesla writes that earlier this year it &#8220;updated [its] investment policy to provide [it] with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on [its] cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity,&#8221; adding that it has the option of putting cash into &#8220;certain alternative reserve assets&#8221; that include &#8220;digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under that banner, the firm has &#8220;invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin,&#8221; going on to say that the well-known electric car company &#8220;may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough wiggle room for Tesla to do whatever it wants with its cash and the crypto markets.</p>
<p>But the company wasn&#8217;t done, completing its news-drop by adding that the company &#8220;expect[s] to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made waves in recent days by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/">pumping a silly cryptocurrency joke</a> called Dogecoin; this is something more material. Tesla is selecting bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of its choice, helping to further cement the blockchain as the world&#8217;s best known. And that it may accept bitcoin-denominated transactions in the future could help bitcoin retain both value, and exchange volume, though we probably repeat ourselves. It&#8217;s worth noting that Musk himself has also personally sent bitcoin prices higher in past using his social presence, including by changing his bio to just the single word, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-falls-retraces-elon-musk-twitter">before its price faded back</a> after he removed it earlier this month.</p>
<p>The car company then spends three paragraphs saying that its choice is risky. That&#8217;s an understatement. Then again, what is Musk if not entertaining?</p>

<p>Last week I highlighted how Lime was getting into the shared moped business. Now, shared moped startup Revel is getting into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">EV charging game</a>. I wonder if we are starting to witness the beginning of a business diversification trend in micromobility?</p>
<p>Revel said it is building a DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles in New York City, the first in a new business venture that will eventually spread to other cities. The company said this new “Superhub,” which is located at the former Pfizer building in Brooklyn, will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. This will be the first in a network of Superhubs opened by Revel across New York City, the company said.</p>
<p>Revel didn’t build the EV charging infrastructure in-house. Instead, it is using Tritium’s new RTM75 model for the first 10 chargers at its Brooklyn site, which will go live this spring. These chargers are designed to deliver 100 additional miles of charge to an electric vehicle in about 20 minutes, according to Revel.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> announced plans to acquire alcohol delivery service Drizly in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">stock-and-cash deal</a> valued at $1.1 billion deal — cementing a strategy that started more than a year ago. The upshot: Uber is betting that its delivery and ride-hailing businesses will provide the fastest path to profitability.</p>
<p>Drizly&#8217;s marketplace will be eventually folded into the Uber Eats app. For now, Drizly will maintain the standalone app. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The acquisition of Drizly is expected to close in the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t follow Uber&#8217;s every move, here&#8217;s a quick recap. Since early 2020, Uber has offloaded most of its businesses, including shared scooter and bike unit Jump, self-driving subsidiary Uber Advanced Technologies Group and the air taxi moonshot Uber Elevate. It also sold a $500 million stake in its Uber Freight spinoff. Meanwhile, it acquired on-demand delivery app Postmates and now Drizly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong> is one other company that had a &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; worthy funding round. The Seattle-based electric bike seller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">raised $150 million</a> from institutional investors, including Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, TPG’s global impact investing platform The Rise Fund and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Existing investors Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>While $150 million is hardly the biggest raise in transportation, it&#8217;s one of the larger ones in the world of electric bikes. The size of round — and the institutions involved — suggests investors see room from growth in the ebike industry and believe in Rad Power&#8217;s business model and its ability to expand beyond the $100 million in sales it generated in 2019. Rad Power Bikes declined to disclose its 2020 sales numbers.</p>
<p>Rad Power is a direct-to-consumer electric bike seller known for creating robust products that combine features like fat tires, big batteries and motors with touchscreens, and even cargo carrying capacity &#8212; all at prices hundreds of dollars below its competitors.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh told me that the funds will be used to double its 325-person workforce, increase the number of retail showrooms and service locations, continue to bring on more contract manufacturers to diversify its supply chain and add more accessories so consumers and customize their bikes.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bear Flag Robotics</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup that is developing autonomous technology for farm tractors, announced last month a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agtech-leader-bear-flag-robotics-raises-7-9-million-seed-extension-round-led-by-true-ventures-301211834.html">$7.9 million seed extension funding round</a> led by True Ventures. (I missed this one last week). The funding comes two years after it raised a $4.6 million seed round also led by True Ventures. Graphene Ventures, AgFunder, D20 and Green Cow VC also participated in the round.</p>
<p><strong>DealerPolicy</strong>, an insurance marketplace for automotive retail, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dealerpolicy-raises-30-million-in-series-b-funding-to-support-the-continued-development-of-automotive-retails-leading-insurance-marketplace-301219491.html#:~:text=BURLINGTON%2C%20Vt.%2C%20Feb.,as%20HSCM%20Bermuda%20Management%20Company.">raised $30 million</a> in Series B funding led by 3L Capital and Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>Hip</strong>, the mobile app startup that connects riders to buses and shuttles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/commuting-platform-startup-hip-lands-12-million-to-help-companies-bring-employees-back-to-the-office/">raised $12 million</a>. The company was a consumer-facing business, but has changed its business model to focus on helping employers prepare for, and start to bring their workers back to the office or factory.</p>
<p><strong>Otonomo</strong>, the cloud-based software startup that helps companies capture and monetize connected car data, agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Software Acquisition Group Inc. II with a valuation of $1.4 billion. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001842498&amp;owner=include&amp;count=40&amp;hidefilings=0">prospectus</a> filed by the Otonomo shows it generated $400,000 in revenue in 2020 with a total operating expenditure of $10 million. Otonomo said it expects to have a negative gross profit through 2021. The company said it expects to be EBITDA positive by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>REE Automotive</strong> has reached merger agreement with special purpose acquisition corporation 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. The combined company, which will be listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol &#8220;REE,&#8221; will have an equity valuation of $3.6 billion. The startup has developed flat and modular EV platforms with fully autonomous-ready independent drive-by-wire, brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire technology for each wheel.</p>
<p>The company said it raised $300 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors including Koch Strategic Platforms and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Magna International.<br />
The transaction is expected to provide more than $500 million of gross proceeds to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Urban SDK</strong>, a connected mobility and safety analytics platform, raised $1.66 million in a funding round led by the Florida Opportunity Fund and matched by DeepWork Capital, a venture capital firm investing in early-stage companies in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Wheels Up</strong>, the private jet subscription service, announced plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp. The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter, would give Wheels Up a valuation of more than $2 billion — more than twice its 2019 value.</p>
<h2>Ford ramps up EV and AV spending</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896228 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png" alt="the station electric vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> said this week it will spend $22 billion on electrification — double its previous commitment — and invest $7 billion on autonomous vehicles through 2025. It should be noted that $2 billion of that AV budget has already been spent, leaving $5 billion left to invest over the next four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are accelerating all our plans — breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving costs and getting more electric vehicles into our product cycle plan,&#8221; Ford CEO Jim Farley said. &#8220;People are responding to what Ford is doing today, not someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement comes at the beginning of a critical two-year period for Ford and on the heels of a fourth quarter that delivered a $2.8 billion loss. The automaker will ramp up deliveries of its all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicle and the Bronco Sport (which is not an EV). The first electric E-Transit commercial vans will come off the line in late 2021. Meanwhile, development continues on an all-electric F-150 pickup that is coming in mid- 2022.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget that Ford is also planning to use Google&#8217;s Android Automotive operating system in new vehicles, beginning in 2023 as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">six-year partnership</a> announced February 1 that will bring embedded Google apps and services to drivers.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s announcement comes a week after GM said it aspired to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, the for-profit company tied to open source web publishing platform WordPress, is announcing that it has acquired analytics provider <a href="http://www.parse.ly">Parse.ly</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, Parse.ly is now part of WPVIP, the organization within Automattic that offers enterprise hosting and support to publishers including TechCrunch. (We use Parse.ly, too.)</p>
<p>WPVIP CEO Nick Gernert described this as the organization&#8217;s first large enterprise software acquisition, reflecting a strategy that has expanded beyond news and media organizations — businesses like Salesforce (whose venture arm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/automattic-raises-300-million-at-3-billion-valuation-from-salesforce-ventures/">invested $300 million in Automattic </a>back in 2019), the NBA, Condé Nast, Facebook and Microsoft now use WPVIP for their content and marketing needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both companies, Gernert said, come from similar backgrounds, with &#8220;roots&#8221; in digital publishing and a &#8220;heavy focus on understanding the impact of content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve really to shift more towards content marketing and starting to think more deeply beyond just what traditional page analytics provide,&#8221; he continued. That means doing more than measuring pageviews and time on site and &#8220;really starting to look more deeply at things like conversation, attribution, areas &#8230; that from a marketer&#8217;s perspective are impactful.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress and Parse.ly already work well together, but the plan is to make WPVIP features available to Parse.ly customers while also making more Parse.ly data available to WPVIP publishers. And Gernert said there also opportunities to add more commerce-related data to Parse.ly, since Automattic also owns WooCommerce.</p>

<p>The goal, he said, is to &#8220;make Parse.ly better for WordPress and best for WPVIP.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he added, &#8220;There&#8217;s no plans here to make Parse.ly the only analytics solution that runs on our platform. We want to preserve the flexibility and interoperability [of WordPress], and we want to make sure from a Parse.ly perspective that it still exists as a standalone product. That&#8217;s key to its future and we will continue to invest in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parse.ly was founded in 2009 and has raised $12.9 million in funding from investors including Grotech Ventures and Blumberg Capital, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parsely/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. Parse.ly founders Sachin Kamdar and Andrew Montalenti are joining WPVIP, with Kamdar leading go-to-market strategy for Parse.ly and Montalenti leading product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had deep admiration for WPVIP&#8217;s market position as the gold standard for enterprise content teams, and we’re thrilled to be able to join together,” Kamdar said in a statement. “From the culture and people, to the product, market and vision, we’re in lockstep to create more value for our customers. This powerful combination of content and intelligence will push the industry forward at an accelerated pace.”</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of Chinese users suddenly found themselves unable to access Clubhouse on early Monday evening as the country prepared to start the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Inside WeChat groups, Clubhouse users rushed to report the situation and help each other with ways to get back onto the red hot live audio app.</p>
<p>Audio drop-in startup Clubhouse was rapidly gaining steam in China, attracting a bevy of users early on to conversations on a wide range of topics. The app seemed likely to meet the fate of other U.S.-based apps and services, however – namely, a ban – and as of Monday, that indeed was what Clubhouse faces, as confirmed by TechCrunch. Users in China can no longer access the Clubhouse app, though the app&#8217;s <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">website</a> remains unblocked. The app is unlikely to return given how much the app&#8217;s model would have to change to comply with Chinese internet regulation.</p>

<p>Clubhouse has faced <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-where-are-the-adults-in-the-clubhouse/">criticism at home in the U.S. for its lack of effective moderation and abuse-prevention practices</a>, so it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that it has fallen afoul of China&#8217;s rather more strict enforcement of measures designed to stifle the spread of information the government deems inappropriate for discussion. The app was also not officially available via Apple&#8217;s China App Store, though access to it and its audio rooms was, before today, freely available without the use of a VPN provided a user had the app installed on their device.</p>
<p>The app was briefly available on China&#8217;s App Store following its global launch in September but was removed in October, TechCrunch previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">reported</a>. It&#8217;s unclear whether Clubhouse or Apple pulled the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not Apple&#8217;s doing but surely they must be happy to get out of a tight spot, as the discussion will shift from Apple&#8217;s involvement in the removal from App Store to the blocking of servers by authorities,&#8221; said Benjamin Ismail, campaign and advocacy director at GreatFire.org, which monitors censorship in China.</p>
<p>As Clubhouse was not listed on the Chinese App Store, it’s unclear how many people from mainland China were on the platform. A room discussing the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen protest, a taboo topic in China, reached the maximum number of participants at 5,000 this afternoon prior to the ban. Another room focused on the same topic attracted over 2,000 users.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s API has been blocked on Monday around 7 PM Beijing time, Greatfire.org told TechCrunch. Some users reported inside WeChat groups that they could no longer receive verification codes at their Chinese phone numbers, providing additional clues to the level of blockage. Many users in China signed up with Chinese phone numbers, which are linked to their real ID in the country and could make it easier for the police to identify them.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, Clubhouse soared in popularity within a few communities in mainland China, including people in startups, investment, academic, or those with an overseas background. Many of them were aware the app wouldn’t last long in China given free and often political debates frequented the platform. Clubhouse rooms titled “How long will Clubhouse last in China” and “Have you been invited to have tea for using Clubhouse?” attracted big crowds. “Having tea” is a euphemism for being taken away for interrogation by the police.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch noted on Saturday, Clubhouse&#8217;s early success prior to this shutdown has already prompted the creation of a number of homegrown alternatives designed around drop-in audio networking. Clubhouse&#8217;s popularity in China, however, may be difficult to replicate for any of these similar efforts – for the same reasons the original app itself is now inaccessible within the country.</p>

<p>With a Great Firewall circumvention tool like a virtual private network (VPN), some users in mainland China managed to regain access to Clubhouse, TechCrunch learned. Some features are able to hear and speak with their VPN off, so long as they have entered a room via a VPN. Agora, which operates from the U.S. and China, provides the SDK that powers Clubhouse&#8217;s live audio interaction, TechCrunch previously reported.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Phable, a three-year-old healthtech startup that is serving patients with chronic illnesses in India, has raised $12 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale in the world’s second most populated nation.</p>
<p>Manipal Hospitals, one of the largest healthcare providers in India, led the Series A round in Phable. Existing investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/the-venture-firm-sosv-has-hired-former-techcrunch-coo-ned-desmond-to-help-grow-its-startups/">New Jersey-headquartered SOSV</a> also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people in India suffer from chronic diseases. One of the biggest challenges they face is the volume of transactions they have to manage each day. There are appointments with doctors and labs for tests, purchasing of medicines, medical devices and insurance, and keeping a log of their test results.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup has built a full-stack solution to process all these transactions. It has also developed what it claims to be the world’s largest integration with medical IoT devices.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to automatically collect patients’ data so that doctors can keep a better track of their progress. The app also enables patients to share what medicine they are taking, and the frequency of the intake.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Phable co-founder Sumit Sinha explained that patients often become less disciplined about taking full dose of their medication once they start to see improvements in their conditions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phablecare.com/">Phable</a> has created a more transparent and real-time communication channel that allows a doctor to nudge their patients to take their medicine on time, and make any necessary changes to the lifestyle or medication cycle, or request a follow-up appointment. The app itself can be used for tele-consultation, the demand for which has skyrocketed in recent quarters as coronavirus forced people to stay indoors.</p>
<p>“This creates a feedback loop between the patient and the doctor even when the patient is not at the clinic or hospital and enables active interventions to get the best outcome,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2110071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110071" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Phable</p></div></p>
<p>The startup also sells a range of medical IoT devices through its platform that patients can buy for tracking their body performance such as blood pressure and glucose levels. Sinha said that even if a patient has bought a machine from some other place, Phable’s app is compatible with most devices. (Even if it is not &#8212; as is sometimes the case with low-cost, non-branded devices &#8212; patients can manually enter their result, or take a picture of the result and through computer vision, Phable is able to understand and make a record of it.)</p>
<p>“The growing burden of chronic diseases in India is exacerbated by issues around compliance of patients with the treatment regime – including medication, lifestyle changes and periodic follow-ups. Phable would help to fill that gap and would enhance the quality of life for many patients. Manipal Hospitals is pleased to have this opportunity to work with the team at Phable to enhance and grow their offerings,” said Dr. Ranjan Pai, Chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group, in a statement.</p>
<p>Phable, which employs 72 people, also maintains partnership with 1mg and Medlife to make it easier for patients to place orders for their medicines and get them delivered at their doorstep.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, millions of Indians have consulted with their doctors through their phone or computer and bought medication online for the first time. According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, e-pharmacy market in India was estimated to be around $512 million in 2018. In a recent note to clients, analysts at Bank of America estimated this market to be worth $2.4 billion by 2022. (The preventive healthcare market, which caters to physical and mental well-being, is expected to grow to $102 billion by 2022.)</p>
<p>Phable today serves patients with cardiovascular and endocrinology related chronic diseases. It has already served over 220,000 patients and plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale the startup to reach 5 million patients and 35,000 doctors by the end of the year. It also plans to broaden its offering, including allowing patients to purchase insurance from within the app or website.</p>
<p>Currently Phable is used by over 5,000 doctors. These doctors are using the platform to stay better connected with their existing patients and are not being paid by Phable. The startup, however, also enables patients to discover more doctors. All in all, Sinha said doctors have seen their revenue grow by 20% by using Phable’s platform.</p>
<p>“Phable started with an uncompromising vision of connected healthcare, reimagined through leading-edge technology, and has been unrelenting in their efforts since day one. It&#8217;s been our privilege to work with the team through our accelerator MOX and to further support Phable as they go on to better millions of lives in India,” said William Bao Bean, General Partner at SOSV, in a statement.</p>

<p>The firm, which was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland and has offices outside of Boston, received funding from Permira with help from Highland Europe and Index Ventures. The company has now raised over $336 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, understanding how folks are using a company&#8217;s technology choices internally is always going to be useful, but when the pandemic hit and offices closed, having access to this type of data became even more important.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Nexthink CEO and co-founder Pedro Bados says that most monitoring tools are focused on figuring out if the systems are working correctly and finding ways to fix them. Nexthink takes a different approach, looking at how employees are adopting the tools a company is offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do at Nexthink is to take the [monitoring] problem from a completely different perspective. We say that we&#8217;re going to give your IT department a real time understanding of how employees are experiencing IT [at your company],&#8221; Bados told me.</p>
<p>He says that they do this by looking at the problem from the employees&#8217; perspective. &#8220;At the end of the day we&#8217;re giving all the insights to IT departments to make sure they can improve the digital experience of their employees,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This could involve querying the user base in the same way that HR and marketing survey tools allow companies to check the pulse of employees or customers. By gathering this type of data, it helps IT understand how employees are using the company&#8217;s technology choices.</p>
<p>This software is aimed at larger organizations with at least 5000 employees. Today, the company has over a 1000 of these customers including Best Buy, Fidelity, Liberty Mutual and 3M. What&#8217;s more, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue</a>, a success benchmark for SaaS companies like Nexthink.</p>

<p>Nexthink currently has 700 employees with plans to reach 900 by the end of this year, and as a maturing startup, Bados has given a lot of thought on how to build a diverse workforce. Just being spread out in two countries gives an element of geographic diversity, but he says it takes more than that, and it all starts with recruitment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way to make sure we get more diversity is we look at recruitment and make sure that we have a balanced pipeline. That&#8217;s something we measure as a company,&#8221; he said. They also have a diversity committee, which is charged with delivering diversity training and figuring out ways to hire a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>While the company has a healthy valuation and a good amount of money in the bank, Bados doesn&#8217;t see an IPO for at least a couple of years. He says he wants to double or triple the business before taking that step. For now, though with $180 million in additional runway and a $100 million in ARR, the company is well positioned for whatever future moves it chooses to make.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk notified the world that he would be donating $100 million to pursue new technologies for carbon capture, methods through which carbon dioxide can be actively extracted from the atmosphere as a means to help stave off climate change. As TechCrunch reported in January when he made the tweet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/">Musk&#8217;s sizeable pool of monetary incentive would be going to the Xprize foundation</a>, a non-profit that has organized similar ambitious technology competitions aimed at developing world-changing tech. Now, Xprize and Musk have released new <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk">details of the competition</a>.</p>
<p>The entire $100 million prize pool is up for grabs with this competition, which will seek solutions that can &#8220;pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans and lock it away permanently in an environmentally benign way.&#8221; That&#8217;s an ambitious goal, and one that seeks methods for carbon extraction which have a net negative effect on the overall global balance of the element&#8217;s presence. Xprize aims to award up to 15 finalists $1 million each, along with three top winners, with $50 million to the Grand Prize victor, and $20 million and $10 million respectively for second and third place. 25 student scholarships valued at $250,000 each will also be up for grabs specifically for student team entrants.</p>
<p>To qualify for victory, solutions must be able to extract 1 ton of CO2 per day, and be viable in a scaled, validated model at time of presentation, with the ability to scale it to &#8220;gigaton levels&#8221; in commercially viable ways in future. Those are big goals for new technologies, but the competition&#8217;s stakes are high: Musk has frequently referred to climate change as an existential threat to humanity, and carbon capture is one key means to combat it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pRLKCJKFQN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/">Elon Musk is donating $100M to find the best carbon capture technology</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk is donating $100M to find the best carbon capture technology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/embed/#?secret=pRLKCJKFQN" data-secret="pRLKCJKFQN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Carbon capture methods exist, and some are at the center of new startups and emerging businesses, like Canadian company Carggon Engineering which uses CO2 extracted from the atmosphere to create new types of fuel, or Air Vodka, a carbon negative vodka distilled using C02 removed from the atmosphere. Though there are a handful of companies pursuing this, the problem is that it&#8217;s typically very expensive to remove carbon in a way that is both safe and that has no subsequent impact on the environment from its resulting byproducts.</p>
<p>The new Xprize competition hopes to spur the development of a wide range of emerging companies in a way similar to how the the 2004 $10 million private spaceflight Ansari Xprize led the development of a whole new era in the space industry. The competition will officially begin on April 22, 2021, at which time full guidelines will be made available and registration will open. Applicants will have up to four years to submit their solution, with the competition closing on Earth Day 2025 and the initial $1 million awards distributed after 18 months following that. That will provide the funding necessary for teams to build out their full-scale demos to claim the top prizes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verse-innovations">VerSe Innovation</a>, the parent firm of popular news and entertainment app Dailyhunt and short video app Josh, said on Monday it has raised over $100 million as part of a Series H financing round from Qatar Investment Authority and Glade Brook Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The announcement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">another $100 million+</a> investment the startup secured from Google, AlphaWave, and Microsoft in December last year. That tranche of investment, also part of Series H, had turned Dailyhunt into a unicorn (giving it a valuation of $1 billion or higher). The startup has to-date raised about $430 million.</p>
<p>Dailyhunt, co-run by Virendra Gupta and former Facebook India head Umang Bedi, is a popular news and entertainment app that serves more than 285 million users each day in 14 local languages in India. Its reach in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, would explain why Twitter last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/twitter-moments-dailyhunt-india/">partnered with the Indian firm to bring Moments to Dailyhunt</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verse-innovations/">VerSe Innovation</a> expanded to short form videos last year, with Josh, after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok</a> and created a theoretical void for snacking content in the country. Scores of large giants and startups &#8212; including MX Player and ShareChat &#8212; have attempted to try their hand at short form videos in the recent quarters.</p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">launched Instagram Reels in India last year</a>, and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">launched Shorts</a>, which is already garnering over 3.5 billion daily views in India, it said last month. (With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">over 450 million users in India</a>, YouTube is closing in on WhatsApp&#8217;s market lead in India.)</p>
<p>Josh appears to have emerged as one of the leading players: The startup says Josh has amassed over 85 million monthly active users &#8212; 40 million of whom check the app each day &#8212; and the app sees more than 1.5 billion video plays everyday.</p>
<p>Now the startup says it is exploring expansion into more categories and like with Dailyhunt and Josh, cater users in smaller cities and towns and eventually replicate this model in international markets.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s internet economy is expected to be worth $639 billion by 2030, analysts at Citi wrote in a report to clients late last month. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated digital adoption and users&#8217; appetite to transact online, a report from analysts at UBS said last week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Josh represents a confluence of India’s top 200+ best creators, the 10 biggest music labels, 15+ million UGC creators, best in class content creation tools, the hottest entertainment formats, and formidable user demographics. Josh has been consistently rated as the leading Indian short-video app in India on the Play store,&#8221; the startup said in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its local languages content offering, and expand its creators ecosystem and AI and ML tech stacks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ByteDance is bringing its battle with archrival Tencent to the court at a time when the Chinese government moves to curve the power of the country&#8217;s internet behemoths.</p>
<p>The Beijing Intellectual Property Court has permitted a ByteDance lawsuit brought against Tencent to proceed, a ByteDance spokesperson confirmed with TechCrunch. Upstart new media company ByteDance alleged that Tencent&#8217;s restrictions on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, are in violation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">China&#8217;s anti-monopoly draft rules</a>. Douyin is headquartered in Beijing while Tencent&#8217;s base is in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>For three years, Tencent has blocked Douyin from its flagship networking apps WeChat and QQ, which bans users from viewing or sharing content from the short video app. Tencent&#8217;s behavior &#8220;no doubt&#8221; constitutes &#8220;monopolistic behavior achieved by abusing market domination to exclude and limit competition,&#8221; which the proposed anti-monopoly law prohibits, Douyin, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gP1oPRVpW6qD_dEGIKw3vQ">said</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation. We have filed this lawsuit to protect our rights and those of our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent said in response the accusation is false and malicious defamation. It further asserted that Douyin, which is used by 600 million users every day, uses illegal and anti-competitive methods to access WeChat&#8217;s user data, and it&#8217;s <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0ujgHBoZmIvPqzpP40t6DA">planning to sue</a> ByteDance for harming its platform ecosystem and user rights.</p>
<p>ByteDance and Tencent each covet the other&#8217;s turf. ByteDance<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/tiktok-challenges-wechat/"> debuted a chat app</a> to take on Tencent&#8217;s dominance in social networking, while Tencent countered Douyin&#8217;s popularity by introducing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/chinas-obsession-with-short-videos-has-its-internet-giants-worried/">a slew of short video apps</a>. Neither has managed to threaten the other&#8217;s dominance in their respective field.</p>
<p>Early signs show that the Chinese government is increasingly willing to rein in monopolistic behavior on the Chinese internet following two decades of relatively lax regulations.</p>
<p>In November, the country&#8217;s top market regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">unveiled</a> the draft version of its first anti-monopoly law, opening a floodgate to lawsuits and investigations. In December, regulators launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">an antitrust probe into Alibaba</a> for forcing vendors to sell exclusively on its platform. Just this month, a court in Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vipshop-hldg-china-antitrust/china-fines-vipshop-almost-500000-for-unfair-competition-acts-idUSKBN2A803Y">imposed a 3 million yuan</a> ($464,000) fine on fashion e-commerce site Vipshop over anti-competitive behavior. It won&#8217;t be surprising to see more Chinese internet giants getting hit by anti-trust actions in the upcoming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Harry Stebbings, the podcaster-turned-VC, is stepping down as a partner of Stride.VC, the London-based venture capital firm he co-founded with Fred Destin, formerly of Accel.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fdestin/status/1358507176843743233">In a series of tweets</a>, Destin said that Stebbings won&#8217;t be involved in Stride&#8217;s second fund (though he&#8217;ll remain a partner in fund one), and will instead be focusing on his podcast franchise “The Twenty Minute VC” and running his own micro fund, the aptly titled &#8220;20VC&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry’s 20VC podcast has remained his passion and been flying high, creating opportunities that are hard to ignore. My bud wants to lean even harder into the 20VC platform,&#8221; tweeted Destin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In the same Twitter thread, Destin said he remains &#8220;fully committed to Stride and what the team is building&#8221;.</p>
<p>That team, however, has now seen a plethora of personnel changes since the VC firm was officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/stride-vc-official/">unveiled</a> in late 2018, with Stebbings being the latest to move on. Paris-based partner Pia d’Iribarne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/stride-vc-loses-partner-pia-diribarne/">departed</a> last August and has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/new-wave/">co-founded New Wave</a>. Stride also lost operating partner Arj Soysa about a year earlier. He&#8217;s now a finance director at Mubadala Capital in Europe.</p>
<p>Alongside Destin, Stride&#8217;s current team members include investor Pietro Invernizzi, finance and operations partner Ross W., and executive assistant Georgina Gallagher, according to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Both Stebbings and Destin declined to comment further, pointing me to Destin&#8217;s tweets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, the National Labor Relations Board rejected Amazon’s attempt to delay a union vote set to begin on Monday, February 8. For many, the online giant’s bid was seen as a stalling tactic, including a motion to demand votes take place in-person &#8212; a clear health risk, as the COVID-19 virus still poses a major threat in the United States and globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again <span class="il">Amazon</span> workers have won another fight in their effort to win a union voice,&#8221; Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement regarding the NLRB&#8217;s decision. &#8220;<span class="il">Amazon</span>’s blatant disregard for the health and safety of its own workforce was demonstrated yet again by its insistence for an in-person election in the middle of the pandemic. Today’s decision proves that it’s long past time that <span class="il">Amazon</span> start respecting its own employees; and allow them to cast their votes without intimidation and interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon, however, said it was disappointed in the decision because it goes against the company&#8217;s goal of getting as many people as possible to vote in the election, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the National Labor Relations Board recognizes that the employee participation rate for its own elections conducted with mail ballots is 20-30% lower than the participation rate for in-person voting,&#8221; Knox said. &#8220;Amazon proposed a safe on-site election process validated by COVID-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already-scheduled shifts. We will continue to insist on measures for a fair election that allow for a majority of our employee voices to be heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the mail-in voting process will continue as planned and ultimately determine whether Amazon’s Alabama warehouse &#8212; which employs around 6,000 &#8212; will join the RWDSU, an AFL-CIO affiliate in operation since 1937. The move would be a major watershed moment for Amazon’s blue-collar workforce &#8212; and could spur similar unionizing among the 110 or so fulfillment centers the company operates across the U.S.</p>
<p>The vote comes amid a sea change for both blue and white-collar workers in a tech sector that has traditionally rejected such movements. Notable recent examples include a group of Google contracts in Pittsburgh, followed by this year’s launch of an Alphabet Workers Union that includes more than 800 employees. Last February, Kickstarter voted to unionize its workforce, followed by developer platform Glitch the following month.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--callout block--right" >
		<h4 class="block--callout__title">Tech workers unionize</h4>
		
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">Kickstarter workers vote to unionize</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/">Glitch workers announce intention to unionize</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">Google, Alphabet employees unionize</a></li>
</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Unions, which act as an intermediary between workers and their employers, advocate on behalf of employees for better wages, working conditions and other benefits through collective bargaining. While it does cost money to join a union, unionized workers tend to make higher salaries than their non-unionized counterparts. Among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median weekly earnings of $1,144, compared to $958 for non-union members in 2020,<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"> according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Often times these unions are the product of months or years of planning behind the scenes &#8212; likely not a surprise for anyone possessing a basic knowledge of the history of labor in the United States. The formation of an Amazon union would present a historic move for labor and tech in the U.S. &#8212; a potential outcome the company has been looking to stop dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>Besides seeking to delay the vote, Amazon has also gone all-in on trying to persuade its workers in Bessemer not to vote to unionize. Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/">Do It Without Dues website</a> encourages workers to keep things the way they are, instead of having to pay union dues.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re paying dues&#8230;it will be restrictive meaning it won&#8217;t be easy to be as helpful and social with each other,&#8221; the site states. &#8220;So be a doer, stay friendly and get things done versus paying dues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers have complained that Amazon&#8217;s anti-union tactics are too much. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/">One worker told The Washington Post</a> they were bombarded with anti-union messaging in the bathroom stall.</p>
<p>Amazon opened the Bessemer warehouse in March 2020 and says it has created more than 5,000 full-time jobs starting with a pay of $15.30 per hour, including healthcare, vision and dental insurance, and 50% 401(K) match, Knox said. She described the work environment as &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;innovative,&#8221; and added, &#8220;We work hard to support our teams and more than 90% of associates at our Bessemer site say they would recommend Amazon as a good place to work to their friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Amazon’s labor history has been a spotty one. The company has often come under fire for its treatment of workers &#8212; particularly those in logistics and shipping, like the 6,000 currently employed in its Alabama fulfillment center. Many of those issues were amplified throughout 2020, as Amazon employees were deemed “essential workers” in the earliest days of the pandemic’s arrival in the States.</p>
<p>In November, former warehouse employee Christian Smalls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/">filed a suit against the company</a>, citing a failure to provide workers with proper PPE amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>“I was a loyal worker and gave my all to Amazon until I was unceremoniously terminated and tossed aside like yesterday’s trash because I insisted that Amazon protect its dedicated workers from COVID-19,” Smalls said at the time. “I just wanted Amazon to provide basic protective gear to the workers and sanitize the workplace.”</p>
<p>Smalls was fired last March after organizing a walkout at a Staten Island fulfillment center. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that he was fired after “putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of employment.”</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/">employees Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were fired</a> for “repeatedly violating internal policies,” according to the company. The pair were vocal critics of the company’s treatment of warehouse employees &#8212; criticism that came to a head during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Then, in September, <a href="https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1300756214574276610">reports surfaced</a> that Amazon was looking to hire an intelligence analyst. Specifically, Amazon in a job posting said it was seeking someone who would inform higher-ups and attorneys “on sensitive topics that are highly confidential, including labor organizing threats against the company.”</p>
<p>Amazon swiftly took down that job post, saying it was “not an accurate description of the role – it was made in error and has since been corrected,” Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in a statement to TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>While Amazon did not give a specific revised description, the company said the role is meant to support its team of analysts that focus on external events, like weather, large community gatherings or other events that have the potential to disrupt traffic or affect the safety and security of its buildings and the people who work at those buildings.</p>
<p>However, that same day, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azegw/amazon-is-spying-on-its-workers-in-closed-facebook-groups-internal-reports-show">Vice reported Amazon had been spying on workers for years</a> to monitor for any potential strikes or protests. Amazon has since said it will stop using its social media monitoring tool.</p>
<p>“We have a variety of ways to gather driver feedback and we have teams who work every day to ensure we’re advocating to improve the driver experience, particularly through hearing from drivers directly,” Boschetti said in a statement. “Upon being notified, we discovered one group within our delivery team that was aggregating information from closed groups. While they were trying to support drivers, that approach doesn’t meet our standards, and they are no longer doing this as we have other ways for drivers to give us their feedback.”</p>
<p>By unionizing, Amazon workers hope to gain the right to collectively bargain over their working conditions, like safety standards, pay, breaks and other issues. Unionizing would also enable workers to potentially become &#8220;just cause&#8221; employees versus at-will, depending on how the negotiations go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon presents a threat to the very fabric of society and the social contract we work to uphold for all working people,&#8221; <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/whyunion">the union organizers state on their site</a>. &#8220;Corporations like Amazon have built decades of increasingly bold and aggressive attacks on workers’ rights that have dramatically eroded union density, harmed working conditions, and lowered the standard of living for many workers. And it’s not stopping. The RWDSU has always stood against anti-worker and anti-union companies. Our union will not back down until Amazon is held accountable for these and so many more dangerous labor practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mail-in voting ends March 29, with the NLRB set to begin counting ballots the following day on a virtual platform. Each party will be allowed to have four people attend the count.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Amazon and will update this story if we hear back.</p>
