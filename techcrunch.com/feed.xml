										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some time ago, I gave up on the idea of finding a thread that connects each story in the weekly Extra Crunch roundup; there are no unified theories of technology news.</p>
<p>The stories that left the deepest impression were related to two news pegs that dominated the week — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa and Plaid calling off their $5.3 billion acquisition agreement</a>, and sizzling-hot IPOs for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/affirm-boosts-its-ipo-price-target-more-than-doubling-its-latest-private-valuation/">Affirm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">Poshmark</a>.</p>
<p>Watching Plaid and Visa sing &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Let&#8217;s Call The Whole Thing Off&#8221;</a> in harmony after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to block their deal wasn&#8217;t shocking. But I was surprised to find myself editing an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/plaid-ceo-touts-new-clarity-after-failed-visa-acquisition/">interview Alex Wilhelm conducted with with Plaid CEO Zach Perret</a> the next day in which the executive said growing the company on its own is &#8220;once again&#8221; the correct strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>In an analysis for Extra Crunch, Managing Editor Danny Crichton suggested that federal regulators&#8217; new interest in antitrust enforcement will affect valuations going forward. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble and women&#8217;s beauty D2C brand Billie also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/pg-terminates-plan-to-acquire-razor-startup-billie-following-ftc-lawsuit/">called off <i>their</i> planned merger last week</a> after the Federal Trade Commission raised objections in December.</p>
<p>Given the FTC&#8217;s moves last year to prevent Billie and Harry&#8217;s from being acquired, &#8220;it seems clear that U.S. antitrust authorities want broad competition for consumers in household goods,&#8221; Danny concluded, and I suspect that applies to Plaid as well.</p>
<p>In December, C3.ai, Doordash and Airbnb burst into the public markets to much acclaim. This week, used clothing marketplace Poshmark saw a 140% pop in its first day of trading and consumer-financing company Affirm &#8220;priced its IPO above its raised range <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006165/en/Affirm-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $49 per share</a>,&#8221; reported Alex.</p>
<p>In a post titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">A theory about the current IPO market</a>, he identified eight key ingredients for brewing a debut with a big first-day pop, which includes &#8220;exist in a climate of near-zero interest rates&#8221; and &#8220;keep companies private longer.&#8221; Truly, words to live by!</p>
<p>Come back next week for more coverage of the public markets in The Exchange, an interview with Bustle CEO Bryan Goldberg where he shares his plans for taking the company public, a comprehensive post that will unpack the regulatory hurdles facing D2C consumer brands, and much more.</p>
<p>If you live in the U.S., enjoy your MLK Day holiday weekend, and wherever you are: thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch.</p>

<p>After spending much of the week covering 2021&#8217;s frothy IPO market, Alex Wilhelm devoted this morning&#8217;s column to studying the OKR-focused software sector.</p>
<p>Measuring objectives and key results are core to every enterprise, perhaps more so these days since knowledge workers began working remotely in greater numbers last year.</p>
<p>A sign of the times: this week, enterprise orchestration SaaS platform Gtmhub announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">raised a $30 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how large the TAM is for OKR, Alex reached out to several companies and asked them to share new and historical growth metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gthmhub</li>
<li>Perdoo</li>
<li>WorkBoard</li>
<li>Ally.io</li>
<li>Koan</li>
<li>WeekDone</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Some OKR-focused startups didn’t get back to us, and some leaders wanted to share the best stuff off the record, which we grant at times for candor amongst startup executives,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p>For our latest investor survey, Matt Burns interviewed five VCs who actively fund consumer electronics startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV Capital</li>
<li>Dayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct Capital</li>
<li>Cyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSV</li>
<li>Bilal Zuberi, partner, Lux Capital</li>
<li>Rob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder,&#8221; says Matt, noting that the pandemic fueled wide interest in fitness startups like Mirror, Peloton and Tonal.</p>
<p>Bonus: many VCs listed the founders, investors and companies that are taking the lead in consumer hardware innovation.</p>

<p>Clothing resale marketplace Poshmark closed up more than 140% on its first trading day yesterday.</p>
<p>In Thursday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Alex noted that Poshmark boosted its valuation by selling 6.6 million shares at its IPO price, scooping up $277.2 million in the process.</p>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s surge in trading is good news for its employees and stockholders, but it reflects poorly on &#8220;the venture-focused money people who we suppose know what they are talking about when it comes to equity in private companies,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>This week, Visa announced it would drop its planned acquisition of Plaid after the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block it last fall.</p>
<p>Last week, Procter &amp; Gamble called off its purchase of Billie, a women&#8217;s beauty products startup — in December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block that deal, too.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the U.S. government took an arm&#8217;s-length approach to enforcing antitrust laws, but the tide has turned, says Managing Editor Danny Crichton.</p>
<p>Going forward, &#8220;antitrust won’t kill acquisitions in general, but it could prevent the buyers with the highest reserve prices from entering the fray.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a grad student currently working on F-1 STEM OPT. The company I work for has indicated it will sponsor me for an H-1B visa this year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hear the random H-1B lottery will be replaced with a new system that selects H-1B candidates based on their salaries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will this new process work?</strong></p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm interviewed Plaid CEO Zach Perret after the Visa acquisition was called off to learn more about his mindset and the company&#8217;s short-term plans.</p>
<p>Perret, who noted that the last few years have been a &#8220;roller coaster,&#8221; said the Visa deal was the right decision at the time, but going it alone is &#8220;once again&#8221; Plaid&#8217;s best way forward.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/2021-a-spac-odyssey/">Tuesday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange</a>, Alex Wilhelm took a closer look at blank-check offerings for digital asset marketplace Bakkt and personal finance platform SoFi.</p>
<p>To create a detailed analysis of the investor presentations for both offerings, he tried to answer two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are special purpose acquisition companies a path to public markets for &#8220;potentially-promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories?&#8221;</li>
<li>Given the number of unicorns and the limited number of companies that can IPO at any given time, &#8220;maybe SPACS would help close the liquidity gap?&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a precaution against coordinated violence as the U.S. approaches President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration, Facebook announced a few new measures it&#8217;s putting in place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/">blog post</a> and tweets from Facebook Policy Communications Director Andy Stone, the company explained that it would block any events slated to happen near the White House, the U.S. Capitol or any state capitol building through Wednesday.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: Through Inauguration Day, we&#39;re blocking the creation of new Facebook events happening in close proximity to DC and state capitols. And we&#39;re doing a secondary review of inauguration-related events and removing policy-violating ones. <a href="https://t.co/AV6z0gSTiu">https://t.co/AV6z0gSTiu</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Andy Stone (@andymstone) <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1350210024065392644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company says it will also do &#8220;secondary&#8221; sweeps through any inauguration-related events to look for violations of its policies. At this point, that includes any content connected to the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">perpetuating the rampant lie that Biden&#8217;s victory is illegitimate</a>. Those groups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/facebook-says-it-will-remove-references-to-stop-the-steal-across-its-platform/">continued to thrive on Facebook</a> until measures the company took at the beginning of this week.</p>
<p>Facebook will apparently also be putting new restrictions in place for U.S. users who repeatedly break the company&#8217;s rules, including barring those accounts from livestreaming videos, events and group pages.</p>
<p>Those precautions fall short of what some of Facebook&#8217;s critics have called for, but they&#8217;re still notable measures for a company that only began taking dangerous conspiracies and armed groups seriously in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> has confirmed with TechCrunch that it oversaw a $195 million secondary sale that values the company at $6 billion. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-ceo-eyes-public-market-after-secondary-valued-it-at-6-billion-.html">CNBC broke the story</a> earlier today.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s impressive valuation comes after its most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">2019 Series E in which it raised $268 million</a> on a 2.75 billion valuation, an increase of $3.25 billion in under 18 months. Company co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij believes the increase is due to his company&#8217;s progress adding functionality to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the increase in valuation over the past year reflects the progress of our complete DevOps platform towards realizing a greater share of the growing, multi-billion dollar software development market,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the startup has raised over $434 million, this round involved buying employee stock options, a move that allows the company&#8217;s workers to cash in some of their equity prior to going public. CNBC reported that the firms buying the stock included Alta Park, HMI Capital, OMERS Growth Equity, TCV and Verition.</p>

<p>The next logical step would appear to be IPO, something the company has never shied away from. In fact, it actually at one point included the proposed date of November 18, 2020 as a target IPO date on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/">the company wiki</a>. While they didn&#8217;t quite make that goal, Sijbrandij still sees the company going public at some point. He&#8217;s just not being so specific as in the past, suggesting that the company has plenty of runway left from the last funding round and can go public when the timing is right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to believe that being a public company is an integral part of realizing our mission. As a public company, GitLab would benefit from enhanced brand awareness, access to capital, shareholder liquidity, autonomy and transparency,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;That said, we want to maximize the outcome by selecting an opportune time. Our most recent capital raise was in 2019 and contributed to an already healthy balance sheet. A strong balance sheet and business model enables us to select a period that works best for realizing our long-term goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>GitLab has not only published IPO goals on its Wiki, but its entire company philosophy, goals and OKRs for everyone to see. Sijbrandij told TechCrunch&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-100m-arr/">at a TechCrunch Disrupt panel</a> in September that he believes that transparency helps attract and keep employees. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the company was and remains a fully remote organization, even pre-COVID.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started [this level of] transparency to connect with the wider community around GitLab, but it turned out to be super beneficial for attracting great talent as well,&#8221; Sijbrandij told Wilhelm in September.</p>
<p>The company, which launched in 2014, offers a DevOps platform to help move applications through the programming lifecycle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of course COVID-19 was bound to be an unavoidable topic during the first-ever all-virtual CES. After all, the topic is at front of mind regardless of the topic these days. Close to a year into the pandemic, presenters still understandably feel obligated to address the always-present elephant in the room. Sometimes it was as simple as acknowledging the strangeness of moving from the Las Vegas Convention Center to a Microsoft-powered virtual venue. Other times it felt far more forced.</p>
<p>When it comes to the technology itself, there’s no doubt that the pandemic is going to have a profound effect on the industry for years to come, from health measures to remote work setups. Sometimes it’s a genuinely organic evolution aimed at adapting technology to an ever-changing world. In other cases, it can feel far more exploitative &#8212; like the consumer electronics equivalent to a beer commercial discussing “these uncertain times.”</p>

<p>I’ve written a lot about how the pandemic will impact robotics and AI going forward. The short version is that companies will no doubt be more enthusiastic about embracing these technologies, after bumping up against the limitations of a human workforce with a deadly and highly contagious virus spreading across the world.</p>
<p>We saw some glimpses of robotics’ response. Though there tends to be a far longer lead time than in the consumer category. The clearest and most immediate example had to be the prevalence of UV outfitted robotics. LG, Ubtech and Ava Robotics all bombarded my inbox with their take on the category. The desire for disinfecting technology should be clear during a pandemic, and robotics offer both a way to automate a dull and repetitious process like this, while removing a potential human viral vector from the equation.</p>

<p>UV disinfecting made appearances in a number of other form factors. Phones have been a target for the tech for a few years now. After all, it didn’t take COVID-19 to teach us that smartphones are mobile petri dishes we watch TikToks on. Products like CleanPhone from Canadian startup Glissner are looking to enter a space that’s been thus far dominated by PhoneSoap, which was genuinely ahead of the curve on the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Targus’s keyboard may well have been the most widely reported-on UV solution of the show, because, well, it’s a bit wacky, with an ultraviolet lamp that sits above it.</p>
<p>Masks are another piece of the puzzle that have slowly been infiltrating the show, but really hit a fever pitch this year. Obviously wearing a face mask in public is only a new phenomenon in some countries &#8212; in other parts of the world like East Asia it’s long been a normal part of life. Last year, Portland-based Ao Air grabbed some headlines with its own take on the category.</p>

<p>Razer’s Project Hazel was undoubtedly the most prominent mask to debut at the show. It’s big and flashy and a bit of a diversion for a company that primarily trades in gaming peripherals. The N95 mask sports LEDs to indicate charging status and make the wearer’s face visible in dark surroundings. There’s also technology built in to make the wearer’s voice clearer. For the moment, however, it’s hard to see them as much beyond a headline grabber.</p>
<p>One piece I genuinely expected to see more of was remote work. We caught glimpses, like the Dell monitor with Microsoft Teams conferencing built in. Microsoft pitched its new Surface as a remote work machine, but frankly, it didn’t feel any more targeted at that vertical than any other portable Surface.</p>

<p>No doubt many of the innovations companies are working on will have to wait until CES 2022. Fingers crossed, we’ll see them next year in Vegas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp delays enforcement of a controversial privacy change, Apple may get rid of the Touch Bar in future MacBooks and Bumble files to go public. This is your Daily Crunch for January 15, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: WhatsApp responds to privacy backlash</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, WhatsApp sent users a notification asking them to consent to sharing some of their personal data — such as phone number and location — with Facebook (which owns WhatsApp). The alert also said users would have to agree to the terms by February 8 if they wanted to continue using the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This change prompted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">legal threats</a> and an investigation from <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">the Turkish government</a>. Now the company is pushing the enforcement date back three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp,&#8221; the company said in a post. &#8220;We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey finally <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690">responded publicly</a> to the company’s decision to ban President Trump from its platform, writing that Twitter had &#8220;faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance&#8221; and that he did not &#8220;feel pride&#8221; about the decision. In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called &#8220;bluesky,&#8221; which is aiming to build up an &#8220;open decentralized standard for social media&#8221; that Twitter is just one part of.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.</p>
<p>Bluesky is aiming to build a “durable” web standard that will ultimately ensure that platforms like Twitter have less centralized responsibility in deciding which users and communities have a voice on the internet. While this could protect speech from marginalized groups, it may also upend modern moderation techniques and efforts to prevent online radicalization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>What is bluesky?</h2>
<p>Just as Bitcoin lacks a central bank to control it, a decentralized social network protocol operates without central governance, meaning Twitter would only control its own app built on bluesky, not other applications on the protocol. The open and independent system would allow applications to see, search and interact with content across the entire standard. Twitter hopes that the project can go far beyond what the existing Twitter API offers, enabling developers to create applications with different interfaces or methods of algorithmic curation, potentially paying entities across the protocol like Twitter for plug-and-play access to different moderation tools or identity networks.</p>
<p>A widely adopted, decentralized protocol is an opportunity for social networks to &#8220;pass the buck&#8221; on moderation responsibilities to a broader network, one person involved with the early stages of bluesky suggests, allowing individual applications on the protocol to decide which accounts and networks its users are blocked from accessing.</p>
<p>Social platforms like Parler or Gab could theoretically rebuild their networks on bluesky, benefitting from its stability and the network effects of an open protocol. Researchers involved are also clear that such a system would also provide a meaningful measure against government censorship and protect the speech of marginalized groups across the globe.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s current scope is firmly in the research phase, people involved tell TechCrunch, with about 40-50 active members from different factions of the decentralized tech community surveying the software landscape and putting together proposals for what the protocol should ultimately look like. Twitter has told early members that it hopes to hire a project manager in the coming weeks to build out an independent team that will start crafting the protocol itself.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the initiative.</p>
<p>Bluesky&#8217;s initial members were invited by Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal early last year. It was later determined that the group should open the conversation up to folks representing some of the more recognizable decentralized network projects, including <a href="https://mastodon.social/about">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, which joined the working group hosted on the secure chat platform <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.</p>
<p>Jay Graber, founder of decentralized social platform <a href="https://happening.net/">Happening</a>, was paid by Twitter to write up a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem, an effort to &#8220;help Twitter evaluate the existing options in the space,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If [Twitter] wanted to design this thing, they could have just assigned a group of guys to do it, but there&#8217;s only one thing that this little tiny group of people could do better than Twitter, and that&#8217;s not be Twitter,&#8221; said Golda Velez, another member of the group who works as a senior software engineer at Postmates and co-founded <a href="https://civ.works/">civ.works</a>, <span class="lt-line-clamp__line">a privacy-centric social</span> <span class="lt-line-clamp__line lt-line-clamp__line--last">network for civic engagement.</span></p>
<p>The group has had some back and forth with Twitter executives on the scope of the project, eventually forming a Twitter-approved list of goals for the initiative. They define the challenges that the bluesky protocol should seek to address while also laying out what responsibilities are best left to the application creators building on the standard.</p>

<h2>Who is involved</h2>
<p>The pain points enumerated in the document, viewed by TechCrunch, encapsulate some of Twitter&#8217;s biggest shortcomings. They include &#8220;how to keep controversy and outrage from hijacking virality mechanisms,&#8221; as well as a desire to develop &#8220;customizable mechanisms&#8221; for moderation, though the document notes that the applications, not the overall protocol, are &#8220;ultimately liable for compliance, censorship, takedowns etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the solution to the problem of algorithms isn&#8217;t getting rid of algorithms &#8212; because sorting posts chronologically is an algorithm &#8212; the solution is to make it an open pluggable system by which you can go in and try different algorithms and see which one suits you or use the one that your friends like,&#8221; says Evan Henshaw-Plath, another member of the working group. He was one of Twitter&#8217;s earliest employees and has been building out his own decentralized social platform called <a href="https://planetary.social/">Planetary</a>.</p>
<p>His platform is based on the secure scuttlebutt protocol, which allows users to browse networks offline in an encrypted fashion. Early on, Planetary had been in talks with Twitter for a corporate investment as well as a personal investment from CEO Jack Dorsey, Henshaw-Plath says, but the competitive nature of the platform prompted some concern among Twitter&#8217;s lawyers and Planetary ended up receiving an investment from <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter co-founder Biz Stone&#8217;s venture fund Future Positive. Stone did not respond to interview requests.</span></p>
<p>After agreeing on goals, Twitter had initially hoped for the broader team to arrive at some shared consensus, but starkly different viewpoints within the group prompted Twitter to accept individual proposals from members. Some pushed Twitter to outright adopt or evolve an existing standard while others pushed for bluesky to pursue interoperability of standards early on and see what users naturally flock to.</p>
<p>One of the developers in the group hoping to bring bluesky onto their standard was Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko, who tells TechCrunch he sees the need for a major shift in how social media platforms operate globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning Trump was the right decision though it came a little bit too late. But at the same time, the nuance of the situation is that maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a single American company that decides these things,&#8221; Rochko tells us.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DKCvXCDwaA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">The deplatforming of President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=DKCvXCDwaA" data-secret="DKCvXCDwaA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like several of the other members in the group, Rochko has been skeptical at times about Twitter&#8217;s motivation with the bluesky protocol. Shortly after Dorsey&#8217;s initial announcement in 2019, Mastodon&#8217;s official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1204791506143457281?s=20">tweeted out a biting critique</a>, writing, &#8220;This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Mastodon is arguably one of the most mature decentralized social platforms. Rochko claims that the network of decentralized nodes has more than 2.3 million users spread across thousands of servers. In early 2017, the platform had its viral moment on Twitter, prompting an influx of &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of new users alongside some inquisitive potential investors whom Rochko has rebuffed in favor of a donation-based model.</p>

<h2>Inherent risks</h2>
<p>Not all of the attention Rochko has garnered has been welcome. In 2019, Gab, a social network favored by right-wing extremists, brought its entire platform onto the Mastodon network after integrating the platform&#8217;s open-source code, bringing Mastodon its single biggest web of users and its most undesirable liability all at once.</p>
<p>Rochko quickly disavowed the network and aimed to sever its ties to other nodes on the Mastodon platform and convince application creators to do the same. But a central fear of decentralization advocates was quickly realized, as the platform type&#8217;s first &#8220;success story&#8221; was a home for right-wing extremists.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ziyPJNEdaU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/embed/#?secret=ziyPJNEdaU" data-secret="ziyPJNEdaU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This fear has been echoed in decentralized communities this week as app store owners and networks have taken another right-wing social network, Parler, off the web after violent content surfaced on the site in the lead-up to and aftermath of riots at the U.S. Capitol, leaving some developers fearful that the social network may set up home on their decentralized standard.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Fascists are 100% going to use peer-to-peer technologies, they already are and they&#8217;re going to start using it more&#8230; If they get pushed off of mainstream infrastructure or people are surveilling them really closely, they&#8217;re going to have added motivation,&#8221; said Emmi Bevensee, a researcher <a href="https://emmibevensee.com/">studying</a> extremist presences on decentralized networks. &#8220;Maybe the far-right gets stronger footholds on peer-to-peer before the people who think the far-right is bad do because they were effectively pushed off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A central concern is that commoditizing decentralized platforms through efforts like bluesky will provide a more accessible route for extremists kicked off current platforms to maintain an audience and provide casual internet users a less janky path towards radicalization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peer-to-peer technology is generally not that seamless right now. Some of it is; you can buy Bitcoin in Cash App now, which, if anything, is proof that this technology is going to become much more mainstream and adoption is going to become much more seamless,&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Bevensee told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;In the current era of this mass exodus from Parler, they&#8217;re obviously going to lose a huge amount of audience that isn&#8217;t dedicated enough to get on IPFS. Scuttlebutt is a really cool technology but it&#8217;s not as seamless as Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m55kWv4kq2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/">Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/embed/#?secret=m55kWv4kq2" data-secret="m55kWv4kq2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Extremists adopting technologies that promote privacy and strong encryption is far from a new phenomenon, encrypted chat apps like Signal and Telegram have been at the center of such controversies in recent years. Bevensee notes the tendency of right-wing extremist networks to adopt decentralized network tech has been &#8220;extremely demoralizing&#8221; to those early developer communities &#8212; though she notes that the same technologies can and do benefit &#8220;marginalized people all around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though people connected to bluesky&#8217;s early moves see a long road ahead for the protocol&#8217;s development and adoption, they also see an evolving landscape with Parler and President Trump&#8217;s recent deplatforming that they hope will drive other stakeholders to eventually commit to integrating with the standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right at this moment I think that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of incentive to adopt, and I don&#8217;t just mean by end users, I mean by platforms, because Twitter is not the only one having these really thorny moderation problems,&#8221; Velez says. &#8220;I think people understand that this is a critical moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mr. Lore retires on January 31, 2021, the U.S. business, including all the aspects of US retail eCommerce, will continue to report to John Furner, Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., beginning on February 1, 2021,&#8221; Walmart said in a filing.</p>
<p>Walmart has continued to push ahead with a number of tech-related initiatives, including the launch of a new business that will focus on developing financial services.</p>
<p>That initiative is being undertaken through a strategic partnership with the fintech investment firm, Ribbit Capital and adds to a startup tech portfolio that also includes the incubator Store N⁰8, <a href="https://www.storeno8.com/the-l8est/how-to-better-serve-the-consumer-of-the-future-starting-today">which launched in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reflecting on the past few years with so much pride – Walmart changed my life and the work we did together will keep changing the lives of customers for years to come. It has been an honor to be a part of the Walmart family and I look forward to providing advice and ideas in the future,&#8221; Lore said in a statement posted to Linkedin. &#8220;Looking forward, I’ll be taking some time off and plan to continue working with several startups. Excited to keep you all up to date on what’s next.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase has a problem. As interest in bitcoin has soared along with its price, the popular cryptocurrency exchange has found itself the target of a growing spate of angry customers who haven&#8217;t been able to access customer service.</p>
<p>A quick look at Twitter tells the story. As one upset user of the service ranted earlier today: &#8220;Multiple issues over the last month which cost me $$$ several open cases and 0% response?? When are you going to help me or is it easier to just forget. This wont be so easy when your publicly traded. Will be following up with [SEC] soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many (many) similar complaints to be found.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, this editor asked the company this week for more insight into its customer service operations after emailing its support staff more than a half dozen times and tweeting once over 10 days, and receiving no response. (I bought one unit of Ether in 2018 on the platform and wanted to access my account, which I&#8217;d been locked out of nearly two years ago.)</p>
<p>To its credit, Coinbase today<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/committing-to-better-customer-service-during-this-time-of-heightened-interest-in-the-cryptoeconomy-5dc2637c4fa7"> issued a statement</a>, promising to do better. Its VP of customer success, Casper Sorenson, wrote on the company&#8217;s blog that Coinbase is &#8220;committing to a better customer experience during this time of heightened interest in the cryptoeconomy.&#8221;  The company says it is adding more people to its team; adding more self-service options (there are startling few); expanding its &#8220;help center&#8221;; and launching a new educational site, Coinbase Learn, &#8220;as a one-stop-shop for first timers, experienced investors, and everyone in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most meaningful perhaps, Coinbase says that in the coming months, it will begin offering live messaging with Coinbase representatives, which is not currently an option. Indeed, Coinbase does not offer live support of any kind. A help support phone line is only available to users wanting to freeze their accounts, and it is automated. (The flip side of its slow customer response times may tie to the apparent seriousness with which Coinbase, which works closely with regulated banks, <a href="https://blockonomi.com/is-coinbase-safe/">takes security issues</a>.)</p>

<p>Still, the company will have to do far more for its increasingly mainstream users as a publicly traded outfit, both because regulators will undoubtedly take a greater interest in its unhappy customers and because it will otherwise lose existing and potential clients to rivals, of which there are a growing array, from the international payment giant PayPal, which is now seeing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/paypals-cryptocurrency-trading-volume-soars-past-242m-in-24-hours/">record daily cryptocurrency trading</a>, to investment brokers like Robinhood. (Another increasingly popular option: digital asset <a href="https://craft.co/grayscale/competitors">managers</a> like Grayscale, whose trusts are publicly traded over the counter.)</p>
<p>More attention to the issue appears overdue. While Coinbase has presumably been dealing with a surge in complaints that corresponds with the volatility of Bitcoin&#8217;s ups and downs, customer service has been an ongoing issue for the nearly nine-year-old, San Francisco outfit, which filed its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-files-confidentially-for-ipo-aiming-for-major-crypto-industry-milestone-195758729.html">confidential form</a> with the SEC in December to go public and says it has 35 million users in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mashable obtained <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sec-coinbase-complaints-fraud/">134 pages of complaints</a> filed to the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight following a five-month FOIA process, and the picture that emerged was &#8220;not of a responsible actor in the cryptocurrency space opening the market to new investors, but rather a company overwhelmed by and underprepared for its own success,&#8221; the outlet reported at the time.</p>
<p>Asked today, among other things, how Coinbase&#8217;s processes have since changed, how many of its more than 1,200 employees are focused on customer support, and whether the outfit could share its latest customer numbers, Coinbase, currently in its SEC-mandated quiet period, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Coinbase has raised $547.3 million in venture backing over the years, according to Crunchbase. Tiger Global Management, which is currently raising up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tiger-global-is-raising-a-new-3-75-billion-venture-fund-one-year-after-closing-its-last/">$3.75 billion for its newest fund</a>, led Coinbase&#8217;s company&#8217;s most recent private round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">$300 million Series E financing</a> that closed in 2018 and assigned Coinbase a post-money valuation of $8 billion.</p>
<p>Last September, the company parted ways with more than 5% of its employees, after cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong publicly discouraged employee activism and political discussions at work, then offered severance to staffers who were uncomfortable with the policy.</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-follow-up-to-coinbase-as-a-mission-focused-company-6e7545e9aea2">60 people</a> took the company up on the offer, Coinbase itself later revealed.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launching is easy; fundraising is harder.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to be a partner at two different VC firms over the past nine years, and we’ve grown AUM 10x both times.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, taking the 15 steps below will help build the core of a high-performing fundraising and investor relations function.</p>
<h2>1. Build the firm as much as possible before soliciting LPs</h2>
<p>The more baked you are, the more investable you are. The best possible move is to invest in and warehouse some special purpose vehicles that fit your strategy. However, that may distract you from the larger goal of raising a fund, not just a special purpose vehicle.</p>
<p>The next best move is to build your core team, e.g., recruit an advisory board, venture partners and EIRs. Lastly, gather feedback. Yohei Nakajima, founder of <a href="http://Untapped.vc">Untapped.vc</a>, said, “Before pitching LPs and building my firm, I talked with over 50 people I knew to get feedback.”</p>
<h2>2. Set up a basic marketing toolkit: Deck, website and social media</h2>
<p>It’s virtually mandatory to develop a detailed, data-backed deck and ideally a video pitch. Your materials should ideally meet the <a href="http://teten.com/lpdd">expectations</a> of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, even if you’re not targeting institutions. Keep these documents constantly up to date, so all team members are aligned on key numbers, e.g., total dollars raised so far. You’ll look unprofessional if you’re not coordinated.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, almost no one invests based on a deck; they want to talk with the people. However, a high-credibility deck opens the door to a meeting where you then have the chance to sell yourself.</p>
<p>Note that limited partners view formatting as a proxy for professionalism. It’s worth investing a little money in a graphic designer who can design a consistent website, business card, logo and presentation templates.</p>
<p>Richard Dukas, CEO, <a href="https://www.dlpr.com/">Dukas Linden Public Relations</a>, said, “If you don&#8217;t have a website and have no material online presence, you likely won&#8217;t get past the first hurdle with potential investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you’re fundraising, you’re selling a luxury good. The less widely marketed your fund, the more valuable it is perceived to be. For example, one LP told me she prefers to receive customized emails from fund principals, as opposed to a bulk-mailed quarterly update. An extreme example of this are venture capitalists who don’t even bother with a website, e.g., <a href="http://www.benchmark.com/">Benchmark</a> and <a href="https://www.thrivecap.com/">Thrive Capital</a>. They are the equivalent of a nightclub with an unmarked door, but other investors will need to <a href="https://teten.com/PE-social">shape up their social media tech stack</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Make your online profile data-driven and internally consistent</h2>
<p>All team members should have internally consistent and professional profiles on Linkedin at a minimum and typically also on Twitter, Facebook and/or other platforms you use. In particular, highlight the metrics by which you measured <a href="http://teten.com/resume">your past activities</a>: size of exit, number of people you managed, budget you were responsible for, etc.</p>
<h2>4. Set up a data room with a completed due diligence questionnaire</h2>
<p>Among the most important information to include: details on return history, legal documents, fund organization chart, <a href="https://medium.com/@eniacvc/seed-fund-portfolio-construction-for-dummies-9ec5b4d152dc">portfolio construction model</a>, portfolio company one-pagers, key personnel resumes and case studies of past investments. We are using <a href="http://digify.com">Digify</a> to manage this.</p>
<h2>5. Prepare FAQs for prospective LPs</h2>
<p>You will inevitably receive a wide range of one-off questions from potential LPs. Make sure to compile all your answers in a single document so that you can recycle and refine these answers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a>, a startup that digitizes textbooks and turns them into an interactive experience for college students, announced on Wednesday that it has acquired yet another business: Fountainhead Press. The acquisition marks Top Hat’s third scoop of a publishing company in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Consolidation is going to be huge in the next few years for edtech, as bigger players raise enough financing (and gain profits) to be able to afford other businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Top Hat’s whole business proposition is a subtweet to Zoom University: It wants to make learning an active, online experience and completely digital. That focus has let them reach 3.5 million students and thousands of universities. With a new acquisition, Top Hat is bringing more content into its fold, and with it, more customers who need a better solution to a dusty textbook.</p>
<p>I caught up with Top Hat CEO and founder <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilagadze?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mike Silagadze</a> to understand what has triggered this string of content acquisitions. While the M&amp;A isn’t tech-focused, we can learn about how a well-funded edtech startup is navigating the early innings of 2021.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about the shift from offline to online, edtech’s consolidation environment and why the “sell to Pearson or bust” mindset might officially be out the door for the sector.</p>
<h2><strong>Offline to online</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Group Nine Media <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/group-nine-spac/">revealed last month</a> that it was forming a SPAC (short for special purpose acquisition corporation) in order to raise money for acquisitions.</p>
<p>The company has now moved forward with those plans, announcing last night that it had priced the SPAC&#8217;s IPO at $10 per unit, to raise a total of $200 million. It&#8217;s now trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GNACU; as of 2:53 p.m. Eastern shares were up 6.55%. (Eventually, the Class A common stock will be listed as GNAC and warrants will be listed separately as GNACW.) The offering is expected to close on January 20.</p>
<p>The acquisition corporation, like Group Nine itself, is led by CEO Ben Lerer (pictured above). Imagination Capital Partner Richard D. Parsons and Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong are also on the board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Group Nine was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/group-nine-media/">formed in 2016</a> with backing from Discovery, merging Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo and Seeker. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/group-nine-acquires-popsugar/">subsequently acquired PopSugar</a>, with co-founder Brian Sugar becoming president of both Group Nine and now Group Nine Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>SPACs, also known as blank-check corporations, have become an increasingly popular way for companies to raise money from the public markets. In its initial filing, Group Nine said it would use the funding &#8220;for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve got an Apple TV+ trial that&#8217;s set to expire sometime between now and June, good news: you&#8217;re getting some free bonus time.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ first launched in November of 2019, alongside a one-year free trial for anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV or Mac. As those initial trials approached their end, Apple voluntarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/apple-is-extending-some-appletv-subs-through-february-2021-for-free/">extended them out to February of 2021</a>. Now they&#8217;re extending them once again.</p>
<p>As first reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-again-extends-apple-tv-free-trials-subscribers-now-get-free-access-until-july-2021/">by 9to5Mac</a>, any trial that previously would&#8217;ve expired from February to June of 2021 will now expire in July instead. We have confirmed these plans with Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users should expect to get an email about the extension in the coming weeks. If you&#8217;re already paying for AppleTV+ or have it as part of an Apple One bundle, meanwhile, you&#8217;ll be getting a $4.99 per month credit until the end of June.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, take this as an opportunity to blast through Ted Lasso, which is probably the most charming thing anyone has made for TV in a decade. Central Park is also great, though it has yet to hook me in quite the same way as Loren Bouchard&#8217;s other series (Bob&#8217;s Burgers, Home Movies).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Desktop Metal this morning announced its intention to purchase fellow 3D printing company EnvisionTEC. Founded in Germany in 2002, EnvisionTEC specializes in photopolymer additive manufacturing, putting its technology in more direct competition with the likes of 3D printing darling Carbon than Desktop Metal’s own existing portfolio.</p>
<p>The deal follows Desktop Metal’s push to go public last August as part of a growing trend of SPAC mergers. Prior to this, the company had raised no shortage of its own funds, with a rapid ascent into unicorn status on the wake of $430 million in investments. It’s spending $300 million to acquire EnvisionTEC through a combination of cash and stock.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of potential for Desktop Metal to grow here. EnvisionTEC has the underlying technology with the ability to print in more than 190 materials, and Desktop Metal has the resources to help scale that tech beyond what the German company has been able to build thus far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s clear that dental is a pretty huge piece of this puzzle. It’s among the clearest and most immediate use cases for this sort of mass volume 3D printing &#8212; and, indeed, the company already sports around 1,000 customers in dental, including companies like Smile Direct Club. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the company effectively tripled its Envision One dental shipments over the previous year.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s used for everything from restorations to same-day, full arch implants,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop tells TechCrunch. “Usually when you get a denture, you’ve got to wait three weeks for denture implants. This is the first time you&#8217;ve got a solution that can do it in the same day. And it’s affordable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturinghttps:/www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005221/en/Desktop-Metal-to-Acquire-EnvisionTEC-Entering-Market-for-Volume-Production-Polymer-Additive-Manufacturing">Per a press release</a> issued in the wake of the news, other existing customers include Ford and Hasbro. Fulop says the company will continue to operate as its own division after the acquisition, which is expected to close this quarter.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to leverage their channel,” the executive says. “We look forward to expanding on that capability and using our channel to give them more tools to have a full solution that spans from metal to composites to biomaterials and now photopolymer printing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said on Friday that it won&#8217;t enforce the planned update to its data-sharing policy until May 15, weeks after news about the new terms created confusion among its users, exposed the Facebook app to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/">a potential lawsuit</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/11/turkey-investigates-whatsapp-and-facebook-over-data-privacy-update">triggered a nationwide investigation</a> and drove tens of millions of its loyal fans to explore alternative messaging apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms. No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We&#8217;re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,&#8221; the firm said in a blog post.</p>
<p>The messaging app, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">serves more than two billion users</a>, said it was delaying the enforcement of the new terms, which it first unveiled last year, over confusion it has created worldwide. The delay of the planned privacy update is aimed at providing users with more time to review the terms, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There&#8217;s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,&#8221; said the company, which earlier this week ran full-page ads on several newspapers in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">amassed over 450 million monthly active users</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097220" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2097220 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg 1199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=768,300 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=680,265 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/whatsapp-app-update.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097220" class="wp-caption-text">For years, WhatsApp has been attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on its app. Now, it&#8217;s attempting to debunk falsehoods about WhatsApp itself. Image Credits: WhatsApp </p></div></p>
<p>Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp had asked users earlier this month to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.</p>
<p>The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp also <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">clarified</a> this week was not the case. WhatsApp, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014</a>, has been sharing some limited information about its users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">with the social giant since 2016</a> &#8212; and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these updates, none of that is changing. Instead, the update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,&#8221; WhatsApp wrote today.</p>
<p>Following the backlash, tens of millions of confused and angered users have flocked to Signal and Telegram. As of earlier this week, Signal was the top app on the App Store in 40 nations and Google Play Store in 18.</p>
<p>In an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/"> interview with TechCrunch earlier this week</a>, Signal co-founder and executive chairman Brian Acton (who also co-founded WhatsApp) said “the smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes. We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> CEO Jeff Lawson knows a thing or two about unleashing developers. His company has garnered a market cap of almost $60 billion by creating a set of tools to make it easy for programmers to insert a whole host of communications functionality into an application with a couple of lines of code. Given that background, perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Lawson has written a book called <a href="https://www.askyourdeveloper.com/">&#8220;Ask Your Developer,&#8221;</a> which hit the stores this week.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Lawson&#8217;s basic philosophy is that if you can build it, you should.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Lawson&#8217;s basic philosophy in the book is that if you can build it, you should. In every company, there is build versus buy calculus that goes into every software decision. Lawson believes deeply that there is incredible power in building yourself instead of purchasing something off the shelf. By using components like the ones from his company, and many others delivering specialized types functionality via API, you can build what your customers need instead of just buying what the vendors are giving you.</p>
<p>While Lawson recognizes this isn&#8217;t always possible, he says that by asking your developers, you can begin to learn when it makes sense to build and when it doesn&#8217;t. These discussions should stem from customer problems and companies should seek digital solutions with the input of the developer group.</p>
<h2>Building great customer experiences</h2>
<p>Lawson posits that you can build a better customer experience because you understand your customers so much more  acutely than a generic vendor ever could. &#8220;Basically, what you see happening across nearly every industry is that the companies that are able to listen to their customers and hear what the customers need and then build really great digital products and experiences &#8212; well, they tend to win the hearts, minds and wallets of their customers,&#8221; Lawson told me in an interview about the book this week.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095469" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095469" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095469" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?w=680" alt="Billboard for book Ask your Developer by Jeff Lawson, CEO of Twilio" width="680" height="321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg 3283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=768,363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=680,321 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=1536,725 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=2048,967 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TWILLIO_101_BILLBOARD1-edit.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095469" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twilio (image has been cropped)</p></div></p>
<p>He says that this has caused a shift in how companies perceive IT departments. They have gone from cost centers that provision laptops and buy HR software to something more valuable, helping produce digital products that have a direct impact on the business&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>He uses banking as an example in the book. It used to be you judged a bank by a set of criteria like how nice the lobby was, if the tellers were friendly and if they gave your kid a free lollipop. Today, that&#8217;s all changed and it&#8217;s all about the quality of the mobile app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays your bank is a mobile app and you like your bank if the software is fast, if it is bug free and if they regularly update it with new features and functionality that makes your life better [ … ]. And that same transformation has been happening in nearly every industry and so when you think about it, you can&#8217;t buy differentiation if every bank just bought the same mobile app from some vendor and just off the shelf deployed it,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>, an anti-harassment startup that aims to help folks feel safer on social media founded by Tracy Chou, launched today. Currently only available for Twitter, Block Party helps people filter out the content they don&#8217;t want to see and into what Block Party calls the Lockout Folder. That&#8217;s where all of the filtered-out content lives in the event you want to review it later.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important to still acknowledge that these people exist,&#8221; Chou told me.</p>
<p>If you pretend like it doesn&#8217;t exist, you might miss out on useful information or genuine connections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s a lot of good stuff that would get lost there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a reason we use public platforms like Twitter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the more negative side, she said, you still may need to check periodically to see if there&#8217;s someone threatening your physical safety.</p>
<p>Helpers play a big part of the Block Party experience. You can grant a trusted helper access to your Lockout Folder to let you know if there&#8217;s anything useful in there, or to simply block the trolls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot easier for someone else to help you process it and flag something that is a concern,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be able to share that burden. The current design of most of these platforms is to put the burden of dealing with it solely on the person who’s being abused.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Lockout Folder also serves as a record-keeping tool in the event you need to present evidence of your harassment to a company, a lawyer or someone else.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097150" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097150" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2097150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png 985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-10.44.51-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Block Party</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really about trying to make people&#8217;s lives easier,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just so painful to have to see the abuse again when you&#8217;re filing the report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block Party emerged from Chou&#8217;s own experiences working at platform companies like Facebook and Quora, as well as her experience as an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. At Quora, the block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform, Chou told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that perspective of having been on the inside and seeing how product and engineering teams work,&#8221; Chou said. &#8220;But also being a DEI activist and seeing how lack of representation on teams has impacted product decisions for the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Block Party is only available for Twitter users, the goal is to add other platforms and help folks address harassers that target them across multiple platforms. Block Party is currently free but plans to introduce subscription tiers. Still, Chou said she envisions the free version always existing.</p>
<p>To date, Block Party has raised a little less than $1.5 million in funding. Its lead pre-seed round was led by Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures. Other investors include Alexia Bonatsos, Ellen Pao, Alex Stamos and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch agreed to keep the identity of the terminated employee confidential due to fears of his and his family’s safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his firing led to employees circulating an internal letter asking GitHub to denounce white supremacy and Nazis. The employees also wanted answers about his firing. That led to GitHub CEO Nat Friedman telling employees the company would investigate the termination of the employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the terminated employee says he is currently seeking counsel to ensure his family is protected, as well as figure out if he can receive damages or some other form of reconciliation. The fired employee said GitHub has reached out to him for help in the internal investigation, but is waiting to engage with the company until he has legal representation in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, he said he is not optimistic about the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am 90% sure it’s not genuine,” the terminated employee said of Friedman’s response. “This type of stuff had been said before. It happened with the ICE stuff where the company said let’s have discussions but then if you mention ICE, you get fired. I used to believe in this company, but now I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to what some employees are asking, the terminated employee sees this as an opportunity for GitHub to take a stance on white supremacy.</span></p>
<p>He said, &#8220;I feel like this could be an opportunity for GitHub to really do a purge and say ‘Do we want white supremacists at this company and how do we get Black leaders into executive management?’ &#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is something he said he’s been asking for since he joined GitHub. But as he kept talking about the lack of diversity at the leadership level, he said he found his job at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I kept talking about it, I got threatened being fired in October,” he said. “Both my managers had to come completely to my defense and beg them not to fire me when I pointed out how the sales team maybe has just two people of color.”</span></p>
<p>In a blanket statement to TechCrunch about the contents of this article, a GitHub spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We take all complaints of this nature very seriously. We are actively investigating the situation.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon his termination, the former employee said the company gave him two paychecks and sent him on his way. He said he would be open to some form of reconciliation, whether in the form of damages, healthcare coverage or something else. While he’s not looking for his job back, he says he would like to see more worker power at GitHub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I had a magic wand, I’d love for the employees at GitHub to be able to have a union and represent people from marginalized communities,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The United States’ GPS system, which is operated by the Defense Department, offers every one of us critical infrastructure around what is known as positioning, navigation and timing (PNT). Positioning and navigation is obvious every time we open up a maps app, but timing is also a critical function of GPS — offering our smartphones and devices precision timing to ensure that compute processes are accurately synced.</p>
<p>As more of the economy relies on these systems, they have increasingly <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/15/131940/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai/">become a target of hackers through GPS spoofing</a>. The government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/">wants to create additional redundancy and resiliency in the sector</a>, and has explored using commercial alternatives to augment or backup parts of the GPS system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump administration aims to protect GPS with new exec order&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/trump-administration-aims-to-protect-gps-with-new-exec-order/embed/#?secret=TBo0kr4pSJ" data-secret="TBo0kr4pSJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Department of Transportation, under a congressional mandate added to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2018, ran a comprehensive evaluation of commercial alternatives to government-owned and operated GPS that could serve as a backup to our existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Among the 11 companies considered in the study were a number of prominent positioning startups, including Satelles, which raised a $26 million round of capital in 2019; NextNav, which has raised a total of nearly $300 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/nextnav-raises-120m-to-deploy-its-indoor-positioning-tech-to-find-people-in-skyscrapers/">including $120 million from Fortress a year ago</a>; and Hellen Systems, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hellen-systems/company_financials">which according to Crunchbase</a> raised a small seed round last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-01/NTRSA%20Report%20to%20Congress_Final_January%202021.pdf">You can read the full report from the DOT</a>, which runs to 457 pages and covers all 14 measures the researchers explored in evaluating these different PNT platforms.</p>
<p>The summary, though, is that there are a number of companies that offer decent backup capabilities for GPS, although the performance and cost vary widely. NextNav came out furthest ahead according to the researchers, who stated that “All [Technology Readiness Level]-qualified vendors demonstrated at least some PNT performance of value, but only one vendor, NextNav, demonstrated in all applicable use case scenarios.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, the DOT researchers said that “… none of the systems can universally backup the positioning and navigation capabilities provided by GPS and its augmentations.” Given the range of needs that GPS fulfills, they recommended that “a diverse universe of positioning and navigation technologies” be used to add resiliency in this infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, costs remain quite complicated to determine. Given the way that different positioning systems operate, the fixed and variable costs for each system are highly dependent on desired coverage area and necessary transmitter density. The researchers weren’t able to devise a clear opinion on the cost effectiveness of different systems, although they do offer some initial data that can provide early insight.</p>
<p>Given the importance of GPS and the desire for companies and the government to have reliable alternatives, VCs have dumped money on the PNT sector in recent years. Now, we have some hard data on which vendors are potentially picking up steam in terms of functionality and utility.</p>

<p>The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/whitney-wolfe-herd-bumbles-founder-doesnt-care-what-shes-supposed-to-do/">launched by a former co-founder of the IAC-owned Tinder</a>, plans to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange, using the ticker symbol &#8220;BMBL.&#8221; Bumble&#8217;s planned IPO was first reported<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/"> in December</a>.</p>

<p>Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd was on the founding team at Tinder before starting Bumble. She <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/tinder-and-iac-settle-sexual-harassment-suit-with-early-employee-whitney-wolfe/">filed suit against Tinder</a> for sexual harassment and discrimination, which was at least somewhat inspirational in her quest to build a dating app that put women in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>In 2019, Wolfe Herd took the helm of MagicLab, renamed to Bumble Group, in a $3 billion deal with Blackstone, replacing Badoo founder and CEO Andrey Andreev following a harassment scandal at the firm.</p>
<p>The company is targeting the public markets at a particularly heady time for new offerings, with <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; border-bottom-color: #00a562;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">investors embracing </a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">venture-backed IPOs throughout late 2020 and the start of 2021</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Previously privately held companies like Airbnb, Affirm and others have seen their fortunes soar on the back of prices that public investors are willing to pay, perhaps inducing more IPO filings than the market might have otherwise seen.</span></p>
<p>You can read its IPO filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830043/000119312521009745/d20761ds1.htm">here</a>. TechCrunch will have its usual tear-down of the document later today, but we have pulled some top-line numbers for you to kick off your own research.</p>
<p>But before we do, the company&#8217;s board makeup, namely that it is over 70% women, is <a href="https://twitter.com/lesliepicker/status/1350119329606606849?s=21">already drawing plaudits</a>. Now, into its numbers.</p>
<h2>Inside Bumble&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider Bumble from three perspectives: Usage, financial results and ownership.</p>
<p>On the usage front, Bumble is popular, as you would imagine a dating service would have to be to reach the scale required to go public. The company claims 42 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q3 2020 &#8212; many companies will try to get public on the strength of their third-quarter results from 2020, as it takes time to close Q4 and the full calendar year.</p>
<p>Those 42 million MAUs translated into 2.4 million total paying users through the first nine months of 2020; the percent, then, of paying users to MAUs is not 2.4 million divided by 42, but a smaller fraction.</p>
<p>Turning to the numbers, recall that Bumble sold a majority of itself a few years back. We bring that up as Bumble&#8217;s financial results are complicated thanks to its ownership structure.</p>
<p>After the IPO, Bumble Inc. will &#8220;be a holding company, and its sole material asset will be a controlling equity interest in Bumble Holdings,&#8221; per the S-1 filing. So, how is Bumble Holdings doing?</p>
<p>Medium? Doing the sums ourselves as the company&#8217;s S- 1 is fraught with accounting nuances, in the first nine months of 2019, Bumble managed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues of $362.6 million</li>
<li>Net income of $68.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, combining two columns to provide a similar set of results for the same period of 2020, Bumble recorded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues of $416.6 million</li>
<li>Net income of -$116.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>For those following along, we&#8217;re using the &#8220;Net (loss) earnings&#8221; line, for profitability, and not the &#8220;Net (loss) earnings attributable to owners / shareholders&#8221; as that would require even more explanation and we&#8217;re keeping it simple in this first look.</p>
<p>While Bumble saw modest growth in 2020 through Q3 and a sharp swing to losses on a GAAP basis, the company&#8217;s adjusted profitability grew over the same time period. The company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA, a very non-GAAP metric, expanded from $80.0 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to $108.3 million in the same period of 2020.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GOclutbA2n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/">A theory about the current IPO market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A theory about the current IPO market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/a-theory-about-the-current-ipo-market/embed/#?secret=GOclutbA2n" data-secret="GOclutbA2n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While we are generally willing to allow quickly growing companies some leniency when it comes to adjusted metrics, the gap between Bumble&#8217;s GAAP losses and its EBITDA results is a stress-test of our compassion. Bumble also swung from free cash flow positivity during the first nine months of 2019 to the first quarters of 2020.</p>
<p>If you extrapolate Bumble&#8217;s Q1, Q2 and Q3 revenue to a full-year number, the company could manage $555.5 million in 2020 revenues. Even at a modest software-ish multiple, the company would be worth more than the $3 billion figure that we discussed before.</p>
<p>However, its sharp unprofitability in 2020 could damper its eventual valuation. More as we dig more deeply into the filing.</p>
<p>Finally, on the ownership question, the company&#8217;s filing is surprisingly denuded of data. Its principal shareholder section looks like this:</p>

<p>When we know more, we&#8217;ll share more. Until then, happy S-1 reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://www.getmoss.com/en">Moss</a> has raised a $25.5 million (€21 million) funding round led by Valar Ventures. Existing investors Cherry Ventures and Global Founders Capital are also participating. Moss provides credit cards and a spending platform to small and medium businesses in Germany.</p>
<p>The company has developed its own risk engine to come up with a credit card limit for your company. Like <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> in the U.S., Moss promises higher credit card limits compared to credit cards offered by traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Again, Moss doesn’t offer prepaid or debit cards — it focuses on credit cards. You can spend within your limit and pay at the end of the month. You don’t need to top up your Moss account to start using it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Credit cards work on the Mastercard network. Admins can issue a physical card for each employee or each team. You can also issue virtual cards for online payments and subscriptions. You can set different limits for each card.</p>
<p>From the administration panel, you can track expenses, search for specific expenses and see your ongoing subscriptions — it helps you identify duplicates. Users can attach receipts and information to each transaction for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>The company has issued 1,000 credit cards and has processes 10,000 transactions so far. Right now, its clients include startups and tech companies. But Moss expects to expand to other industries soon thanks to today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Moss competes with <a href="https://www.spendesk.com/en-eu/">Spendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/">Revolut Business</a> and others. These corporate card products focus on debit cards. Let’s see if offering credit cards turns out to be an important differentiating feature.</p>
