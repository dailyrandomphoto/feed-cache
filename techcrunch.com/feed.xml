										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is facing a fresh pair of antitrust probes in Europe.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the EU&#8217;s Competition Commission both announced formal investigations into the social media giant&#8217;s operations today &#8212; with what&#8217;s likely to have been co-ordinated timing.</p>
<p>The competition regulators will scrutinize how Facebook uses data from advertising customers and users of its single sign-on tool &#8212; specifically looking at whether it uses this data as an unfair lever against competitors in markets such as classified ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair also said they will seek to work closely together as their independent investigations progress.</p>
<p>With the UK outside the European trading bloc (post-Brexit), the national competition watchdog has a freer rein to pursue investigations that may be similar to or overlap with antitrust probes the EU is also undertaking.</p>
<p>And the two Facebook investigations do appear similar on the surface &#8212; with both broadly focused on how Facebook uses advertising data. (Though outcomes could of course differ.)</p>
<p>The danger for Facebook, here, is that a higher dimension of scrutiny will be applied to its business as a result of dual regulatory action &#8212; with the opportunity for joint working and cross-referencing of its responses (not to mention a little investigative competition between the UK and the EU&#8217;s agencies).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-facebook-s-use-of-ad-data">CMA</a> said it&#8217;s looking at whether Facebook has gained an unfair advantage over competitors in providing services for online classified ads and online dating through how it gathers and uses certain data.</p>
<p>Specifically, the UK&#8217;s regulator said it&#8217;s concerned that Facebook might have gained an unfair advantage over competitors providing services for online classified ads and online dating.</p>
<p>Facebook plays in both spaces of course, via Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Dating respectively.</p>
<p>In a statement on its action, CMA CEO, Andrea Coscelli, said: &#8220;We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors. Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European Commission&#8217;s investigation will &#8212; similarly &#8212; focus on whether Facebook violated the EU&#8217;s competition rules by using advertising data gathered from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where it is active.</p>
<p>Although it only cites classified ads as its example of the neighbouring market of particular concern for its probe.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s probe has another element, though, as it said it&#8217;s also looking at whether Facebook ties its online classified ads service to its social network in breach of the bloc&#8217;s competition rules.</p>
<p>In a separate (national) action, Germany&#8217;s competition authority opened a similar probe into Facebook tying Oculus to use of a Facebook account at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">end of last year</a>. So Facebook now has multiple antitrust probes on its plate in Europe, adding to its woes from the massive states antitrust lawsuit filed against it on home turf also back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">December 2020</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bdzzKS72FW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/embed/#?secret=bdzzKS72FW" data-secret="bdzzKS72FW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;When advertising their services on Facebook, companies, which also compete directly with Facebook, may provide it commercially valuable data. Facebook might then use this data in order to compete against the companies which provided it,&#8221; the Commission noted in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2848">press release</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This applies in particular to online classified ads providers, the platforms on which many European consumers buy and sell products. Online classified ads providers advertise their services on Facebook&#8217;s social network. At the same time, they compete with Facebook&#8217;s own online classified ads service, &#8216;Facebook Marketplace&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission added that a preliminary investigation it already undertook has raised concerns Facebook is distorting the market for online classified ads services. It will now take an in-depth look in order to make a full judgement on whether the social media behemoth is breaking EU competition rules.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, who also heads up competition policy for the bloc, added: “Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups. We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today&#8217;s digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Reached for comment on the latest European antitrust probes, Facebook sent us this statement:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are always developing new and better services to meet evolving demand from people who use Facebook. Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices and both products operate in a highly competitive environment with many large incumbents. We will continue to cooperate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Up til now, Facebook has been a bit of a blind spot for the Commission&#8217;s competition authority &#8212; with multiple investigations and enforcements chalked up by the bloc against other tech giants, such as (most notably) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/europe-lays-out-antitrust-case-against-amazons-use-of-big-data/">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>But Vestager&#8217;s Facebook &#8216;dry patch&#8217; has now formally come to an end. (The EU&#8217;s informal investigation into Facebook Marketplace had been ongoing since March 2019.)</p>
<p>The CMA, meanwhile, is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">wider pro-competition regulatory reforms</a> aimed squarely at tech giants like Facebook and Google under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">a UK plan to clip the wings of the adtech duopoly</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Guest articles are hugely popular with our startup audience — if the topics are right.</p>
<p>Prospective authors regularly ask us about which topics Extra Crunch subscribers would like to hear more about. Here are some pointers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How-tos:</strong> Generally, early-stage founders want the latest useful information about how to create a company, including fundraising, growth and team-building. What has been changing in your area of expertise that would surprise people who have done a startup or two before?</li>
<li><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Market analysis:</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Our readers want to learn more about the latest developments in emerging technology sectors from people who have some sort of special viewpoint into the action. They want comprehensive posts that paint a clear picture of the companies, products and services that characterize individual tech sectors today. The focus can range from tech being applied to old-line industries or being used to create entirely new categories.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas? Submit to <a href="mailto:guestcolumns@techcrunch.com">guestcolumns@techcrunch.com</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, we are especially interested in submissions from authors who have expertise in the following subtopics:</p>
<h2>Growth marketing</h2>
<p>By definition, nearly every startup that has figured out its product-market fit is trying to grow fast. Our audience always wants to hear the latest ideas that they might be able to apply, too. Whether it&#8217;s related to SEO, content, email, social or other marketing channels, they&#8217;re looking for granular advice that can help them find and engage the right users. <strong>Founders and investors who have growth marketing experience will go to the front of the line.</strong></p>
<h2>Alternative fundraising</h2>
<p>We cover a lot of venture capital, naturally, but we have also been covering the rise of alternative fundraising over the years, including revenue-based investing, crowdfunding, social and beyond. Founders in search of funding are generally open to new ideas and iterations, particularly from other founders and experts who are pioneering effective new concepts.</p>
<h2>Quality of life</h2>
<p>Tech has infused all parts of our lives and promises better answers for the physical world around us. But the hopes of today, from personal well-being to the prosperity of cities to a sustainable planet, often feel out of reach. We are especially eager for emerging solutions from industry experts in personal health, housing and transportation, and environmental and climate topics.</p>
<p>One final note: We only publish a handful of columns each week on Extra Crunch given our other editorial initiatives, but we would like to do more — especially with domain experts who are interested in contributing on a recurring basis. When working with repeat authors, we will also publish one-off articles about public-interest topics on TechCrunch without a paywall.</p>

<p>Hello Equity podcast family, we&#8217;re back with another survey.</p>
<p>This is our second go-round with collecting your feedback, notes, and vibes.</p>
<p>The first survey we conducted back in the early-days of 2020 was super useful in helping us better tune the show. Since then, Equity has grown in frequency and we&#8217;ve expanded our production team. So, it&#8217;s a perfect time to collect your opinions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd96e0oKV6OPcilUHgSIJBnNuD7_GNcnFCqnk1RveUNuBJojQ/viewform?usp=sf_link"><strong>You can find the survey here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you have listened to the show a few times, or if you listen every week, or if you&#8217;ve heard a few hundred episodes, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re going to offer some sort of neat reward to a lucky participant. Think things like TechCrunch socks. Or a romantic dinner for you and your partner that Danny cooks. Or Alex may call the person of your choosing to tell them that they have very poor gross margins.</p>
<p>The gist is that we are hungry for your feedback and are willing to pay for the 37 to 94 seconds it will take you to fill out our little Google Form.</p>
<p>We appreciate you, and the time you spend with us. (But really, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd96e0oKV6OPcilUHgSIJBnNuD7_GNcnFCqnk1RveUNuBJojQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">take the darn survey</a>!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Grupo Bursátil Mexicano (GBM) is a 35-year-old investment platform in the Mexican stock market. In its first three decades of life, GBM was focused on providing investment services to high net worth individuals and local and global institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past decade, the Mexico City-based brokerage has ramped up its digital efforts, and, in the past five years, has evolved its business model to offer services to all Mexicans with the same products and services it offers large estates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, GBM is announcing it has received an investment of “up to” $150 million from SoftBank via the Japanese conglomerate’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/">Latin America Fund</a> at a valuation of “over $1 billion.” The investment is being made through one of GBM’s subsidiaries and is not contingent on anything, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Co-CEO Pedro de Garay Montero told TechCrunch that GBM has built an app, GBM+, that organizes and invests clients’ money through three different tools: Wealth Management, Trading and Smart Cash.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last year was a “historic” one for the company, he said, and GBM went from having 38,000 investment accounts in January 2020 to more than 650,000 by year’s end. In the first quarter of 2021, that number had grown to over 1 million &#8212; representing more than 30x growth from the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For some context, according to the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), there were only 298,000 brokerage accounts in Mexico at the end of 2019, and that number climbed to 940,000 by the end of 2020 &#8212; with GBM holding a large share of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of GBM’s clients are retail clients, but the company also caters to “most of the largest investment managers worldwide,” as well as global companies such as Netflix, Google and BlackRock. Specifically, it services 40% of the largest public corporations in Mexico and a large base of ultra high net worth individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is planning to use its new capital in part to invest “heavily” in customer acquisition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Montero said that half of its team of 450 are tech professionals, and that the company plans to also continue hiring as it focuses on growth in its B2C and B2B offerings and expanding into new verticals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are improving our already robust financial education offering,” he added, “so that Mexicans can take control of their finances. GBM’s mission is to transform Mexico into a country of investors.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because Mexico is such a huge market &#8212; with a population of over 120 million and a GDP of more than $1 trillion &#8212; GBM is laser-focused on growing its presence in the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The financial services industry is dominated by big banks and is inefficient, expensive and provides a poor client experience. This has resulted in less than 1% of individuals having an investment account,&#8221; Montero told TechCrunch. “We will be targeting clients through our own platform and internal advisors, as well as growing our base of external advisors to reach as many people as possible with the best investment products and user experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to institutional clients, he believes there is “enormous potential” in serving both the large corporations and the SMEs “who have received limited services from banks.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juan Franck, Investment lead and head of Mexico for SoftBank Latin America Fund, believes the retail investment space in Mexico is at an inflection point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The investing culture in Mexico has historically been low compared to the rest of the world, even when specifically compared to other countries in Latin America, like Brazil,” he added. “However, the landscape is quickly changing as, through technology, Mexicans are being provided more education around investing and more investment alternatives.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the midst of this shift, SoftBank was impressed by GBM&#8217;s “clear vision and playbook,” Franck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, despite being a decades-old company, SoftBank sees big potential in the strength of the digital platform that GBM has built out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“GBM is the leading broker in Mexico in terms of trading activity and broker accounts,” he said. “The company combines decades of industry know-how with an entrepreneurial drive to revolutionize the wealth management space in the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SentinelOne, a late-stage security startup that helps organizations secure their data using AI and machine learning, has filed for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ipo/">IPO</a> on the New York Stock Exchange (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nyse/">NYSE</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1583708/000162828021011624/sentineloneincs-1initialpu.htm">an S-1 filing on Thursday</a>, the security company revealed that for the three months ending April 30, its revenues increased by 108% year-on-year to $37.4 million and its customer base grew to 4,700, up from 2,700 a year prior. Despite this pandemic-fueled growth, SentinelOne&#8217;s net losses more than doubled from $26.6 million in 2020 to $62.6 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, including expanding our research and development function to drive further development of our platform, expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing the functionality to expand into adjacent markets, and reaching customers in new geographic locations,” SentinelOne wrote in its filing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Mountain View-based company said it intends to list its Class A common stock using the ticker symbol “S” and that details about the price range and number of common shares to be put up for the IPO are yet to be determined. The S-1 filing also identifies Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Securities, Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities as the lead underwriters.</p>
<p>SentinelOne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/sentinelone-an-ai-based-endpoint-security-firm-confirms-267m-raise-on-a-3-1b-valuation/">raised $276 million in a funding round in November last year</a>, tripling its $1 billion valuation from February 2020 to $3 billion. At the time, CEO and founder Tomer Weingarten told TechCrunch that an IPO “would be the next logical step” for the company.</p>
<p>SentinelOne, which was founded in 2013 and has raised a total of $696.5 million through eight rounds of funding, is looking to raise up to $100 million in its IPO, and said it&#8217;s intending to use the net proceeds to increase its visibility in the cybersecurity marketplace and for product development and other &#8220;general corporate processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It added that “may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our business.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The company&#8217;s sole acquisition so far took place back in February </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/sentinelone-an-ai-based-endpoint-security-firm-confirms-267m-raise-on-a-3-1b-valuation/">when it bought high-speed logging startup Scalyr for $155 million</a>.</p>
<p>SentinelOne is going public during a period of heightened public interest in cybersecurity. There has been a wave of high-profile cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, with hackers taking advantage of widespread remote working necessitated as a result.</p>
<p>One of the biggest attacks saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">Russian hackers breach the networks of IT company SolarWinds</a>, enabling them to gain access to government agencies and corporations. SentinelOne&#8217;s endpoint protection solution was able to detect and stop the related malicious payload, protecting its customers.</p>
<p>“The world is full of criminals, state actors, and other hostile agents who seek to exfiltrate and exploit data to disrupt our way of life,” Weingarten said in SentinelOne’s SEC filing. “Our mission is to keep the world running by protecting and securing the core pillars of modern infrastructure: data and the systems that store, process, and share information. This is an endless mission as attackers evolve rapidly in their quest to disrupt operations, breach data, turn profit, and inflict damage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <em>Bundeskartellamt</em>, Germany&#8217;s very active competition authority, isn&#8217;t letting the grass grow under new powers it gained this year to tackle big tech: The Federal Cartel Office (FCO) has just <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/04_06_2021_Google_Showcase.html">announced</a> a third proceeding against Google.</p>
<p>The FCO&#8217;s latest competition probe looks very interesting as it&#8217;s targeting Google News Showcase &#8212; Google&#8217;s relatively recently launched<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> product which curates a selection of third party publishers&#8217; content to appear in story panels on Google News (and other Google properties), content for which the tech giant pays a licensing fee.</span></p>
<p>Google started cutting content licensing deals with publishers around the world for News Showcase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">last year</a>, announcing a total pot of $1BN to fund the arrangements &#8212; with Germany one of the first markets where it inked deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However its motivation to pay publishers to licence their journalism is hardly pure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UwJJDA56m1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/embed/#?secret=UwJJDA56m1" data-secret="UwJJDA56m1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It follows years of bitter accusations from media companies that Google is freeloading off their content. To which the tech giant routinely responded with stonewalling statements &#8212; saying it would never pay for content because that&#8217;s not how online aggregation works. It also tried to fob off the industry with a digital innovation fund (aka <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/intl/en_gb/">Google News Initiative</a>) which distributes small grants and offers free workshops and product advice, seeking to frame publishers&#8217; decimated business models as a failure of innovation, leaving Google&#8217;s adtech machine scot free to steamroller on.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s stonewalling-plus-chicken-feeding approach worked to stave off regulatory action for a long time but eventually enough political pressure built up around the issue of media business models vs the online advertising duopoly that legislators started to make moves to try to address the power imbalance between traditional publishers and intermediating tech giants.</p>
<p>Most infamously in Australia, where lawmakers passed a news media bargaining code <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its passage, both Facebook and Google, the twin targets for that law, warned the move could result in dire consequences &#8212; such as a total shut down of their products, reduced quality or even fees to use their services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZM40ar74ft"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">After Facebook&#8217;s news flex, Australia passes bargaining code for platforms and publishers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After Facebook&#8217;s news flex, Australia passes bargaining code for platforms and publishers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/embed/#?secret=ZM40ar74ft" data-secret="ZM40ar74ft" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nothing like that happened but lawmakers did agree to a last minute amendment &#8212; adding a two-month mediation period to the legislation which allows digital platforms and publishers to strike deals on their own before having to enter into forced arbitration.</p>
<p>Critics say that allows for the two tech giants to continue to set their own terms when dealmaking with publishers, leveraging market muscle to strike deals that may disproportionately benefit Australia&#8217;s largest media firms &#8212; and doing so without any external oversight and with no guarantees that the resulting content arrangements foster media diversity and plurality or even support quality journalism.</p>
<p>In the EU, lawmakers acted earlier &#8212; taking the controversial route of extending copyright to cover snippets of news content <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">back in 2019</a>. (And Monday June 7 is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1807">deadline for Member States</a> to have transposed the rules into national law.)</p>
<p>France was among the first EU countries to bake the provision into national law &#8212; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">competition watchdog quickly ordered Google to pay for news reuse</a> back in 2020 after Google tried to wiggle out of the legislation by stopping displaying snippets in the market.</p>
<p>It responded to the competition authority&#8217;s order with more obfuscation, though, agreeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">earlier this year</a> to pay French publishers for linking to their content but also for their participation in News Showcase &#8212; bundling required-by-law payments (for news reuse) with content licensing deals of its own devising. And thereby making it difficult to understand the balance of mandatory payments vs commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>The problem with News Showcase is that these licensing arrangements are being done behind closed doors, in many cases ahead of relevant legislation and thus purely on Google&#8217;s terms &#8212; which means the initiative risks exacerbating concerns about the power imbalance between it and traditional publishers caught in a revenue bind as their business models have been massively disrupted by the switch to digital.</p>
<p>If Google suddenly offers some money for content, plenty of publishers might well jump &#8212; regardless of the terms. And perhaps especially because any publishers that hold out against licensing content to Google at the price it likes risk being disadvantaged by reduced visibility for their content, given Google&#8217;s dominance of the search market and content discoverability (via its ability to direct traffic to specific media properties, such as based on how prominently News Showcase content is displayed, for example).</p>
<p>The competition implications look clear.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still impressive that the <em>Bundeskartellamt </em>is spinning up an investigation into News Showcase so quickly.</p>
<p>The FCO said it&#8217;s acting on a complaint from Corint Media &#8212; looking at whether the announced integration of the Google News Showcase service into Google’s general search function is &#8220;likely to constitute self-preferencing or an impediment to the services offered by competing third parties&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s looking at whether contractual conditions include unreasonable terms (&#8220;to the detriment of the participating publishers&#8221;); and, in particular, &#8220;make it disproportionately difficult for them to enforce the ancillary copyright for press publishers introduced by the German Bundestag and Bundesrat in May 2021&#8221; &#8212; a reference to the transposed neighbouring right for news in the EU copyright reform.</p>
<p>So it will be examining the core issue of whether Google is trying to use News Showcase to undermine the new EU rights publishers gained under the copyright reform.</p>
<p>The FCO also said it wants to look at &#8220;how the conditions for access to Google’s News Showcase service are defined&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google launched the News Showcase in Germany on October 1 2020, with an initial 20 media companies participating &#8212; covering 50 publications. Although more have been added since.</p>
<p>Per the FCO, the News Showcase &#8216;story panels&#8217; were initially integrated in the Google News app but can now also be found in Google News on the desktop. It also notes that Google has said the panels will soon also appear in the general Google search results &#8212; a move that will further dial up the competition dynamics around the product, given Google&#8217;s massive dominance of the search market in Europe.</p>
<p>Commenting on its proceeding in a statement, Andreas Mundt, president of the Bundeskartellamt, said: &#8220;Cooperating with Google can be an attractive option for publishers and other news providers and offer consumers new or improved information services. However, it must be ensured that this will not result in discrimination between individual publishers. In addition, Google’s strong position in providing access to end customers must not lead to a situation where competing services offered by publishers or other news providers are squeezed out of the market. There must be an adequate balance between the rights and obligations of the content providers participating in Google’s programme.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google was contacted for comment on the FCO&#8217;s action &#8212; and it sent us this statement, attributed to spokesperson, Kay Oberbeck:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Showcase is one of many ways Google supports journalism, <a href="https://blog.google/supportingnews#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/supportingnews%23overview&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622890337552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-AiwTikaxXr1BH5JvqTVAFdWAkA">building on products and funds</a> that all publishers can benefit from. Showcase is an international licensing program for news &#8212; the selection of partners is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria, and partner content is not given preference in the ranking of our results. We will cooperate fully with the German Competition Authority and look forward to answering their questions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The FCO&#8217;s scrutiny of Google News Showcase, follows hard on the heels of two other Google proceedings it opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">last month</a>, one to determine whether or not the tech giant meets the threshold of Germany&#8217;s new competition powers for tackling big tech &#8212; and another examining its data processing practices. Both remain ongoing.</p>
<p>The competition authority has also recently opened a proceeding<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/"> into Amazon&#8217;s market dominance</a> &#8212; and is also looking to extend another recent investigation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">Facebook&#8217;s Oculus business</a>, also by determining whether the social media giant&#8217;s business meets the threshold required under the new law.</p>
<p>The amendment to the German Competition Act came into force in January &#8212; giving the FCO greater powers to proactively impose conditions on large digital companies who are considered to be of “paramount significance for competition across markets” in order to pre-emptively control the risk of market abuse.</p>
<p>That it&#8217;s taking on so many proceedings in parallel against big tech shows it&#8217;s keen not to waste any time &#8212; putting itself in a position to come, as quickly as possible, with proactive interventions to address competitive problems caused by platform giants just as soon as it determines it can legally do that.</p>
<p>The <em>Bundeskartellamt </em>also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;superprofiling&#8217;</a> on its desk &#8212; which links privacy abuse to competition concerns and could drastically limit the tech giant&#8217;s ability to profile users. That investigation and case has been ongoing for years but was recently referred to Europe&#8217;s top court for an interpretation of key legal questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indonesian healthcare startup <a href="https://www.prixa.ai/">Prixa</a> has raised $3 million led by MDI Ventures and the Trans-Pacific Technology Fund (TPTF), with participation from returning investors including Siloam Hospitals Group.</p>
<p>This brings Prixa’s total raised to $4.5 million since it launched in 2019. Co-founder and chief executive officer James Roring M.D., told TechCrunch in an email that the new funding will enable Prixa to scale its platform and customer base. Prixa uses a B2B model, partnering with healthcare payers like insurance providers and corporations. Through its B2B customers, it currently serves about 10 million patients.</p>
<p>Prixa currently works with four major insurers and has six additional insurers in its short-term pipeline. It also works with Indonesia’s largest third-party administrators, Roring said, allowing it to reach more policyholders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prixa’s platform includes a digital health assistant to answer patients&#8217; questions, telemedicine consultations, pharmacy deliveries and on-demand lab diagnostics. Usage increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as more patients sought online consultations for primary care.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telemedicine startups are positioning themselves for a post-pandemic world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/embed/#?secret=jP98KUdtDB" data-secret="jP98KUdtDB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other telehealth startups in Indonesia include Halodoc and Alodokter (which is also backed by MDI). Both connect patients directly with healthcare and insurance providers. Roring said Prixa differentiates by focusing on greater cost control for healthcare payers and positioning itself as a digital primary care platform.</p>
<p>“By symptomatically managing patients outside of tertiary care facilities and caring for chronic non-communicable diseases online, Prixa is able to effectively reduce the amount of outpatient claims and downstream inpatient cost incurred by healthcare payers,” Roring said. “Additionally, the combination of a growing and robust medical database, as well as proven clinical guidelines, contribute to cost efficiency and service optimization through the standardization of treatment by our healthcare providers.”</p>
<p>In press statement about the funding, Aditia Henri Narendra, MDI Ventures’ general manager of legal and corporate communication, said, “MDI co-led this financing because Prixa has demonstrated its ability to support insurance companies and hospitals in making medical services more accessible and affordable through its AI telemedicine platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">An email has been going around the internet as a part of a release of documents related to Apple’s App Store based suit brought by Epic Games. I love this email for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that you can extrapolate from it the very reasons Apple has remained such a vital force in the industry for the past decade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The gist of it is that SVP of Software Engineering, Bertrand Serlet, sent an email in October of 2007, just three months after the iPhone was launched. In the email, Serlet outlines essentially every core feature of Apple’s App Store — a business that brought in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html">estimated $64B</a> in 2020. And that, more importantly, allowed the launch of countless titanic internet startups and businesses built on and taking advantage of native apps on iPhone.</p>
<p class="p1">Forty five minutes after the email, Steve Jobs replies to Serlet and iPhone lead Scott Forstall, from his iPhone, “Sure, as long as we can roll it all out at Macworld on Jan 15, 2008.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Apple University should have a course dedicated to this email.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Here it is, shared by an account I enjoy, Internal Tech Emails, on Twitter. If you run the account let me know, happy to credit you further here if you wish:</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bertrand Serlet to Steve Jobs: &quot;Fine, let&#39;s enable Cocoa Touch apps&quot;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">October 2, 2007 <a href="https://t.co/9aTxmjgkRS">pic.twitter.com/9aTxmjgkRS</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Internal Tech Emails (@TechEmails) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400270458608664577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</p>
<p class="p1">First, we have Serlet’s outline. It’s seven sentences that outline the key tenets of the App Store. User protection, network protection, an owned developer platform and a sustainable API approach. There is a direct ask for resources — whoever we need in software engineering — to get it shipped ASAP.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">It also has a clear ask at the bottom, ‘do you agree with these goals?’</p>
<p class="p1">Enough detail is included in the parentheticals to allow an informed reader to infer scope and work hours. And at no point during this email does Serlet include an <i>ounce</i> of <i>justification</i> for these choices. These are the obvious and necessary framework, in his mind, for accomplishing the rollout of an SDK for iPhone developers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There is no extensive rationale provided for each item, something that is often unnecessary in an informed context and can often act as psychic baggage that telegraphs one of two things:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">You don’t believe the leader you’re outlining the project to knows what the hell they’re talking about.</li>
<li class="li1">You don’t believe it and you’re still trying to convince yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Neither one of those is the wisest way to provide an initial scope of work. There is plenty of time down the line to flesh out rationale to those who have less command of the larger context.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">If you’re a historian of iPhone software development, you’ll know that developer Nullriver had released Installer, a third-party installer that allowed apps to be natively loaded onto iPhone, in the summer of 2007. Early September, I believe. It was followed in 2008 by the eventually far more popular Cydia. And there were developers that August and September already experimenting with this completely unofficial way of getting apps on the store, like the <a href="https://furbo.org/2007/09/11/silence-is-golden/">venerable Twitterific </a>by Craig Hockenberry and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnBFF8QmEgo">Lights Off</a> by Lucas Newman and Adam Betts.</p>
<p class="p1">Though there has been plenty of established documentation of Steve being reluctant about allowing third-party apps on iPhone, this email establishes an official timeline for when the decision was not only made but essentially fully formed. And it’s much earlier than the apocryphal discussion about when the call was made. This is just weeks after the first hacky third-party attempts had made their way to iPhone and just under two months since the first <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2018/03/a-lot-can-happen-in-a-decade/">iPhone jailbreak toolchain</a> appeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There is no need or desire shown here for Steve to ‘make sure’ that his touch is felt on this framework. All too often I see leaders that are obsessed with making sure that they give feedback and input at every turn. Why did you hire those people in the first place? Was it for their skill and acumen? Their attention to detail? Their obsessive desire to get things right?</p>
<p class="p1">Then let them do their job.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Serlet’s email is well written and has the exact right scope, yes. But the response is just as important. A demand of what is likely too short a timeline (the App Store was eventually announced in March of 2008 and shipped in July of that year) sets the bar high — matching the urgency of the request for all teams to work together on this project. This is not a side alley, it’s the foundation of a main thoroughfare. It must get built before anything goes on top.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This efficacy is at the core of what makes Apple good when it is good. It’s not always good, but nothing ever is 100% of the time and the hit record is incredibly strong across a decade’s worth of shipped software and hardware. Crisp, lean communication that does not coddle or equivocate, coupled with a leader that is confident in their own ability and the ability of those that they hired means that there is no need to bog down the process in order to establish a record of involvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One cannot exist without the other. A clear, well argued RFP or project outline that is sent up to insecure or ineffective management just becomes fodder for territorial games or endless rounds of requests for clarification. And no matter how effective leadership is and how talented their employees, if they do not establish an environment in which clarity of thought is <i>welcomed and rewarded </i>then they will never get the kind of bold, declarative product development that they wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">All in all, this exchange is a wildly important bit of ephemera that underpins the entire app ecosystem era and an explosive growth phase for Internet technology. And it’s also an encapsulation of the kind of environment that has made Apple an effective and brutally efficient company for so many years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Can it be learned from and emulated? Probably, but only if all involved are willing to create the environment necessary to foster the key elements above. Nine times out of ten you get moribund management, an environment that discourages blunt position taking and a muddy route to the exit. The tenth time, though, you get magic.</p>
<p class="p1">And, hey, maybe we can take this opportunity to make that next meeting an email?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Bertrand Serlet and Steve Jobs could change the world over an email perhaps we don’t need to have that meeting. <a href="https://t.co/NZ1HmVAnwb">https://t.co/NZ1HmVAnwb</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery, which really came into its own with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, continues to command huge attention from investors. The jury is still out on how people will use those services in the longer term, but in the meantime, the most ambitious of the startups in the field are raising big.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://www.goflink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a> &#8212; a Berlin-based on-demand &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery service built around self-operated dark stores and a smaller assortment (2,400 items) that it says it will deliver in 10 minutes or less &#8212; has raised $240 million to expand its business into more cities, and more countries, on the heels of strong demand.</p>
<p>Flink &#8212; which means &#8220;quick&#8221; in German &#8212; is currently active in 24 cities across Germany, France and the Netherlands. It hasn&#8217;t disclosed how many active customers it has, but it targets younger consumers, those with small fridges, those who have forgotten items in their bigger shops, and people who simply don&#8217;t want to or can&#8217;t shop in the old-style of once every one or two weeks. Flink says it&#8217;s currently on a pace of activating operations in a new area every two days, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are on a mission to give people back some of their valuable time during their hectic days and impress them with our service every time they order,&#8221; said Flink CEO Oliver Merkel &#8212; who co-founded the company with Julian Dames and Christoph Cordes &#8212; in a statement. &#8220;We want to establish Flink as the top destination for their day-to-day goods at great prices and with instant delivery by our amazing riders. The order growth we have seen over the past weeks has been explosive and we attribute that to the excellent service we are providing to our consumers.”</p>
<p>The size of this all-equity Series A is extraordinary considering that company only launched in December last year. The company is not disclosing its valuation but one person close to the company said it&#8217;s &#8220;not a unicorn yet.&#8221; (Not worth $1 billion on paper, that is.)</p>
<p>The round is being co-led by Prosus, BOND, and Mubadala Capital; and it comes with a very interesting deal attached.</p>
<p>REWE &#8212; a German supermarket giant &#8212; has inked a strategic partnership with the company that will make Flink its preferred partner for smaller shopping grabs, which looks like it will complement the work that REWE is doing to build out its own grocery delivery businesses for bigger baskets. It&#8217;s not clear if REWE is actually investing.</p>
<p>This latest investment comes on the heels of Flink announcing, back in March when it was only three months old, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$52 million round</a> from Target Global and earlier backers Northzone, Cherry Ventures and TriplePoint Capital, along with Cristina Stenbeck from Kinnevik, who invested in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>The opportunity for a new startup to get into the market for food &#8212; and in this case specifically grocery &#8212; delivery, is an interesting one at the moment.</p>
<p>On one hand, we&#8217;ve been through a year where many cities across Europe have been under shelter-in-place orders, pushing many more people to turn to online food ordering to get essential things delivered to their doors.</p>
<p>That is to say, demand &#8212; at least under current circumstances &#8212; has been more than proven out. In fact, many of the biggest providers completely buckled under pressure with crashing sites, very few or no delivery slots available and many items out of stock on a too-regular basis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that situation has led to a huge profusion of companies swooping in to fill that gap. Perhaps too huge a profusion?</p>
<p>There are seemingly dozens of new players competing with Flick. Gorillas, another outfit out of Berlin, also been raising big money and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted its own $1 billion+ valuation</a> (for what it&#8217;s worth: remember, this is all just on paper). Alongside the new entrants of the last year are also a rush of more mature startups like Glovo (which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> raised $528 million earlier this year</a>), Kolonial (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/norways-kolonial-rebrands-as-oda-bags-265m-on-a-900m-valuation-to-grow-its-online-grocery-delivery-business-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$265 million earlier this year</a>), Everli and Rohlik (respectively, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $230 million rounds</a> this spring), as well as much bigger players like Ocado and of course the brick-and-mortar grocers who are investing big in their own operations.</p>
<p>And just earlier this morning, Getir out of Turkey, another fast-grocery startup that has been investing a lot in growth (its delivery bikes can be seen every time I go outside at the moment here in London) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3acc197c-cd81-4b3b-a19b-32e58fc687e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a $550 million round at a $7.5 billion valuation</a> &#8212; a piece of news that may have been one part of the calculus for Flink also announcing today.</p>
<p>And there are so many more I&#8217;m not mentioning here.</p>
<p>The big question will be whether the market can sustain all of this, and if not, what that will mean for all of these, and all of the money invested in the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unlike some of the scramble that took place in restaurant delivery, where we saw a slew regional giants appear (tapping into the growth of the web for e-commerce, and then spiffy apps to make ordering and for restaurants managing orders quick and easy). Then, the biggest of them moved to land grabs to pick up others near them to get better economies of scale &#8212; a process that eventually took the most well-capitalized of that smaller subset global. Then the bigger global players gobble the smaller, or merge to take on others.</p>
<p>All of that is actually still playing out, and in fact some of the biggest of the hot-food delivery companies, such as Deliveroo out of the UK, are <em>also</em> moving into grocery to better diversify.</p>
<p>In that regard, it&#8217;s very interesting to see Prosus in this round.</p>
<p>Prosus &#8212; which is, essentially, a tech giant that was separated out from the rest of Naspers some time ago as a separate, publicly-listed entity to better focus investment and attention on the space (it holds a huge stake in Tencent, among other things) &#8212; really got burned last year from its longstanding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/prosus-makes-6-3b-hostile-bid-for-just-eat-which-rejects-deal-in-favor-of-takeaway-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostile attempt</a> to acquire Just Eat, to combine it with Prosus&#8217; existing holdings in food delivery.</p>
<p>One of the bigger global takeout food delivery players, Just Eat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instead eloped with Takeaway</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed off into the Grubhub sunset</a>, leaving Prosus bobbing in the water.</p>
<p>Since then, Prosus has been very proactive in using its capital to plot out its own course. That&#8217;s included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/indias-swiggy-raises-113m-led-by-prosus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stakes in Swiggy</a> in India, investing in that Kolonial round, and also today&#8217;s news backing Flink.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“The opportunity that exists for online grocery delivery is vast, with the grocery market in Germany alone expected to reach more than €300 billion in the coming years,&#8221; said Larry Illg, CEO of Food Delivery at Prosus, in a statement. &#8220;The past year has seen many new players entering the nascent market, vying to fulfill the increasing consumer demands. Flink comes to the market offering ultra-fast delivery of items, mostly under 10 minutes, getting consumers what they need almost immediately. Flink’s innovative tech-enabled logistics service combined with the expertise of the team, the quality of the partnerships they have quickly established and the pace of execution within Germany, has been nothing short of impressive.”</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;Flink is a pioneer in a new model of commerce that is purpose-built for consumers who expect better, faster, cheaper services,&#8221; added Daegwon Chae, general partner at BOND. &#8220;We have been impressed by Flink’s ability to scale rapidly while delighting customers through a seamless experience, and are excited to partner together as Flink builds the grocery store of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flink is the rare combination of a great founding team tackling a huge market with a truly disruptive proposition. The grocery retail market in Germany is one of the largest undigitized markets at only 3% online penetration. We believe that the grocery store of the future will be hyper-local, instantly available, and always delighting its customers. With best-in-class operations and strong momentum, Flink can become a major player in the digital grocery sector, and we look forward to partnering with them on the journey,&#8221; said <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amer Alaily at Mubadala Capital, in a statement.</span></p>
<p>More money for the space, and something tells me it&#8217;s not the final chapter. For us, we can order some popcorn on one (or more) of these platforms and watch how it plays out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In its latest ambitious digital policy announcement, the European Union has proposed creating a framework for a &#8220;trusted and secure European e-ID&#8221; (aka digital identity) &#8212; which it said today it wants to be available to all citizens, residents and businesses to make it easer to use a national digital identity to prove who they [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest ambitious digital policy announcement, the European Union has proposed creating a framework for a &#8220;trusted and secure European e-ID&#8221; (aka digital identity) &#8212; which it <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663">said today</a> it wants to be available to all citizens, residents and businesses to make it easer to use a national digital identity to prove who they are in order to access public sector or commercial services regardless of where they are in the bloc.</p>
<p>The EU does already have a regulation on electronic authentication systems (eIDAS), which entered into force in 2014, but the Commission&#8217;s intention with the e-ID proposal is to expand on that by addressing some of its limitations and inadequacies (such as poor uptake and a lack of mobile support).</p>
<p>It also wants the e-ID framework to incorporate digital wallets &#8212; meaning the user will be able to choose to download a wallet app to a mobile device where they can store and selectively share electronic documents which might be needed for a specific identity verification transaction, such as when opening a bank account or applying for a loan. Other functions (like e-signing) is also envisaged being supported by these e-ID digital wallets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other examples the Commission gives where it sees a harmonized e-ID coming in handy include renting a car or checking into a hotel. EU lawmakers also suggest full interoperability for authentication of national digital IDs could be helpful for citizens needing to submit a local tax declaration or enrolling in a regional university.</p>
<p>Some Member States do already offer national electronic IDs but there&#8217;s a problem with interoperability across borders, per the Commission, which noted today that just 14% of key public service providers across all Member States allow cross-border authentication with an e-Identity system, though it also said cross-border authentications are rising.</p>
<p>A universally accepted &#8216;e-ID&#8217; could &#8212; in theory &#8212; help grease digital activity throughout the EU&#8217;s single market by making it easier for Europeans to verify their identity and access commercial or publicly provided services when travelling or living outside their home market.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers also seem to believe there&#8217;s an opportunity to &#8216;own&#8217; a strategic piece of the digital puzzle here, if they can create a unifying framework for all European national digital IDs &#8212; offering consumers not just a more convenient alternative to carrying around a physical version of their national ID (at least in some situations), and/or other documents they might need to show when applying to access specific services, but what commissioners billed today as a &#8220;European choice&#8221; &#8212; i.e. vs <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">commercial digital ID systems which may not offer the same high-level pledge of a &#8220;trusted and secure&#8221; ID system that lets the user entirely control who gets to sees which bits of their data.</span></p>
<p>A number of tech giants do of course already offer users the ability to sign in to third party digital services using the same credentials to access their own service. But in most cases doing so means the user is opening a fresh conduit for their personal data to flow back to the data-mining platform giant that controls the credential, letting Facebook (etc) further flesh out what it knows about that user&#8217;s Internet activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new European Digital Identity Wallets will enable all Europeans to access services online without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. With this solution they will have full control of the data they share,&#8221; is the Commission alternative vision for the proposed e-ID framework.</p>
<p>It also suggests the system could create substantial upside for European businesses &#8212; by supporting them in offering &#8220;a wide range of new services&#8221; atop the associated pledge of a &#8220;secure and trusted identification service&#8221;. And driving public trust in digital services is a key plank of how the Commission approaches digital policymaking &#8212; arguing that it&#8217;s a essential lever to grow uptake of online services.</p>
<p>However to say this e-ID scheme is &#8216;ambitious&#8217; is a polite word for how viable it looks.</p>
<p>Aside from the tricky issue of adoption (i.e. actually getting Europeans to A) know about e-ID, and B) actually use it, by also C) getting enough platforms to support it, as well as D) getting providers on board to create the necessary wallets for envisaged functionality to pan out and be as robustly secure as promised), they&#8217;ll also &#8212; presumably &#8212; need to E) convince and/or compel web browsers to integrate e-ID so it can be accessed in a streamlined way.</p>
<p>The alternative (not being baked into browsers&#8217; UIs) would surely make the other adoption steps trickier.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s press release is fairly thin on such detail, though &#8212; saying only that: &#8220;Very large platforms will be required to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a whole chunk of the proposal is given over to discussion of &#8220;Qualified certificates for website authentication&#8221; &#8212; a trusted services provision, also expanding on the approach taken in eIDAS, which the Commission is keen for e-ID to incorporate in order to further boost user trust by offering a certified guarantee of who&#8217;s behind a website (although the proposal says it will be voluntary for websites to get certified).</p>
<p>The upshot of this component of the proposal is that web browsers would need to support and display these certificates, in order for the envisaged trust to flow &#8212; which sums to a whole lot of highly nuanced web infrastructure work needed to be done by third parties to interoperate with this EU requirement. (Work that browser makers already seem to have <a href="https://www.ccadb.org/documents/qualified_website_authentication_certificates_interoperability.pdf">expressed serious misgivings</a> about.)</p>
<p>&#8220;This regulation may force web browsers to accept additional types of &#8216;trust certificates&#8217;,&#8221; said security and privacy researcher, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, discussing the Commission&#8217;s proposal with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This comes with a requirement for web browsers to honor such certificates and change the web browser user interfaces to display this in some way. It is doubtful that such a thing actually improves trust. If this was a mechanism to fight &#8216;fake news&#8217; it would be a cumbersome one. On the other hand we have an additional precedent here when web browser vendors are required to amend their security and privacy models.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Web browsers will be forced/compelled to accept authentication certificates. This is to guarantee the proof of the website operator identity. What standards should be used here? Will web browsers implement it? <a href="https://t.co/sygngNHyQW">pic.twitter.com/sygngNHyQW</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1400450414634434578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another big question-mark thrown up by the Commission&#8217;s e-ID plan is how exactly the envisaged certified digital identity wallets would store &#8212; and most importantly safeguard &#8212; user data. That very much remains to be determined, at this nascent stage.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s discussion in the regulation&#8217;s recitals, for example, of Member States being <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">encouraged to &#8220;set-up jointly sandboxes to test innovative solutions in a controlled and secure environment in particular to improve the functionality, protection of personal data, security and interoperability of the solutions and to inform future updates of technical references and legal requirements&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And it seems that </span>a range of approaches are being entertained, with recital 11 discussing using biometric authentication for accessing digital wallets (while also noting potential rights risks as well as the need to ensure adequate security):</p>
<blockquote><p>European Digital Identity Wallets should ensure the highest level of security for the personal data used for authentication irrespective of whether such data is stored locally or on cloud-based solutions, taking into account the different levels of risk. Using biometrics to authenticate is one of the identifications methods providing a high level of confidence, in particular when used in combination with other elements of authentication. Since biometrics represents a unique characteristic of a person, the use of biometrics requires organisational and security measures, commensurate to the risk that such processing may entail to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and in accordance with Regulation 2016/679.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s clear that underlying the Commission&#8217;s big, huge idea of a unified (and unifying) European e-ID is a complex mass of requirements needed to deliver on the vision of a secure and trusted European digital ID that doesn&#8217;t just languish ignored and unused by most web users &#8212; some highly technical requirements, others (such as achieving the sought for widespread adoption) no less challenging.</p>
<p>The impediments to success here certainly look daunting.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, lawmakers are ploughing ahead, arguing that the pandemic&#8217;s acceleration of digital service adoption has shown the pressing need to address eIDAS&#8217; shortcomings &#8212; and deliver on the goal of &#8220;effective and user-friendly digital services across the EU&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alongside today&#8217;s regulatory proposal they&#8217;ve put out a Recommendation, inviting Member States to &#8220;establish a common toolbox by September 2022 and to start the necessary preparatory work immediately&#8221; &#8212; with a goal of publishing the agreed toolbox in October 2022 and starting pilot projects (based on the agreed technical framework) sometime thereafter.</p>
<p>&#8220;This toolbox should include the technical architecture, standards and guidelines for best practices,&#8221; the Commission adds, eliding the large cans of worms being firmly cracked open.</p>
<p>Still, its penciled in timeframe for mass adoption &#8212; of around a decade &#8212; does a better job of illustrating the scale of the challenge, with the Commission writing that it wants 80% of citizens to be using an e-ID solution by 2030.</p>
<p>The even longer game the bloc is playing is to try to achieve digital sovereignty so it&#8217;s not beholden to foreign-owned tech giants. And an &#8216;own brand&#8217;, autonomously operated European digital identity does certainly align with that strategic goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trade schools are nothing new, but a new startup called <a href="https://mtcopeland.com/">Copeland</a> thinks it can build a big business by bringing education about plumbing, drywall, cabinetry and more to the masses through high-quality pre-filmed classes online that feature industry pros and professional educators.</p>
<p>If it sounds like a kind of MasterClass for all things construction, that&#8217;s not an accident. Copeland sprung from the mind of renowned investor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldearing/">Michael Dearing</a>, who wrote the first check to MasterClass (now reportedly valued at <a href="https://www.axios.com/masterclass-new-funding-25-billion-valuation-f75521cd-3a85-4215-b4fa-c2ae48da9765.html">$2.5 billion</a>) and spied an opportunity in pairing underemployed Americans with homebuilders who can&#8217;t find enough people to hire. Meanwhile, Copeland&#8217;s cofounder and CEO, Gabe Jewell, previously spent nearly four years as a creative producer with MasterClass.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to trade schools, Copeland, which charges for its content, is competing with an endless &#8212; and free &#8212; number of YouTube videos about how to both build and dismantle things. Still, the year-old, six-person, Bay Area-based company, which has produced <a href="https://mtcopeland.com/courses/">nine distinct pieces of content</a> so far, has investors excited about its prospects. Indeed, in addition to early backing from Dearing, the company just raised $5 million in seed funding from Defy.vc and Collaborative Fund in a round that brings its total funding to date to $7 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This afternoon, we talked with Jewell to learn more about what Copeland &#8212; <a href="https://mtcopeland.com/blog/faqs/where-did-the-name-m-t-copeland-come-from/">named after an educator</a> &#8212; is assembling, and whether homeowners, as well as aspiring tradespeople, are target customers, too. Some of that conversation follows, below:</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re trying to educate trade workers and those aspiring to work in construction &#8212; an industry that&#8217;s in the midst of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/finding-workers-is-getting-harder-for-busy-u-s-homebuilders">years-long labor shortage</a> and needs people with know-how. Do you envision awarding credentials so employers know your customers have gone through training?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: That&#8217;s on the table &#8212; proof of aptitude or certificates of completion after you&#8217;ve successfully passed an assessment. On the licensing side, that would be complicated because [general contractor] licenses are offered regionally, and you need to be a licensed electrical contractor so you don&#8217;t burn someone&#8217;s house down, and that&#8217;s a four-year process typically. So we&#8217;re right now focused more on general education and support rather than [anything more tangible than that].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Out of curiosity, how would you test users, given this is a one-to-many platform?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: Some of it could involve testing construction math &#8212; putting you through an assessment to ensure you know how to calculate angles and area and so forth. Other tests cold be more around general knowledge. We can&#8217;t, with an online test, ensure that you&#8217;ll build a great cabinet, but it&#8217;s easy to imagine [other testing] opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>TC: MasterClass relies on celebrities and stars in their respective fields. To generate more buzz, might you pull in celebrity homebuilders and tradespeople from do-it-yourself-type shows as teachers?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: We&#8217;re talking about that, too. There&#8217;s a healthy online community of professional builders who share what they do and they&#8217;ve given us a warm welcome. What&#8217;s most important to us is ensuring that the quality of instruction is really high really.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I spent part of yesterday watching videos about how to dismantle a brick wall; it makes me wonder whether there will be content on your platform that&#8217;s accessible to, and even targeting, homeowners.</strong></p>
<p>GJ: We are hopefully going to see a DIY halo audience for this stuff. For example, deck building is an employable skill and one that we&#8217;ll teach you such that you can learn to do it as a professional would. At the same time, if you&#8217;re serious about building your own deck, who else would you rather learn it from than pros who know how to teach it?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also thinking of ways to bring those audiences together. You could learn how to dismantle that wall, but you could also come to Copeland to find a professional remodeler who you come to see as a trusted resource.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long does it take to create each piece of programming for the site?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: It takes us a couple of months to put the courses together, which mostly fall right now between an hour and two hours, though well see more variability in that down the road.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have partnerships with homebuilders or commercial real estate developers that are desperate right now for help?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: We are establishing partnerships with real estate builders. A few are [coming together now] and we&#8217;re really excited about growing that side of the business as we develop and film more stuff and add to our current library.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Will subscriptions be part of the picture as you build out that content?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: Yes, right now we charge $75 per course, and you have access to it forever, or a business can purchase a number or seats. As we grow the library, though, you&#8217;ll see see flexibility regarding the pricing structure.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What type of content is coming?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: Currently, we&#8217;re really focused on residential construction, both hands-on trade skills, like carpentry and cabinet making, but also blueprint reading, and we’ll continue to grow that by adding in plumbing, and drywall and general contractor skills, like reading contracts and risk management. But we&#8217;re also building a commercial construction management library that’s taught by university professors largely centered around skills between the field and the office. Maybe you’re an experienced craftsman and you need to learn leadership skills, or you come to construction from retail and you&#8217;re working in an office capacity and need to learn how to connect the dots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota AI Ventures, Toyota’s standalone venture capital fund, has dropped the &#8220;AI&#8221; and is reborn as, simply, Toyota Ventures. The fund is commemorating its new identity by investing an additional $300 million in emerging technologies and carbon neutrality via two early-stage funds: the Toyota Ventures Frontier Fund and the Toyota Ventures Climate Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of these two new funds, each worth $150 million, brings Toyota Ventures&#8217; total assets under management to over $500 million. With the new capital infusion into the Frontier Fund comes an expansion of Toyota Ventures’ core thesis, which previously focused on AI, autonomy, mobility, robotics and the cloud, and now is adding smart cities, digital health, fintech and energy. So while Toyota Ventures’ investment approach isn’t changing, it’s broadening the scope of startups it will consider investing in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AI is kind of shrinking as a proportion of everything,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Adler, founding managing director of Toyota Ventures,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “The first mission of the Frontier Fund has always been to discover what’s next for Toyota. Toyota pivoted to cars in the 1930s, and Toyota will grow to other businesses in the future. Startups are experiments in the marketplace, and this is a way for us to understand and get comfortable with where innovations are coming from.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota as a global company has more than 370,000 employees that cover a range of business units in which the company at large stands to benefit from investing, such as financial technology. The Frontier Fund is a step outside of mobility. It not only seeks to bring emerging tech to market, but it also wants to bring new innovations onboard, whether as a customer or an acquisition, according to Adler. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the vision of the company really is that machines are here to stay, they amplify the human experience, and Toyota understands how machines amplify humans really well for the benefit of society, which sounds incredibly corny, but the company really believes that,” said Adler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that same token, the new Climate Fund seeks to invest in startups that can help Toyota accelerate its goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. The company has been investing in hydrogen for years, including a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent partnership with Japanese fuel company ENEOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s open to whatever technology will help achieve carbon neutrality, according to Adler.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think renewable energies will play a role,” said Adler. “Hydrogen production, storage distribution and utilization will play a role. We think carbon capture and storage will play a role. We’re not going to get dogmatic about hydrogen because we’ve been at it for decades and maybe things will change. Hydrogen hasn’t been crowdsourced across the startup community because there just wasn’t a market for it, but I think the market may be emerging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund is accepting online pitches on its </span><a href="https://toyota.ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from entrepreneurs seeking early-stage funding. On Thursday, Toyota Ventures also announced it would be expanding its team and working with a new Advisor Network as a resource for founders looking for guidance on anything from product development to diversity and recruitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toyota Ventures has been an invaluable partner for Boxbot since they invested in our seed round in 2018,” said Austin Oehlerking, co-founder and CEO of Boxbot, in a statement. “They have been instrumental in helping us to navigate complicated, existential challenges on our journey from concept to product/market fit. Jim and the team really understand how corporate venture capital should function in order to successfully partner with startups.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adler says he and his team come from an entrepreneurial background, so they understand what it’s like on the other side of the table. Toyota Ventures’ focuses on early-stage startups because that’s where it believes some of the most interesting innovations come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big believer that early-stage venture capital is a telescope into the future,” said Adler. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we can actually find those incredibly valuable innovations that make this all worthwhile.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A change to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en#privacy-us">TikTok&#8217;s U.S. privacy policy</a> on Wednesday introduced a new section that says the social video app <em>&#8220;may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information&#8221;</em> from its users&#8217; content. This includes things like <em>&#8220;faceprints and voiceprints,&#8221;</em> the policy explained. Reached for comment, TikTok could not confirm what product developments necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users, but said it would ask for consent in the case such data collection practices began.</p>
<p>The biometric data collection details were introduced in the newly added section, &#8220;Image and Audio Information,&#8221; found under the heading of &#8220;Information we collect automatically&#8221; in the policy.</p>
<p>This is the part of TikTok&#8217;s Privacy Policy that lists the types of data the app gathers from users, which was already fairly extensive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first part of the new section explains that TikTok may collect information about the images and audio that are in users&#8217; content,<em> &#8220;such as identifying the objects and scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of face and body features and attributes, the nature of the audio, and the text of the words spoken in your User Content.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While that may sound creepy, other social networks do object recognition on images you upload to power accessibility features (like describing what&#8217;s in an Instagram photo, for example), as well as for<a href="https://www.business2community.com/facebook/facebooks-new-image-recognition-algorithm-can-scan-your-picture-for-advertising-opportunities-02202720"> ad targeting</a> purposes. Identifying where a person and the scenery is can help with AR effects, while converting spoken words to text helps with features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok&#8217;s automatic captions.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FNSgZvfPRF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/">TikTok adds auto captions to make videos accessible to hard of hearing and deaf</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok adds auto captions to make videos accessible to hard of hearing and deaf&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/tiktok-adds-auto-captions-to-make-videos-accessible-to-hard-of-hearing-and-deaf/embed/#?secret=FNSgZvfPRF" data-secret="FNSgZvfPRF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The policy also notes this part of the data collection is for enabling <em>&#8220;special video effects, for content moderation, for demographic classification, for content and ad recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying operations,&#8221;</em> it says.</p>
<p>The more concerning part of the new section references a plan to collect biometric data.</p>
<p>It states:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information as defined under US laws, such as faceprints and voiceprints, from your User Content. Where required by law, we will seek any required permissions from you prior to any such collection.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The statement itself is vague, as it doesn&#8217;t specify whether it&#8217;s considering federal law, states laws, or both. It also doesn&#8217;t explain, as the other part did, why TikTok needs this data. It doesn&#8217;t define the terms &#8220;faceprints&#8221; or &#8220;voiceprints.&#8221; Nor does it explain how it would go about seeking the &#8220;required permissions&#8221; from users, or if it would look to either state or federal laws to guide that process of gaining consent.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s important because as it stands today, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data">only a handful of U.S. states</a> have biometric privacy laws, including Illinois, Washington, California, Texas and New York. If TikTok only requested consent, &#8220;where required by law,&#8221; it could mean users in other states would not have to be informed about the data collection.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a TikTok spokesperson could not offer more details on the company&#8217;s plans for biometric data collection or how it may tie in to either current or future products.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we recently updated our Privacy Policy to provide more clarity on the information we may collect,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The company also pointed us to an <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-approach-to-security">article about its approach to data security</a>, TikTok&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/transparency-report-2020-2">Transparency Report</a> and the recently launched <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/privacy-and-security-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/privacy-and-security-on-tiktok/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622845675873000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGI8mMx0o_xJ8hWVqssD_nh5LwlkA">privacy and security hub</a>, which is aimed at helping people better understand their privacy choices on the app.</p>

<p>The biometric disclosure comes at a time when TikTok has been working to regain the trust of some U.S. users.</p>
<p>Under the Trump administration, the federal government attempted to ban TikTok from operating in the U.S. entirely, calling the app a national security threat because of its ownership by a Chinese company. TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban/">fought back </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-sues-the-u-s-government-over-its-forthcoming-ban/">against the ban </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tiktok-launches-a-new-information-hub-and-twitter-account-to-correct-the-record-it-says/">went on record to state</a> it only stores TikTok U.S. user data in its U.S. data centers and in Singapore.</p>
<p>It said it has never shared TikTok user data with the Chinese government nor censored content, despite being owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. And it said it would never do so, if asked.</p>
<p>Though the TikTok ban was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/">initially stopped in the courts</a>, the federal government appealed the rulings. But when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">President Biden took office</a>, his administration put the appeal process on hold <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">as it reviewed the actions </a>taken by his predecessor. And although Biden has, as of today, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">signed an executive order</a> to restrict U.S. investment in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/biden-china-surveillance-order.html">Chinese firms linked to surveillance</a>, his administration&#8217;s position on TikTok remains unclear.</p>

<p>It is worth noting, however, that the new disclosure about biometric data collection follows <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tiktok-reaches-92-million-settlement-bipa-lawsuit-022605/">a $92 million settlement in a class action lawsuit against TikTok</a>, originally filed in May 2020, over the social media app&#8217;s violation of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act. The consolidated suit included more than 20 separate cases filed against TikTok over the platform&#8217;s collection and sharing of the personal and biometric information without user consent. Specifically, this involved the use of facial filter technology for special effects.</p>
<p>In that context, TikTok&#8217;s legal team may have wanted to quickly cover themselves from future lawsuits by adding a clause that permits the app to collect personal biometric data.</p>
<p>The disclosure, we should also point out, has only been added to the U.S. Privacy Policy, as other markets like the EU have stricter data protection and privacy laws.</p>
<p>The new section was part of a broader update to TikTok&#8217;s Privacy Policy, which included other changes both large and small, ranging from corrections of earlier typos to revamped or even entirely new sections. Most of these tweaks and changes could be easily explained, though &#8212; like new sections that clearly referenced TikTok&#8217;s e-commerce ambitions or adjustments aimed at addressing the implications of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency</a> on targeted advertising.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, TikTok still has plenty of data on its users, their content and their devices, even without biometric data.</p>
<p>For example, TikTok policy already stated it automatically collects information about users&#8217; devices, including location data based on your SIM card and IP addresses and GPS, your use of TikTok itself and all the content you create or upload, the data you send in messages on its app, metadata from the content you upload, cookies, the app and file names on your device, battery state and even your keystroke patterns and rhythms, among other things.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the &#8220;Information you choose to provide,&#8221; which comes from when you register, contact TikTok or upload content. In that case, TikTok collects your registration info (username, age, language, etc.), profile info (name, photo, social media accounts), all your user-generated content on the platform, your phone and social network contacts, payment information, plus the text, images and video found in the device&#8217;s clipboard. (TikTok, as you may recall, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature">got busted by Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 feature</a> that alerted users to the fact that TikTok and other apps were accessing iOS clipboard content. Now, the policy says TikTok &#8220;may collect&#8221; clipboard data &#8220;with your permission.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The content of the Privacy Policy itself wasn&#8217;t of immediate concern to some TikTok users. Instead, it was the buggy rollout.</p>
<p>Some users reported seeing a pop-up message alerting them to the Privacy Policy update, but the page was <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewericdoes/status/1400115048782045187">not available</a> when they tried to read it. Others <a href="https://twitter.com/diegheaux/status/1400223230577762310">complained</a> of seeing the pop-up repeatedly. This issue doesn&#8217;t appear to be universal. In tests, we did not have an issue with the pop-up ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has replaced and expanded Trump-era restrictions on investing in certain Chinese firms deemed supportive of that country&#8217;s surveillance and military apparatus. Major tech, space and telecom companies are listed in the initial 59 covered by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">the executive order</a>, with more to come by order of the Treasury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse, constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,&#8221; writes President Biden in the introduction to the order.</p>
<p>The E.O. has its roots in the Trump administration&#8217;s long-running and evolving blacklist of Chinese companies, whether for government procurement, private investment by U.S. firms, or other purposes. Major tech companies like ZTE and Huawei <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/trump-declares-national-emergency-to-protect-u-s-networks-from-foreign-espionage/">were put on the list straight away in 2019</a>, but others were steadily added over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Biden order refines these orders, revising certain portions and expanding others, particularly in the definition of what constitutes dangerous behavior or collaboration with Chinese authorities. Notably it stretches this to cover companies involved in domestic surveillance of Uygur Muslims in China and political dissidents in Hong Kong and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The new list of companies includes many of those listed over the last two years and adds plenty more. Seemingly any major company that deals with tech, communications or aerospace is at risk of being entered on the list, from China Mobile and China Unicom to China Aerospace, Hikvision and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">SMIC</a>. Direct investment in the companies is disallowed, as is investing in an intermediary such as an index fund that includes one of the prohibited companies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EiQdj6klEf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">The Trump administration will add SMIC, China&#8217;s largest chipmaker, to its defense blacklist: report</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Treasury — rather than the Defense Department, as it was previously — is given the responsibility of maintaining and updating the list, either adding to or subtracting from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tackling these challenges head-on is consistent with the Biden administration’s commitment to protecting core U.S. national security interests and democratic values, and the administration will continue to update the list of PRC entities as appropriate,&#8221; read a fact sheet accompanying the order.</p>
<p>Clearly the White House aims to continue and refine the trade war with China started by Trump. Whether U.S. pressure will be enough to influence Chinese policy or if the international community&#8217;s support will be necessary may soon be clear as the president goes to visit allies in search of support on this and other measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company that acquired Uber ATG last year, has assembled a team of outside experts, shared new details about its operations in a self-assessment safety report and launched a <a href="https://aurora.tech/safety">website</a> as part of a broader effort to win over consumers wary of the technology that they may someday share the road with, or even use.</p>
<p>Aurora said Thursday it has tapped experts in aviation safety, insurance, medicine and automotive safety — all people from outside of the niche AV industry — to provide an outside perspective on the company&#8217;s overall approach to safety, to look for gaps in its system and advise on the best ways to share its progress and record with regulators and the public. The advisory group is designed to augment Aurora&#8217;s existing safety efforts, which includes on-road testing and development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for a while we&#8217;ve almost done the &#8216;Field of Dreams&#8217; analysis where it&#8217;s like, &#8216;well if we build it they will come, just look at iPhones,'&#8221; Nat Beuse, Aurora&#8217;s head of safety said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We are always comparing it to these other consumer products, and I&#8217;m not so sure that is actually how we win over the hearts and minds of consumers in every single community in the United States.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beuse, who previously led the safety team at Uber ATG and once oversaw automated-vehicle developments at the U.S. Department of Transportation, said the goal is for driverless vehicles — whether that&#8217;s robotaxis shuttling people or trucks hauling freight — to be adopted broadly. That can&#8217;t happen, he said, without being able to measure and show the public that the technology is safe. He noted that public trust is one of the two biggest threats he sees to the AV industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;If all we worry about is a small number of people who get exposed to [AVs] we will never see the benefits of this technology and the broad scale, sweeping changes and the impact that it can have on our lives in a beneficial way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to do a lot more there [gaining public trust]. Beuse added that gaining public trust should be done in concert with the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for too long it&#8217;s been, &#8216;You, industry, you solve it. You&#8217;re building this stuff,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I really think it&#8217;s a partnership. Of course, we&#8217;re building the tech, we have a huge responsibility, but also the government has a huge, huge role to play and helping us kind of get the public on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>The members of the <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/aurora-shares-safety-report">safety advisory board</a> include Intelligent Transportation Society of America President and CEO Shailen Bhatt, Dave Carbaugh, the former chief pilot for flight-operations safety at Boeing and Victoria Chibuogu Nneji, the lead engineer and innovation strategist at Edge Case Research. Other members include Biologue President Jeff Runge, who is also a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Adrian Lund, managing member of HITCH42, LLC and former president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and GHS Aviation Group CEO George Snyder.</p>
<p>The committee, which has already been meeting, is comprised of people who &#8220;don&#8217;t live and breathe the tech,&#8221; Beuse said.</p>
<p>Most importantly, for Aurora and the rest of the industry, is addressing the looming question of &#8216;how safe is safe enough?&#8217; when it comes to driverless vehicles. One metric that has been adopted, and increasingly criticized, is comparing vehicle miles traveled and vehicle miles per &#8220;disengagement,&#8221; an industry jargon term that means a human safety operator has taken over from the computer driving the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been pretty adamant that that&#8217;s not a real metric because you can drive around in a parking lot and generate some interactions and that&#8217;s a whole lot different than if you&#8217;re driving in a city — and oh by the way, that&#8217;s a whole lot different if you&#8217;re driving on the highway,&#8221; Beuse explained.</p>
<p>Aurora is part of the <a href="https://avsc.sae-itc.org/">Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium</a> (AVSC), which includes Daimler, Ford, GM, Honda, Lyft, Motional, SAE and Toyota, that is working to come up with better safety metrics. The new Aurora safety advisory board isn&#8217;t working directly on the AVSC project, however it is providing general guidance that could help in this effort.</p>
<p>While there is still more work to be done to validate these new metrics, the group does have a handful that it thinks are pretty promising, Beuse said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Software as a service has been thriving as a sector for years, but it has gone into overdrive in the past year as businesses responded to the pandemic by speeding up the migration of important functions to the cloud. We’ve all seen the news of SaaS startups <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/in-2020-vc-exits-fell-70-while-saas-matured-report-6656821.html">raising large funding rounds</a>, with deal sizes and valuations <a href="https://www.saastr.com/what-it-takes-to-really-raise-capital-in-2021/">steadily climbing</a>. But as tech industry watchers know only too well, large funding rounds and valuations are not foolproof indicators of sustainable growth and longevity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Failing to come across as a unique, differentiated company will likely mean settling for an exit that feels mediocre instead of incredible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To scale sustainably, grow its customer base and mature to the point of an exit, a SaaS startup needs to stand apart from the herd at every phase of development. Failure to do so means a poor outcome for founders and investors.</p>
<p>As a founder who pivoted from on-premise to SaaS back in 2016, I have focused on scaling my company (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/activecampaign-raises-240m-at-a-3b-valuation-as-marketing-and-sales-automation-come-into-focus-for-smbs/">most recently crossing 145,000 customers</a>) and in the process, learned quite a bit about making a mark. Here is some advice on differentiation at the various stages in the life of a SaaS startup.</p>
<h2>Launch and early years</h2>
<p>Differentiation is crucial early on, because it’s one of the only ways to attract customers. Customers can help lay the groundwork for everything from your product roadmap to pricing.</p>
<p>The more you know about your target customers’ pain points with current solutions, the easier it will be to stand out. Take every opportunity to learn about the people you are aiming to serve, and which problems they want to solve the most. Analyst reports about specific sectors may be useful, but there is no better source of information than the people who, hopefully, will pay to use your solution.</p>
<p>The key to success in the SaaS space is solving real problems. Take DocuSign, for example — the company found a way to simply and elegantly solve a niche problem for users with its software. This is something that sounds easy, but in reality, it means spending hours listening to the customer and tailoring your product accordingly.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 3, 2021. If you are a startup founder or early employee or investor, there’s good news on the TechCrunch front today: The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/announcing-the-disrupt-2021-extra-crunch-stage-agenda/">start of the Disrupt agenda is live</a>! It’s going to be one hell of a show for anyone interested in startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/the-existential-cost-of-decelerated-growth/">and how they grow</a>. See you there! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/united-airlines-agrees-to-purchase-15-boom-supersonic-airliners/"><strong>United goes Boom</strong></a><strong>:</strong> News broke today that United Airlines has agreed to purchase 15 supersonic jets from Boom, a startup focused on building them. For Boom, the deal is a big happening, evidence of material market demand for its products. And, given how much planes cost in general, a huge set of bookings for the company to show to its investors that have plowed nearly a quarter billion dollars into the company, according to Crunchbase.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/"><strong>Twitter is Blue</strong></a><strong>:</strong> No, the social media company isn’t sad. Quite the opposite. Instead, Twitter’s subscription service Blue is going live in two markets for a few dollars per month. It’s something of a very public test of what Twitter hopes &#8212; we presume &#8212; will be a globally available subscription option for those of us who can’t stop tweeting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/"><strong>Women’s health remains an underinvested startup niche</strong></a><strong>: </strong>TechCrunch’s Natasha Mascarenhas dug into the world of hormonal health for the blog today, asking why there aren’t unicorns in the huge market. It’s a great read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We’re dividing up today’s startup and venture capital news into two buckets. The first comprises early-stage rounds, and the latter investments in upstarts that are a bit more mature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/"><strong>India’s early-stage market accelerates</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Manish Singh reports for TechCrunch that a host of Indian startups are in the process of raising money. He broke an ocean of news in his piece on the matter, not only underscoring how active the global venture market is, but just how hard it can be to keep track of all the activity.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/simplified-raises-2-2-million-in-seed-to-bring-automated-content-creation-to-marketers/"><strong>Simplified raises $2.2M to support marketing creative</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Marketers are expected to generate lots of content. Simplified is taking on Canva and that huge market need in a single go. And now it’s backed by Craft Ventures.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ganaz-raises-7m-a-round-to-rethink-how-agriculture-workers-get-hired-and-paid/"><strong>Ganaz raises $7M to help agricultural workers get paid</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Not every tech company has to cater to the tech elite or the wealthy. Ganaz is betting that its business &#8212; focused on what we described as changing “how people with little documentation and no bank account get paid and send money with a modern workforce stack” &#8212; is going to be a hit. Given how huge the agricultural sector is, its wager makes some sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, on the late-stage front:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/"><strong>Gong raises $250M for sales automation</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Gong’s rapid growth and latest funding was part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/the-existential-cost-of-decelerated-growth/">my column this morning</a> because of how interesting they proved to be. In short, the sales automation company has roughly tripled its valuation to more than $7 billion since last August. How? By growing by more than 2x in the last year.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/">Realtime Robotics raises $31M for real-time robotics</a>: </strong>Boston’s startup scene is more than biotech, it should be clear by now. Realtime Robotics is one such Beantown startup that isn’t building new drugs. Instead, Brian Heater reports, it’s building robot software to “help companies deploy systems with limited programming, offering adaptable controls that work for multiple systems at once.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/leolabs-raises-65m-series-b-for-its-satellite-monitoring-and-collision-detection-service/">LeoLabs raises $65M to keep satellites from hitting each other</a>: </strong>As SpaceX sends bushels of internet satellites into space, the issue of crowding in near-Earth orbit will only get stickier. LeoLabs is betting that keeping expensive space tech from hitting other space tech, or even space trash, is going to be a growth industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 lessons we learned after raising $6.3M from 50 investors</h2>
<p>Two years ago, founders of calendar-assistant platform Reclaim were looking for a &#8220;mango&#8221; seed round — a boodle of cash large enough to help them transition from the prototype phase to staffing up for a public launch.</p>
<p>Although the team received offers, co-founder Henry Shapiro says the few that materialized were poor options, partially because Reclaim was still pre-product.</p>
<blockquote><p>So one summer morning, my co-founder and I sat down in his garage — where we’d been prototyping, pitching and iterating for the past year — and realized that as hard as it was, we would have to walk away entirely and do a full reset on our fundraising strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a guest post for Extra Crunch, Shapiro shares what he learned from embracing failure and offers three conclusions &#8220;every founder should consider before they decide to go out and pitch investors.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big Tech was busy yet again today, with news from Waymo, Twitter and Blackstone. We also have to talk about the law.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/waymos-driverless-taxi-service-can-now-be-accessed-on-google-maps/"><strong>You can now hail Waymo taxis in Google Maps</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Vertical integration, baby! It’s a jam if you are a platform company that makes self-driving cars, operates a taxi service, and also publishes what I presume is the most popular mapping software in the world.</li>
<li>In related news: Waymo, bring self-driving taxis to Providence, Rhode Island, you cowards!</li>
<li>In related apologies: Waymo is not made up of cowards, but merely businesspeople who should invest more of their testing budget in Providence, Rhode Island.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/"><strong>Twitter wants to hear you talk</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Twitter is bringing its Spaces product more front-and-center in its mobile experience. Sure, all you use Twitter for today is tweets, but Big Tweet will soon want to send your newsletters, host your chats, and, well, distribute your Fleets as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/">A court case draws limits around a controversial American hacking law</a>: </strong>Per TechCrunch, the U.S. Supreme Court “ruled that a police officer who searched a license plate database for an acquaintance in exchange for cash did not violate U.S. hacking laws” in a “landmark ruling [that] concludes a long-running case that clarifies the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA.”</li>
<li>In terms of legal news and tech, it’s nice to have some good news.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/blackstone-acquires-tech-publisher-idg-for-1-3b-as-private-equity-strikes-again/"><strong>Blackstone is buying IDG</strong></a><strong>:</strong> While your humble TechCrunchers are somewhat sensitive to the idea of private equity buying media properties, the Blackstone-IDG deal is yet another example of the trend.</li>
<li>The deal means that titles like “CIO, Computerworld, InfoWorld, Macworld, Network World, PCWorld, and Tech Hive” are changing hands, along with IDC itself.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April, Medium CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/ev">Ev Williams</a> wrote a memo to his staff about the company’s shifting culture in the wake of a challenging year.</p>
<p>“A healthy culture brings out the best in people,” he wrote. “They feel psychologically safe voicing their ideas and engaging in debate to find the best answer to any question — knowing that their coworkers are assuming good intent and giving them the benefit of the doubt because they give that in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few paragraphs later, Williams wrote that while counterperspectives and unpopular opinions are “always encouraged” to help make decisions, “repeated interactions that are nonconstructive, cast doubt, assume bad intent, make unsubstantiated accusations, or otherwise do not contribute to a positive environment have a massive negative impact on the team and working environment.”</p>
<p>He added: “These behaviors are not tolerated.”</p>
<p>The internal memo, obtained and verified by TechCrunch, was published nearly one month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307415/medium-union-effort-stalls-one-vote-short-majority-cwa">Medium staff’s unionization attempt failed to pass</a>, and roughly one week after Williams announced <a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81">a pivot of the company&#8217;s editorial ambitions</a> to focus less on in-house content and more on user-generated work.</p>
<p>Medium’s editorial team got voluntary payouts as part of the shift, with VP of Editorial Siobhan O’Connor and the entire staff of GEN Magazine stepping away.</p>
<p>However, several current and former employees told TechCrunch that they believe Medium’s mass exodus is tied more to Williams’ manifesto, dubbed &#8220;the culture memo,&#8221; than a pivot in editorial focus. Since the memo was published, many non-editorial staffers — who would presumably not be impacted by a shift in content priorities — have left the company, including product managers, several designers and dozens of engineers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="k0BgkZ44Mi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/the-future-of-gig-work-could-involve-unions-and-co-ops/">The future of gig work could involve unions and co-ops</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The future of gig work could involve unions and co-ops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/the-future-of-gig-work-could-involve-unions-and-co-ops/embed/#?secret=k0BgkZ44Mi" data-secret="k0BgkZ44Mi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Those departing allege that Williams is trying to perform yet another reset of company strategy, at the cost of its most diverse talent. One pull of internal data that includes engineers, editorial staff, the product team, and a portion of its HR and finance team, suggests that, of the 241 people who started the year at Medium, some 50% of that pool are now gone. Medium, which has hired employees to fill some vacancies, denied these metrics, stating that it currently has 179 employees.</p>
<p>Medium said that 52% of departures were white, and that one third of the company is non-white and non-Asian. The first engineer that TechCrunch spoke to said that minorities are overrepresented in the departures at the company. They also added that, when they joined Medium, there were three transgender engineers. All have since left.</p>
<h2>&#8220;A beloved dictator vibe&#8221;</h2>
<p>In February, a number of Medium employees — led by the editorial staff — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278684/medium-union-unionizing-communications-workers-america">announced plans to organize into a union</a>. The unionization effort was eventually defeated after falling short by one vote, a shortfall that some employees think was due to Medium executives pressuring staff to vote against the union.</p>
<p>The month after the unionization effort failed, Medium announced an editorial pivot. The company offered new positions or voluntary payouts for editorial staff. A number of employees left, which is not uncommon in the aftermath of a tense time period such as a failed unionization and the offer of a clear, financially safe route out.</p>
<p>In April, Williams posted the culture memo outlining his view on the company’s purpose and operating principles. In the memo, he writes that “there is no growth without risk-taking and no risk-taking without occasional failure” and that “feedback is a gift, and even tough feedback can and should be delivered with empathy and grace.” The CEO also noted the company&#8217;s commitment to diversity, and how adapting to “opportunities or threats is a prerequisite for winning.”</p>
<p>Notably, Medium has gone through a number of editorial strategy changes, dipping in and out of subscriptions, in-house content, and now, leaning on user-generated content and paid commissions.</p>
<p>“Team changes, strategy changes and reorganizations are inevitable. Each person’s adaptivity is a core strength of the company,” the memo reads.</p>
<p>The memo doesn’t explicitly address the unionization attempt, but does talk about how Medium will not tolerate “repeated interactions that are nonconstructive, cast doubt, assume bad intent, make unsubstantiated accusations, or otherwise do not contribute to a positive environment [but] have a massive negative impact on the team and working environment.”</p>
<p>Employees that we spoke to think that Williams’ memo, while internal rather than publicly posted, is reminiscent of statements put out by <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong</a> and <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">Basecamp CEO Jason Fried,</a> which both banned political discussion at work due to its incendiary or &#8220;distracting&#8221; nature. While the Medium memo doesn’t wholly ban politics, the first engineer said that the “undertone” of the statement creates a “not safe work environment.” Frustrated employees created a side-Slack to talk about issues at Medium.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Medium said that &#8220;many employees said they appreciated the clarity and there were directors and managers involved in shaping it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The month of the memo, churn tripled at the company compared to the month prior and was 30 times higher than the January metric, using an internal data set obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The second engineer that spoke to TechCrunch left the company last month and said that the memo didn’t have anything “egregious” at first glance.</p>
<p>“It was more of a beloved dictator vibe, of like, your words are vague enough that they’re not enforceable on anything else, and it looks good on paper,” they said. “If you just saw that memo and nothing else, it’s not a Coinbase memo, it’s not a Basecamp memo.”</p>
<p>But, given the timing of the memo, the engineer said their interpretation of Williams’ message was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Medium wants] to enforce good vibes and shut down anything that is questioning &#8216;the mission,&#8217;” they said.</p>
<h2><strong>Medium&#8217;s extreme </strong></h2>
<p>The same engineer thinks that “very few people left because of the editorial pivot.” Instead, the engineer explained a history of problematic issues at Medium, with a wave of departures that seem to be clearly triggered by the memo.</p>
<p>In July 2019, for example, Medium chose to publish a series that included <a href="https://gen.medium.com/singer-joy-villa-on-the-risks-and-rewards-of-going-maga-c1078c4ba7b9">a profile</a> of Trump supporter Joy Villa with the headline “I have never been as prosecuted for being Black or Latina as I have been for supporting Trump.”</p>
<p>When the Latinx community at Medium spoke to leadership about discomfort in the headline, they claimed that executives from editorial didn’t do anything about the headline until it was mentioned in a public Slack channel. One editor asked anyone who had gone through the immigration process or was a part of the Latinx community to get in a room and explain their side, a moment that felt diminishing to this employee. The headline only changed when employees posted in a public Slack channel about their qualms.</p>
<p>“They think caring is enough,” the employee said. “And that listening is merciful and really caring, and therefore they’re really shocked when that is not enough.”</p>
<p>The third engineer who spoke to TechCrunch joined the company in 2019 because they were looking for a mission-driven company impacting more than just tech. They realized Medium had “deeper issues” during the Black Lives Matter movement last summer.</p>
<p>“There were deeper issues that I just hadn&#8217;t heard about because I wasn&#8217;t part of them. That just kind of got slid under the rug,” they said, such as the Trump supporter profile. The former employee explained how they learned that HR had ignored a report of an employee saying the N-word during that time, too. Medium said this is false.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t feel like I needed the memo to really understand their true colors,” they said.</p>
<p>After The Verge and Platformer published a report on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349175/medium-layoffs-union-evan-williams-blogger-twitter-subscription">Medium’s messy culture and chaotic editorial strategy</a>, the second engineer said that multiple employees who were assumed to be tied to the story were pressured to resign.</p>
<p>“The way I see it, they fought dirty to defeat the union,” the first engineer said. “But it wasn&#8217;t a total success because all of these people have decided to leave in the wake of the decision, and that&#8217;s the cost. The people who are left basically feel like they have to nod and smile because Medium has made it clear that they don’t want you to bring your full self to work.”</p>
<p>The engineer said that Medium’s culture of reckoning is different from Coinbase because of the mission-oriented promise of the former.</p>
<p>“Some companies, like Coinbase, have said that ‘we want people who are not going to bring politics and social issues to work,’ so if you join Coinbase, that’s what you are expecting, and that’s fine,” they said. “But Medium specifically recruited people who care about the world, and justice, and believe in the freedom of speech and transparency.”</p>
<p>The engineer plans to officially resign soon and already has interviews lined up.</p>
<p>“It’s a good job market out there for software engineers, so why would I work for a company that is treating their own people unfairly?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you didn’t want to shell out $9.99 per month to watch the meme-worthy iCarly reboot, now you won’t have to. On Monday, Paramount+ will launch its ad-supported Essential Plan, priced at $4.99 per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This less expensive plan will replace the CBS All Access plan, which included commercials, but also granted access to local CBS stations. If you’re currently subscribed to that $5.99 per month plan, you can keep it. But starting Monday, it won’t be around anymore for new subscribers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the Essential Plan different from CBS All Access? Subscribers on the new tier will get access to Marquee Sports (including games in the NFL, UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues), breaking news on CBSN, and all of Paramount’s on-demand shows and movies. This includes offerings from ViacomCBS-owned channels like BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, the Smithsonian Channel and more. But, local live CBS station programming will no longer be included. So, if that’s a deal-breaker, you might want to subscribe to CBS All Access this weekend. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existing Premium Plan ($9.99 per month) removes commercials and adds support for 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision. Like other streaming services, only Premium subscribers will have access to mobile downloads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both plans include access to parental controls and up to six individual profiles. The service doesn’t have a watch list at this time. But that has become a baseline feature for being competitive in this space, so it’s not a matter of if, but when. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For comparison, the basic Netflix plan costs $8.99 per month, but only lets you watch on one screen at a time. That makes it harder to share an account with family or friends. Their standard tier is $13.99, making it a bit pricier than Paramount+.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/hbo-max-launches-ad-supported-subscription-for-9-99-per-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBO Max unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their own lower-cost, ad-supported subscription tier, priced at $9.99 per month. The WarnerMedia-Discovery merger could also have major implications for the popular streaming service, though how that shakes out in terms of content libraries, or even possibly a combined streaming app, remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, consumers will make their decisions about which services to pay for based on a variety of key factors including content, pricing and user experience. On the content front, Paramount+ plans to announce a slate of big-name titles when the new plan goes live on Monday, in hopes of wooing new subscribers. But the low-cost plan may also appeal to those who don’t necessarily care about top movies — they just want an affordable add-on to their current streaming lineup that provides them with access to some of the programs Netflix lacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paramount+ owner ViacomCBS said it added </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/viacomcbs-paramount-plus-streaming-q1-6-million-subscribers-wall-street-1234750834/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 million global streaming subscribers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across their Paramount+, Showtime OTT and BET+ services in Q1, to end the quarter with 36 million global users. Most of those come from Paramount+.</span></p>
