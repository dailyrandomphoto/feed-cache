										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate training startup <a href="http://Attensi.com">Attensi</a> — which originally emerged out of Oslo, Norway — has raised $26 million from New York-based Lugard Road Capital, DX Ventures (a VC fund backed by Delivery Hero), and existing shareholder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/viking-venture-management">Viking Venture</a>. The new funding will be used to expand in North  America and Europe.</p>
<p>Attensi uses a ‘gamified approach to corporate training, putting employees into 3D simulations of their workplace and work processes. Its competitors include companies like GoSkills, Mindflash SAP Litmos Skilljar.</p>
<p>With the pandemic shifting all office work to remote, digital training platforms like this stand to benefit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is also yet another recent example of how US VCs are &#8216;going hunting&#8217; for startups in Europe, putting pressure on local VCs.</p>
<p>Attensi co-founder and co-CEO, Trond Aas said in a statement: “With gamified simulation training, we have combined the best of workplace psychology with our expertise in simulations and gamification to create a new category of training solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company claims it’s experienced a 63% CAGR in annual recurring revenue. Its clients include Daimler Mercedes Benz, Circle K, Equinor, BCG, and ASDA.</p>
<p>Doug Friedman, a partner at Lugard Road Capital, said: “We could not be more excited to be investing in the Attensi team as they work to forever change and improve corporate  learning and development through their Attensi solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> announced this morning that private equity firm <a href="http://kkr.com">KKR</a> is investing $500 million in the company, a move that could help the struggling cloud content management vendor get out from under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds in what&#8217;s called a &#8220;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp">dutch auction</a>&#8221; style sale to buy back shares from certain investors for the price determined by the auction, an activity that should take place after the company announces its next earnings report in May. This would presumably involve buying out Starboard, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">took a 7.5% stake in the company</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-starboard-exclusive-idINKBN2AN1MX">Reuters reported</a> that Starboard could be looking to take over a majority of the board seats when the company board meets in June. That could have set them up to take some action, most likely forcing a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="voIpvT2YUd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">Box acquires e-signature startup SignRequest for new content workflows</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Box acquires e-signature startup SignRequest for new content workflows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/embed/#?secret=voIpvT2YUd" data-secret="voIpvT2YUd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While it&#8217;s not clear what will happen now, it seems likely that with this cash, they will be able to stave off action from Starboard, and with KKR in the picture be able to take a longer term view. Box CEO Aaron Levie sees the move as a vote of confidence from KKR in Box&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;KKR is one of the world’s leading technology investors with a deep understanding of our market and a proven track record of partnering successfully with companies to create value and drive growth. With their support, we will be even better positioned to build on Box’s leadership in cloud content management as we continue to deliver value for our customers around the world,&#8221; Levie said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, John Park, Head of Americas Technology Private Equity at KKR, will be joining the Box board of directors. The company also announced that independent board member Bethany Mayer will be appointed chairman of the board, effective on May 1st.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">bought e-signature startup SignRequest</a>, which could help open up a new set of workflows for the company as it tries to expand its market. With KKR&#8217;s backing, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to expect that Box, which is cash flow positive, could be taking additional steps to expand the platform in the future.</p>
<p>Box stock was down over 8% premarket, a signal that perhaps Wall Street isn&#8217;t thrilled with the announcement, but the cash influx should give Box some breathing room to reset and push forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swag has a long and patchy history in the world of business. For every hip pair of plaid socks, there are five t-shirts you may never wear, an itchy scarf, a notepad your kids might use, and an ugly mug; and most of all, likely thousands of dollars and lots of time invested to make those presents a reality. Now, a startup that has built a service to rethink the concept behind corporate gifts and make them more effective is today announcing a round of funding to continue expanding its business &#8212; and one sign that it may be on to something is its progress so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://alyce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyce</a>, a Boston startup that has built an AI platform that plugs into various other apps that you might use to interact and track your relationships with others in your working life &#8212; sales prospects, business partners, colleagues &#8212; and then uses the information to personalise gift recommendations for those people, has raised $30 million, a Series B that it will be using to continue building out its platform, signing up more users, and hiring more people for its team.</p>
<p>This round is being led by General Catalyst, with Boston Seed Capital, Golden Ventures, Manifest, Morningside and Victress Captial &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alyce says that it has grown 300% year-over-year between 2019 and 2020, tackling a corporate gifting and promotional items industry that ASI Market Research estimates is worth around $24.7 billion annually. Its customers today include Adobe&#8217;s Marketo, G2, Lenovo, Wex, Invision, DialPad, GrubHub, and 6Sense.</p>
<p>As with so many other apps and services that aim at productivity and people management, Alyce notes that this year of working remotely &#8212; which has tested many a relationship and job function, led to massive inbound and outbound digital activity (the screen is where everything gets played out now), and frankly burned a lot of us out &#8212; has given it also a new kind of relevance.</p>
<p>“As everyone was flooded with spam last year unsubscribing soared,&#8221; Greg Segall, founder and CEO of Alyce, said in a statement. &#8220;When a prospect opts out, that’s forever. It’s clear that both brands and customers crave the same thing &#8211; a much more purposeful and relatable way to engage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alyce&#8217;s contribution to more quality engagement comes in the form of AI-fueled personalization.</p>
<p>Linking up with the other tools people typically use to track their communications with people &#8212; they include Marketo, Salesforce, Vidyard and Google&#8217;s email and calendar apps &#8212; the system has been built with algorithms that read details from those apps to construct some details about the preferences and tastes of the intended gift recipient. It then uses that to come up with a list of items that might appeal to that person from a <a href="https://help.alyce.com/article/111-what-types-of-gifts-can-i-give" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider list that it has compiled</a>, with some 10,000 items in all. (And yes, these can also include more traditional corporate swag items like those socks or mugs.) Then, instead of sending an actual gift, &#8220;Swag Select&#8221;, as Alyce&#8217;s service is called, sends a gift code that lets the person redeem with his or her own choice from a personalised, more narrowed-down list of items.</p>
<p>Alyce itself doesn&#8217;t actually hold or distribute the presents: it connects up with third parties that send these out. (It <a href="http://alyce.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices</a> its service based on how much it is used, and how many more tools a user might want to have to personalise and send out gifts.)</p>
<p>Yes, you might argue that a lot of this sounds actually very impersonal &#8212; the gift giver is not directly involved in the selection or sending of a present at all, which instead is &#8220;selected&#8221; by way of AI. Essentially, this is a variation of the personalization and recommendation technology that has been built to serve ads, suggest products to you on e-commerce sites, and more.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&#8217;s an interesting solution to the problem of trying to figure out what to get someone, which can be a challenge when you really know a person, and even harder when you don&#8217;t, while at the same time helping to create and fulfill a gesture that, at the end of the day, is about being thoughtful of them, not really the gift itself.</p>
<p>(You could also argue, I think, that since the gift lists are based on a person&#8217;s observations about the recipient, there is in fact some personal touches here, even if they have been run through an algorithmic mill before getting to you.)</p>
<p>And ultimately, the aim of these gifts is to say &#8220;thank you for this work relationship, which I appreciate&#8221;, or &#8220;please buy more printer paper from me&#8221; &#8212; not &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for being rude to you at dinner last night.&#8221; Although&#8230; if this works as it should, maybe there might well be an opportunity to extending the model to more use cases, for example brands looking for ways to change up their direct mail marketing campaigns, or yes, people who want to patch things up after a spat the night before.</p>
<p>Notably, for General Catalyst, it&#8217;s interested indeed in the bigger gifting category, pointing to the potential of how this service could be scaled in the future.</p>
<p>“At General Catalyst, we are proud to lead the latest round of funding for Alyce as the company has reimagined the gifting category with technology and impact. The ability to deliver products and experiences that both the giver and recipient feel good about is incredibly powerful,” said Larry Bohn, Managing Director at General Catalyst, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The once quiet world of seed investing became frenetic a few years ago as dedicated seed funds and angel networks increased in scale and velocity. That environment has now crescendoed into the present world of the seed capital hurricane: funds galore, solo capitalists splurging streams of rolling-capital dollars wherever they can find a cap table crevice, crowdfunding cash sloshing around — and in the eye of the storm are the founders looking to just snag a term sheet for their companies and get back to work.</p>
<p>Into that maelstrom comes <a href="https://www.indexventures.com">Index Ventures</a>, which today announced the close and launch of a new $200 million dedicated seed investing vehicle it’s dubbed Index Origin. The fund’s name pays homage to the firm’s long-standing commitment to seed and first-check investing, where it has backed companies as diverse as Robinhood, Figma, Deliveroo and Wise (aka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">the rebranded TransferWise</a>) at the seed state.</p>
<p>“Our view is that seed investing is truly the essence of venture capital,” said Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index who joined in early 2020. “It&#8217;s when you as an investor have to take the biggest leap of faith.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She noted that the firm “in the last 18 months, I think we&#8217;ve made over almost 35 seed investments.” The new Index Origin fund would be a ramp up in terms of volume.</p>
<p>There’s extreme competition for cap tables at the earliest stages of startups today, and Index is focusing on a few offerings to maximize its sales pitch to founders.</p>
<p>The first emphasizes flexibility. Achadjian noted that there has been a sort of a devil’s bargain for founders on which type of funds to take at the seed stage. “Do you want a dedicated seed fund who is phenomenal at what they do, or do you want a multi-stage fund that might not have seed-specific resources but they can do a quick follow up [round],” she asked rhetorically. “There hasn&#8217;t really been the right product in the market to help founders have the best of both worlds, and so that was kind of our inspiration for Index Origin.”</p>
<p>Fitting its multi-stage thesis, all Index partners can write seed checks out of the new fund and they can invest in any vertical of interest to them in any geography (primarily the United States and Europe although it’s not explicitly limited to those markets). Achadjian noted that since the firm can potentially double down on later-stage rounds, the fund is more flexible in working with other firms, angels, and the whole coterie of funders at the seed stage.</p>
<p>That solves the capital component. As for providing more dedicated resources for seed founders, Index is offering a trilogy of programs to make it easier to scale businesses. They include a “First Hires” program designed to help with early hires at startups; an Early Adopter Network to help companies connect with potential design customers to find and accelerate product-market fit; and finally, The Index Network, an expert network of specialists (think DevOps, SalesOps, or technical architecture) that startup founders can consult on when they run into roadblocks. These programs and the seed fund writ large will have a dedicated team to help find and grow seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>“Our philosophy has been: we never say it&#8217;s too early for Index,” Achadjian said.</p>
<p>Part of the impetus for these new programs is the diverging mix of founders that have started companies in recent years. “We&#8217;ve actually found that a lot of founders, they used to have technical backgrounds, but in the last couple of years, it&#8217;s shifted to more business-background founders,” she said. That has meant helping these founders find technical talent and building up a network of technical expertise to help them grow.</p>
<p>Secondly, Index wants to increase the diversity of founders in its investment pipeline. “That&#8217;s another driver for why we wanted to do seed, because it gives us a broader access to the very, very top of funnel,” Achadjian explained. “I think if you want to make an impact for diversity, that&#8217;s actually the stage where you can make the biggest impact.”</p>
<p>Index’s approach matches that of Sequoia, which <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/25/sequoia-capital-raises-195-million-for-its-newest-seed-fund/">announced earlier this year</a> that it raised $195 million for a seed fund, also focused on the U.S. and Europe. Most other firms in the multi-stage investing game tuck seed bets inside their early-stage funds, rather than creating standalone investing vehicles. With potentially dozens of checks to write in the coming months, expect to see Index bring even more activity into the white-hot seed market.</p>

Classes range from $5-$25 and various subscriptions and packages are offered.</p>
<p>Moxie has now raised a $6.3M &#8216;Seed+&#8217; funding round led by Resolute Ventures with participation from Bessemer Ventures, Greycroft Ventures, Gokul Rajaram, and additional investors. With the $2.1M Seed round from last October, that means Moxie has now raised a total of $8.4M.</p>
<p>With the funding, Moxie now plans to better optimize the user experience with a curated selection of top Moxie classes; new tools that help connect users to instructors; and the ability to preview classes before attending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company claims to have experienced &#8220;exponential growth” because of its convenience in the pandemic era, with 8,000 classes and 1 million class-minutes completed in March. Moxie’s independent instructors set their own schedules and prices, and get to keep 85% of what they earn on the platform.</p>
<p>The company will also now launch &#8216;Moxie Benefits&#8217; in partnership with Stride Health, provide instructors with access to health insurance, dental and vision plans, life insurance, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Also planned is &#8216;Moxie Teams’, enabling groups of instructors to join together to form small businesses on the platform, not unlike the way some Uber drivers form teams.</p>
<p>Jason Goldberg, CEO and founder said in a statement: “Moxie was born during the pandemic alongside thousands of independent fitness instructors who were forced out of gyms and studios and suddenly had to become entrepreneurs and navigate the new frontier of virtual fitness. Now we are seeing widespread adoption of online fitness into people&#8217;s lives, and Moxie’s growth proves that these shifts in consumer behavior have staying power. We know that 89% of Moxie users plan to continue virtual workouts post COVID — they love the convenience.”</p>
<p>Resolute Ventures Partner &amp; Co-Founder Raanan Bar-Cohen said: “Our investment theory has always been to identify entrepreneurial founders solving for today’s problems. With Moxie, we saw an experienced operator in Jason, with a product that solved for the issues that instructors and consumers had experienced in the shift to online fitness, as well as a clear roadmap for continued success.”</p>
<p>So why has Moxie managed to cleave to the new virtual workout culture? Goldberg tells me it’s down to a range of factors.</p>
<p>For starters, it’s a two-sided fitness marketplace that has live interactive group fitness classes, unlike VOD apps, and, crucially, unlike Peloton. Additionally, any instructor can teach on Moxie, rather than wait to be picked as a ‘star&#8217; by Peloton. Since 90% of classes are live group fitness classes, they are effectively replacing yoga studios and HIIT classes, rather than personal training. He says many top instructors are now earning $6-figures on the platform.</p>
<p>Certainly, Moxie has managed to capitalize on the fact that while gyms are closed, it’s easy to do virtual classes. Will they still stick around when the pandemic is over? Presumably many will find it more convenient than schlepping to the gym and less intimidating than joining classes in person. Additionally, users can switch classes as easily as switching TV channels.</p>
<p>As Goldberg told me via email: &#8220;Covid forced everyone to try virtual fitness for the first time. Guess what? People found it more convenient and more connected than going to offline gyms. And guess what? Peloton is not for everyone.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tines.com/">Tines</a>, a no-code automation platform co-founded by two senior cybersecurity operators, today announced that it has raised a $26 million Series B funding round led by Addition. Existing investors Accel and Blossom Capital participated in this round, which also includes strategic investments from CrowdStrike and Silicon Valley CISO Investments. After this round, which brings the total funding in the company to $41.1 million, Tines is now valued at $300 million.</p>
<p>Given that Tines co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoinhinchy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eoin Hinchy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kinsella/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Kinsella</a> were both in senior security roles at DocuSign before they left to start their own company in 2018, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that the company&#8217;s platform launched with a strong focus on <a href="https://www.tines.com/security-teams">security operations</a>. As such, it combines security orchestration and robotic process automation with a low-code/no-code user interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tines is on a mission to allow frontline employees to focus on more business-critical tasks and improve their wellbeing by reducing the burden of ‘busy work’ by helping automate any manual workflow and making existing teams more efficient, effective, and engaged,&#8221; the company notes in today&#8217;s announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea here is to free analysts from spending time on routine repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on those areas where they can have the most impact. The tools features pre-configured integrations with a variety of business and security tools, but for more sophisticated users, it also features the ability to hook into virtually any API.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135427" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135427" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2135427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=2048,1360 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2135427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tines</p></div></p>
<p>The company argues that even non-technical employees should be able to learn the ins and outs of its platform within about three hours (sidenote: it&#8217;s nice to see a no-code platform acknowledge that users will actually need to spend some time with it before they can become productive).</p>
<p>“If software is eating the world, automation is eating the enterprise,&#8221; Hinchy said. &#8220;Yet, the majority of progress in this space still requires non-technical teams to depend on software engineers to implement their automation. Other platforms are generally either too hard to use, not flexible enough or not sufficiently robust for mission-critical workflows like cybersecurity. Tines empowers enterprise teams to automate any of their own manual workloads independently, making their jobs more rewarding while simultaneously delivering enormous value for their organizations.”</p>

<p>Current Tines customers include the likes of Box, Canva, OpenTable and Sophos.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in Dublin, Ireland and recently opened an office in Boston, plans to use the new funding to double its 18-person team in order to support its product growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tines has quickly established itself as a market leader in enterprise automation,&#8221; said Lee Fixel, founder of Addition. &#8220;We look forward to supporting Eoin and the Tines team as they continue to scale the business and enhance their product &#8212; which is beloved by their unmatched customer base.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, which provides corporate cards and spend management software, announced that it has closed $115 million across two investments, the latter of which valued the company at $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-invests-in-brex-rival-ramp-at-1-6-billion-valuation">first reported</a> that Ramp was raising new capital. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/ramp-looks-to-raise-more-capital-as-the-corporate-spend-market-mints-unicorns/">confirmed the news</a> prior to the company&#8217;s announcement earlier today. Ramp raised the capital in two tranches, the first of which, a $65 million investment led by D1 Capital Partners, valued the startup at $1.1 billion. A $50 million investment led by Stripe, the online payments giant, pushed its valuation to $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch, Ramp CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman?lang=en">Eric Glyman</a> was demure about the valuation differential between the two investments, only noting that different investing groups can have different assessments of the value of a company. TechCrunch&#8217;s read of the two-part fundraising event is that Stripe likely saw Ramp&#8217;s growing scale and wanted to put capital into it but had to pay a higher price for coming in after D1 had already written a check.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, Ramp&#8217;s latest capital raises are a multiple of the amount it last raised when it pursued primary funds, namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">its $30 million December, 2020 round</a>. The company raised twice in 2020, and once in 2019. More recently, Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">secured a $150 million credit facility</a> to help it support growing spend volume from its corporate customers.</p>
<p>Ramp provides corporate cards to customers, wrapped in software that helps companies track and manage overall spend. As part of its news today, the startup shared that it is &#8220;nearing&#8221; a transaction run rate of $1 billion. Glyman confirmed to TechCrunch that the metric was calculated on a month&#8217;s volume multiplied by 12, a reasonable method of determining the figure.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s spend run rate grew by around 400% in the last half year.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kpge0aDmpA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">LatAm corporate spend-management startup Clara raises $3.5M, comes out of stealth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LatAm corporate spend-management startup Clara raises $3.5M, comes out of stealth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/embed/#?secret=kpge0aDmpA" data-secret="kpge0aDmpA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ramp&#8217;s new capital, debt and valuation gains that it has managed thus far in 2021 may help it navigate competitive waters. Its rivals &#8212; Brex, TeamPay, Divvy, Airbase and others &#8212; are also well-capitalized and hungry to take an ever-larger chunk of the world of corporate expense under their belts.</p>
<p>Ramp, like many of its rivals, makes money by collecting a small slice of customer spend as revenue via interchange incomes. TechCrunch asked Glyman if he has plans to start charging for the software that Ramp currently provides its customers for free, as some of its rivals do. The CEO declined to guide us further than our own hunches.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reckons that while growth remains strong at Ramp and its fellow zero-cost corporate spend providers, they&#8217;ll stick with their current model. In time, however, we expect surviving players to ask their customers to pony up for at least part of the software stack that they currently receive for free.</p>
<p>The possibility is accentuated by the fact that Glyman told TechCrunch that his customers are removing existing software like Expensify in favor of Ramp&#8217;s own code in some instances. That means that those companies have spend budgeted that Ramp and others are not accreting to their own books.</p>
<p>And Ramp is not slowing down its product work. Almost all of its new capital, per Ramp&#8217;s CEO, will go into product work. The roughly 100-person company closed 2020 with around 65 people, and plans to continue doubling its headcount every six or eight months, according to Glyman.</p>
<p>Finally, what to make of Stripe on the Ramp cap table? Stripe itself has a <a href="https://stripe.com/corporate-card">corporate card and spend management product</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">was picky</a> when one of its backers put capital into a company that it construed as a rival. According to Glyman, the decision to take investment from Stripe came down to whether his team wanted to work with the larger company &#8212; they did &#8212; and whether they trusted the payments giant. He decided to. Stripe did not receive a board seat as part of its investment.</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;ll see Ramp move its <a href="https://pages.marqeta.com/hubfs/pdfs/Ramp_Case_Study_v3.pdf">backend off of Marqueta</a> and over to Stripe&#8217;s own? Or perhaps Stripe subsumes Ramp at some point in the future. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-led by Inspired Capital and IA Ventures, with participation from Upfront Ventures. This round brings the company’s total funding to date to $20 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based company, which launched in 2015, aims to help doctors experience a more efficient &#8212; and painless &#8212; approach to delivering value-based care by offering an EHR platform that promises “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% fewer clicks, 3x faster workflows, and the ability to truly work on one screen,” said Andrew Hines, the company’s CEO and founder.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value-based care is a delivery model where providers are paid based on patient health outcomes </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">as opposed to the traditional pay-per-service model where doctors are reimbursed per visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen a transition in the U.S. toward value-based care over the last several years, and that shift is also being reflected in how doctors are getting reimbursed. As a result, existing EHR companies find themselves having to add bells and whistles to their platforms, which in turn has compromised the doctor’s workflow experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What has happened over time is we have asked our clinicians to become sophisticated coders. They are clicking through screens that are cluttered, that are not designed with human factors in mind,” said Steve Strongwater in </span><a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.16.0603"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a journal on innovation in care delivery published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Strongwater is a physician and the CEO of Atrius Health in Boston.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Current EHRs are a workplace hazard from an ergonomics perspective,” said Hines. “It’s like if you sit in the wrong chair day in and day out, your back is going to hurt.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technology has made many people’s jobs easier, that’s not the case for doctors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that </span><a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.16.0603"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EHRs are actually a source of physician burnout in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is in and of itself a problem of national concern. </span></p>
<p>The EHR market is extremely fragmented (there are several hundred EHR companies in the U.S.) which makes sharing medical records between physicians a challenge. Because health insurance claims contain significant medical information, insurance companies are a reliable alternative source for a lot of the important data about their members. But if a doctor needs to access that information for treatment purposes &#8211; which they have to do regularly &#8211; they have to log into a different portal or access a different report depending on each patient&#8217;s insurance. That’s one of the problems Canvas aims to solve, and their partnership with Anthem is just the beginning.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s often a major amount of inertia &#8212; and associated cost &#8212; with changing EHRs, Hines, a data scientist-turned-entrepreneur, says the company assuages these concerns by leading its sale efforts with its numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doctors who use Canvas experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30% more productivity in the first month and are able to save 1-2 hours a day charting &#8212; which allows them to see more patients or go home early,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Nigeria and Kenya have been at the forefront of African fintech innovation, activities in Egypt are beginning to shape up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Egypt is home to a burgeoning fintech startup ecosystem, and today, one of its biggest players, <a href="https://paymob.com/en">Paymob</a> announced that it has completed an $18.5 million Series A round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2020, Paymob raised <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/paymob-3-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 million as its first tranche</a> of Series A investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $15 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was raised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the same investors led by Dubai-based VC firm Global Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other investors include Egyptian investment fund A15 and Dutch development bank FMO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total raise of $18.5 million is the largest Series A round in Egypt yet and one of the largest equity rounds in North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lead this momentous fintech fundraise in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paymob has a perfect combination of high-quality technology, product customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannot do without, and an outstanding management team, &#8220;Basil Moftah, general partner at Global Ventures, said of the investment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their market opportunity is also huge; Egypt’s transformation to a cashless society is being enabled by the unique products Paymob has built.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paymob </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 by Alain El Hajj, Islam Shawky, and Mostafa El Menessy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform helps online and offline merchants to accept payments from their customers via several products and solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a payment gateway that merchants can plugin into their sites or mobile application using its APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For offline merchants, Paymob has a POS solution where they can receive in-store card payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has a payment links feature where merchants share links with their customers to receive payments that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are received</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using mobile wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to the company, 85% of mobile wallets transactions carried out in Egypt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is processed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also claims to be the largest payment facilitator in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Egypt, Paymob is also present in Kenya, Pakistan, and Palestine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Shawky says the company has plans to expand into more Sub-Saharan African countries. However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that will come after focusing on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to gain a large market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional expansion (with an imminent entry into Saudi Arabia this year) is one of Paymob&#8217;s objectives following this raise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a statement released by the company, it will also use the investments to expand its merchant network, meet increasing demand, and improve product offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presented one of the best opportunities for fintechs all over the world to achieve massive growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For Paymob, it claims to have grown its monthly revenue over 5x last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also recorded a total payment volume of more than $5 billion from over 35,000 local and international merchants like Swvl, LG, Breadfast, and Tradeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growth allowed the fintech company to raise the second tranche of investment after closing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $3.5 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shawky told TechCrunch that the deal materialized after the company&#8217;s investors and management </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an &#8220;unprecedented growth&#8221; driven by the pandemic &#8220;in addition to the new initiatives launched by regulators, which encouraged them to increase their investment to meet our increasing demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As earlier iterated, fintech is on the rise in Egypt with startups like Moneyfellows, NowPay, Raseedi, Flick providing lending, payments, wealth and personal finance management services, etc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Egyptian fintech ecosystem also got a major boost when incumbent fintech Fawry became a publicly-traded unicorn for the first time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2007, Fawry has been the largest online payment platform in the country and offers a variety of services ranging from mobile wallet to banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Fawry&#8217;s longstanding presence pose a challenge to Paymob&#8217;s quest to become a dominant fintech as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Shawky doesn&#8217;t think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Paymob&#8217;s major competitor is cash. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With only a small percentage of the economy operating in digital forms, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transforming cash into digital is yet to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be unlocked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the raise </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">follows the launch of two funds &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/after-its-first-54m-fund-algebra-ventures-launches-another-90m-fund-for-startups-in-egypt/">Algebra Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/sawari-ventures-finally-closes-71m-fund-for-north-african-startups/">Sawari Ventures</a> in what can be described as an exciting week for startups and VCs in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that began its journey in India 15 years ago, helping businesses reach and engage with users through texts said on Thursday it has attained the unicorn status and is also profitable.</p>
<p>San Francisco-headquartered Gupshup has raised $100 million in its Series F financing round from Tiger Global Management, which valued the 15-year-old startup at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The startup operates a conversational messaging platform, which is used by over 100,000 businesses and developers today to build their own messaging and conversational experiences to serve their users and customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.gupshup.io">Gupshup</a>, which has raised $150 million to date and concluded its Series E round in 2011, says each month its clients send over 6 billion messages.</p>
<p>“The growth in business use of messaging and conversational experiences, transforming virtually every customer touchpoint, is an exciting secular trend,&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global Management, in a statement. “Gupshup is uniquely positioned to win in this market with a differentiated product, a clear and sustainable moat, and an experienced team with a proven track record. In addition to its market leadership, Gupshup’s unique combination of scale, growth and profitability attracted us.”</p>
<p>Tens of millions of users in India, including yours truly, remember Gupshup for a different reason, however. For the first six years of its existence, Gupshup was best known for enabling users in India to send group messages to friends. (These <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/">cheap texts and other clever techniques</a> enabled tens of millions of Indians to stay in touch with one another on phone a decade ago.)</p>
<p>That model eventually became unfeasible to continue, Beerud Sheth, co-founder and chief executive of Gupshup, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“For that service to work, Gupshup was subsidizing the messages. We were paying the cost to the mobile operators. The idea was that once we scale up, we will put advertisements in those messages. Long story short, we thought as the volume of messages increases, operators will lower their prices, but they didn’t. And also the regulator said we can’t put ads in the messages,” he recalled.</p>
<p>That’s when Gupshup decided to pivot. “We were neither able to subsidize the messages, nor monetize our user base. But we had all of this advanced technology for high-performance messaging. So we switched from consumer model to enterprise model. So we started to serve banks, e-commerce firms, and airlines that need to send high-level messages and can afford to pay for it,” said Sheth, who also co-founder freelance workplace Elance in 1998.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gupshup has expanded to <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/gip-messaging-service">newer messaging channels</a>, including <a href="http://store.gupshup.io">conversational bots</a> and it also helps businesses set up and run <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/whatsapp-api">their WhatsApp channels</a> to engage with customers.</p>
<p>Sheth said scores of major firms worldwide in banking, e-commerce, travel and hospitality and other sectors are among the clients of Gupshup. These firms are using Gupshup to send their customers with transaction information, and authentication codes among other use cases. &#8220;These are not advertising or promotional messages. These are core service information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which had an annual run rate of $150 million, will use the fresh capital to broaden its product offering and court clients in more markets. Sheth said a similar use case with businesses he saw in India a decade ago is playing out in many emerging markets, opening avenue of growth for the business messaging platform.</p>
<p>“Gupshup’s mission is to build the tools that help businesses better engage customers through mobile messaging and conversational experiences. As we work towards our mission, we are delighted with this investment from Tiger Global, given its incredible track record of making big, bold, successful bets on innovative, category-defining companies worldwide,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Abacum was founded last year in the middle of the COVID-19 global lockdown, after what it says was around a year of &#8220;deep research&#8221; to feed its product development. They launched their SaaS in June 2020. And while they&#8217;re not disclosing customer numbers at this early stage their first clients include a range of scale-up companies in the US and in Europe, including the likes of Typeform, Cabify, Ebury, Garten, Jeff and Talkable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Spanish co-founders &#8212; Julio Martinez, a fintech entrepreneur with an investment banking background, and Jorge Lluch, a European Space Agency engineer turned CFO/COO &#8212; spotted an opportunity to build dedicated software for mid-market finance teams to provide real-time access to data via native collaborative that plugs into key software platforms used by other business units, having felt the pain of a lack of access to real-time data and barriers to collaboration in their own professional experience with the finance function.</p>
<p>The idea with Abacum is to replace the need for finance teams to manually update their models. The SaaS automatically does the updates, fed with real-time data through direct integrations with software used by teams dealing with functions like HR, CRM, ERP (and so on) &#8212; empowering the finance function to collaborate more easily across the business and bolster its strategic decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s sales pitch to the target mid-sized companies is multi-layered. Abacum says its SaaS both saves finance teams time and enables faster-decision making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to using Abacum, finance analysts in our clients were easily spending 50% to 70% of their time in manual tasks like downloading files from different systems, copy&amp;pasting them in massive spreadsheets (that crash frequently), formatting the data by manually adding and removing rows, columns and formats, connecting the data in a model prone to manual error (e.g. vlookups &amp; sumifs),&#8221; Martinez tells TechCrunch. &#8220;With Abacum, this entire manual part is automatically done and the finance professionals can spend their time analyzing and adding real value to the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We enable faster decisions that were not possible prior to Abacum. For instance, some of our clients were updating their cohort analysis on a quarterly basis only because the associated manual tasks were too painful. With us, they&#8217;re able to update the analysis weekly and take better decisions as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SaaS also supports decisions in another way &#8212; by applying machine learning to business data to generate estimates on future performance, providing an AI-based reference point based on historical data that finance teams can use to inform their assumptions.</p>
<p>And it aids cross-business collaboration &#8212; allowing users to share and gather information &#8220;easily through workflows and permissions&#8221;. &#8220;We see that this results in faster and richer decisions as more stakeholders are brought into the process,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Martinez says Abacum chose to focus on mid-market finance teams because they face &#8220;more challenges and inefficiencies&#8221; vs the smaller (and larger) ends of the market. &#8220;In that segment, the finance function is underinvested &#8212; they face the acute complexities of scaling companies that become very pressing but at the same time they are still considered a support function, a back-office,&#8221; he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abacum makes finance a strategic function &#8212; we deliver native collaboration to finance teams so that they become the trusted business partner they want to be. We also see that the pandemic has accelerated the need for finance teams to collaborate effectively and work remotely,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>He also describes the mid market segment as &#8220;fairly unpenetrated&#8221; &#8212; claiming many companies do not yet having a solution in place.</p>
<p>While competitors he points to when asked about other players in the space are long in the tooth in digital terms: Adaptive Insights (2003); Host Analytics (2001); and Anaplan (2008).</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed round in a statement, <span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Peter Specht, principal at Creandum, added</span>: &#8220;The financial planning processes in many companies are ripe for disruption and demand more automation. Abacum&#8217;s slick solution empowers finance teams to be more collaborative, efficient and better informed with access to real-time data. We were impressed by their user-friendly product, the initial hiring of top talent, and crucially the strong founders and their extensive operational experience &#8212; including as CFOs and entrepreneurs who have experienced the problem first-hand. We are delighted to be part of Abacum&#8217;s journey to empower global SMEs to bring their financial operations to new levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abacum&#8217;s seed financing will be ploughed into product development and growth, per Martinez, who says it&#8217;s focused on wooing finance teams in the US and Europe for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://butter.us/">Butter</a>, a startup registered in Denmark but operating fully remote, is building an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; platform for planning and running virtual workshops.</p>
<p>Offering video software and other features dedicated to workshopping, the idea is to pull people away from using more generic tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which, arguably, aren&#8217;t well suited to workshops. It&#8217;s also an idea that will be welcomed by many remote workers trapped in a groundhog day full of back-to-back Zooms &#8212; and one that has already attracted venture capital.</p>
<p>Backing Butter&#8217;s seed round of $2.75 million, which is being disclosed today, is Project A. Others investing in the burgeoning startup are Des Traynor, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Intercom (amongst other angels). It adds to $440,000 previously raised through a mix of equity funding from Morph Capital, venture debt from The Danish Growth Fund and grants from Innovation Fund Denmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Butter co-founder and CEO Jakob Knutzen tells me that workshop facilitators, such as strategy consultants, HR trainers and design sprinters, typically have two problems: technical overload and a lack of energy in the workshops.</p>
<p>The former includes having to juggle too many tools needed to plan, run and disseminate a workshop, coupled with unintuitive interfaces and an inability to set up elements of a workshop in advance. The lack of &#8220;energy&#8221; when delivering workshops virtually is likely a harder nut to define and then crack, but anyone who has taken part in an online workshop has likely experienced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We solve these in two ways,&#8221; says Knutzen, &#8220;[with an] all-in-one tool that helps facilitators prepare, run and debrief the workshop in one place, [and] a delightful design that supports facilitators in delivering a more human experience&#8230; 90% of our users comment on this; Zoom fatigue is real&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134583" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134583" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134583" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Butter</p></div></p>
<p>You get started in Butter by creating and setting up a &#8220;room,&#8221; including optionally creating an agenda, polls and timers, as well as various customisation, such as a welcome page, image and (yes) music. Next, you invite workshop participants via an automatically generated link that can easily be shared.</p>
<p>On the day, participants join directly in their browser and the workshop leader runs the workshop using the agenda they created as the main guiding point. Butter also supports various third-party integrations, such as for white boarding, note taking, etc. After the session, facilitators can access a &#8220;recap&#8221; in the room overview with a chat transcript, recording and poll results, etc.</p>

<p>Adds the Butter CEO: &#8220;Down the line, we&#8217;ll make this even more &#8216;full workshop flow&#8217; &#8212; [including] more of the planning part, having a full pre-workshop space for participants, building out the post-workshop experience, etc. But for now, we&#8217;ve doubled down on making the &#8216;during&#8217; part flow smoothly&#8221;.</p>
<p>To that end, Butter is yet to monetise, but will adopt a SaaS model. Meanwhile, Knutzen cites competitors as established but generalist platforms, such as Zoom and Teams; legacy specialist platforms, such as Adobe Connect and Webex for Training; and other startups trying to solve the same problem (e.g. Toasty.ai, circl.es and VideoFacilitator).</p>
<p>&#8220;We differentiate ourselves by being laser focused on workshops,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.shilling.vc/">Shilling</a>, an early-stage VC in Portugal, has now launched a new €30M ($35.6M) early-stage fund called Shilling Founders Fund, which is backed just over 35 successful tech founders, as well as large European VC Atomico. The fund will run on a profit-sharing model, sharing fund returns with all of its portfolio founders. While the fund tends to back Portuguese startups it also hold back 40% of its capital for international deals.</p>
<p>The fund says it has already invested in seven companies: Rows (spreadsheet for app creators), Vawlt (secure and resilient multi-cloud platform), Promptly (SaaS platform for health outcomes analytics), Modatta (decentralized marketplace for consented personal data), Biocol Labs (DTC post-chemical pharmacy), Decipad (low-code notebook) and Detech.ai (AI-powered application and infrastructure monitoring platform).</p>
<p>The fund is also launching what it dubs the “Shilling Platform” &#8211; a pool of learnings and resources for startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Pedro Santos Vieira, managing partner at Shilling said: &#8220;We call it experience-based acceleration. Additionally, we run on a profit-sharing model. Each portfolio founder will receive a share of our returns. This twofold approach fully aligns incentives between Shilling, LPs, and portfolio founders.”</p>
<p>Founded by Hugo Gonçalves Pereira, António Casanova, Diogo da Silveira, João Coelho Borges, Juan Alvarez and Pedro Rutkowski in 2011, Shilling was later joined by tech founders Ricardo Jacinto (Elecctro), Miguel Santo Amaro (Uniplaces), Pedro Ramalho Carlos (IP) and Pedro Santos Vieira (GoodGuide) in the last five years. Since 2011, it has invested in a number of breakout hits from the country, including Unbabel; Bizay; Uniplaces; and Best Tables, acquired by TripADvisor.</p>
<p>Hugo Gonçalves Pereira, founder of Shilling, added: “We are a Portugal-based, globally ambitious, VC fund, with a founder-friendly approach to early-stage investing&#8230; and when we say founder-friendly we truly mean it: in our pre-seed program, ventures go from first call, to money in the bank, in less than 30 days.”</p>
<p>As we noted earlier this year in our ExtraCrunch survey of Lisbon, Portugal, the city is gearing up to join other significant tech hubs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://truelayer.com/">TrueLayer</a>, the London startup that offers a developer-friendly platform for companies, including other fintechs, to utilise open banking, is disclosing $70 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The Series D round is led by new investor Addition. Existing investors, including Anthemis Group, Connect Ventures, Mouro Capital, Northzone and Temasek, also participated. New investors include Visionaries Club, Zack Kanter (CEO Stedi), Daniel Graf (ex-Uber, Google, Twitter) and David Avgi (ex-CEO SafeCharge, CEO UniPaaS).</p>
<p>TrueLayer says the Series D brings the total investment to date to $142 million. The injection of capital will be used to continue scaling its open banking network, which brings together payments, financial data and identity to enable companies to build new products that improve &#8220;how we spend, save, and transact online&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This will include further development of premium open banking-based services that go beyond simply accessing open banking APIs and will enable more innovation across financial services, including embedded finance and payments more generally.</p>
<p>To do this, and to support what it says is growing demand, TrueLayer is expanding its engineering, product and commercial teams. In the past 12 months, the fintech has expanded its services across 12 European markets.</p>
<p>Over the years, TrueLayer CEO and co-founder Francesco Simoneschi and I have often pontificated on what open banking&#8217;s killer use case or use cases may turn out to be. We may finally have our answer: payments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because one aspect of open banking is payment initiation, which lets an authorised third party initiate the transfer of money out of your bank account on your behalf as an alternative to card payments, which were never built with online payments in mind.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VSJVCUMHTf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/truelayer-the-open-banking-api-provider-discloses-investment-and-partnership-with-visa/">TrueLayer, the open banking API provider, discloses investment and partnership with Visa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TrueLayer, the open banking API provider, discloses investment and partnership with Visa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/truelayer-the-open-banking-api-provider-discloses-investment-and-partnership-with-visa/embed/#?secret=VSJVCUMHTf" data-secret="VSJVCUMHTf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We believe open banking payments will become the default way to pay online, replacing other payment methods in the next five years,” says Simoneschi. “Open banking is digitally native and mobile-first, moving money at a fraction of the cost, securely and conveniently, while also delivering a vastly better consumer experience”.</p>
<p>The past year has also exposed some of the problems with existing payments methods, as people have turned to digital channels to manage every aspect of their lives. “The problem is cards,” says the TrueLayer CEO, “which weren’t designed for online and have been retrofitted into current online payment flows. Newer digital approaches such as Google Pay or Apple Pay paper over those cracks but don’t change the fundamentals”.</p>
<p>Simoneschi says the company has seen the use of its payments API grow rapidly as more consumers embrace instant bank payments. Volumes grew by 600x over the last year, driven by more and more companies adopting open banking payments, including the likes of Revolut, Trading 212, Freetrade and Nutmeg.</p>
<p>“We typically see that 1 in 3 customers choose the open banking payment option after trying it once,” he notes, revealing that for some clients, closer to 70% of their customers are using open banking as the primary payment method.</p>
<p>“There are a number of reasons why it makes sense for customers. For one, they don’t need to remember card details. Instead, they authenticate with their face or fingerprint on their mobile device, instantly and securely. Plus, they’ll never need to update stored details if their card is lost, stolen or expires”.</p>
<p>Open banking payments as a checkout option benefits merchants too, argues Simoneschi. “These payments typically convert 20% better than cards (and up to 40% with our flows) and have success rates higher than 95%, equating to millions or hundreds of millions in recovered revenue at the end of the year,” adds the TrueLayer co-founder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s plans to expand to international markets in the second half of next month as the Indian edtech giant, valued at over $13 billion, looks to accelerate its growth, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">acquired 33-year-old tutor Aakash for nearly $1 billion</a> earlier this week, plans to launch in the U.S., UK, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico next month and explore other geographies later this year, it told employees in an email.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s international business, to be called Byju&#8217;s Future School, is being led by Karan Bajaj, the founder of coding platform WhiteHat Jr, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">Byju&#8217;s acquired for $300 million last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that through technology, we can inspire kids all over the world to fall in love with learning. Our global expansion comes at a critical time as families are actively looking for supplemental learning that encourages their children to be creative and learn by doing,” said Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive of Byju&#8217;s, in a statement. “This launch furthers our vision of creating active learners across the world.”</p>
<p>WhiteHat Jr&#8217;s platform is playing a crucial role in Byju&#8217;s international play. The coding platform, which offers one-to-one session between teachers and students, is enabling Byju&#8217;s to offer its courses in both synchronous and asynchronous formats.</p>
<p>The startup began experimenting in some international markets late last year, and in recent months has hired several high-profile executives to manage each geographies. All of these executives report to Bajaj, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Byju&#8217;s Future School helps cross the bridge from passive to active learning by offering an interactive learning platform that blends real-time instruction with lessons that generate creative outcomes for kids aged between 6-18 years,&#8221; the email reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Powered by 11,000 qualified women teachers based in India engaging with students from English-speaking countries, Byju&#8217;s Future School is further targeting to penetrate deeper into non-English speaking markets such as Mexico and Brazil. The coding curriculum will also be available in Spanish and Portuguese, besides onboarding qualified women teachers who engage with students in these two countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s Future School plans to offer a range of subjects including music, english, fine arts and science, the startup told employees, and coding and math will be available at the launch.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated with confirmation from Byju&#8217;s.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.nabla.com">Nabla</a>, a French startup launching a new app today focused on women’s health. On Nabla, you’ll find several services that should all contribute to helping you stay on top of your health. In short, Nabla lets you chat with practitioners, offers community content, helps you centralize all your medical data and will soon offer telemedicine appointments.</p>
<p>Nabla’s key feature right now is the ability to start a conversation with health professionals. You can send a message to a general practitioner, a gynecologist, a midwife, a nurse, a nutritionist, or a physiotherapist.</p>
<p>While text discussions are not going to replace in-person appointments altogether, they can definitely be helpful. By increasing the number of interactions with health professionals, chances are you’ll be healthier and you may even end up booking more in-person appointments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other French startups have been providing text conversations with practitioners. For instance, health insurance company <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> lets you message a general practitioner — but you have to be insured by Alan. <a href="https://bilo.ba">Biloba</a> also lets you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/biloba-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor-if-you-have-questions-about-your-children/">chat with a doctor</a> —&nbsp;but the company has been focusing on pediatrics.</p>
<p>Nabla has a different positioning and offers this feature for free — there’s a limit as you can only send a handful of questions per month though. If it’s a common question, you may find the answer from the community. Nabla’s doctors will curate community content as well.</p>
<p>Using a free product to talk about your health feels suspicious. But that’s because the startup is well-funded and plans to launch premium features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135338" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="688" class="size-full wp-image-2135338" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg 2871w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=1536,1031 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=2048,1375 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nabla.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nabla</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has raised $20.2 million (€17 million) and is already working with a team of doctors who are ready to answer questions from the company’s first users — or patients. Investors in the company include Xavier Niel, Artemis, Rachel Delacour, Julie Pellet, Marc Simoncini and Firstminute Capital.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Nabla could raise so much money before releasing its app is that the three co-founders have a track record in the tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Alexandre Lebrun previously founded VirtuOz, which was acquired by Nuance, and <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit.ai</a>, which was acquired by Facebook. More recently, he’s worked for Facebook’s AI research team (FAIR).</p>
<p>Co-founder and COO Delphine Groll has been heading business development and communications for two major media groups <a href="https://corporate.aufeminin.com/en">Aufeminin</a> and <a href="https://www.mylittleparis.com">My Little Paris</a>. And Nabla’s co-founder and CTO Martin Raison has worked with Alexandre Lebrun at both Wit.ai and Facebook.</p>
<p>In addition to text conversations, Nabla shows all your past interactions in a personal log. You can connect that log with other apps and services, such as Apple’s Health app, Clue and Withings. This way, you can see all your data from the same app.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, the startup truly believes that machine learning can help when it comes to preventive and holistic care. By default, nothing is shared with Nabla for machine learning purposes. But users can opt in and share data to improve processes, personalization and more.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nabla wants to optimize the interactions with doctors as much as possible. The startup says it doesn’t want to replace doctors altogether —&nbsp;it wants to enhance medical interactions so that doctors can focus on the human and empathetic part.</p>
<p>Nabla plans to launch a telemedicine service so that you can interact with doctors in real time as well as a premium offering with more features. That’s an ambitious roadmap, and it’s going to be interesting to track Nabla over the long run to see if they stick to their original vision and find a loyal user base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying one through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.</p>
<p>A Gurgaon-based startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/indias-spinny-raises-43-7m-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">attempting to improve this experience</a> said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinny.com/">Spinny</a> has raised $65 million in its Series C financing round, the five-year-old Indian startup said. The new round was led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture firm General Catalyst, while Feroz Dewan’s Arena Holdings, Think Investments, and existing investors Fundamentum Partnership &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/india-the-fundamentum-partnership/">backed by tech veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal</a> &#8212; and Elevation Capital participated in it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round, which brings Spinny’s to-date raise to over $120 million, valued the startup at about $350 million, up from about $150 million a year ago, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The startup declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p>Spinny operates a platform to facilitate sale and purchase of used cars. One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, and Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny, says the startup’s thorough and transparent inspection of the car, buying it from the owner, and then selling it to customers is addressing those concerns.</p>
<p>The startup says it is removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get their full-refund, he said.</p>
<p>Spinny began its journey as a marketplace for used cars, but Singh said the startup has expanded its offerings to become a full-stack platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135671" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135671" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2135671 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=768,351 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=680,311 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spinny.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135671" class="wp-caption-text">Used car marketed is estimated to grow at 22% CAGR to 7.2mn cars sold per year. (BoFA research)</p></div></p>
<p>Days after one of my previous conversations with Singh, New Delhi announced a months-long lockdown in the nation as it moved to contain the spread of the pandemic. Singh said the pandemic did hurt Spinny&#8217;s business for a few months, but the startup has long recovered its pre-pandemic growth figures.</p>
<p>The pandemic made many cautious about taking an Uber or Ola ride, and explore buying their own cars, which accelerated the growth, said Singh. It also significantly reduced the CAC (customer acquisition cost) for Spinny, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Spinny is uniquely positioned to tap this opportunity&#8211;given their compelling leadership and their real market momentum. As long time investors, we&#8217;ve been impressed by how Spinny is reinventing every part of the buying process &#8211; injecting trust and safety into every aspect of the customer experience,” said Adam Valkin, General Partner at General Catalyst, in a statement.</p>
<p>Spinny, which was operational in five Indian cities last year, plans to expand to 15 cities by the end of 2021, and also deploy part of the fresh fund to broaden its full-stack platform, said Singh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spinny has become India&#8217;s most trusted used car brand and is on its way to becoming India&#8217;s largest as well. It&#8217;s heartening to hear customers describe the experience of buying a used car from Spinny being better than that of buying a new car. This has been made possible because of Niraj and the entire Spinny team&#8217;s customer obsession and relentless execution. We are privileged to be their early partners and super excited to double down in this round,&#8221; said Mukul Arora, Partner at Elevation Capital, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery startups, and specifically those focused on grocery delivery, continue to reap super-sized rounds of funding in Europe, buoyed by a year of pandemic living that has led many consumers to shift to shopping online. Today, the latest of these is coming out of Norway.</p>
<p><a href="https://kolonial.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kolonial</a>, a startup based out of Oslo that offers same-day or next-day delivery of food, meal kits and home essentials &#8212; its aim is to provide &#8220;a weekly shop&#8221; for prices that compete against those of traditional supermarkets &#8212; has raised €223 million ($265 million) in an equity round of funding.</p>
<p>Along with that, the company &#8212; profitable as of this year &#8212; is rebranding to <a href="https://oda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oda</a> and plans to use the money (and new name) to expand to more markets, starting first with Finland and then Germany in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas confirmed to TechCrunch in an interview that the funding values Oda at €750 million ($900 million) post-money.</p>
<p>The market for online grocery ordering and delivery is gearing up to be a very crowded one, with hundreds of millions of dollars being poured by investors into the fuel tanks of a range of startups &#8212; each originating out of different geographies, each with a slightly different approach. Oda believes it has the right mix to end up at the front of the pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found ourselves in a unique position,&#8221; Munthe-Kaas said in the interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We have built a service targeting the mass market with instant deliveries and low prices, because if you want to capture the full basket for the family, you can’t be a premium service. We&#8217;ve done that, and we&#8217;re profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, it will have the backing of two e-commerce heavyweights for its next steps.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 and Prosus (the tech holdings of South Africa&#8217;s Naspers), are co-leading the round, with past backers Kinnevik and a strategic investor, Norwegian &#8220;<a href="https://www.ieseinsight.com/doc.aspx?id=1125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soft discount</a>&#8221; chain REMA, also participating.</p>
<p>The funding is a big leap for Oda (the name is not officially going to come into effect until the end of this month, although the company is already describing itself with the new brand, so we&#8217;ll follow that lead).</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/154887-22/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> notes that before this round, Oda had only raised about $96 million, and its last valuation was estimated to be just $178 million in 2017.</p>
<h2>50 supermarkets in one place</h2>
<p>The company has certainly come a long way. Founded in 2013 by ten friends, in Kolonial originally seemed to have a more modest vision when it first started out: Kolonial in Norwegian doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;colonial&#8221; (a connotation Munthe-Kaas nevertheless said the startup wanted to avoid, one big reason for the change), but &#8220;cornershop.&#8221;</p>
<p>These days, Oda is focused more on competing against large supermarkets &#8212; its average order size is $120 &#8212; yet with a significantly more efficient cost base behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been helped by the current climate.</p>
<p>Online grocery shopping has been growing and maturing for a while now, but the last year has been a veritable hothouse in that process: Covid-19, shelter in place orders and a general desire for people to keep their distance all compelled many more consumers to try out online grocery shopping for the first time, and many have stuck with it.</p>
<p>“We have seen a significant inflection point with grocery over the last year with the market transitioning online, accelerated by Covid,&#8221; said Larry Illg, CEO of Prosus Food, in a statement. &#8220;Oda’s leadership and impressive growth in Norway paired with its ground-breaking technology and ambition to scale across Europe and beyond makes them an ideal partner to tackle the grocery opportunity over the coming years.”</p>
<p>Oda has over last eight years grown to become the sector leader in a category it arguably helped define in its home country. It was profitable in 2020 on revenues of €200 million, and it currently controls some 70% of Norway&#8217;s online grocery ordering and delivery market based on its own particular approach to the model.</p>
<p>That model involves Oda building and controlling its own supply chains from producers to consumers (no partnerships with third party physical retailers where Oda powers their services), producing several of the products itself (such as baked goods) to order, and using centralized fulfillment centers to manage orders for large geographies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Centralized warehouses means 50 supermarkets in one location,&#8221; Munthe-Kaas said, adding that this also makes the business significantly greener, too.</p>
<p>Those fulfillment centers, meanwhile, are operated at &#8220;extreme efficiency&#8221;, in his words.</p>
<p>Oda&#8217;s grocery item picking averages out at 212 units per hour &#8212; that is, the amount of items &#8220;picked&#8221; for orders in a week divided by the number of labor hours in a week. The next closest UPH number in the industry, Munthe-Kaas said, was Ocado in the UK at 170 UPH, and the norm, he added, was more like 100 UPH, with physical store picking (where customers select items from shelves themselves) averaging out at 70 UPH.</p>
<p>All of this translates to much more cost-effective operations, including more efficient ordering and stock rotation, which helps Oda make better margins on its sales overall.</p>
<p>Munthe-Kaas declined to go into the details of how Oda manages to get such high UPH numbers &#8212; that&#8217;s competitive knowledge, he said &#8212; noting only that a lot of automation and data analytics goes into the process.</p>
<p>That will nevertheless be music to the ears of SoftBank, which has had a complicated run in e-commerce in the last several years, backing a number of interesting juggernauts that have nonetheless found themselves unable to improve on challenging unit economics.</p>
<p>“Oda’s leading position in Norway is a testament to the merits of its bespoke and data-driven approach in offering a personalised, holistic and reliable online grocery experience,” said Munish Varma, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We believe that Oda’s customer-centric focus, market-leading automation technology and fulfillment efficiency are a winning combination, and position Oda for success in scaling internationally for the benefit of customers and suppliers alike.”</p>
<p>The big challenge for Oda going forward will be whether it can transplant its business model as it has been developed for Norway into further markets.</p>
<p>Oda will not only be looking for customer traction for its own business, but it will be doing so potentially against heavy competition from others also looking to expand outside their borders.</p>
<p>There are other online supermarket plays like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a> out of the Czech Republic (which in March bagged $230 million in funding); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everli</a> out of Italy (formerly called Supermercato24, it also raised $100 million); <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picnic</a> out of the Netherlands (which has yet to announce any recent funding but it feels like it&#8217;s only a matter of time given it too has <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly laid out international ambitions</a>); and Ocado in the UK (which also has <a href="http://techmeme.com/200612/p23#a200612p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised huge amounts of money</a> to pursue its own international ambitions).</p>
<p>And there is also the wave of companies that are building more fleet-of-foot approaches around smaller inventories and much faster turnaround times, the idea being that this can cater both to individuals and a different way of shopping &#8212; smaller and more often &#8212; even if you are a family.</p>
<p>Among these so-called &#8220;q-commerce&#8221; (quick commerce) players, covering just some of the most recent funding rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a> just last week raised $528 million; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a> in Berlin raised $290 million; Turkey’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-becomes-a-unicorn-with-2-6bn-valuation-301256950.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a> — also rapidly expanding across Europe — picked up $300 million on a $2.6 billion valuation as Sequoia took its first bite into the European food market; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly Zapp</a> in London has also closed $100 million in funding.</p>
<p>Deliveroo, which went public last week, is also now delivering groceries (in partnership with Sainsbury&#8217;s) alongside its restaurant delivery service.</p>
<p>These, ironically, are more cornershop replacements than Oda itself (formerly called Kolonia, or &#8220;cornershop&#8221; in Norwegian), and Munthe-Kaas said he sees them as &#8220;complementary&#8221; to what Oda does.</p>
<p>Indeed, Munthe-Kaas remains very committed to the basic rulebook that Oda has lived by for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to beat the physical stores on quality, selection and price and get it home delivered,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a margin business and the only way to optimize is to be completely relentless.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also understands that this might ultimately need to be modified depending on the market.</p>
<p>For example, while the company has not worked with other retailers in Norway &#8212; even the investment by REMA is not for distribution but for better economies of scale in procuring products that REMA and Oda will sell independently from each other &#8212; this might be a route that Oda chooses to take in other markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re in discussions with several other retailers, wholesalers and producers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s important to get sourcing terms and have upstream logistics, but there are many ways of achieving that. We are super open to making partnerships on that front, but we still think the way to win is to run the value chain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ShareChat said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round that values it at over $2 billion, joining <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">four other local startups</a> in attaining the unicorn status this week.</p>
<p>The Indian social network said it has raised $502 million in a new financing round &#8212; Series E &#8212; led by Tiger Global that valued ShareChat at $2.1 billion, up from about $650 million last year. Snap and existing investors Twitter and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated in the round, said ShareChat, which has raised about $765 million to date.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup began engaging with investors for new funds about 10 months ago, and explored a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/twitter-explored-buying-indian-startup-sharechat-and-positioning-moj-as-a-global-tiktok-rival/">full buy out deal with Twitter</a>, which didn&#8217;t materialize, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ShareChat, which claims to have over 160 million users, offers its social network app in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns, or what venture capitalist Sajith Pai of Blume Ventures refer as “India 2.” Very few players in the Indian startup ecosystem have a reach to this segment of this population, which thanks to users from even smaller towns and villages — called “India 3” — getting online has expanded in recent years.</p>
<p>Last year, the Bangalore-based startup launched Moj &#8212; a short-form video app that it says has already amassed over 80 million monthly active users &#8212; to fill the void left after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">New Delhi banned TikTok</a>, which counted India as its biggest international market prior to being blocked. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">inked a deal with ShareChat</a> to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian short-video app earlier this year. (Thursday&#8217;s deal is Snap&#8217;s first investment in an Indian startup.)</p>
<p>Moj competes with a handful of players including Times Internet&#8217;s MX TakaTak, and Glance&#8217;s Roposo and DailyHunt&#8217;s Josh &#8212; both of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">received funding from Google late last year</a>. The search giant was also in talks to invest in ShareChat late last year, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we saw a large vacuum emerge on June 29 with a lot of short-video apps exiting the market — we knew this opportunity was for us. There were millions of short-video creators already trained for creating that content supply. The real game was therefore going to be on building the most relevant feed for the user and we were the only Indian company that had built a world-class feed recommendation system for short-form content,&#8221; wrote Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of ShareChat in a blog post. &#8220;We built the app in 30 hours. Scaled it to 120mn MAUs in 9 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>ShareChat, which began its life on Facebook and WhatsApp groups, has started to experiment with monetization in recent years. On its app, for instance, ShareChat allows commerce platforms to interact with customers via its audio chat rooms. It also quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/twitter-backed-sharechat-eyes-fantasy-sports-in-india/">launched a fantasy sports app called Jeet</a> early last year, as reported first by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at a significant inflection point in our company’s journey — as the internet penetration further deepens in India we are well-positioned to expand our ecosystem of products to 1 Billion+ MAUs cumulatively. We have seen how large the short-video market is in China — with around 80% of the entire Internet population using one of the short-video products(Douyin, Kuaishou etc) daily,&#8221; wrote Sachdeva.</p>
<p>ShareChat is the ninth Indian startup to become a unicorn this year &#8212; and fifth this week. Social commerce Meesho <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">turned a unicorn on Monday</a>, fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">CRED on Tuesday</a> and e-pharmacy firm PharmEasy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww on Thursday</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About a year after Beyond Meat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">debuted in China</a> on Starbucks&#8217;s menu, the Californian plant-based protein company opened a production facility near Shanghai to tap the country&#8217;s supply chain resources and potentially reduce the carbon footprint of its products.</p>
<p>Situated in Jiaxing, a city 85 km from Shanghai, the plant is Beyond Meat&#8217;s first end-to-end manufacturing facility outside the U.S., the Nasdaq-listed company said in an announcement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Over the past year, competition became steep in China&#8217;s alternative protein space with the foray of foreign players like Beyond Meat and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/eat-just-china-dicos/">Eat Just</a>, as well as a slew of capital injections for domestic startups including Hey Maet and Starfield.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond Meat doesn&#8217;t flinch at the rivalry. When asked by TechCrunch to comment on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">story</a> about China&#8217;s alternative protein scene, a representative of the company said &#8220;there are none that Beyond Meat considers their competitors.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zCXuw19QKL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/">Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/embed/#?secret=zCXuw19QKL" data-secret="zCXuw19QKL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>China not only has an enormous, unsaturated market for meat replacements; it&#8217;s also a major supplier of plant-based protein. Chinese meat substitute startups enjoy a cost advantage from the outset and don&#8217;t lack interest from investors who race to back consumer products that are more reflective of the tastes of the rising middle class.</p>
<p>Having some kind of manufacturing capacity in China is thus almost a prerequisite for any serious foreign player. Tesla has done it before to build Gigafactory in Shanghai to deliver cheaper electric vehicles. Localized production also helps companies advance their sustainability goals as it shortens the supply chain.</p>
<p>In Beyond Meat&#8217;s own words, the Jiaxing facility is &#8220;expected to significantly increase the speed and scale in which the company can produce and distribute its products within the region while also improving Beyond Meat’s cost structure and sustainability of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American food-tech giant works hard on localization, selling in China both its flagship burger patties and an imitation minced pork product made specifically for the world&#8217;s largest consumer of pork. The soy- and rice-based minced pork could be used in a wide range of Chinese cuisines and is the result of a collaboration between the firm&#8217;s Shanghai and Los Angeles teams.</p>
<p>Besides production, the Jiaxing plant will also take on R&amp;D responsibilities to invent new products for the region. Beyond Meat will also be unveiling its first owned manufacturing facility in Europe this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth,&#8221; said Ethan Brown, CEO and founder of Beyond Meat. &#8220;We believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond Meat products can now be found in Starbucks, KFC, Alibaba&#8217;s Hema supermarket and other retail channels across major Chinese cities.</p>
