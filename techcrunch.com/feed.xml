					<description><![CDATA[The company's platform enables real-time intervention for people with medication dependence and substance-use disorders.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telehealth company Lucid Lane raised $16 million in Series A funding to continue developing its platform that enables real-time intervention for people with medication dependence and substance-use disorders.</p>
<p>Adnan Asar, co-founder and CEO of Lucid Lane, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/lucid-lane-has-developed-a-service-to-get-patients-off-of-pain-meds-and-avoid-addiction/">started the company five years ago</a> after watching his wife struggle to stop taking medication she was prescribed following an illness.</p>
<p>There are 40 million people prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines each year, many like Asar’s wife, after surgery or in conjunction with cancer treatment to address acute and chronic pain as well as co-occurring mental health challenges, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>However, though the medications work well, out of the number of people prescribed, about 15 million people will continue to use the medication after the prescription runs out. This leads to ballooning healthcare costs with the healthcare system spending $150 billion annually to take care of this population, Asar said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lucid Lane has developed a service to get patients off of pain meds and avoid dependence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/lucid-lane-has-developed-a-service-to-get-patients-off-of-pain-meds-and-avoid-addiction/embed/#?secret=rB9s6ve1NB" data-secret="rB9s6ve1NB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lucid Lane’s latest services are aimed toward avoidance of becoming a persistent medication user or addict. They include comprehensive medication taper management for those dependent on opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol and nicotine, and a medication assisted treatment designed for patients diagnosed with opioid and alcohol substance disorders. The evidence-based treatments are available in more than 25 states.</p>
<p>Its technology utilizes web and mobile-based applications to provide remote patient monitoring and connection to dedicated therapists on a daily basis. A newly developed analytics engine collects health signals from patients to measure symptoms like anxiety, depression, pain levels and withdrawal effects so that the platform and therapists can personalize their treatments. If needed, the engine will connect patients instantly with an on-call counselor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over 90% of Lucid Lane patients who start medication tapering safely taper off, while members who are persistent opioid or benzodiazepine users tapered by 50% in six months after they started the process, which is better than Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Asar said. Patients also reported improvements in pain, emotional well-being and quality of life.</p>
<p>The Series A funding comes one year after the Los Altos-based company secured $4 million in a seed round. Accel Partners led the Series A and was joined by Battery Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Morado Ventures and strategic angel investors. As part of the investment, Eric Wolford, venture partner at Accel, joined the Lucid Lane board of directors.</p>
<p>Asar wasn’t planning for the Series A until later this year, but as the healthcare world was changing around him, venture capital firms began knocking on his door asking when he was raising the next round.</p>
<p>“I met Eric through Battery Ventures, and we had tremendous alignment with passion and mission and it seemed a great fit,” Asar said.</p>
<p>Wolford said he recognized how big of a problem opioid addiction was, that it was a worthy cause, and the size of the market opportunity. “There is something beyond the returns that is compelling, the extent of the problem and the awareness that exists already,” he added.</p>
<p>He also felt that Asar and his team knew the healthcare system and how to introduce technology into it. He mentioned that the industry is complicated to interface with due the complex nature of payers, providers, patients and regulations from state to state. He said that Lucid Lane was embracing the system and working with it.</p>
<p>Wolford was also attracted to the personalized nature of the company’s approach and that it can become the standard of care, taking the pressure off of doctors who want to do right by their patients, but want to prescribe less medication so they don’t become dependent.</p>
<p>“It’s a pressure release value so doctors are appropriately prescribing drugs, are accommodating patients and also providing an intervention to avoid the bad that may start,” he added. “Personalization is what doesn’t exist in healthcare right now, and will help get a person to a state of wholeness and encouragement while also progressing them when they are ready.”</p>
<p>Indeed, things are moving quickly for Lucid Lane. As with the healthcare industry itself, the global pandemic helped adoption of the company’s telehealth platform surge as remote care became more mandatory than a discretionary feature. In addition, Asar said it would have normally taken two years for the company to get into Medicare, but with the government’s updated regulations around telehealth, Lucid Lane is now nationwide with Medicare.</p>
<p>The company has a team of more than 40 therapists across 30 states and will be using the new funding to drive its commercial growth, including building up its sales, business development and product development teams. In addition to a leadership team with experience across the technology spectrum, Lucid Lane also announced that Beau Norgeot, former Anthem clinical AI executive, is joining the company as its chief data officer.</p>
<p>The company is also engaged in peer-reviewed, evidence-based, clinical trials at academic institutions, including Stanford University, the United States Veteran Affairs System and The University of Texas Health System.</p>
<p>“We are the only company addressing the whole spectrum of dependent patients and addicted patients,” Asar said. “Doctors don’t have the time or capability to do this, so we work with them to set a goal for patients to improve their quality of life and reduce their pain.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Latin America<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/"> attracts record-breaking venture capital totals,</a> education technology startups in the region are given new opportunities to grow. In the past week, Coderhouse, a live cohort-based learning platform, and Crehana, an on-demand skills development service for the enterprise, both announced financing rounds.</p>
<p>The back-to-back raises are a reminder that edtech’s relevance in LatAm isn’t just growing in classrooms, but also within organizations across LatAm. It&#8217;s a sign that both consumers and employers believe in the importance of reskilling in today&#8217;s new, ever-changing future of work.</p>
<h2>Broad but better</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.coderhouse.com/">Coderhouse</a>, founded in 2014 by Christian Patiño, is a platform for LatAm professionals to take live, online cohort-based courses in topics such as data, coding, design and marketing.</span></p>
<p>Patiño explained how the original online education platforms, also known as MOOCs, are “super accessible,” with low completion rates. The response to this then became boot camps, which he deems are “way more effective” but inaccessible due to low acceptance rates and high costs. With both sides of the spectrum in mind, he wants Coderhouse to sit somewhere in the middle, combining the affordability of MOOCs (massive open online course providers) and the engagement of bootcamps.</p>
<p>At $100 per course, Coderhouse offers small-group classes led by instructors and teacher assistants, with curriculum designed through partnerships with top companies.</p>
<p>The company announced this week that it has raised a $13.5 million Series A round led by Monashees, along with Reach Capital, David Velez from Nubank, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, Hugo Barra (former head of VR at Facebook) and the founders of Loggi, Rappi, Wildlife Studios, Méliuz, MadeiraMadeira, Cornershop, Bitso, Casai, Clara, RunaHR and Belvo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Coderhouse’s first venture capital check after bootstrapping for years. Since 2019, Coderhouse has grown revenue 10x year over year, and has reached a $12 million run-rate. Now, with formal backing, the founders are focused on growing that total by offering more services in Latin America. Patiño said that 80% of their revenue comes from Argentina, and the capital resources will help them grow their 21,000 student base to other countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Latin American venture capital is breaking records this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/embed/#?secret=0nqAr3JUME" data-secret="0nqAr3JUME" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup serves a variety of students, including people who are looking for new jobs, people who want to get promoted within their current companies and entrepreneurs and freelancers who want to master a business-imperative skill such as marketing or copywriting. The broadness in early adopters could make it hard for the company to provide outcomes at scale &#8212; someone looking to be promoted has very different needs than someone who is looking for a new job &#8212; but for now, it’s helping the early-stage company find its voice.</p>
<p>The round was the first LatAm investment for Reach Capital, a U.S.-based edtech firm. Partner Esteban Sosnik explained how Coderhouse’s strategy is a response to LatAm’s talent bottleneck, as digital momentum in the region continues and roles change. He believes the broadness of Coderhouse’s offering makes it “tough to define one definition for outcomes.”</p>
<p>Sosnik thinks that graduation rates are a good proxy for impact and student satisfaction. So far, 90% of users who pay for Coderhouse graduate from their course, and of that cohort, 80% of students claim that salaries increase post-graduation. Down the road, he could see Coderhouse offering more data on the long-term economic impact of how taking a course can impact job trajectory two to four years down the line.</p>

<p>The company has no filters that limit students from taking courses, so it maintains quality by rigorous vetting of teachers. The founder estimates that only 8% of teachers are accepted to teach on Coderhouse’s platform, resulting in nearly 2,000 active teachers with the company today.</p>
<p>A challenge for the startup will be scaling its teacher assistant [TA] to student ratio. Right now, there are 20 students to one TA, and Patiño wants to introduce more peer-to-peer work and grading to limit how labor intensive a class is for instructors.</p>
<p>As Coderhouse figures out how to be an affordable bootcamp for aspiring and current employees, Crehana is finding its stride in going straight to the companies that employ them.</p>
<h2><strong>Centralize it all</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.crehana.com/">Crehana</a> is a one-stop shop for employers to retrain their employees. Where it goes niche in clientele focus, it goes broad in services: It wants to do the “entire value chain” of learning, from assessing skill gaps to offering content to address weak spots to tracking progress. Right now, there are more than 400 instructors/mentors that teach over 700 courses across 100,000 techniques and competencies needed for jobs.</p>
<p>Crehana announced today that it has raised a $70 million Series B just months after a $13 million Series A extension round. Per CEO Diego Olcese, the round will lead to “aggressively scaling” an offering that now accounts for half of Crehana’s revenue: Crehana for Business.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M9g8vnAwPz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/">The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 2021 edtech avalanche has just begun&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-2021-edtech-avalanche-has-just-begun/embed/#?secret=M9g8vnAwPz" data-secret="M9g8vnAwPz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Crehana for Business is an enterprise solution packaged for a specific company looking to up-skill a portion of their staff. Crehana will continue to offer individual seats on its learning platform, but Crehana for Business illustrates what Olcese sees as the future: the centralization of education as a focus within companies.</p>
<p>“We’re building this so companies can understand the end-to-end process of employee development in the company, from the onboarding process to when an employee gets promoted in their job,” he said. “We are centralizing that management for HR teams.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185919" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185919" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2185919" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="849" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185919" class="wp-caption-text">Diego Olcese, founder of Crehana. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Crehana</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a big bet, one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/udemys-new-president-discusses-the-reskilling-companys-future/">Udemy has been working on for years. </a>The San Francisco-based platform launched an enterprise product that now has over 7,000 customers, hitting near $200 million in annual recurring revenue. Crehana didn’t disclose specifics around revenue, but did say that it had 10x year over year growth in Crehana for Business, with the overall business hitting 4x year over year growth; both metrics are between 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Olcese said that Crehana’s biggest difference from Udemy is in how it handles content. Crehana produces, designs and publishes all content on its site, and selects which teachers will instruct on which topics. Comparatively, Udemy has a <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003469994-Teaching-on-Udemy-FAQ">more open marketplace</a> that allows anyone to start teaching after their identity is verified.</p>
<p>Crehana’s hands-on content strategy makes sense, but is hard to scale; and content isn’t competitive forever. This tension is why the company thinks its future looks more like Crehana for Business, which uses content as part of a broader infrastructure on how employees are skilled, instead of looking like a content provider.</p>
<p>As it works toward becoming an education infrastructure layer, Crehana is experimenting with technology that would allow companies to create their own content that isn’t just localized to geography, but is tuned into personalities, management structures and more.</p>
<p>As for if it ever wants to become a company that would help Nubank, a LatAm fintech darling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">valued at $30 billion</a>, create its own mini-university to train and up-skill employees, the founder was clear: “It’ll be better than a university,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>The Venn diagram in between them both </strong></h2>
<p>Generally speaking, Crehana and Coderhouse’s pair of financings show that investors see LatAm’s digital transformation having a fundamental, long-tail impact on edtech adoption within regional companies. The question then becomes, which is the best way to serve a newly hungry group of learners, and what is the easiest answer for employers&#8217; biggest stresses: unqualified candidates.</p>
<p>The two companies differ in strategy. Coderhouse, for example, believes in delivering education en masse and through affordable chunks. By using cohort-based methodology, the startup helps consumers work on specific skills that can help in a variety of different scenarios, from promotions to finding new jobs. Meanwhile, Crehana believes that going in-house with institutions could be the sweet spot needed to make true change. It is focusing on localized content as an initial moat, but long-term it thinks that employers need a simple way to track employees as they learn, retain and engage with new skills. The company may look more like a learning infrastructure than a content provider.</p>
<p>While the strategies look different in sales, both build off of current strides in edtech, not limited to but including the ability to learn online, the understanding that lifelong learning is a key competitive advantage for professionals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time when people get loans, it’s for big life purchases such as a house or a car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not every big purchase is a necessity. Some are more for fun, and the financing options for those types of buys &#8212; such as motorcycles and ATVs &#8212; are more limited. Today, </span><a href="http://www.octane.co."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane Lending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that embarked seven years ago on remedying that, announced it has raised $52 million in a Series D round of funding that values the company at over $900 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which offers &#8220;instant&#8221; financing for large recreational purchases, boasts impressive financials in a startup world whose inhabitants are mostly unprofitable. For one, Octane is both net income and operating cash flow positive, and expects to originate more than $1 billion in the next 12 months. It has been doubling revenue annually, and CEO and co-founder Jason Guss projects that the company will see “over $100 million in revenue” this year. Its valuation is now “more than double” what it was at the time of its July 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25 million raise, according to Guss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Investment Company Inc., a member of the Progressive Insurance group, led its latest financing, which included participation from existing backers Valar Ventures, Upper90, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, Third Prime and Parkwood, as well as new investors Gaingels and ALIVE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest round, New York-based Octane has now raised more than $192 million in total equity funding since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane launched with the goal of “making lending better in overlooked markets,” according to Guss. Specifically, Octane initially set out to build a lender marketplace to streamline retail financing in the powersports category. Put more simply, it wanted to help people who want to buy things like motorcycles, snowmobiles, jet skis and ATVs get the financing they need to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly learned that the buying journey in powersports markets was broken beyond just financing,” Guss told TechCrunch. “We elevated our goal to build an end-to-end buying solution including editorial content, consumer pre-qualification tools, instant full-spectrum financing and digital deal closing.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2185843" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185843" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2185843 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="578" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=768,652 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=680,578 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Octane</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because lending is involved in about 80% of powersports purchases and about 80% of lending happens in the dealership, Octane focused first on building a lending platform for dealerships and consumers. Then in 2016, it launched Roadrunner Financial, a wholly owned-and-operated lender, so that it could offer full spectrum lending, “expand access to credit and speed up transactions through digitization and automation.” Today, the company is partnered with 3,800 dealers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an anchor in dealerships, Octane then expanded its scope. Last year, it acquired </span><a href="https://www.cycleworld.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cycle World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.utvdriver.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UTV Driver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with five other brands from Bonnier with a goal “to inspire and inform powersports enthusiasts across the nation.” Also last year, it launched Octane Pre-qual, which enables consumers to instantly prequalify for financing on OEM and dealership websites with a soft credit pull. With that offering, Octane aims to help direct consumers to a dealership, close their loan and complete their purchase in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are growing dramatically because we make transactions faster and simpler to close for consumers and dealerships,” Guss said. “We are the only platform to offer end-to-end purchasing benefits in the markets we play in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Octane plans to use its new capital to expand to adjacent “other passion purchase” markets and continue to launch customer engagement tools as well as buying solutions for consumers shopping for powersports vehicles online. It also wants to continue to add dealership, OEM and brand partners, which today include BRP, Suzuki and Triumph Motorcycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We define a passion purchase as a major discretionary purchase that brings people joy,” Guss said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most innovation and investment is focused on large, marquee markets such as small business, auto and homes.” As people spent less toward travel and eating out once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the powersports market got a boost, growing double digits last year, noted Guss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our core customer base was not significantly impacted by COVID economically so consumer demand and loan performance remained strong,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Quigg, chief strategy officer at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Insurance, believes that technology and consumers’ needs continue to evolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane’s point-of-sale loan origination platform provides benefits to consumers and dealerships in a specialty segment of the lending market,” he said. “We like to partner with innovative, forward-thinking companies and believe that our investment in Octane aligns very well with this strategy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane describes itself as a remote-first workplace that has offices in New York and Dallas. It has grown its team by 50% in the last year, from 213 to 336 employees.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sentilink.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an identity verification technology startup, has raised $70 million in a Series B funding round led by Craft Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felicis Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and NYCA also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total raised to $85 million since its 2017 inception. The company declined to reveal at what valuation the money was raised, saying only it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“at a very high multiple” of its 2019 $15 million Series A led by a16z.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naftali Harris and Max Blumenfeld founded SentiLink in mid-2017 after their experience working as data scientists at Affirm, where they built out the company&#8217;s risk function. At one point during their tenure at the installment loan provider, they came across a “peculiar” fraud case, where 12 identities applied for loans using the same name and date of birth but 12 different Social Security numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair was surprised to discover that all 12 of the identities had real credit reports with 750+ credit scores despite not being real people. It was then they realized how big a problem identity verification was and how poorly it was done, and founded SentiLink with Affirm CEO and founder Max Levchin&#8217;s blessing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based SentiLink aims to help banks, lenders and financial institutions detect fraud at the point of application through a real-time API. Specifically, those APIs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detect fake and stolen identities for new account</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, before a bank issues a new credit card, it will send the application information to SentiLink. SentiLink&#8217;s models and technology assess the credit card application for various fraud risks, including identity theft and synthetic fraud. If SentiLink detects the application as high risk, the bank will ask for more information or reject the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink works with more than 100 financial institutions, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">three of the top 10 banks in the U.S. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has verified several hundred million applications to date, and saw its revenue grow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by “5x” over the last year, according to Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craft Ventures co-founder and general partner David Sacks said SentiLink’s growth trajectory is “one of the fastest” he’s ever seen.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their traction with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">companies from new startups to major U.S. banks is impressive,” he added. “All of this stems from the team’s deep understanding of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fraud and identity. I learned about fraud attacks I didn&#8217;t even think were possible from talking</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with Naftali and Max.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris said the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a few </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">months away from profitability before its Series B but decided the opportunity was “too big to grow slowly.” So it opted to put off profitability so it could expand more “aggressively.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the slew of companies in the space out there, it can be hard to differentiate what makes one unique compared to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Harris, the biggest differentiation in SentiLink’s approach is how much it emphasizes “deep understanding of fraud and identity in our models.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a team of fraud investigators that manually review applications every day looking for fraud, and we use their insights and discoveries in our fraud models and technology,” he told TechCrunch. “This deep understanding is so important to us that every Friday the entire company spends an hour reviewing fraud cases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink, Harris added, focuses on &#8220;deeply&#8221; understanding fraud and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">identity, and then using technology to productionalize these insights.  Those discoveries include</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the deterioration of phone/name match data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">uncovering &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">same name&#8221; fraud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This deep understanding is so important that SentiLink employs</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a team of risk analysts whose full time job is to investigate new kinds of fraud and discover</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">what the fraudsters are doing,” the company says.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink, like so many other startups, saw an increase in business during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The various government assistance programs were rife with fraud. This had a cascading effect throughout financial services, where fraudsters that had successfully stolen government money attempted to launder it into the financial system,” Harris said. “As a result we&#8217;ve been very busy, particularly with checking and savings accounts that until now have had relatively little fraud.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to build out its product suite and do some hiring. Today it has 25 employees, with five accepted offers, and expects to end the year with a headcount of 45-50.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identity verification has so many aspects to it and approaches, and so we plan to significantly expand our product suite beyond the scoring API that we&#8217;ve started with,” Harris told TechCrunch. “Part of this will include continuing to invest heavily in our product team, part of this will involve partnering with other companies, and it may also include acquisitions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of September, for example, the company plans to launch a KYC (“Know Your Customer”) solution.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Marg, a principal at Craft, said Harris and Blumenfeld’s ex</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perience at Affirm “was a clear sign they were experts on this subject.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We love it when founders have an earned secret or insight around a massive problem that outsiders don’t understand, and SentiLink is a perfect example of this,” he said. “Their fast growth only validated that the problem they were solving for customers was urgent and painful.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, chartering vessels and processing ocean freight can be challenging. The sector is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inefficient and fragmented. Merchants also struggle to access finance to perform cross-border trade in the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of digital freight companies are tackling this problem, like Nigerian-based <a href="https://mvx.trade/">MVX</a>. The company today is announcing its $1.3 million seed round to bolster its efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tlmembereo">Tonye Membere-Otaji</a> thought about the idea for MVX in 2016. Having worked in the maritime industry (running his family business and in a professional capacity building apps and websites for companies), Membere-Otaji </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was intrigued by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how no online marketplace for vessels existed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I decided to figure out how to solve that problem of finding vessels because there were too many intermediaries, which made processes difficult,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a few issues relating to not having the right team to build out the product stalled the company&#8217;s progress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Membere-Otaji finally launched the company with CTO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/oluwatobi-amusan-2b379853">Tobi Amusan</a> after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/05/27/nigerian-maritime-logistics-platform-mvxchange-closes-pre-seed-funding-round/">securing a $100,000 pre-seed investment from Oui Capital</a>, a pan-African VC firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MVXchange at first. Its business model revolved around providing a support vessel booking platform that matched vessel chartering requests made by operators with available Offshore Support Vessels (OSVs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in March 2020, the company made a sharp pivot and tweaked its model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Membere-Otaji cites uncertainty of oil prices and the pandemic as reasons behind the decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t see ourselves doing vessel chartering for the long term because the demand for fossil fuels will definitely reduce over the next few decades. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to do something scalable, something that was impactful, and something that we could be proud of in the next 20 years,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What followed was the launch of MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform, helping cargo owners find deals on moving containers across Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This April, the company launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, both offerings are now </span><a href="https://mvx-hq.medium.com/mvx-the-new-face-of-convenient-trade-in-africa-dd353c481f7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rolled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mvx-hq.medium.com/mvx-the-new-face-of-convenient-trade-in-africa-dd353c481f7"> into one</a>: MVX.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, MVX wants to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online. The startup has expanded beyond Nigeria and claims that merchants from the West African country,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as Kenya, South Africa, Ghana and Rwanda, can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX charges a commission for the services provided, including trucking, warehousing, shipping, and cargo stuffing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it easy and convenient for businesses. Instead of trying to do everything themselves, which can be chaotic and cause </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">distraction from their core businesses, we handle everything because we have all these service providers in one platform. So as shippers work with us, MVX works with like seven to 10 other service providers,&#8221; said Membere-Otaji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for cross-border logistics services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hit revenues of $32 billion by 2025. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the market to reach its full potential. That has been the case, and investors are noticing too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Ghana&#8217;s Jetstream <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/">offers a similar service and raised $3 million</a> two months ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SEND is another example; <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/send">YC backs the startup</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what stands out for MVX, according to Membere-Otaji, is that the company also sees itself as a trade finance company.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ghana&#8217;s Jetstream lands $3M to build the digital infrastructure for Africa&#8217;s trade corridors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/embed/#?secret=PqTrMEAXdB" data-secret="PqTrMEAXdB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept brings together the best of both worlds of fintech and trade. So the way it works is that with merchants looking to move shipments from Africa to the U.S. or China, some lack adequate capital to pay for freight or supply. With MVX, they can proceed to request credit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX passes it over to its financial partners, who lend to the consumers if they meet the minimum requirement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next, MVX takes care of the shipment and delivers it abroad. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the transaction </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the merchant pays back, with all partners taking commissions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our job </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to empower trade in Africa, and freight is a means to that. From every step involved in that process, from providing trade and finance to warehousing to payments processing, we want to play in all that space. There aren&#8217;t a lot of companies with that trading finance element doing that like us. And also, we see a huge potential in the offline market. Right now, the reason why we have this problem is that transactions are offline. Our strategy in capturing offline markets is also key.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pan-African freight company has already recorded more than 300 shipments this year but plans to end with 1,500. Per revenue and traction, the CEO claims the company has surpassed its 2020 numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX raised money for its seed round from Africa-focused firms Kepple Africa, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa, and Capital Oak. Some angel investors in the U.S., Japan, Nigeria, and South Africa also participated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year-old startup will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its operations, hire staff and improve its technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX is also talking to investors to raise more money, most likely debt, for its trade financing product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>In a statement, Satoshi Shinada, general partner at Kepple Africa, said, &#8220;The trade sector in Africa is one that we believe is ripe for disruption. MVX is building a game-changing technology and platform to revolutionize how businesses in Africa move shipment and trade around the world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data science platform <a href="https://www.dataiku.com/">Dataiku</a> announced today it has raised a $400 million Series E, bringing its valuation to $4.6 billion. The round was led by Tiger Global, with participation from returning investors like ICONIQ Growth, CapitalG, FirstMark Capital, Battery Ventures, Snowflake Ventures and Dawn Capital.</p>
<p>New investors included Insight Partners, Eurazeo, Lightrock and Olivier Pomel, the chief executive of Datadog.</p>
<p>Dataiku’s last round of funding was a $100 million Series D in 2020.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Dataiku is used by data scientists, but also designed for business analysts and other people with less technical backgrounds. The platform lets companies design and deploy AI and analytics apps, turn raw data into advanced analytics and design machine learning models. It’s been used for a wide array of use cases, including fraud detection, customer churn prevention and supply chain optimization.</p>
<p>The company now has about 450 enterprise clients, including Unilever, Merck, GE, Ubisoft and NXP.</p>

<p>In June, Dataiku launched a fully managed version of the platform called Dataiku Online, which means the company takes care of setup and infrastructure. Co-founder and CEO Florian Douetteau told TechCrunch at the time Dataiku Online is focused on getting more startups and SMBs onto the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Tiger Global partner John Curtius said, “We’ve seen that executing an AI strategy in which data is part of day-to-day operations can have large-scale impact for organizations across sectors and sizes, and Dataiku is well-positioned to continue to help the enterprise realize this potential value given both the strength of their technology and the team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industry veteran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/jiten-gupta-jupiter-launch/">Jitendra Gupta&#8217;s neobank for consumers in India</a> &#8212; Jupiter &#8212; has raised $45 million in a new financing round as the Bangalore and Mumbai-based startup gears up for its platform&#8217;s public launch in about a month.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series B, was co-led by Brazil-based Nubank, Global Founders Capital, Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners India. Mirae Assets Venture also joined the round and existing investors including Addition Ventures, Tanglin VC, 3one4 Capital, Greyhound and Beenext also participated.</p>
<p>The new round values the two-year-old Indian startup, which has raised $70 million to date, at over $300 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://jupiter.money">Jupiter</a> has built a neobank for consumers in India. The startup, which launched its eponymous platform in beta in June, is attempting to bring &#8220;delight&#8221; to the banking experience.</p>
<p>“We believe that a bank account should be a smart account, where it gives you insight, shares personalized tips and guides you through attaining some financial discipline,” said Gupta &#8212; who co-founded CitrusPay (sold to Naspers’ PayU) and served as managing director of PayU &#8212; in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186055" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186055" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186055" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="668" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=1536,1001 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186055" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jupiter</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has developed a number of products including a savings account bundled with features that aim to simplify money management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform, which positions itself as a &#8220;100% digital bank,&#8221; also offers the ability to buy now and pay later on UPI, a standard developed by a coalition of banks in India that has become the most popular way people in the country transact online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nubank and Jupiter share the mission of making banking the best experience possible for our customers, putting an end to all the bureaucracy and the pain in the current system. The Indian and Brazilian markets have many similarities and through this investment, we aim to support Jupiter in their growth path. We see a lot of potential and are excited about joining them so early on their journey,” said David Vélez, founder and chief executive of Nubank, in a statement. The Brazilian giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">raised $750 million in June this year</a> at a valuation of $30 billion.)</p>
<p>In an interaction Thursday, Gupta said the startup, which employs over 120 people, is currently working to on-board the 100,000 people who have signed up to its waiting list. In about a month, he said, Jupiter will launch to the public.</p>
<p>Scores of startups in India are attempting to improve the banking experience in India today. Whether <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">you are a teenager</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/fampay-a-fintech-aimed-at-teens-in-india-raises-38-million/">just out of college</a>, or a working professional, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/jai-kisan-a-fintech-startup-aimed-at-rural-india-raises-30-million/">don’t have a credit score</a>, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan. But even these services have a ceiling limit of some sort.</p>
<p>“If you really want to change the banking industry, you cannot operate from the side. You have to fight from the centre, where they deposit their money. It’s a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of initial capital and experience with banks,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>Scores of investors have been in talks with Gupta in recent quarters to invest in the round, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Gupta said earlier that he is not looking to raise a ton of capital for his new venture.</p>
<p>“Neobanks such as Jupiter are exactly what India needs: someone who can deliver simple, extensive and high-quality digital banking in a cost-efficient way,&#8221; said Ashish Dave, chief executive of Mirae Asset Venture Investments&#8217; India business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think a customer experience so good that it feels like making privileged banking available to folks who dread branch visits and long waiting times. Banking needs to meet customers where they are, and serve them in the most intuitive manner possible. Jiten and his stellar tech team have built just that, on top of the existing banking stack,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ever considerate of its users, Facebook has determined that its privacy settings needed a bit of a shuffle to keep things clear and easy to find. To that end they&#8217;ve taken the &#8220;privacy settings&#8221; settings and scattered them mischievously among the other categories.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things easier to find. Instead of having settings spread across nearly 20 different screens, they’re now accessible from a single place,&#8221; writes Facebook in a blog post announcing the changes.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-data-privacy/">that&#8217;s from 2018</a>, when they <em>centralized</em> privacy settings to make them easier to find. <em>This</em> is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/">the one from today</a> about decentralizing them into a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>&#8220;Settings are now grouped into six broad categories, each containing several related settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies … We’ve unbundled the Privacy Settings category and moved the settings previously contained within it into other categories.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185957" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/salt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185957" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/salt.gif" alt="Facebook unbundling its privacy settings (but the image is actually a guy sprinkling salt in the wind)" width="452" height="454" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2185957" class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: Facebook unbundling its privacy settings into new categories.</p></div></p>
<p>Under which of those categories do you think privacy settings belong? Facebook &#8220;renamed them to more closely match people’s mental models,&#8221; so it should be obvious. Just use your mental model.</p>
<p>If your answer is &#8220;all of them, conceivably,&#8221; congratulations, you got it! Now if you want to update your privacy settings, all you need to do is visit all of these new categories and subcategories individually. Any one of them might have a crucial toggle inside — it&#8217;s like a treasure hunt!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185953" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185953" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185953" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg 1377w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/re-re-design.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2185953" class="wp-caption-text">Facebook&#8217;s settings page, from oldest to newest. Which do you prefer?<strong> Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>We joke, but Facebook did also make the &#8220;Privacy Checkup&#8221; item much more prominent in this update.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed his support Wednesday for a ballot initiative in Massachusetts that would keep gig economy workers classified as independent contractors, fulfilling a promise he made nearly a year ago to push for laws that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">preserve its business model</a>.</p>
<p>“In the state of Massachusetts, we think the right answer is our IC+ model, which is independent contractor with benefits,” Khosrowshahi said during the earnings call with investors. “Our drivers love it. Prop 22 has proven to be incredibly popular with California drivers.”</p>
<p>His comments come a day after a coalition of app-based ride-hailing and on-demand delivery companies, which includes Uber, Doordash, Lyft and Instacart, filed a petition for the ballot initiative that would classify app-based ride-hail and delivery workers as independent contractors and provide them with benefits such as healthcare stipends for drivers who work at least 15 hours per week. The coalition claimed that the provision would allow drivers to earn a minimum of $18 per hour in 2023 before tips. The ballot measure, if it passes legal muster and receives enough signatures, would be included in the November 2022 election.</p>
<p>Proposition 22, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">ballot measure that kept gig workers in the state classified as independent contractors</a>. passed in California in November last year. It also exempts gig companies like Uber from AB-5, the bill that entitles gig workers to self-classify as employees with usual labor protections that don&#8217;t apply to independent contractors, like minimum wage, sick leave, unemployment and workers&#8217; compensation benefits.</p>
<p>Gig companies, which largely have yet to become profitable, spent $205 million in marketing for this ballot measure and made no secret about plans to do the same thing in other states. Which brings us back to Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi said during the earnings call that the vast majority of drivers prefer the IC+ model over full-time employment. The Coalition to Protect Workers’ Rights disagreed, arguing that <a href="https://noprop22ma.com/402-2/">the ballot language has loopholes</a> that would create a subminimum wage for app-based workers and that few would qualify for the healthcare support promised. It also noted that the measure would remove anti-discrimination protections, eliminates workers’ compensation rules and allows companies to cheat the state unemployment system of hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uber has been using independence as a red herring for years,&#8221; Shona Clarkson, organizer for Gig Workers Rising, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We know that drivers do not actually have independence while driving for Uber. There is no independence in working 70+ hours a week, not being able to set your own rates, not being able to see where a ride is going and having no real control at work. The benefits promised under Prop 22 were a sham that have not materialized. As a network of over 10,000 gig workers in the state of California, we have not seen Uber drivers able to access any meaningful benefits since the implementation of Prop 22.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi said Californians voted in favor of Prop 22 because they had driver support, and he sees no reason why Massachusetts should be any different.</p>
<p>&#8220;We absolutely prefer a legislative outcome in Massachusetts, but if we can&#8217;t get there we&#8217;ll take it to the vote and based on what happened in California, we&#8217;re quite confident,&#8221; he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Though 2021 is far from over, it’s already witnessed a record level of venture capital activity in the technology sector. With larger round sizes announced daily, founders may have their pick of term sheets — but they need to think critically and strategically about which firms to add to their cap table.</p>
<p>So far this year, we’ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">$292.4 billion</a> in venture financing across the globe, of which $138.9 billion was raised in the United States. Specific to tech companies, the capital is only accelerating: In Q2, founders raised 157% more capital compared to the same period last year, according to the latest data from CB Insights.</p>
<p>It’s not just that more companies are raising money <del>—</del> they are doing so at a higher valuation. Median seed and Series A stage valuations today stand at $12 million and $42 million, respectively, up 20% to 30% from 2020. This can be partly attributed to growing exits/M&amp;A activity in the technology sector, a record number of IPOs and a general bullishness around technology, as well as low interest rates and liquidity in the market.</p>

			Good VCs who are aligned with a startup’s vision create more value than the dollars they bring to the table.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At a time when we are witnessing record VC activity, founders would be well served to go back to the basics and focus on the principles of fundraising when determining who sits on their cap table. Here are a few pointers for founders in that direction:</p>
<h2>1. Value &gt; valuation</h2>
<p>Good VCs who are aligned with a startup’s vision create more value than the dollars they bring to the table. Typically, such value is created across a few distinct functions &#8212; product, sales, domain expertise, business development and recruiting, to name a few &#8212; based on the background of the partners of the fund and the composition of their limited partners (investors in the venture fund).</p>
<p>Further, the right VC can serve as an authentic, objective sounding board for CEOs, which can be an asset to have as a startup navigates uncertainty and the typical challenges that come with scaling a young company. As founders assess multiple term sheets, it’s worth thinking through whether they should optimize for VCs who offer the highest valuation, or for ones who bring the most value to the table.</p>
<h2>2. A two-way street</h2>
<p>Running an efficient fundraising process, in part, entails holding VCs accountable to their own diligence requests. While it is unfortunately common for VCs to request a lot of data upfront, startups should share information after assessing intent and appetite on the investors’ part.</p>
<p>For every additional data request, founders are well within their rights (and should) check with their potential investors on where the process stands and get indicative timelines for moving forward with next steps. Mark Suster <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-you-should-never-have-a-data-room-the-most-counter-intuitive-fund-raising-advice-youll-ever-9380172366ea">said</a> it best: “Data rooms are where fundraising processes go to die.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 4, 2021. It’s been hectic: Robinhood’s stock lost its mind. Facebook made another chunk of the internet mad. And a new unicorn wants to go public? It’s been a great day for tech news.</p>
<p>But before we get on with it, we’re excited to announce that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter! This Week in Apps by Sarah Perez launches this Saturday morning, August 7, and is the place to go for all of your app news goodness. Be sure to sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/">Robinhood’s stock does insane things:</a> </strong>Robinhood users were involved in the GameStop and AMC trading frenzies earlier this year. So perhaps it was inevitable that Robinhood’s own stock would get caught in a similar updraft. That’s what happened today, with shares of the newly public fintech company soaring far, far above its IPO price. So much for the Robinhood public offering being underwhelming!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/human-interest-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-plans-for-an-ipo/">Human Interest is now a unicorn, wants to go public:</a></strong> With a fresh $100 million round constructed of bricks of cash from both TPG and SoftBank, Human Interest’s SMB 401(k) service is now worth $1 billion. Per our own Mary Ann, it’s “targeting a traditional IPO sometime in 2023, with execs saying the target is to have ‘$200 million+ in run-rate revenue before going public.’” More of this sort of clear planning, please.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/neobanks-moves-toward-profitability-could-be-the-path-to-public-markets/">Neobanks’ improving economics could hint at future IPOs:</a></strong> Checking in on the recent financial performance of a few neobanks, TechCrunch discovers quite a lot to like in the numbers. There are some laggards, but the huge, global venture capital bet on the fintech banking model appears to be set to pay off.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/the-stripe-for-b2b-payments-reserve-trust-raises-30-5m-in-qed-led-round/"><strong>Denver’s Reserve Trust reloads for business payments:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It takes a bit of explaining, but moving money around the world is hard without a partner bank. Reserve Trust wants to help companies move their funds directly, sans banking partners. And it just raised $30.5 million to do so. The issues of accepting and moving money online are huge problem spaces, evidence of which you can see in this section of Daily Crunch most days, it feels.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/"><strong>ispace is going to the moon:</strong></a> Japanese space tech company ispace has raised a fresh $46 million Series C to help it undertake a number of lunar missions in the coming years. Three missions in three years, it turns out. The new capital is to support its second and third launches which should come &#8212; take off? &#8212; in 2023 and 2024.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/fullstory-raises-103m-at-a-1-8b-valuation-to-combat-rage-clicks-on-websites-and-apps/">FullStory raises $103M to make digital UIs suck less:</a> </strong>By tracking where users click in confusion, anger or frustration, FullStory wants to help companies improve their various digital interfaces. If you hate how some apps are built (and who doesn’t), FullStory could be good news. The Atlanta-based company is now worth $1.8 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/"><strong>More money to buy up e-commerce brands:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The global push to raise capital, buy e-commerce brands and unify them under a single aegis is a huge area of venture capital investment. Today’s round is Suma Brands, which now has $150 million to execute acquisitions. The new capital is mostly debt, it turns out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/dubai-based-buy-now-pay-later-platform-tabby-raises-50m-at-300m-valuation/"><strong>tabby raises $50M Series B for Middle Eastern BNPL work:</strong></a> We have a new buy now, pay later round for you today. This time it’s tabby, which is based in Dubai and has a focus on its local region. Global Founders Capital and STV led the funding round, which also included a host of other venture capital firms like Mubadala Investment Capital and Raed Ventures.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/work-bench-will-continue-supporting-early-stage-enterprise-startups-with-new-100m-fund/"><strong>Work-Bench closes $100M new fund:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New York-based Work-Bench has raised a new fund to invest in enterprise SaaS companies. In a world of megafunds and billion-dollar deals, the firm is staying smaller than it probably could have grown. (It also dropped <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/the-state-of-enterprise-tech-in-nyc-1h-2021-funding-report">some research on the New York tech scene</a> that I’m chewing on.)</li>
<li>Rounding out our startup coverage, if you are a startup and want to learn more about the world of PR, we had a few comms pros on the Equity podcast this week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/when-the-goals-of-pr-and-journalism-dont-align/">Tune in here</a>.</li>

<h2>What Square’s acquisition of Afterpay means for startups</h2>
<p>In his first column since returning to TechCrunch, reporter Ryan Lawler considered the potential ripples Square&#8217;s purchase of Afterpay may send across the pond of buy now, pay later startups.</p>
<p>For commentary and perspective, he interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dan Rosen, founder and general partner, Commerce Ventures</li>
<li>Jake Gibson, founding partner, Better Tomorrow Ventures</li>
<li>TX Zhuo, partner, Fika Ventures</li>
<li>Matthew Harris, partner, Bain Capital Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>The investors he spoke to agreed that deferring payments helps drive e-commerce, &#8220;but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups,&#8221; reports Ryan.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the board&#8217;s role in an early-stage startup?</p>
<p>Startup founders frequently ask me about the role of a board of directors. A board can be a crucial asset in an early-stage startup.</p>
<p>Here’s a framework for how it can help drive success at your company: Strategy, People, Image, Finance and Systems for compliance, or “SPIFS.”</p>
<h2>What is a board of directors, anyway?</h2>
<p>The board of directors helps with governance of the company. U.S. law requires that any company have one, though does not require how big it should be. By generic definition, the board of directors consists of elected individuals that represent shareholders. It is the governing body that provides company oversight and helps set business policy and strategy.</p>
<p>On a more practical level and in a startup environment, the board can aid in creating a successful business strategy, putting together the right management team, developing branding, building good financial habits, and avoiding legal and compliance issues. The needs and composition of the board will change depending on the startup’s stage, management and financing history (e.g., if there are preferred shareholders, investors that require a board seat and more).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors often ask founders about their board for two reasons. First, it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged. The founder can typically choose who is on their board (through careful selection of investors and advisers) and negotiate a board structure they prefer.</p>
<p>Typically, a healthy board will have a good balance between common shareholders, preferred shareholders and <a href="https://tylerjewell.substack.com/p/independent-board-member-guide">independents</a>. It also helps investors and analysts understand who will ask critical questions and give important advice to the company’s executive management, especially when the going gets tough (it inevitably does!).</p>
<h2>What exactly can a board help you do?</h2>
<p>After 20 years as a venture capitalist and board member, I boiled down the value of a board into five main pieces under the acronym SPIFS: Strategy, People, Image, Finance and Systems for compliance.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Setting business strategy is one of the main ways that the board helps founders, especially if it’s their first time running a business. It is a valuable sounding board for validating that you have taken a sober account of the market and have the right plan to develop your product and acquire customers.</p>
<p>The board should ask these questions when guiding founders through setting strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I win?</li>
<li>What problem am I solving?</li>
<li>Why is my product the best to solve that problem?</li>
<li>How do I differentiate against my competitors?</li>
<li>Do I have the right go-to-market strategy?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based CRM company <a href="http://hubspot.com">HubSpot</a> announced today that co-founder and CEO Brian Halligan would be stepping into the executive chairman role and CMO Yamini Rangan would be taking over as CEO next month (on September 7).</p>
<p>Rangan joined the company in January 2020 after stints at Dropbox, Workday and SAP. Her strong background in engineering, sales and marketing should prove helpful as she takes over the chief executive role. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/hubspots-ceo-brian-halligan-injured-in-accident-expected-to-make-a-full-and-complete-recovery">Halligan suffered a snowmobile accident</a> earlier this year, and while he has recovered now, Rangan ran the company in his absence, perhaps helping lay the groundwork for this decision. Halligan wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@HubSpot/writing-hubspots-next-chapter-940aab669c5d">in a blog post</a> announcing his decision that she is completely prepared to take on this role.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yamini has been overseeing day to day operations at HubSpot since March, managing Board meetings, the HubSpot earnings call, and key hiring and growth initiatives, working closely with Dharmesh and the rest of the leadership team. She’s made HubSpot better by being here, and I know that trend will continue with her as CEO,&#8221; Halligan wrote.</p>

<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, who has been following the company since its early days, says he isn&#8217;t surprised to see a change like this. &#8220;With the company recently hitting its 15-year anniversary it really isn&#8217;t a huge surprise that something like this is happening. And given all the success they&#8217;ve had in growing the company to this point, you have to believe they&#8217;ve been preparing for this move for quite some time,&#8221; Leary told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement came as the company released its Q2 2021 revenue, which looked to be pretty solid, coming in at $310.8 million up 53% over the same period last year. The vast majority, over $300 million, was subscription revenue, with the remainder coming from professional services, a ratio that you would expect for a company like this. The revenue puts them on a nice run rate of more than $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The company was founded in Boston in 2006 by Halligan and Dharmesh Shah and raised over $100 million, according to Crunchbase data. It was an early promoter of content marketing, using quality content, often in the form of company blogs, to drive website traffic and increase sales. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s widely accepted now, but when they started the company it was not well known and they helped bring the concept to the mainstream.</p>
<p>HubSpot later moved into a broader CRM platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/09/hubspot-spikes-20-over-its-ipo-price-in-strong-debut/">after going public in 2014</a>. Along with Wayfair, HubSpot is one of the big success stories <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/13/wayfair-and-hubspot-ipos-could-be-just-the-beginning-for-boston-startup-scene/">to come out of the Boston startup scene</a> and go public, helping to fuel the city&#8217;s startup ecosystem with the money the founders made on their successful IPOs. HubSpot stock was up over 2% in after-market trading on the news, perhaps signaling that investors are pleased with the company&#8217;s transition plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">may have shut down</a> its Stories features known as Fleets, but the Stories format will continue to invade other social platforms. TikTok today confirmed it&#8217;s piloting a new feature, TikTok Stories, which will allow it to explore additional ways for its community to bring their creative ideas to life.</p>
<p>The company notes the new feature will be another option, in addition to its existing storytelling tools like videos, Duets, Stitch and LIVE &#8212; it&#8217;s not meant to replace them.</p>
<p>TikTok didn&#8217;t say how long the pilot test would run or whether it would result in a public launch. However, we understand the test has been running for several days, not weeks or months. It is available in a small handful of non-U.S. markets for the time being, with the goal of gaining insight and feedback from TikTok users.</p>
<p>The current set of features may or may not make it to the public product, we should warn.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">More screenshots of TikTok Stories <a href="https://t.co/1PVfgJ9YWT">pic.twitter.com/1PVfgJ9YWT</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422978668771647491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The feature was discovered by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422978668771647491">Matt Navarra</a>, who is often among the first to find new features in social apps. In this case, he tells us that several tipsters brought screenshots of TikTok Stories to him, but it was initially unclear whether or not it was a hoax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The timing, of course, was somewhat suspect &#8212; Twitter had just shut down Fleets in what was a fairly high-profile example of a failure to make Stories work on a social platform, despite their popularity on other popular apps, like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and even, as of late, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">Pinterest</a>.</p>
<p>From the screenshots and videos of TikTok Stories in action, we see a product that appears to be, for the most part, something that looks familiar to users of Stories on other platforms.</p>
<p>Users can tap a camera button from the new navigation bar on the left side of the screen to create their first Story, then use common tools like those to add text or stickers, insert sounds and even use effects on their content. Like other platforms, users can either record videos or upload photos &#8212; the latter which opens up TikTok to take advantage of users&#8217; larger camera rolls, rather than relying only on video.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Where TikTok&#8217;s version of Stories differentiates itself is that it allows users to comment publicly on the creator&#8217;s content. These comments are public, the app explains, as mutual friends can see each other&#8217;s comments. There is also another tab where you can see how many people viewed a given Story, and whether or not you&#8217;re following those users. A button will allow you to click to follow people back, if you choose.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s Stories are also ephemeral and disappear in 24 hours, the app&#8217;s tutorial explains.</p>
<p>To view Stories from other creators, you can scroll through the new sidebar and tap on the creator&#8217;s avatar to watch their content. (This almost looks like a vertical version of Twitter&#8217;s Fleets bar, even down to the blue rings around creators&#8217; profile photos.)</p>
<p>The addition of Stories offers TikTok users who don&#8217;t post with regularity (or at all) an easier way to start engaging with TikTok&#8217;s tools by getting started with a more comfortable and familiar format. It can also provide creators with a way to interact casually with fans in between their more polished and edited TikTok video posts.</p>

<p>But it also gives TikTok a much larger surface where it could eventually run advertisements, assuming it can first properly moderate the inevitable attempts at skirting its community guidelines that result from launching an &#8220;ephemeral&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>The feature is also a direct shot across Instagram&#8217;s bow, following the Facebook-owned app&#8217;s direct attempt to copy TikTok with Reels.</p>
<p>TikTok declined to say which markets, specifically, can try out TikTok Stories. Screenshots show the feature described in English and on Android phones, however.</p>
<p>Though Stories may have failed on Twitter, the platform isn&#8217;t known for being a home for rich, creative tools, like TikTok. Meanwhile, TikTok believes in exploring any creative tool that could allow its users to express themselves &#8212; whether that&#8217;s through video, livestreaming, interacting with others or now, through ephemeral, short-form content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell U.S. ride-hailing giant Uber reported its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210804005979/en/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021">second-quarter financial results</a>. The company’s numbers come a day after its domestic rival, Lyft,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/lyft-reaches-adjusted-profitability-milestone-despite-continuing-net-losses/"> shared its own Q2 earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Notably while Lyft managed to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, Uber did not. However, Uber did generate positive net income of $1.14 billion in the quarter thanks to its investments in other companies like Didi and Aurora Innovation.</p>
<p>From the top, Uber’s gross bookings totaled $21.9 billion in the second quarter, up 114% compared to the year-ago period. That gross platform spend resulted in $3.93 billion in revenues at Uber, up 105% from the company’s $1.91 billion Q2 2020 results.</p>
<p>Its Q2 performance was enough to keep Uber on track toward its pre-tax profitability goal, with the company reiterating that it will reach adjusted EBITDA profitability by the fourth quarter, per its earnings release.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Analysts had expected the company to post revenues of $3.74 billion, and earnings per share of -$0.51, per data <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBER/analysis?p=UBER">collected by Yahoo Finance</a>. While beating expectations on revenue, the company did not have the same success with its forecasts on its adjusted EBITDA loss. Analysts had expected a narrower adjusted EBITDA loss of -$324.5 million. The adjusted EBITDA reality was a loss of $509 million.</p>
<p>Shares of Uber fell more than 8% in after-hours trading. Shares have since recovered, but are still off by more than 6%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Digging into the company’s individual business operations, in gross bookings terms, Uber’s ride business posted the largest growth in Q2 2021, growing 184% from its year-ago result to $8.84 billion. Delivery, a larger chunk of gross bookings at the company, grew 85% in Q2 2021 to $12.91 billion compared to its year-ago comparable.</p>
<p>Uber derives less revenue per dollar of delivery gross bookings than it does in ride-hailing, with its two businesses generating $1.96 billion and $1.62 billion in revenues, respectively, despite their massive differential in total consumer spend.</p>
<p>Freight, Uber’s smallest named division in revenue terms, grew 64%, to $348 million. Despite its small size, Uber has been expanding the division and making strategic acquisitions and partnerships as a means to help the segment break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Last month, Uber Freight acquired Transplace from private equity group TPG Capital for about $2.25 billion. The deal involved $750 million in Uber stock, with the remainder in cash.</p>

<p>Uber’s two key businesses were not profitable in aggregate, with the company’s ride-hailing and delivery businesses not managing to save the company from negative adjusted profits. However, Uber’s rides business did manage to post $179 million in positive adjusted EBITDA on its own &#8212; down from the company’s Q1 2021 result &#8212; while the company’s delivery business posted another quarter of negative adjusted profits, turning in -$161 million worth of adjusted EBITDA.</p>
<p>Recall that Uber’s ride-hailing adjusted EBITDA pales in comparison to the company’s unallocated expenses; Uber’s adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 came to -$509 million, an improvement of 39% compared to the year-ago period, but still a long way from breakeven.</p>
<p>But Uber’s quarter had a highlight to share in the form of other income. Uber’s operating loss of $1.19 billion was more than ameliorated by the company earning $1.93 billion in nonoperating income. That was mostly derived from $1.91 billion in unrealized gains on “debt and equity securities,” including “a $1.4 billion unrealized gain on [its] Didi investment and a $471 million unrealized gain on [its] Aurora Investments recognized in the second quarter of 2021.”</p>
<p>Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">went public in the second quarter</a>.</p>
<p>Turning to geographic results, Uber’s fastest recovery came in the APAC region, where revenue soared 227% from $217 million in the year-ago quarter to $709 million in the company’s most recent three-month period. EMEA came in second, in growth terms, expanding top line 159% from $358 million to $929 million over the same time frame. The United States and Canada posted revenue growth of 76% from $1.13 billion to $1.98 billion, and Latin America managed a more modest 44% rebound in the quarter.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The future of technology is determined by a handful of venture capitalists. The world’s 10 leading venture capital firms have, together, invested over $150 billion in technology startups. The venture capitalists who run these firms decide which startups today will develop the new platforms and technologies that will shape our lives tomorrow.</p>
<p>There is a startling lack of diversity within the venture capital sector. This means that a small group of men — mostly white men — make decisions that affect all of us. Unsurprisingly, they all too often ignore the broader societal and human rights implications of these investment decisions.</p>
<p>We all live in a world shaped by venture capital. As of 2019, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/finance/venture-capital-consultants/state-of-venture-capital-industry-2019">81%</a> of all venture capital funds worldwide are clustered in just a handful of countries, primarily in the U.S., Europe and China, which in turn are shaping the future of technology. If you spend time on Facebook or Twitter, use Google, travel in an Uber or stay in an Airbnb, then you’ve experienced firsthand the impact of venture capital funding.</p>
<p>Venture capital firms, which provide equity financing for early- and growth-stage startups, play a critical gatekeeper role, deciding which new technologies and technology companies will receive funding.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Venture capital firms need to institute human rights due diligence processes that meet the standards set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>All businesses &#8212; including venture capital &#8212; have a responsibility to respect human rights. In order to ensure that their investments are not undermining our human rights, it is therefore critical for venture capital firms to conduct due diligence processes before making investments.</p>
<p>Amnesty International recently <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/risky-business-top-10-leading-venture-capital-firms-failing-in-their-responsibility-to-respect-human-rights/">surveyed</a> the world’s largest venture capital firms and startup accelerators. Of the world’s 10 largest venture capital firms, not a single one had an adequate human rights due diligence process that met the standards set forth in the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf">UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, this is true of the broader venture capital sector as well. Overall, of the 50 VC firms and three startup accelerators analyzed by Amnesty International, we found that almost all of them lacked adequate human rights due diligence policies and processes.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/embed/#?secret=UEjK0CUDF6" data-secret="UEjK0CUDF6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This failure to carry out adequate due diligence means that a vast majority of VC firms are failing in their responsibility to respect human rights.</p>
<p>This almost complete lack of respect for human rights among the world’s largest venture capital firms has three key impacts. First, and most immediately, it means that venture capital firms invest in companies whose products and services have been implicated in ongoing human rights abuses, such as <a href="http://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-facial-recognition-sensetime-megvii">companies that provide support</a> to the Chinese government’s repression of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang and across China.</p>
<p>Second, it means that venture capital firms continue to fund companies whose business models have a significant negative impact on human rights, including our privacy and labor rights. For instance, leading venture capital firms continue to support companies that rely on app-based or “gig” workers, who often face exploitative or otherwise abusive work conditions, as well as companies whose “<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/1404/2019/en/">surveillance capitalism</a>” business model undermines our right to privacy.</p>
<p>Third, the lack of human rights due diligence by venture capital firms dramatically increases the risk that they fund new and “frontier” technologies without ensuring that adequate human rights safeguards are in place.</p>
<p>For instance, the application of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) tools across a wide variety of sectors risks amplifying existing societal biases and discrimination. Seemingly objective algorithms can be biased by reliance on incomplete or unrepresentative training data, and/or by replicating the unconscious bias of those who developed the algorithms.</p>
<p>This is a critical blind spot, especially as VC-funded startups seek to disrupt such fundamental parts of our lives as education, finance and health.</p>
<p>The negative impacts of the VC firms’ lack of human rights due diligence — especially regarding issues like algorithmic bias — are magnified by these firms’ own lack of gender and racial diversity. For instance, women comprise only <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey.html">23%</a> of venture capital investment professionals (i.e., those involved in deciding which startups to fund).</p>
<p>The numbers are even worse when it comes to racial diversity — just <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/diversity-venture-capital-human-capital-survey.html">4%</a> of investment professionals at VC firms in the U.S. are Latinx, and only 4% are Black. Groups like <a href="https://www.blckvc.org/">Blck VC</a>, <a href="https://www.diversity.vc">Diversity VC</a> and <a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/">digitalundivided</a> have been calling attention to this issue for years, but venture capitalists have been slow to respond so far.</p>
<p>This lack of diversity is mirrored in the gender and racial composition of founders who receive VC funding. In 2018, all-female founding teams received just <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/01/28/funding-female-founders-2018/">2.2%</a> of all U.S.-based venture funding. At the same time, Black and Latinx founders received less than <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/23/venture-capital-diversity-equity-black-latino-startups-funding/">2.3%</a> of all U.S.-based venture capital funding in 2019.</p>
<p>With power comes responsibility. Venture capital firms need to institute human rights due diligence processes that meet the standards set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p>
<p>Further, they should provide support to their portfolio companies to ensure that they comply with human rights standards. Venture capital firms should also publicly commit to hiring more diverse teams, especially in investment-related positions. Finally, they should publicly commit to funding more diverse startup founders as part of their flagship funds.</p>
<p>VC firms have a responsibility to ensure that their investments are not causing harm. A responsibility that they have, to date, largely ignored.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese startup ispace has raised $46 million in a fresh round of Series C funding as it looks to complete three lunar lander missions in three years.</p>
<p>The funding will go toward the second and third of the planned missions, scheduled for 2023 and 2024. The first mission, which ispace aims to conduct in the latter half of 2022, is being furnished by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/moon-lander-startup-ispace-raises-28-million-and-launches-a-new-lunar-data-platform/">earlier financing</a>.</p>
<p>The Series C was led by Japanese VC firm Incubate Fund, with additional investment from partnerships managed by Innovation Engine, funds managed by SBI Investment Co., Katsunori Sago, Aizawa Investments and funds managed by HiJoJo Partners and Aizawa Asset Management. Incubate Fund’s investments in ispace stretch back to the company’s seed round in 2014.</p>
<p>Ispace’s total funding now stands at $195.5 million.</p>
<p>The company said last month it had started building the lunar landing flight module for the 2022 mission at a facility owned by space launch company ArianeGroup, in Lampoldshausen, Germany. The lander for that first mission, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/ispace-reveals-the-final-design-of-its-lunar-lander-ahead-of-its-first-mission-to-the-moon-in-2022/">the Hakuto-R</a>, will take three months to reach the moon, largely to save costs and additional weight from propellant. It<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/japanese-space-company-ispace-aims-to-send-landers-to-the-moon/"> will deliver</a> a 22-pound rover for Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center, a lunar robot for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and payload from three Canadian companies. The lander will reach the moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>The 7.5 foot-tall Hakuto-R will also be used in the second mission in 2023, to deposit a small ispace rover that will collect data to support the company&#8217;s subsequent missions to the moon. For the final mission, the Toyko-based startup is developing a larger lander in the United States.</p>

<p>Ispace describes its long-term goal as being a &#8220;gateway for private sector companies to bring their business to the Moon.&#8221; The company has particular interest in helping spur a space-based economy, noting on its <a href="https://ispace-inc.com/">website</a> that the moon&#8217;s water resources represent &#8220;untapped potential.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Two decades after businesses first started deploying AI solutions, one can argue that they’ve made little progress in achieving significant gains in efficiency and profitability relative to the hype that drove initial expectations.</p>
<p>On the surface, recent data supports AI skeptics. Almost <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/">90%</a> of data science projects never make it to production; only <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2019/01/03/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2019/">20%</a> of analytics insights through 2022 will achieve business outcomes; and even companies that have developed an enterprisewide AI strategy are seeing failure rates of up to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190708005039/en/">50%</a>.</p>
<p>But the past 25 years have only been the first phase in the evolution of enterprise AI — or what we might call Enterprise AI 1.0. That’s where many businesses remain today. However, companies on the leading edge of AI innovation have advanced to the next generation, which will define the coming decade of big data, analytics and automation — Enterprise AI 2.0.</p>
<p>The difference between these two generations of enterprise AI is not academic. For executives across the business spectrum — from healthcare and retail to media and finance — the evolution from 1.0 to 2.0 is a chance to learn and adapt from past failures, create concrete expectations for future uses and justify the rising investment in AI that we see across industries.</p>
<p>Two decades from now, when business leaders look back to the 2020s, the companies who achieved Enterprise AI 2.0 first will have come to be big winners in the economy, having differentiated their services, scooped up market share and positioned themselves for ongoing innovation.</p>
<p>Framing the digital transformations of the future as an evolution from Enterprise AI 1.0 to 2.0 provides a conceptual model for business leaders developing strategies to compete in the age of automation and advanced analytics.</p>
<h2>Enterprise AI 1.0 (the status quo)</h2>
<p>Starting in the mid-1990s, AI was a sector marked by speculative testing, experimental interest and exploration. These activities occurred almost exclusively in the domain of data scientists. As Gartner wrote in a recent <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2019/01/03/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2019/">report</a>, these efforts were “alchemy … run by wizards whose talents will not scale in the organization.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook shut down accounts belonging to two academic researchers late Tuesday, cutting off their ability to study political ads and misinformation on the world&#8217;s biggest social network.</p>
<p>The company accused the academics of engaging in &#8220;unauthorized scraping&#8221; and compromising user privacy on the platform, claims that Facebook&#8217;s many critics are slamming as a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/">thin pretense</a> for killing the transparency work.</p>
<p>The company took action against Laura Edelson and Damon McCoy, two well-known researchers affiliated with<a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/"> NYU&#8217;s Cybersecurity for Democracy project</a> who have long sparred with the company. The move cuts off their access to Facebook&#8217;s Ad Library — one of the company&#8217;s only meaningful transparency efforts to date — and data on popular posts from the social media monitoring service CrowdTangle.</p>
<p>Facebook has a history with Edelson and McCoy. The company served the pair cease and desist letters<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/facebooks-threat-to-the-nyu-ad-observatory-is-an-attack-on-ethical-research/"> just weeks before the 2020 election</a>, calling on the team to disable an opt-in browser tool called Ad Observer and unpublish their findings. Ad Observer is a <a href="https://adobserver.org/">browser tool anyone can install</a> that&#8217;s designed to give researchers a rare glimpse into how Facebook targets the ads that have transformed it into a trillion-dollar company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last several years, we’ve used this access to uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, identify misinformation in political ads including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook’s apparent amplification of partisan misinformation,&#8221; Edelson said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, including our work measuring vaccine misinformation with the<a href="https://www.viralityproject.org/"> Virality Project</a> and many other partners who rely on our data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident set off a fresh round of criticism about the company&#8217;s preference for opacity over transparency when it comes to some of the more dangerous behavior that the platform incubates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By Wednesday, Facebook&#8217;s actions had attracted the attention of some members of Congress. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) criticized Facebook&#8217;s decision to punish the researchers under the pretense of protecting users in light of the company&#8217;s long history of invasive privacy practices. Wyden also called Facebook&#8217;s bluff over its claim that revoking researcher access is an effort to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">comply with a privacy order from the FTC</a> that the company was issued for its previous user privacy violations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">After years of abusing users&#39; privacy, it&#39;s rich for Facebook to use it as an excuse to crack down on researchers exposing its problems. I&#39;ve asked the FTC to confirm that this excuse is as bogus as it sounds. <a href="https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9">https://t.co/eHuPiVYFe9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1422961646096424963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) also weighed in on Facebook&#8217;s latest controversy, calling the decision &#8220;deeply concerning.&#8221; Warner praised independent researchers for &#8220;consistently [improving] the integrity and safety of social media platforms by exposing harmful and exploitative activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s past time for Congress to act to bring greater transparency to the shadowy world of online advertising, which continues to be a major vector for fraud and misconduct,&#8221; Warner said.</p>
<p>Firefox developer Mozilla came to the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/">defense of Ad Observer</a> on Wednesday, noting that the company &#8220;reviewed it twice, conducting both a code review and examining the consent flow&#8221; before recommending the browser extension through its storefront. In a blog post, Mozilla&#8217;s chief security officer stated that Facebook&#8217;s claims &#8220;simply do not hold water.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/researchers-nyu-knight-institute-condemn-facebooks-effort-to-squelch-independent-research-about-misinformation">free press organizations</a>, researchers and misinformation experts also condemned Facebook&#8217;s decision Wednesday. &#8220;Facebook’s cavalier approach to privacy enabled it to become so dominant,&#8221; <a href="https://themarkup.org/press-release-20210804">The Markup&#8217;s Julia Angwin and Nabiha Syed</a> wrote in a joint statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;But now, when independent researchers want to interrogate that platform and the influence it commands, Facebook is propping up user privacy as a shield to hide behind.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working on an H-1B in the U.S. for nearly two years. </strong></p>
<p><strong>While I’m immensely appreciative of my company’s sponsorship and that I made it through the H-1B lottery and am working, I’m stuck in a rut. I really want to start something of my own and work on my own terms in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there any immigration options that would allow me to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Seeking Satisfaction near Stanford</strong></p>
<p>Dear Seeking,</p>
<p>A couple of exciting immigration news updates to get us started today! In <a href="https://bit.ly/3fsIUZ0">breaking startup founder news</a>, U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced the <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/media/press-releases/lofgren-introduces-legislation-create-new-visa-program-immigrant-entrepreneurs">LIKE Act</a> for startup founders in the House of Representatives last week. Below, we’ll share what this could mean for your startup aspirations. Also, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducted a second H-1B lottery because it didn’t receive enough H-1B petitions to meet the annual cap. So, if you or your employer were selected, be sure to file an H-1B petition by November 3.</p>
<p>Although job dissatisfaction and frustration on an H-1B can be normal, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardgorbis/">Edward Gorbis</a>, there’s a lot you can do to take control of your U.S. immigration situation and go out on your own. I interviewed Gorbis for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/076-coaching-immigrant-leaders-with-edward-gorbis/">my podcast</a>; he’s the founder of <a href="https://www.careermeetsworld.com/">Career Meets World</a> and a performance coach who works with immigrants and first-generation professionals to help them find fulfillment and thrive in their careers and life. Gorbis said that “once immigrants reach stability, they start to think, ‘Who am I, what do I value, what’s my core identity?’” It’s possible for any of us to retrain our brain for success.</p>
<p>Gorbis said that imagining overcoming the hurdles that stand in the way of doing the work that will fulfill you is the first step. So, here are some options that can help you imagine how to build the life of your dreams.</p>
<h2>Become a founding CEO and raise $250,000</h2>
<p>A great new option for aspiring entrepreneurs is <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP), a new immigration program in the United States that allows CEOs, CTOs and others to live in the U.S. and run their company for 2.5 years with an option for a 2.5-year extension. Your spouse can obtain a work permit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Entrepreneur-Parole.pdf?7fd8bf&amp;7fd8bf">How to qualify?</a> You need to own at least 10% of a U.S. company, such as a Delaware C corporation registered in California. Ideally, you’ll want to show that your company bank account has at least $250,000 raised from qualified U.S. investors, but you can use other evidence to demonstrate that your company has the potential to grow rapidly and create jobs in the U.S.</p>
<p>A startup visa and path to a green card may be soon on the way for entrepreneurs and their crucial employees: Last week, Lofgren introduced the <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/lofgren.house.gov/files/7.26.21%20-%20LIKE%20Act%20Full%20Text.pdf">Let Immigrants Kickstart Employment (LIKE) Act</a>. The requirements for the proposed startup visa are the same as for IEP but would allow a longer stay &#8212; up to eight years total if the startup creates jobs and generates substantial revenue.</p>
<p>I’m <a href="https://bit.ly/3fsIUZ0">very proud</a> to have aided in drafting the LIKE Act. It’s a thrill to see how my suggestions were included, such as making Startup Green Cards not subject to the visa bulletin, clarifying that you can seek consecutive Startup Visas from different companies, how to allocate employee visas to startups, ensuring the Startup Visa is a dual intent status, and adding premium processing. It was such a joy to be able to contribute ideas to this amazing process. I look forward to supporting this bill to become a law; please reach out to me if you want to support this worthy cause.</p>

<h2>See yourself at another company</h2>
<p>There is technically no limit to how many <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> employers you can have or how many — or few — hours you work in an H-1B position. So, think about other companies.</p>
<p>One option would be to have concurrent H-1Bs: Keep your current H-1B job for stability and start your own company, preferably with another individual or two, and have your startup sponsor you for an H-1B. Take a look at this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/dear-sophie-can-i-transfer-my-h-1b-to-a-startup-i-founded/#:~:text=But%20yes%2C%20it%20is%20possible,to%20work%20at%20the%20startup.">Dear Sophie column</a> for what to do before embarking on this path.</p>
<p>Another option would be to <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/h-1b/031-h-1b-nitty-gritty-2-h-1b-transfer-for-startup-founders/">transfer your H-1B</a> to another employer, or your own startup if you are going to work there. Since you already went through the H-1B lottery with your current employer, you will not have to go through the lottery process again for a second H-1B whether you choose the concurrent or transfer option.</p>
<p>Setting up a startup that can sponsor you for an H-1B is complicated, so I suggest you work with both a corporate attorney and an immigration attorney. Keep in mind that you will not be able to do any work for your startup until an H-1B with your startup has been approved, which is why having co-founders is helpful. Another reason is H-1Bs require an employer-employee relationship between a startup and the H-1B candidate. That means a co-founder — or the startup’s board — must supervise you and have the ability to fire you. Moreover, we often advise founders that it may be best to own less than a 50% stake in the startup when applying for an H-1B.</p>
<h2>Consider a green card</h2>
<p>If you end up pursuing concurrent H-1Bs, consider asking your employer whether it is willing to sponsor you for a green card. If that’s not the case, your startup can sponsor you for one, or you can self-petition for a green card:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A extraordinary ability green card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-green-card-advanced-degree/">EB-2 green card for professionals holding advanced degrees</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-green-card-exceptional-ability/">EB-2 exceptional ability green card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-3-green-card-skilled-workers-professionals">EB-3 green cards for skilled workers and professionals</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All EB-2 green cards — except the EB-2 NIW — and the EB-3 green card require labor certification approval (<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/020-sponsoring-employees-for-perm-green-cards/">PERM</a>) from the U.S. Department of Labor. The two green cards that allow an individual to self-sponsor are the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW.</p>
<h2>Imagine yourself doing gigs in your field</h2>
<p>Many startup founders qualify for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/o-1a-extraordinary-ability/">O-1A</a> extraordinary ability visa. However, you cannot have both an H-1B and an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A</a> at the same time, so if your startup sponsors you for an O-1A, you will be required to leave your current H-1B job once an O-1A is approved.</p>
<p>An O-1A offers more flexibility than an H-1B. You can work for a single petitioning company or on multiple gigs through an agent. However, qualifying for an O-1A is more difficult than an H-1B. Resources, such as through my firm, support people with getting qualified. The one similarity with the H-1B is that you must show your startup and you have an employer-employee relationship.</p>
<h2>Invest in your own company</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/">E-2 visa</a> for treaty investors and employees is ideal for startup founders whose home country has a treaty of commerce and navigation with the U.S. Here is a list of <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/treaty.html">treaty countries</a>. For more details on E-2 visas for founders and employees, check out this previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-best-option-for-international-founders-to-expand-in-the-us/">Dear Sophie column</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/016-e-2-visa-for-founders-and-employees/">podcast episode</a>.</p>
<p>Although there is no minimum dollar amount that a founder must invest in a startup to qualify for an E-2, we often advise founders to invest at least $100,000 to have a strong case. You cannot have both an H-1B and an E-2, so you will need to leave your current H-1B job if your E-2 is approved.</p>
<p>An immigration attorney can offer additional options based on your personal circumstances and legal advice tailored to you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey of building your dreams!</p>
