										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has introduced an<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj"> iCloud Passwords Chrome extension</a> that will make life easier for those who use both Windows computers and other Apple devices, like a Macbook or an iPhone. The new browser extension lets you access the passwords you saved in Safari on your other Apple devices, then use them within Chrome when you&#8217;re on a Windows PC.</p>
<p>You can also save any new passwords you create in Chrome to your iCloud keychain, so it&#8217;s synced across your Apple devices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106596" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106596" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106596" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106596" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t formally announce the new feature, but reports of an iCloud Passwords extension had already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/icloud-windows-chrome-extension-icloud-passwords/">been referenced in the release notes</a> of the new iCloud for Windows 10 (ver 12), which arrived at the end of January. After the update, a &#8220;Passwords&#8221; section appeared in the app designated by the iCloud Keychain logo. This directed users to download the new extension, but the link was broken, as the extension was not yet live.</p>
<p>That changed on Sunday, according a <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/31/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-windows/">report from 9to5Google</a>, which found the new Chrome add-on had been published to the Chrome Web Store late on Sunday evening. Now, when Windows users access the new Passwords section, the dialog box that prompts the download will properly function.</p>
<p>Once installed, Chrome users on Windows will be able to access any passwords they saved or allowed iCloud Keychain to securely generate for them within Safari for macOS or iOS. Meanwhile, as Windows users create new credentials, these, too, will be synced to their iCloud Keychain so they can later be pulled up on Mac, iPhone, and iPad devices, when needed.</p>
<p>This is the first Chrome extension to support iCloud Keychain on Windows, as before Apple had only offered an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-bookmarks/fkepacicchenbjecpbpbclokcabebhah?hl=en">iCloud Bookmarks</a> tool for older Windows 7 and 8 PCs, which reached over 7 million users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106594" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106594" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106594" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106594" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Some users who have tried the extension are reporting problems, but it seems that&#8217;s related to their PCs not having been first updated to iCloud for Windows 12.0, which is a prerequisite for the new extension to work.</p>
<p>Though Apple typically locks users into its own platforms, it has slowly expanded some of its services to Windows and even Android, where it makes sense. Today, Apple offers its entertainment apps like Apple Music and Apple TV on other platforms, including Android, and has launched Apple TV on its media player rival, Amazon Fire TV, among others. And <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/14/apple-working-to-release-music-and-podcasts-apps-on-microsoft-store/">9to5Mac notes</a> that Apple appears to be working to bring Music and Podcasts to the Microsoft Store in the future, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New transparency figures released by Amazon show the company responded to a record number of government data demands in the last six months of 2020.</p>
<p>The new figures land in <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20467513-amazon-transparency-report-2h-2020">the company&#8217;s bi-annual transparency report</a> published to Amazon&#8217;s website over the weekend.</p>
<p>Amazon said it processed 27,664 government demands for user data in the last six months of 2020, up from 3,222 data demands in the first six months of the year, an increase of close to 800%. That user data includes shopping searches and data from its Echo, Fire, and Ring devices.</p>
<p>The new report presents the data differently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/amazon-government-demands-data/">from previous transparency disclosures</a>. Amazon now breaks down the top requesting countries. U.S. authorities historically made up the bulk of the overall data demands Amazon receives, but this latest report shows Germany with 42% of all requests, followed by Spain with 18%, and Italy and the U.S. with 11% share each.</p>
<p>But the report also removes the breakdown by legal process, and now only differentiates between the requests it gets for user&#8217;s content and for non-content. Amazon said it handed over user content data in 52 cases.</p>
<p>For its Amazon Web Services cloud business, which it reports separately, Amazon said it processed 523 data demands, with 75% of all requests made by U.S. authorities, and Amazon turned over user&#8217;s content in 15 cases.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson would not say what led to the sharp rise in data demands. (Amazon seldom comments on its transparency reports.)</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s transparency report is one of the lightest reads of all the tech giants at just three pages in length, and spends most of the report explaining how it responds to each legal demand than on the data itself. The company, known for its notorious secrecy, became the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/after-years-of-silence-amazon-finally-discloses-govt-data-demands/">last of the major tech giants</a> to push out a transparency report in 2015. Where most tech companies added data to their transparency reports, like takedown notices and account removals, Amazon bucked the trend by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/amazon-government-data-demands/">removing data</a> from its reports, despite the company&#8217;s growing reach into millions of homes.</p>
<p>The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61968b3b-c093-4c4a-a7b7-29b565bc0bc0">reported</a> this weekend that Ring, the video doorbell and home security startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/">acquired by Amazon for $1 billion</a>, now has 2,000 law enforcement partners across the United States, allowing police departments to access homeowners&#8217; doorbell camera footage.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and make sure to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/calendly-3-billion/">last week’s main episode</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">companion chat about Robinhood</a>.</p>
<p>This morning we ran into quite a lot of the same material, with Robinhood back in the news and the stock market looming large. Here&#8217;s what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>American stocks are set to rise, bitcoin is flat, and meme-stocks are mixed.</li>
<li>In India, news is out that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">new law could ban bitcoin</a> (whatever that means), and this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">morning India forced Twitter to take down some accounts</a> that had been critical of government policy. That&#8217;s a pretty bad look. And it comes as we see a coup in Myanmar <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6">leading to a decline in internet connectivity</a>; there is a clear link between authoritarianism and a desire for Internet control.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">Robinhood&#8217;s CEO went on Clubhouse</a>, where he was interviewed by Elon Musk about last week&#8217;s mess; it turns out the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or NSCC, had asked Robinhood for $3 billion in deposit requirements. That number was reduced to $700 million, with Robinhood limiting some consumer behavior, allowing the company to open Friday morning.</li>
<li>This morning the key news stories include <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374?mod=djemalertNEWS">the mess that is Facebook Groups</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/eu-calls-15-8-billion-apple-tax-ruling-contradictory-in-appeal?sref=gni836kR">the EU is appealing a tax decision</a> that could impact tech company structure for years to come.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thanksben.com/">Ben</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/ben/">raised $2.5 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.phocassoftware.com/">Phocas Software</a> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/28/cloud-data-analytics-service-phocas-raises-34-million-to-grow-ai-global-footprint/">raised $34 million</a></li>

<li>And, finally, we are heading into earnings season, so strap in and get ready for a deluge of results.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that and we are back Thursday, if not before. Hugs and hellos from the Equity crew!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/amazon-introduces-the-amazon-one-a-way-to-pay-with-your-palm-when-entering-stores/">Amazon introduced</a> a new biometric device, <a href="https://one.amazon.com/">Amazon One</a>, that allowed customers to pay at Amazon Go stores using their palm. Today, the company says the device is being rolled out to additional Amazon stores in Seattle &#8212; an expansion that will make the system available across eight total Amazon physical retail stores, including Amazon Go convenience stores, Amazon Go Grocery, Amazon Books, and Amazon 4-star stores.</p>
<p>Starting today, the Amazon One system is being added as an entry option at the Amazon Go location at Madison &amp; Minor in Seattle. In the next few weeks, it will also roll out to two more Amazon Go stores, at 5th &amp; Marion and Terry &amp; Stewart, the company says. That brings the system to eight Seattle locations, and sets the stage for a broader U.S. expansion in the months ahead.</p>
<p>As described, the Amazon One system uses computer vision technology to create a unique palm print for each customer, which Amazon then associates with the credit card the customer inserts upon initial setup. While the customer doesn&#8217;t have to have an Amazon account to use the service, if they do associate their account information, they&#8217;ll be able to see their shopping history on the Amazon website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon says images of the palm print are encrypted and secured in the cloud, where customers&#8217; palm signatures are created. At the time of its initial launch, Amazon argued that palm prints were a more private form of biometric authentication than some other methods, because you can&#8217;t determine a customer&#8217;s identity based only on the image of their palm.</p>
<p>But Amazon isn&#8217;t just storing palm images, of course. It&#8217;s matching them to customer accounts and credit cards, effectively building a database of customer biometrics. It can also then use the data collected, like shopping history, to introduce personalized offers and recommendations over time.</p>
<p>The system raises questions about Amazon&#8217;s larger plans, as the company&#8217;s historical use of biometrics has been fairly controversial. Amazon <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">sold biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S. Its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>. Its Ring camera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">company continues</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">work in partnership with police.</a><a href="https://retailwire.com/discussion/are-amazons-flying-security-drones-a-threat-to-homeowner-privacy/"> </a>In terms of user data privacy, Amazon hasn’t been careful either — for example, by continuing to store Alexa voice data <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681423/amazon-alexa-echo-chris-coons-data-transcripts-recording-privacy">even when users deleted audio files. </a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s more is the company doesn&#8217;t just envision Amazon One as a means of entry into its own stores &#8212; they&#8217;re just a test market. In time, Amazon wants to make the technology available to third-parties, as well, including stadiums, office buildings and other non-Amazon retailers.</p>
<p>The timing of the Amazon One launch in the middle of a pandemic has helped spur customer adoption, as it allows for a contactless way to associate your credit card with your future purchases.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The GameStop debacle has been hailed by many as a first of its kind form of digital activism, with the &#8216;crowd&#8217; coming together to stick it to Wall Street, and specifically hedge funds that are in the business of short selling.</p>
<p>However, what if you&#8217;re a startup or scale-up caught in the middle of such an unprecedented and unstoppable set of events, requiring you to make rapid business and product decisions almost seemingly on the fly. Especially if there is significant reputational damage at stake when things don&#8217;t go to plan.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly the position that trading platform Robinhood found itself in last week. Despite promising to make finance accessible for all, the company temporarily limited trading on GameStop, AMC, and other memestocks, leaving users upset that the fintech darling wasn&#8217;t living up to its name. The specific reasons may have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-limits-users-to-a-single-share-of-gamestop-and-other-stocks/">short-term and technical</a>, but the choice was viewed with suspicion by much of Robinhood&#8217;s users, not least because Robinhood has a large hedge fund as a customer. This saw the Robinhood app receive hundreds of thousands of 1-star ratings on the app stores, which Apple and Google helped remove.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But what role did UX play in all of this and how could better UX choices have mitigated the Robinhood backlash? That’s the question we asked together with <a href="https://builtformars.co.uk/">Built for Mars</a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, who tracked Robinhood’s product changes throughout the GameStop crisis.</p>

<hr />
<p>Specifically, we highlight 5 UX fails and suggest ways to fix them. As you’ll see, the fast moving events meant it was a continuously moving target and would have been very challenging for any product team. With that said, there are many learnings that can be applied to other existing digital products or ones you are currently building, regardless of whether or not you’re hit by the next GameStop-styled crisis.</p>
<h2>Removing Gamestop from search results</h2>
<p>Robinhood wanted to stop people buying GME shares, so they just removed Gamestop from the search results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106552" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106552" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106552" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106552" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: Robinhood didn’t want people to find the page to purchase Gamestop shares, so they just removed Gamestop from the search results.</p>
<p>The fix: Robinhood absolutely should have left Gamestop in the search results. By removing it entirely the company did three things: created ambiguity, provided no explanation, and looked suspicious.</p>
<p>The rule: Great UX is about being definitive and clear, and the absence of information is the opposite of this.</p>
<h2>Blocking people from buying Gamestop shares</h2>
<p>People could still get on to the GME stock page, so Robinhood simply disabled the buy button and showed this generic message:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106553" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106553" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Block-from-buying.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106553" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: Robinhood stopped people buying shares—essentially closing the free market—and disabled the buy button with a generic message.</p>
<p>The fix: This is an unprecedented move from a brokerage, and most Robinhood users will never have considered this to be a possibility. They should have included a link to more information about why they had to take this decision. In this instance, with insufficient info, users flocked to Twitter but found no explanation on the Robinhood Twitter account either.</p>
<p>The rule: When delivering bad news which will directly affect customers, you need to have spent the time to properly explain why this has happened, how it affects them, and what happens next.</p>
<h2>Fractional shares are unavailable</h2>
<p>Robinhood is known for fractional shares, but it temporarily blocked people buying fractional shares of Gamestop. This was after Robinhood re-allowed people to buy shares, but with limits:</p>
<p>No fractional shares<br />
Limited number of shares</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106554" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106554" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106554" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106554" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: When people tried to buy fractional shares, they would put in their order, and see this error message. It explains what you can’t do, but doesn’t provide any context as to why.</p>
<p>The fix: Simple: add context explaining why they’ve had to make this decision. The company removed one of the key USPs of Robinhood, and it didn’t even mention if it’s temporary.</p>
<p>The rule: You shouldn’t just add an explanation in one place and expect all your users to see it. You should proactively place links to your detailed response in all of the places and features that are affected by your restrictions.</p>
<h2>Creating sell orders on your behalf</h2>
<p>People were claiming on Twitter that Robinhood were automatically creating sell orders, and not allowing people to cancel them. (As it turns out, the T&amp;Cs state that Robinhood has the legal right to do this.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106555" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106555" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106555" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: If this is true, it means that Robinhood was taking drastic action to mitigate their liquidity issues. This action directly affects the finances of their users, and still, there’s no explanation why.</p>
<p>The fix: Whilst good UX can’t make this okay, a decent explanation in context of why they’re having to do this at least provides a good rationale. Also, it’s not an ‘error’, so labelling it an error feels disingenuous.</p>
<p>The rule: Stopping your user from doing an action is one thing, but taking control and doing something that may be against their will is another. This should only be done with sufficient context, explanation and empathy.</p>
<h2>Failing to get statements</h2>
<p>People wanted to leave Robinhood, and were claiming that other brokerages needed a ‘statement of portfolio’ to initiate a switch.</p>
<p>Twitter blew up as the ‘download statement’ function was broken for people all weekend. We never saw Robinhood address it, and naturally people assumed it was a dirty tactic to keep customers from leaving.</p>
<p>The fail: When trying to download a statement users saw this error message. This didn’t just happen once, but users were claiming that it was broken and they were unable to download their statements.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106557" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106557" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106557" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106557" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fix: Unlike the other examples, this doesn’t require more context, but does need an alternative method of reaching the same result. Some features are vital and urgent, some aren’t.</p>
<p>The rule: Some actions are important enough that it’s not good enough to just fail. In these instances, you need to provide an alternative way to reach the same goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://rapid7.com">Rapid7</a>, the Boston-based security operations company, has been making moves into the cloud recently and this morning it announced that it has acquired Kubernetes security startup <a href="https://www.alcide.io/">Alcide</a> for $50 million.</p>
<p>As the world shifts to cloud native using Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads, it&#8217;s tricky ensuring that the containers are configured correctly to keep them safe. What&#8217;s more, Kubernetes is designed to automate the management of containers, taking humans out of the loop and making it even more imperative that the security protocols are applied in an automated fashion as well.</p>
<p>Brian Johnson, SVP of Cloud Security at Rapid7 says that this requires a specialized kind of security product and that&#8217;s why his company is buying Alcide. &#8220;Companies operating in the cloud need to be able to identify and respond to risk in real time, and looking at cloud infrastructure or containers independently simply doesn’t provide enough context to truly understand where you are vulnerable,&#8221; he explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rapid7 is acquiring DivvyCloud for $145M to beef up cloud security&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/rapid7-is-acquiring-divvycloud-for-145m-to-beef-up-cloud-security/embed/#?secret=C6htP9Ejh4" data-secret="C6htP9Ejh4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;With the addition of Alcide, we can help organizations obtain comprehensive, unified visibility across their entire cloud infrastructure and cloud native applications so that they can continue to rapidly innovate while still remaining secure,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s purchase builds on the company&#8217;s acquisition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/rapid7-is-acquiring-divvycloud-for-145m-to-beef-up-cloud-security/">of DivvyCloud last April for $145 million</a>. That&#8217;s almost $200 million for the two companies that allow the company to help protect cloud workloads in a fairy broad way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also part of an industry trend with a number of Kubernetes security startups coming off the board in the last year as bigger companies look to enhance their container security chops by buying the talent and technology. This includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/vmware-to-acquire-kubernetes-security-startup-octarine-and-fold-it-into-carbon-black/">VMWare nabbing Octarine</a> last May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/">Cisco getting PortShift</a> in October and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/"> Red Hat buying StackRox</a> last month.</p>
<p>Alcide was founded in 2016 in Tel Aviv, part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/">active Israeli security </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/">startup</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/"> scene</a>. It raised about $12 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.designcrowd.com/">DesignCrowd</a> announced today it has raised $10 million AUD (about $7.6 billion USD) in pre-IPO funding. The capital will be used on hiring and product development, with the goal of accelerating the growth of <a href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/">BrandCrowd</a>, its DIY platform.</p>
<p>The new funding comes as DesignCrowd gets ready for a potential initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange. The round&#8217;s investors include Perennial Value Management, Alium Capital, Ellerston Capital, Regal Funds Managemetn and CVC, along with returning backers Starfish Ventures and AirTree Ventures. DesignCrowd has now raised more than $22 million AUD in total.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007 and based in Sydney, Australia, DesignCrowd built its reputation as a design crowdsourcing platform, allowing users to get proposals from designers around the world. BrandCrowd was launched to complement DesignCrowd’s crowdsourcing/marketplace model, expanding its potential user base and differentiating it from other sites people use to find designers, like 99designs and Fiverr.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are other DIY logo makers aimed at entrepreneurs and small brands, including tools from Design Hill, Canva and Tailor Brands, BrandCrowd had an advantage from the start because it already has access to more than 800,000 designers through DesignCrowd, allowing the company to find the best logo designers from around the world for its library, said co-founder and chief executive officer Alec Lynch. BrandCrowd prefers to buy designs upfront before publishing them, since all logos are exclusive to the platform (users can pay an extra fee to remove logos from its library).</p>
<p>BrandCrowd customers pay a one-off fee to download a logo and can sign up for monthly or annual subscriptions. Many use both platforms, Lynch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, if a small business wants to start by getting a custom logo design from a designer on DesignCrowd, we then allow them to use that logo in our DIY design tools on BrandCrowd to make everything else they might need, from business card designs to Instagram posts and email signature,&#8221; said Lynch. &#8220;They can even make modifications to their logo on BrandCrowd using our logo editor tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>DesignCrowd’s net revenues in 2020 grew 54% year-over-year, due primarily to BrandCrowd. The company says BrandCrowd saw over five million sign-ups over the past 12 months, with more than half of its revenue from the United States.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company experienced some headwinds in March and April 2020, Lynch said, but then global demand for online design rebounded and began increasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hypothesis is that the pandemic led to more people starting new businesses in the second half of 2020 and more people needing design for those businesses, which was helpful for us,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In addition to this small &#8216;boom&#8217; in small businesses starting, we think the pandemic has probably accelerated an existing trend of businesses sourcing design online rather than offline.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, </span><a href="https://getcarbon.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup, made its financials public for the first time. Although typical for foreign private startups, it&#8217;s almost an anomaly in Africa. There have been rare cases in the past, for instance, when Rocket Internet had to include Jumia&#8217;s financials in its yearly reports after going public. At the time, the German investment outfit was a founding shareholder in the African-based unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Carbon has been hailed for transparency and openness, it remains to be seen if it&#8217;s a trend other African startups are willing to follow. Posting audited financials can prove detrimental for a private African company for several reasons ranging from bad marketing and PR if huge losses are incurred to regulatory clampdown if the company performs well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $15.8 million VC-backed company, Carbon was founded by </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chijiokedozie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chijioke Dozie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngozidozie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ngozi Dozie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012. The brothers started the company in a niche digital lending market, but now, the company offers a plethora of services from savings to payments and investments.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Chijioke Dozie, the CEO, spoke to TechCrunch in 2019, he cited recruitment purposes and clientele trust as reasons why the company made its financials public &#8212; an exercise it has done every second quarter for two years. It&#8217;s a tradition Dozie hopes the company will keep this year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our annual report will be released in the second quarter after our financial audit has been concluded. If you recall, we released a year in review in January 2020 before we released the fiscal year of 2019 report,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s annual reports reveal numbers on gross earnings, profit/loss before and after-tax, net impairment loss, total assets, liabilities, and equity, among others. The company&#8217;s year on review, on the other hand, highlights payments processed, customer base, loans disbursed, and investments made on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we wait for its annual report for 2020, its year in review offers a sneak peek into how Carbon grew the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the fiscal year 2020, the company which has about 659,000 customers said it processed ₦96.54 billion (~$241.35 million), up 89% compared to the same period a year ago. For its lending arm, disbursement volume was ₦25.21 billion (~$63 million), up 9.1% from FY2019. Also, ₦13.02 billion (~$32.55 million) worth of investments was made on the platform, representing a 365% increase from the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, factors that influenced these numbers last year included launching an iOS app that drove customer acquisition, introducing its </span><a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/what-ussd-why-does-it-matter-mobile-financial-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USSD banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature for lower-income customers; and a social chat feature to enable faster transactions. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106500" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106500" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="485" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PhotoPictureResizer_210201_002339136_crop_1080x770.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Carbon</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in its quest to become a digital bank, Carbon acquired a microfinance bank license. According to Dozie, the license means that Carbon&#8217;s customers are afforded additional protection through depositors&#8217; insurance via the NDIC. The Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal insurance agency, protects depositors and guarantees the settlement of insured funds when a financial institution can no longer repay their deposits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in place, Dozie says the typical Carbon wallet is now a full-fledged bank account, and customers can perform transactions on the platform as they would with any bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Carbon, other startups on the continent have followed suit by releasing year-on-year metrics. In recent memory, most of these startups play in the fintech and crypto-exchange space. But Carbon remains unique amongst these crop of companies as it releases both transaction stats and real insights into its financial performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas transaction stats tend to highlight a seemingly explosive year-on-year growth of a company, a comprehensive view of financials will likely show a mixed performance. For instance, Carbon generated $17.5 million in revenue for FY2019, up 68% from 2018. For that same period, it recorded a 23% decrease in its profit after tax numbers, a 222% rise in total liabilities and 107% increase in assets finishing the year off with a 6% increase in total equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what these numbers look like for 2020. But that&#8217;s not the only event to keep an eye on. In addition to its $10 million Series A from SA-based Net1 UEPS Technologies and a $5million debt financing in 2019 from Lendable, Dozie says the digital bank which also has a presence in Kenya is ramping efforts to raise a Series B round soon to consolidate its position on the continent.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New space startup <a href="https://www.blushiftaerospace.com">bluShift</a> wants to bring a new kind of propellant to the small satellite launching market, with rockets powered by bio-derived rocket fuels. These differ from traditional fuels in that they offer safety advantages during handling, and ecological advantages during production and use. The startup has been working on its solid rocket biofuel since its founding in 2014, and has received grants from the Maine Technology Institute and NASA&#8217;s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to refine its fuel formula and rocket engine design to help it get to this point.</p>
<p>The company achieved a milestone on Sunday with its first rocket launch – a low altitude flight of a small sounding rocket, called Stardust 1.0. It&#8217;s a single-stage prototype, which can only carry 18 lbs of payload, and it&#8217;s designed to achieve suborbital space. That may not seem like much, but it is enough to put small research equipment up into suborbital space, at costs that put launches within range for small companies and academic institutions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106488" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106488" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2106488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106488" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knack Factory/Courtesy Aerospace</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stardust 1.0 is designed to be reusable, though it&#8217;s still a prototype, and the company is also working on Startdust 2.0 which is a second prototype that&#8217;s expected to increase the payload capacity and act as the primary building block for its subsequent production commercial rockets, including Starless Rogue, a two-stage launcher for suborbital missions, and Red Dware, a three-stage, 66-lb capacity launch vehicle that can reach low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s launch looked like it might not have been on track to go well at first, with an initial attempt seeing the rocket&#8217;s ignition light – but without a takeoff. After resetting for a second try, there wasn&#8217;t any ignition. Finally the company did take off late in the day, with a flight that it said &#8220;went perfectly&#8221; on a follow-up call with media.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter blocked access to dozens of accounts in India, including some that belonged to high-profile individuals, on Monday to comply with a “legal demand,” prompting confusion and anger among users who are seeking an explanation for this action.</p>
<p>Among those whose accounts have been withheld in India include Caravan, a news outlet that conducts investigative journalism, political commentator Sanjukta Basu, activist Hansraj Meena, actor Sushant Singh, and Shashi Shekhar Vempati, chief executive of state-run brodcasting agency Prasar Bharti. Accounts of at least two politicians with Aam Aadmi Party &#8212; Preeti Sharma Menon and Jarnail Singh &#8212; that governs the National Capital Territory of Delhi have also been withheld.</p>
<p>At least two popular accounts linked with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farms-protests/india-cuts-internet-near-delhi-as-hundreds-of-farmers-begin-hunger-strike-idUSKBN29Z08R">ongoing protests by farmers</a> &#8212; Kisan Ekta Morcha and Tractor2Twitr &#8212;  in India have also been restricted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At this point, it remains unconfirmed who all have pursued the legal action that prompted Twitter to restrict these accounts in India. The accounts remain accessible to users outside of the country. At least in the case of political commentator Basu, Twitter told him that Indian authorities had issued the legal demand against some accounts that included his and that it was talking with the authorities.</p>
<p>Citing a government source, AFP journalist Bhuvan Bagga <a href="https://twitter.com/Bhuvanbagga/status/1356197006440603649">reported</a> earlier today that India&#8217;s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology directed Twitter to block around 250 tweets and accounts that were using a hashtag to make what it alleged were false, intimidatory and provocative tweets over the weekend. He adds: &#8220;Incitement to genocide is a grave threat to public order and therefore the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) ordered for blocking of these Twitter accounts and Tweets under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.&#8221; A person familiar with the matter corroborated this claim to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said, “many countries have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content. In our continuing effort to make our services available to people everywhere, if we receive a properly scoped request from an authorized entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time. Transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression, so we have a notice policy for withheld content.”</p>
<p>Vinod Jose, executive editor of Caravan, said Twitter didn&#8217;t inform the publication that it was withholding its Twitter account.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Section 69A and the IT Blocking Rules prevent intermediaries like Twitter from disclosing any information about blocking of an account or tweet. The confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules creates a bizarre situation where citizens have the right to challenge blocking of online content but they are unable to do so because they don&#8217;t have access to these legal orders,&#8221; said New Delhi-based advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation, explaining the limitations of this law that citizens face in the country.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s move comes at a time when several Indian journalists are facing charges of sedition over their reporting and social media posts about a protest by farmers last week. Among those journalists who are facing these cases include Rajdeep Sardesai, a high-profile news anchor, and Vinod Jose, executive editor of Caravan.</p>
<p>Twitter, which has amassed about 75 million users in India, has long faced criticism about the way it handles its operations in the country.</p>
<p>Unlike in the United States, Twitter has historically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/twitter-flags-indian-politicians-years-old-tweet-for-violating-its-policy/">miserably failed to perform the tiniest level of content moderation</a> in India.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a handful of benefits for the startup ecosystem and to accelerate the growth of digital services in the annual budget Monday as the South Asian nation looks to revive the economy that was severely-hit amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Sitharaman said the nation has earmarked 1,500 crore Indian rupees ($205.3 million) to incentivize the adoption of digital payments. Market leaders Paytm, Google Pay, and PhonePe are locked in an intense battle to drive people in India to pay digitally, but the firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">struggled to find a viable business model</a> for their core payments service.</p>
<p>Many firms have urged the government to scrap merchant discount rate (MDR), which prevents firms from charging merchants for processing transactions. (Firms in India have agreed that they won&#8217;t charge individuals for processing their payments, but have suggested that they should be able to charge merchants.) No announcement on this front was made today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The budget also proposed extending social security benefits to gig workers and other platform workers and launch a website to help these workers find employment, said Sitharaman. These workers will be protected by minimum wages, she said in the proposal. Additionally, she said women would be allowed to work in all categories and also during night-shifts with adequate protection. &#8220;At the same time, compliance burden on employers will be reduced with single registration and licensing, and online returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the budget, Sitharaman also proposed some tax relief for startup employees when they sell their stakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;During their formative years, startups generally use Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) to attract and retain highly talented employees. ESOP is a significant component of compensation for these employees. Currently, ESOPs are taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise. This leads to cash-flow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the long-term. In order to give a boost to the start-up ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The South Asian nation also proposed broadening the definition of small businesses, increasing the threshold for capitalization to 2 crore Indian rupees (about $275,000), up from existing limit of 50 lakh Indian rupees ($68,750). This will allow many more businesses to come under the small business umbrella and avail relevant benefits such as some tax concessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, considering the fact that in the initial years, a startup may not have adequate profit to avail this deduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of deduction from the existing 7 years to 10 years,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The budget also proposed incentives for incorporation of one-person companies, a move that Sitharaman said will help companies &#8220;grow without restriction on paid up capital and turnover, allowing conversion into any other type of company at any time, reducing the residency limit for an Indian citizen to set up a one-person company from 182 days to 120 days, and allow also non-resident Indians to incorporate one-person companies in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry executives in recent weeks said they were also hoping that India will  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/us-says-india-italy-and-turkey-digital-taxes-are-discriminatory-but-wont-take-any-actions-for-now/">address the digital services tax</a> the country began imposing on foreign firms last year. This was not addressed in the new budget.</p>
<p>Sitharaman also said New Delhi will put together a plan aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the electronics value chain. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here, I propose a scheme focussed on encouraging manufacture of mobile phones, electronic equipment and semi-conductor packaging. Details would be announced later,&#8221; she said. You can read the fully summary of 2021-22 budget <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1693908">here</a>. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and many other companies, has mastered the art of using Twitter to harness fans and promote himself and his interests across as wide an audience as possible. Using some of that momentum, last night he made a vocal debut on a newer platform &#8212; Silicon Valley’s hottest startup right now, Clubhouse, which lets people join rooms to listen in on conversations between hosts and guests.</p>
<p>Musk, fielding a series of mostly softball questions, used the session to &#8220;talk to his base&#8221; on topics ranging from space travel, colonies on Mars, crypto, AI and Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>He managed to bust a few myths about his &#8220;alternative&#8221; positions on several subjects, and at times managed to sound far more nuanced than his meme-propelled, trolling Twitter feed. For example, i<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n contrast to previous expositions on the viability of living on Mars, Musk didn’t paint a rose-colored vision in his conversation. Instead, he said that while Mars exploration is a worthwhile effort to keep humankind alive, life would be hard.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The last quarter of the interview then veered off radically when Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, was brought in (apparently by Musk, but there was a hint of co-ordination behind the scenes).</p>
<p>Suddenly, Musk turned interviewer and had Tenev unpack what had happened in the last week with the Wall Street Bets debacle.</p>
<p>Some saw the Clubhouse room as a massive PR stunt by the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz &#8212; which, in addition to being a big investor in Robinhood and Clubhouse, backs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/astranis-raises-90-million-for-its-next-gen-satellite-broadband-internet-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startups</a> that work with Musk&#8217;s companies.</p>
<p>With more than 5,000 people in the room (breaking Clubhouse&#8217;s previously maintained limits), hundreds of journalists and live streams on YouTube, we did get a little taste of how A16Z&#8217;s new media efforts &#8212; which effectively seek to disintermediate journalists in the public discourse about technology &#8212; might work.</p>
<p>And from the looks of events like last night&#8217;s, like it or leave it, for now at least, it&#8217;s a part of the mix.</p>
<p><strong>Below is our semi-live blog of the session: </strong></p>
<p>As I type this Elon Musk has joined <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> for his first-ever in-person live session and the boundaries of the app have already been tested, with the usual limit of 5,000 people for a room getting passed, and amplified further with Musk fans creating secondary listening rooms on Clubhouse, Youtube and more: <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355983231988862978?s=21">live-streamed here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cba53J1jyPM">here</a> for example.</p>
<p>I am dusting off my creaky live-blogging skillz to cover the interview&#8230; and will update this post as we go (apologies for the appalling typos in the interim).</p>
<p>Musk initially talked about going to Mars and said it was likely to be “hard” for the early pioneers, but that the endeavor ultimately would be a matter of keeping the “candle of civilization alive in the dark”.</p>
<p>Asked if he believed in aliens, he said there wasn’t a single piece of conclusive evidence for the existence of aliens, although it’s “quite possible” there is such a thing as Alien technology, at least at a “7/11” level, and a joked that the evidence so far suggests they might be at the “500 Megapixel camera” or “at least iPhone 6 level”.</p>
<p>He said his kids were not quite into the idea of going to Mars.</p>
<p>Asked about memes online he quipped: “He who controls the memes controls the universe” and it’s about what “influences the zeitgeist”. Memes are a complex form of communication, he said: unlike pictures, memes are “10,000 words not 1,000 words”. They are aspirational and funny. “I love memes, they can be very insightful,” he added.</p>
<p>Does he try to sound crazy on Twitter? “I started crazy on Twitter,” he joked.</p>
<p>He said he doesn’t follow memes himself. Instead, he has “meme dealers,&#8221; friends who pick out and send him memes they think he would like.</p>
<p>He talked about his company <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> and also added that Tesla had one of the strongest AI teams in the world.</p>
<p>With AI, it’s about “how do we stay relevant” and at least “stay ‘along for the ride’ in the good scenario” and couple our minds with AI to harness its power.</p>
<p>“People are already a cyborg,&#8221; he said, referring to a tertiary layer in the form of smartphones. The bit-rate of us typing into a phone is 100 bits. So it’s like trying to talk to a tree, for our smartphones. So with a direct neural interface, we increase it by a huge magnitude, and also spend longer time with a higher magnitude of processing because of this.</p>
<p>You can decide if you want to be a robot or a person. But when you wake in the morning you wouldn’t have to be the same ‘mind’ as you were yesterday. It’s analogous to a video game, not unlike the “Altered Carbon” Netflix series.</p>
<p>There are primitive versions of this in the Neuralink idea, with tiny wires going into your brain.</p>
<p>He claimed Neuralink will be releasing new videos in a month or so, such as of a monkey playing videos with their mind. He didn’t appear to comment on the ethics behind this (one of the many times Musk was not challenged in what he said). The value of the early implant will be enormous and outweigh the risks, is his take.</p>
<p>The moderators asked him about educating 5-year-olds: what should they learn these days?</p>
<p>Musk talked about how video games engage children, but explaining “the why” was important.</p>
<p>“We are programmed to forget the low &#8216;probability of things&#8217; if they aren’t relevant,&#8221; he said. For example, taking apart an engine and putting it together. We need tools, so we understand the relevance. It’s better than taking a “course on wrenches”.</p>
<p>He was asked “why are there not more Elon Musks”? His hard-knocks response: “If you need encouraging words, don’t do a startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also gave his two bitcoins on crypto.</p>
<p>A friend sent him a slice of cake using bitcoin in 2013. “I should have bought it 8 years ago.” he said. “At this point Bitcoin is a good thing. I am a supporter. I am late to the party, but I am a supporter.”</p>
<p>He said it was clear Bitcoin was getting broader acceptance by the financial world. “I don’t have a strong opinion on other currencies.” Dogecoin, he said, was made as joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies, but “fate loves irony.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it also seems to love chaos, in Musk&#8217;s vioew. “The most entertaining outcome is the most likely,&#8221; he said. The most ironic outcome would be Dogecoin becoming the currency of the future.</p>
<p>But maybe not if some social platforms have anything to do with it. He said he made a joke about Bitcoin and his Twitter account got locked.</p>
<p>Attention then turned to his electric car company Tesla. The target is to make 20 million cars and trucks per year. This is a wild &#8212; and again, very unchallenged &#8212; statement: recall that in 2020 it made less than 500,000 cars, and even less trucks. That a long road to travel, in other words.</p>
<p>He also had some thoughts on self-driving. Autonomous vehicles could reach the point where you would rely on them for a significant amount of time in the a week. Autonomous cars would take over for roughly a third of the hours in a weeks, so 60 hours instead of 12, eventually, in his projection. (Again, very blue sky statements here, as there are no fully autonomous cars in free use on roads at this point.)</p>
<p>He also had some thoughts on work in the pandemic and post-pandemic world. Working remotely on Zoom has been tricky for him, he said. “Fear is not the mind-killer, context switching the mind-killer,” he said, of having to switch between disparate subjects on calls.</p>
<p>Would he start another company to address Covid-19 in some way? He joked that he pretty much has his hands full with Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company and others to date.</p>
<p>He talked about the huge advances in vaccine technology, such as the MRNA tech which made the Covid-19 vaccine possible. He seemed very bullish about the vaccine.</p>
<p>While the news today is about the the dearth of supply in vaccines, it seems like he thinks the space for Covid-19 medicines, and specifically inoculations against it, is a crowded market longer term. “There is going to be an avalanche of vaccine,” coming he said. “I guarantee you &#8216;it&#8217; will be thrown away this year.”</p>
<p>There could be an opportunity for producing these in his current enterprises, he hinted. “The Tesla machine can make a bazillion doses super fast,&#8221; he claimed. (Again, no challenge or follow up on that one, either.)</p>
<p>All in all, he made his poison clear on vaccines: “I am not an anti-vaxxer, I am a pro-vaxxer.”</p>
<p>Then a turn to his first years in technology. In Silicon Valley in the early days, he said, he had to ask himself: “Do I watch the internet being built in front of me or do I get involved?”</p>
<p>Still, he recalled being “too shy” to speak to anyone in the lobby of Netscape.</p>
<p>Then he tried to code. He wrote the first maps and directions on the internet. By hand. The Web site only worked during the night as he was using the server on the computer during the day to code.</p>
<p>Marc Andreessen, who was also on the clubhouse session, then quipped that he would get a job the next time he hangs out in the lobby of one of his companies.</p>
<p>Musk gave a hat-tip to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_King">The Last King</a>’ and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81002370">Cobra Kai</a> for his streaming enjoyment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">The Expanse’s</a> plot lines sometimes seem too fantastical to him, he said. He was recommended Devs, Mythic Quest and Ravens Banquet by moderators. Tenet was “pretty good” too, he said. Did he understand it? “If you think too hard about it, it’s not going to make complete sense, but it’s a good movie.”</p>
<p>His knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</a>, remains impressively intact.</p>
<p>Then, a big switching of the gears, as “Vlad The Stock Impaler” was brought into the Clubhouse room to talk about the Game Stop phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Vlad” &#8212; more specifically Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood &#8212; began with an, at times, stumbling attempt to explain what happened last week but was eventually interrogated more thoroughly by Musk.</p>
<p>Musk at this point turned interviewer, and we&#8217;re here doing a bit more comprehensive transcribing because it&#8217;s worth keeping Tenev&#8217;s words in full.</p>
<p>“All right, tell us what really happened. Give us the inside scoop,” Musk said</p>
<p>“This has been a very surreal weekend and week for me,” said Vlad.</p>
<p>Vlad said “one of the really great things is all the people “coming out of the woodwork” to offer support for the company to offer advice. He said this was his first time using Clubhouse. He then made a jokey remark about being an adherent of the “simulation hypothesis”.</p>
<p>Musk brought him back: “The people demand an answer and they want to know the truth.”</p>
<p>Vlad said: “So there&#8217;s an introducing broker-dealer called Robinhood Financial, and that basically is the app that you know and love, it processes trades. You&#8217;re a customer of Robinhood Financial. Then there&#8217;s a clearing broker-dealer, Robinhood Securities, that clears and settles the trades. And then we have Robinhood Crypto, which is our Crypto business… All of these are different entities that are differently operated. So, basically Wednesday of last week. We just had, you know, unprecedented volume, unprecedented load on the system. A lot of these, you know, so-called meme stocks were, you know, going viral on social media, and people were people are joining Robinhood and there was a lot of net buy activity on them.”</p>
<p>He said Robinhood became number one on the iOS App Store and pretty close if not number one on Google Play store.</p>
<p>“Thursday morning I’m sleeping. At 3:30am Pacific, our operations team receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation. So, basically as a broker as a clearing broker. And this is where RobinHood Securities comes in. We have to put up money to the NSCC based on some factors including things like the volatility of the trading activity into certain securities. And this is is the equities business so it&#8217;s based on, stock trading and not options trading or anything else.</p>
<p>So, they give us a file with the deposit and the request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.”</p>
<p>Musk: This is not an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula that they use to calculate that”</p>
<p>Vlad: Just to give context, Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it&#8217;s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right. So, basically, the details are, we don&#8217;t have the full details, it&#8217;s a little bit of an opaque formula, but there&#8217;s a component called the VAR of it, which is value at risk. And that&#8217;s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things although it&#8217;s not fully transparent. So, there are ways to reverse engineer it, but it&#8217;s not kind of publicly shared.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s a special component, which is discretionary. So that kind of acts as a multiplier, and basically</p>
<p>Musk: Discretionary meaning like it&#8217;s just their opinion”</p>
<p>Vlad: There&#8217;s definitely more, more than just their opinion.</p>
<p>Musk: Everyone wants to know, did something shady go down here? It seems weird that you get a sudden $3 billion demand, you know, at 3.30am in the morning. Just suddenly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Vlad: I wouldn&#8217;t impute shadiness to it or anything like that and actually you know the NSCC was reasonable.</p>
<p>They worked with us to actually lower it. So, it wasn’t unprecedented activity. I don&#8217;t have the full context about, you know, what was going on in the NSCC make these calculations.</p>
<p>Musk: Is anyone holding you hostage right now?</p>
<p>Vlad: Thanks for asking. But anyways, so this was obviously nerve-racking, and I actually was asleep at this point, you know, the operations team was fielding this at three o&#8217;clock. And then, you know, we got back, we put our heads together. Our Chief Operating Officer basically said, look, let&#8217;s call up the higher-ups at the NSCC and kind of figure out what&#8217;s going on. Maybe there&#8217;s some way we can work with them. And basically, there was another call. And they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion…. But still a high number.</p>
<p>Vlad said the team then proposed how to manage the risk through the day “marking these volatiles stocks that were driving the activity, positioning closing only. And then, at about an hour before the market closed market opened. So, at 5.30, or five in the morning, they [the NSCC] came back and they said okay, the deposit [should be] 700 million, which we then deposited and paid promptly. And then, everything was fine.</p>
<p>So, that that essentially explains why we had to mark the symbols ‘position closing only’, and also why, you know, we knew this was a bad outcome for customers… Part of what&#8217;s been really difficult is Robinhood stands for, you know, democratizing access to stocks and, yes, we want, we want to give people access so we had no choice in this case, we had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements. And so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.</p>
<p>Musk: Who controls the clearinghouse?</p>
<p>Vlad: It&#8217;s a consortium. It&#8217;s not quite a government agency. You know, I, I don&#8217;t really know the details all that. But, you know, and to be fair… there was legitimate turmoil in the markets. These are unprecedented events with these meme stocks, there was a lot of activity. So, there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants, higher requirements, so it&#8217;s not entirely unreasonable.</p>
<p>But we did operational processes to make sure that customers that had positions could sell their open positions because obviously restricting someone…We got a lot of questions about ‘you had to restrict buying, why didn&#8217;t you also restrict selling?’ And the fact of the matter is, people get really pissed-off if they&#8217;re holding stock and they want to sell it and they can’t. So that’s categorically worse. Lots of other brokers, I think, we&#8217;re in the same situation. Robinhood who was in the news, but you just sort of heard this industry-wide, other brokers, were basically restricted in the same exact activity.</p>
<p>Musk: So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head. Either you put up this money or else. Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river? Or did you have no choice? And if you had no choice that&#8217;s understandable. But then, you know, we’ve got to find out why you have no choice. And who are the people that are saying you have no choice?</p>
<p>Vlad: I think that&#8217;s fair. We have to comply with these requirements, financial institutions have requirements. The formula, behind these requirements… it would obviously be ideal if there was a little bit more transparency so we could plan better around that, but to be fair, we were able to open and serve our customers and 24 hours later, our team raised over a billion dollars in capital so that when we do open tomorrow morning we&#8217;ll be able to, kind of, relax the stringent position limits that we put on these securities on Friday.</p>
<p>Musk: Will there be any limits?</p>
<p>Vlad: Well I think there&#8217;s always going to be some theoretical limit, we don&#8217;t have infinite capital, right? And on Friday, there were limits. So, there&#8217;s always going to have to be some limit, I think the question is, will the limits be high enough to the point where they won&#8217;t impact 99.9-plus percent of customers. So if someone were to deposit $100 billion and decide to trade in one stock that wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</p>
<p>Musk: If you had no choice then you had no choice. It’s a ‘gun to the head situation’. That’s understandable.</p>
<p>Vlad: Yeah, these are unprecedented times, and to be fair to those guys they&#8217;ve been reasonable. So, I think the one thing that is maybe not clear to people is Robinhood is a participant in the financial system. So we have to work with all of these counter-parties, so we do get a lot of questions about, you know, ‘why do you work with market makers?’, why you work with clearinghouses. Vertically integrating… I mean it&#8217;s hard enough to build an introducing… clearing broker-dealer… not too many people have done that. But the financial system that allows customers to trade shares is sort of a complex web of multiple parties… Everyone says it could be better. It could be improved. It&#8217;s just the necessity of trading equities in the US, that you have to do all these things.</p>
<p>Musk: To what degree are you beholden to Citadel?</p>
<p>Vlad: There was a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this and that&#8217;s just false. Market makers execute our trades, they execute trades of every broker-dealer. This was a clearinghouse decision, and it was just based on the capital requirements. So, from our perspective, you know, Citadel and other market makers weren&#8217;t involved in that.</p>
<p>Musk: But wouldn’t they have a strong say on who got put in charge of that organization, since it&#8217;s an industry consortium, not a government regulatory agency?</p>
<p>Vlad: I don&#8217;t have any reason to believe that. I think that&#8217;s just like, you know, then you&#8217;re getting into kind of the conspiracy theories a little bit. So, I just have no reason to believe that that&#8217;s the case, you know.</p>
<p>Musk: Okay. Well, I guess we’ll see what happens with directions. Hopefully, that was insightful or at least a little bit entertaining. “Are you not entertaining?” he said. [Apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBiXPVKuTA">a reference to the movie &#8216;Gladiator&#8217;</a>]</p>
<p>The moderators then thank Musk and Vlad for coming on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Fun claim: Musk said he didn’t know Clubhouse existed up until a week ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking is one of the hardest parts of learning a new language, especially if you don’t have someone to practice with regularly. <a href="https://elsaspeak.com/en/">ELSA</a> is an app that helps by using speech recognition technology to correct pronunciation. Based in San Francisco and Ho Chi Minh City, ELSA announced today it has raised a $15 million Series B, led by VI (Vietnam Investments) Group and SIG. Other participants included returning investors Google’s AI-focused fund Gradient Ventures, SOSV and Monk’s Hill Ventures, along with Endeavor Catalyst and Globant Ventures.</p>
<p>The capital will be used to expand ELSA’s operations in Latin America and build a scalable B2B platform, allowing companies and educational organizations to offers the app’s coaching services to employees or students. Founded in 2015, ELSA, which stands for English Language Speech Assistant, now claims more than 13 million users. Its last round of funding was a $7 million Series A announced in 2019.</p>

<p>In addition to Latin America, ELSA will also focus on expanding in Vietnam, India and Japan, where it saw high demand last year. The company recently formed a partnership with IDP and British Council, which owns the widely-used IELTS English language test and now recommends ELSA to for test preparation. ELSA is also working with language schools in Vietnam like IMAP and Speak Up, online learning platform YOLA and corporate clients including Kimberly Clark, Intel and ATAD.</p>
<p>ELSA co-founder and chief executive officer Vu Van told TechCrunch that many users want to improve their English speaking proficiency for job opportunities and to increase their earning potential. In Vietnam, India and Brazil, people with higher English speaking proficiency can earn about two to three times more than their colleagues, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This motivation drives a lot of demand for our English learner community in Vietnam, India and Brazil, especially during COVID-19 when we’ve seen enormous interest from the LatAm region as well,&#8221; Van added.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, where Van is from, English learners spend a lot of their disposable income on online or offline English training. &#8220;However, the majority of English learners still struggle to improve their speaking skill because other people don’t understand them or they’re afraid to speak it,&#8221; she said. ELSA was designed to give them an accessible resource to help improve their pronunciation and confidence when speaking English.</p>
<p>Other apps focused on English pronunciation include FluentU and Say It. Van said one of ELSA’s main advantages is its proprietary voice recognition AI tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s unique about our AI is that we’ve collected the largest amount of accented English voice data from millions of users that we have used to train our AI model over the last few years, which gives us a higher accuracy in recognizing and understanding non-native English speakers around the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The other existing voice recognition technologies available, by comparison, might understand native speakers well but have a hard time understanding non-native accented English learner communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of providing feedback about individual words, ELSA’s app also corrects individual sounds and gives users detailed information on how to improve their pronunciation, including &#8220;very advanced prosodic speaking features like intonation, rhythm and fluency to help them speak English more naturally, something that our competitors don’t offer,&#8221; Van added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thanksben.com/">Ben</a>, a London-based employee benefits and rewards platform, has raised $2.5 million in funding. The seed round is led by Cherry Ventures, and Seedcamp.</p>
<p>A number of angel investors with backgrounds in fintech and HR tech also participated. They include Paul Forster (founder of Indeed), Taavet Hinrikus (founder of TransferWise), Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas (previously an exec at GoCardless but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/carlos-gonzalez-cadenas-angel-investor-and-coo-of-gocardless-is-joining-index-as-partner/">now a partner at Index Ventures</a>), Philip Reynolds (VP of Engineering at Workday), and Matt Robinson (founder of Nested).</p>
<p>Part fintech, part HR play, Ben has built an employee benefits platform to enable SMEs to offer much more personalised and flexible benefits to employees. The U.K. startup does this via a SaaS for managing benefits, including a benefits marketplace, combined with per-employee debit cards powered by Mastercard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to give employees more individual choice around which benefits they choose, while making it easy to on-board additional providers. This can be via the marketplace or through whitelisting merchant or merchant categories via the employer issued Mastercards, such as food and drink or travel and mobility, or a specific co-working space etc.</p>
<p>“While most companies offer benefits in order to attract and engage team members, and ultimately drive productivity, most solutions don&#8217;t deliver the desired outcomes,” Ben co-founder and CEO Sebastian Fallert tells me. “To have impact, offerings need to work for the individual employees; after all, a ‘benefit’ that’s relevant for somebody working from home in their mid-40s could be next to useless for a new starter in their 20s”.</p>
<p>Fallert says that providing the required level of personalised benefits has been impossible for most small to medium-sized companies due to the “high cost and complexity” of creating and administering personalised programmes. This has seen only large enterprises able to offer flexible benefit programmes where employees get to pick from a range of options. Ben aims to remedy this.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, angel investor and COO of GoCardless, is joining Index as partner&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/carlos-gonzalez-cadenas-angel-investor-and-coo-of-gocardless-is-joining-index-as-partner/embed/#?secret=ELME1J10xu" data-secret="ELME1J10xu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The Ben software platform allows companies to load funds and set individual spend rules on how these can be used,” explains Fallert. “Employees are then able to choose from group benefits, such as private medical insurance, mental wellbeing services, or dental plans, while a real per-employee Mastercard opens the door to pretty much any product or service in a tax-efficient and compliant way”.</p>
<p>The result is a “win-win,” says the Ben CEO. “Employees get tailored benefits, and companies only pay for what’s used, take advantage of tax exemptions and preferred pricing, while streamlining the administration”.</p>
<p>The Ben platform is currently used by smaller and mid-market companies, especially those with a distributed team. “It’s these firms in particular that have to deal with the growing complexity of their programmes to keep up with a more diverse and increasingly remote/distributed workforce,” says Fallert.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ben has three revenue streams: a SaaS fee; interchange revenue every time its cards get used; and, of course, affiliate revenue from its marketplace.</p>
<p>Adds the Ben CEO: “One of our core hypotheses is that there are so many amazing services out there that simply can’t get through to companies as they’re often not relevant for all employees, such as debt consolidation or fertility treatment. With Ben, they get easy distribution on standard commercial terms while companies get to offer an additional benefit without any additional overhead”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite China&#8217;s history of stringent media control, an industry of uninstitutionalized, individual publishers has managed to flourish on social media platforms like Tencent&#8217;s WeChat and ByteDance&#8217;s Toutiao. These self-publishers are called &#8220;We Media&#8221; in the Chinese internet lexicon, denoting the independent power of citizen journalists and content creators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, self-publishers have always had to tread carefully on what they post or risk being targeted by censors who deem them illegal or inappropriate.</p>
<p>The topics they cover are myriad, ranging from fashion and food to politics and current affairs. WeChat, a major destination for self-publishers, hinted last July it had <a href="https://weibo.com/1930378853/J9Pue3PbJ?from=page_1006061930378853_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment#_rnd1612149124822">20 million &#8220;public accounts&#8221;</a>, platforms for individuals to broadcast content and in businesses&#8217; case, reach customers. In 2020, 360 million users read articles published on WeChat public accounts, WeChat founder Allen Zhang <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1olKm1M-18alaHZVrNeS-A">disclosed</a> recently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sina Weibo, China&#8217;s answer to Twitter, has long attracted citizen journalists. In the early days of COVID-19, millions of Chinese users rushed to Weibo seeking facts from accounts like that of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52712358">Fang Fang</a>, an author who chronicled her experience in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Now, a new development in China&#8217;s internet regulation is about to further restrict China&#8217;s tens of millions of self-publishers.</p>
<p>Public accounts that &#8220;provide online news service to the public shall obtain the Internet News Information Permit and other relevant media accreditation,&#8221; according to a new <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-01/22/c_1612887880656609.htm">regulation</a> (translation <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/2021-verified-accounts/">here</a>) published January 22 by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country&#8217;s internet watchdog.</p>
<p>In the following days, WeChat, Baidu, Sohu and other online information services began notifying publishers of the new rule. &#8220;If your account lacks relevant accreditation, you are advised not to edit, report, publish or comment on news about politics, the economy, military, foreign affairs or other major current events,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://developers.weixin.qq.com/community/minihome/doc/000c00f9524608eddd9bbf1405b400">notice</a> sent by WeChat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The WeChat Public Account Platform always commits to providing a green, healthy online environment to users,&#8221; the message adds.</p>
<p>The requirement of news accreditation will likely be a death knell for independent social media publishers that have taken on journalistic roles, particularly those covering politics. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something you can obtain easily unless you&#8217;re an official news outlet or an organization with unmatched resources and background,&#8221; a WeChat account publisher told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Avoiding sensitive topics, such as U.S.-China relations, is always the norm, but the red line on each platform is slightly different, a self-publisher who focuses on finance said. &#8220;Sometimes you will have to try it yourself,&#8221; the person said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s control on news reaches into every corner of the internet, and regulations are always playing catchup with the pace at which new media, such as microblogs and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/china-underage-livestreaming-ban/">live streaming</a>, flourishes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TpkKIKE4df"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/china-underage-livestreaming-ban/">China&#8217;s authorities propose to keep minors out of live streaming</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2017-05/02/c_1120902760.htm">2017</a> to <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2019-01/11/c_1122842142.htm">2018</a>, the cyberspace authority granted news permits to a total of 761 &#8220;internet news services,&#8221; which together operated 743 websites, 563 apps, 119 forums, 23 blogs, 3 microblogs, 2285 public accounts, one instant messenger, and 13 live streaming services. In other words, hard news is off limits for internet services of these categories that operate without a news license. It remains to see how platform operators like WeChat and Sina Weibo work to enforce the rules.</p>
<p>Heightening oversight on online information could have merit when it comes to battling misinformation. The new regulation also calls on operators to set up mechanisms like a creator blacklist to root out fake news. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But the regulation overall could have an adverse impact on freedom of expression in China, the International Federation of Journalists <a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-authorities-ban-self-publishing-by-journalists-and-censor-online-content.html">warned</a>.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The vaguely defined new rule comes at a time when &#8216;self-media&#8217; has gained huge popularity in China and journalists have begun using such platforms to publish work which was axed by their organisations,&#8221; the IFJ <a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-authorities-ban-self-publishing-by-journalists-and-censor-online-content.html">said</a> in a statement published on January 28.</p>

In a statement on military-owned television, the army said a year-long state of emergency would be declared in Myanmar and power handed to military chief Min Aung Hlaing.</p>
<p><a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6">According to NetBlocks</a>, a non-governmental organization that monitors digital rights, cybersecurity and internet governance around the world, internet disruptions began around 3AM Monday morning local time, with national connectivity falling to 75% of ordinary levels, and then reaching about 50% around 8AM. Data shows that the cuts affected several network operators, including the state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and Telenor. NetBlocks said &#8220;preliminary findings [indicate] a centrally ordered mechanism of disruption targeting cellular and some fixed-line services, progressing over time as operators comply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aye Min Thant, a former correspondent for Reuters who is now the Tech for Peace program manager at Phandeeyar, a tech accelerator in Yangon, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_ayeminthant/status/1356064981712691200">tweeted</a> that she had been logged out of Signal and Telegram overnight, and can’t log in again because cell service is shut down, preventing her from getting verification codes.</p>
<p>The detainment of Suu Kyi and other National League for Democracy leaders comes days after Myanmar’s military attempted to downplay concerns about a coup by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/myanmar-military-says-it-will-protect-and-follow-constitution-idUSKBN29Z09L">stating it would protect the country’s constitution</a>, despite its allegations of vote fraud in November’s election.</p>
<p>Myanmar came under direct military rule after a 1962 coup replaced the civilian government. In 1990, free elections were held and the NLD won, but the military refused to give up power, placing Suu Kyi under house arrest. After 2011, a transition to democratic rule gradually began, but the military still controlled much of the government.</p>
<p>The NLD has <a href="https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/mounting-evidence-myanmar-highlights-need-full-cooperation-investigations-3-cs-genocide">also been accused of being complicit</a> in the military’s ethnic cleansing campaign against Rohingya Muslims and disenfranchising opponents.</p>
<p>While Myanmar’s government does not practice direct censorship of internet content, <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/myanmar/freedom-net/2019">Freedom House gave the country a score of only 36 out of 100</a> in 2019, citing manipulation of online content by both the military and NLD, and prosecution that forces individuals to self-censor. In June 2019, the government banned the internet in parts of Rakhine and Chin State, the sites of ongoing fighting between the Myanmar military and Arakan Army. Human rights observers including the <a href="https://time.com/5910040/myanmar-internet-ban-rakhine/">Human Rights Watch</a> have said that the internet ban prevents people in those areas from communicating with their families, getting information about COVID-19 or accessing aid.</p>

<p><b>Alpha Global forms to unite Alphabet workers around the world</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Global announced its formation earlier this week to unite Alphabet workers around the world, including those from the Alphabet Workers Union in the United States, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22243138/google-union-alphabet-workers-europe-announce-global-alliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verge reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alpha Global, which is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, aims to create a common worker strategy, support fellow workers and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A just Alphabet has wide-ranging implications for our democracies and societies,” </span><a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/sites/default/files/imce/alphabet_commitment_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Global said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That is why we are joining together to demand fundamental human rights for all workers in Alphabet operations, including the right to form or join a union and the right to bargain collectively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should mention that you’ll be able to hear more about Alphabet Workers Union at Alpha Global at TC Sessions: Justice directly from Parul Koul, the executive chair of Alphabet Workers Union. You can </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">snag your tickets here for just $5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Perhaps it’s the commoditization of Black culture. </span></p>

<p><b>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative launches the Justice Accelerator Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has created a new criminal justice reform group, </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/1/27/22251211/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-czi-criminal-justice-immigration-overhaul"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recode reported this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $350 million put toward the new Justice Accelerator Fund over the next five years, the organization will focus on criminal justice advocacy. JAF will be led by Ana Zamora, CZI’s current director of criminal justice.</span></p>
<p><b>NLRB gets a new acting general counsel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden named Peter Sung Ohr the new acting general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board. As Vice’s Lauren Kaori Gurley noted, Ohr’s appointment has the potential to be very good for gig workers and workers rights, in general.</span></p>

<p><b>ServiceNow launches racial equity fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $100 million set aside for the fund, the enterprise software company’s racial equity fund aims to “drive more sustainable wealth creation by funding homeownership, entrepreneurship, and neighborhood revitalization within Black communities in 10 regions across the United States,” </span><a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/racial-equity-fund.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a nugget on how it’ll work:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ServiceNow Racial Equity Fund will buy smaller community loans to increase the lending capacity for local banks. By increasing access to capital, the investment will facilitate homeownership and entrepreneurship in Black communities, leading to job creation and wider economic growth. The investment, which is the first of its kind for ServiceNow, will initially focus investments in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York, Orlando, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. – locations where ServiceNow has significant operations and community presence.</span></p></blockquote>

<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>This week was whatever you wanted it to be. A rising up of the proletariat. A case of weaponized disinformation. A rally for regulation&#8230; or perhaps deregulation of financial markets. Choose your own adventure with the starting point being one flavor of chaos leading into a slightly more populist blend of chaos.</p>
<p>At the end of it, a lot of long-time financiers are confused, a lot of internet users are using rent money to buy stock in Tootsie Roll, a lot of billionaires are finding how intoxicating adopting a &#8220;for-the-little-guy!&#8221; persona on Twitter can be, and here I am staring at the ceiling wondering if there&#8217;s any institution in the world trustworthy enough that the internet can&#8217;t turn it into a lie.</p>
<p>This week, my little diddy is about meme stocks, but more about the idea that once you peel away the need to question why you actually trust something, it can become easier to just blindly place that faith in more untrustworthy places. All the better if those places are adjacent to areas where others place trust.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones had its worst week since October because retail investors, organized in part on Reddit, turned America&#8217;s financial markets into the real front page of the internet. Boring, serious stocks like Facebook and Apple reported their earnings and the markets adjusted accordingly, but in addition to the serious bits of news, the Wall Street page was splashed with break neck gains from &#8220;meme stocks.&#8221; While junk stocks surging is nothing new, the idea that a stock can make outrageous gains based on nothing and then <em>possibly</em> hold that value based on a newly formed shared trust is newer and much more alarming.</p>
<p>The most infamous of these stocks was GameStop. <em>(If you&#8217;re curious about GameStop&#8217;s week, there are at least 5 million stories across the web to grab your attention, here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">one</a>. Side note: collectively we seem to have longer attention spans post-Trump.)</em></p>
<p>So, Americans already don&#8217;t have too much institutional faith. Looking through some long-standing <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx">Gallup research,</a> compared to the turn of the century, faith in organized religion, the media, most wings of government, big business and banks has decreased quite a bit. The outliers in what Americans do seem to trust more than they did 20 or so years ago are small businesses and the military.</p>
<p>This is all to say that it&#8217;s probably not stellar that people don&#8217;t trust anything, and me thinking that the internet could probably disrupt every trusted institution except the military probably only shows my lack of creative thinking when it comes to how the web could democratize the Defense Department. As you might guess from that statement, I think democratizing access to certain institutions can be bad. I say that with about a thousand asterisks leading to footnotes that you&#8217;ll never find. I also don&#8217;t think the web is done disrupting institutional trust by a long shot, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Democratizing financial systems sounds a lot better from a populist lift, until you realize that the guys users are competing against are playing a different game with other people&#8217;s money. This saga will change plenty of lives but it won&#8217;t end particularly well for a most people exposed to &#8220;infinite upside&#8221; day trading.</p>
<p>Until this week, in my mind Robinhood was only reckless because it was exposing (or &#8220;democratizing access to&#8221; &#8212; their words) consumers to risk in a way that most of them probably weren&#8217;t equipped to handle. Now, I think that they&#8217;re reckless because they didn&#8217;t anticipate that OR how democratized access could lead to so many potential doomsday scenarios and bankrupt Robinhood. They quietly raised a $1 billion liquidity lifeline this week after they had to temporarily shut down meme stock trading, a move that essentially torched their brand and left them the web&#8217;s most hated institution. (Facebook had a quiet week)</p>
<p>This kind of all feeds back into this idea I&#8217;ve been feeding that scale can be very dangerous. Platforms seem to need a certain amount of head count to handle global audiences, and almost all of them are insufficiently staffed. Facebook announced this week in its earnings call that it has nearly 60,000 employees. This is a company that now has its own Supreme Court; that&#8217;s too big. If your institution is going to be massive and centralized, chances are you need a ton of people to moderate it. That&#8217;s something at odds with most existing internet platforms. Realistically, the internet would probably be happier with fewer of these sweeping institutions and more intimate bubbles that are loosely connected. That&#8217;s something that the network effects of the past couple decades have made harder but regulation around data portability could assist with.</p>
<p>Writing this newsletter, something I&#8217;m often reminded is that while it feels like everything is always changing, few things are wholly new. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/jonathan-lebed-s-extracurricular-activities.html">This great NYT profile from 2001 written by Michael Lewis</a> is a great reminder of that, chronicling a 15-year-old who scammed the markets by using a web of dummy accounts and got hounded by the SEC but still walked away with $500k. Great read.</p>
<p>In the end, things will likely quiet down at Robinhood. There&#8217;s also the distinct chance that they don&#8217;t and that those meme traders just ignited a revolution that&#8217;s going to bankrupt the company and torch the globals markets, but you know things will probably go back to normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until next week,<br />
Lucas Matney</p>

I&#8217;ll try to keep these updates GameStop free, but one quick note from the peanut gallery. The SEC isn&#8217;t all that happy about the goings ons in the market this week and they&#8217;re mad, probably mostly at Robinhood. They got pretty terse with their statement. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/sec-issues-statement-on-past-weeks-turbulent-market-activity-prompted-by-reddit-fueled-gamestop-run/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

The update will force apps to essentially ask users whether they&#8217;d like to be tracked across apps. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

Celebrity investing has been popular forever, but it&#8217;s gotten way more common in the venture world in recent years. Reputation transfer teamed with the fact that money is so easy to come by for top founders, means that if you are choosing from some second-tier fund or The Chainsmokers, you might pick The Chainsmokers. On that note, actor Robert Downey Jr. raised a rolling fund to back climate tech startups, we&#8217;ve got all the deets. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/robert-downey-jr-is-launching-a-new-rolling-venture-fund-to-back-sustainability-startups/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

Ah poor Adam Neumann, poor SoftBank. If only they&#8217;d kept their little &#8220;tech company&#8221; under wraps for another couple years and left that S-1 for a kinder market with less distaste for creative framing. It seems that WeWork is the next target to get SPAC&#8217;d and be brought onto public markets via acquisition. I&#8217;m sure everything will go fine. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/report-wework-could-be-getting-spacd-soon-too/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

Big tech is a gentlemen&#8217;s game, generally big tech CEOs play nice with each other in public and save their insults for the political party that just fell out of power. This week, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg were a little less friendly. Zuckerberg called out Apple by name in their earnings investor call and floated some potential unfair advantages that Apple might have. Them&#8217;s fighting words. Cook was more circumspect as usual and delivered a speech that was at times hilariously direct in the most indirect way possible about how much he hates Facebook. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/"><strong>More</strong></a></p>

<h2>Extra things</h2>
<p><em>Tidbits from our paywalled Extra Crunch content:</em><br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder/"><strong>The 5 biggest mistakes I made as a first-time startup founder</strong></a><br />
&#8220;I and the rest of the leadership team would work 12-hour days, seven days a week. And that trickled down into many other employees doing the same. I didn’t think twice about sending emails, texts or slacks at night and on weekends. As with many startups, monster hours were simply part of the deal.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/fintechs-could-see-100-billion-of-liquidity-in-2021/"><strong>Fintechs could see $100 billion of liquidity in 2021</strong></a><br />
&#8220;For the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index. While the underlying performance of these companies was strong, the pandemic further bolstered results as consumers avoided appearing in-person for both shopping and banking. Instead, they sought — and found — digital alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/"><strong>Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020</strong></a><br />
&#8220;What is driving generally positive venture capital results for Africa in recent quarters? Giuliani told TechCrunch in a follow-up email that &#8216;investment in Africa is being driven on the one hand by a broadening base for early-stage ecosystem support organizations, including accelerators, seed funds, syndicates and angel investing,” and “consolidation,” which is aiding both “growth-stage deals and a burgeoning M&amp;A market.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new Netflix film &#8220;The White Tiger&#8221; tells the story of Balram, who is born to a poor family in the Indian village of Laxmangarh and escapes by using his intelligence and determination, ultimately becoming a successful entrepreneur in Bangalore.</p>
<p>Viewers knows this from the start, as Balram (played by Adarsh Gourav) narrates his life story in an email, apparently written to explain his success to China&#8217;s visiting head of state. That narration is one of the best things about the movie, providing plenty of black comedy while also allowing Balram to justify his choices in what — by his own admission — is an increasingly disturbing story.</p>
<p>As we explain in the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, &#8220;The White Tiger&#8221; makes a convincing case for the ruthlessness needed to escape from poverty, while also painting a damning portrait of Balram&#8217;s employers, the American-educated Ashok (Rajkummar Rao) and Pinky (Priyanka Chopra Jonas), whose ostensible warmth and compassion only go so far.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If &#8220;The White Tiger&#8221; falls short at all, it&#8217;s in comparison to &#8220;Parasite,&#8221; a film that deals with similar themes in even more ambitious and virtuosic ways. But a movie can fail to reach the heights of &#8220;Parasite&#8221; while still being quite good.</p>
<p>In addition to our review, we also discuss <a href="https://wonderland-at-home.myshopify.com">The Mother Box</a>, a $130 meal kit tied to the March release of Zack Snyder&#8217;s cut of &#8220;Justice League&#8221; on HBO Max.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>What a week. What a <em>month</em>. Are you doing all right? It’s okay if you are tired. We all are. That’s why we have weekends.</p>
<p>Let’s reflect on what happened this week: Individual traders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">outraged</a> more professional investors by doing something hilarious, namely taking a trade that made some sense &#8212; betting that an atrophying physical retailer was going to continue obsolesce &#8212; and inverting it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By going long on GameStop, investors flipped the script on the smart money. Then all heck snapped free, some stocks got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">blocked on trading services</a>, Congress got mad, billionaires started to front on Twitter like they were the Common Man, some cryptos surged, including <em>Dogecoin</em> of all things, and as we headed into the weekend nothing was truly resolved. It was weird.</p>
<p>Let’s talk over the lessons we’ve learned. First, don’t short a stock so heavily that you are at risk of having the trade exposed and inverted to your detriment. Second, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">fintech startups that TechCrunch has covered for years</a> were more brittle than anticipated, either thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">reserve requirements or simple platform risk</a>. And third, things can <em>always</em> get dumber.</p>
<p>Evidence of that final lesson came during the week’s news cycle in which it became known that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/report-wework-could-be-getting-spacd-soon-too/">WeWork might pursue a public listing via a SPAC</a>. So much for this year being more serious and normal than 2020.</p>
<p>But let’s stop recapping and get into our main topic today, namely a chat that I had with the person I actually work for, <a href="https://twitter.com/gurugk">Guru Gowrappan</a>, the CEO of Verizon Media Group (VMG). For those who don’t know, Verizon owns VMG, which in turn owns TechCrunch. VMG is a collection of assets, ranging from Yahoo to media brands to technology products. It does billions in yearly revenue, which should help frame how far above my seat &#8212; an excellent perch inside of TechCrunch, but not one that comes with org-chart stature &#8212; Guru sits.</p>
<p>Very far away.</p>
<p>But we follow each other on Twitter and after Verizon reported earnings this week, inclusive of some honestly pretty good numbers from VMG <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1354053674964807681">that I tweeted about</a>, I got about half an hour of Guru’s time. This meant that I had my boss’s boss’s [etc] boss on the record with zero agenda. How could I say no?</p>
<p>For context, VMG <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/quarterly-reports/4q-2020-earnings-conference-call-webcast">generated</a> $2.3 billion in Q4 revenue, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/file/52729/download?token=CdDAGqL6">described</a> that as “the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition.” What drove the result? Per the Verizon earnings call, “strong advertising trends with demand-side platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year.”</p>
<p>If you are Guru or, frankly, your humble servant, the growth was welcome after VMG’s revenue had dipped to $1.4 billion in Q2 2020, off 24.5% from its year-ago result.</p>
<p>I had a few questions: Would the recent advertising momentum persist in 2021, something that could impact a host of businesses far beyond the VMG org; how important was it to Verizon that VMG had managed to post year-over-year growth; how he expects to balance commerce revenue and journalism; and what Guru thinks about new media products like the recent rebirth of newsletter tech, something that Substack and Twitter and even Facebook are tinkering with.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding strong advertising performance in the final months of the year during COVID, Guru said that “the core fundamentals [of] the market dynamics have changed so that they’re more permanent,” adding that consumer behavior is now “more digital, more online” than before.</li>
<li>The VMG CEO declined to share Q1 2021 expectations in detail, but did note that VMG is aiming to “continue [its] momentum.”</li>
<li>Part of that momentum comes from subscription products, which Guru cited as a win: <em>“If you look at one of the trends that happened due to COVID, consumers [are] moving to more trusted content and want to spend more time and money on consuming subscription-based products [&#8230;] TechCrunch/Extra Crunch grew almost 196% year-on-year.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>My read of his answer to where we are today is that it’s not a bad time to be in the online media game, which isn’t something that has been true much in the past few years, looking around the remains of the journalism industry.</li>
<li>Regarding VMG’s home inside of Verizon &#8212; something that I’ve thought about after <a href="https://digiday.com/media/they-wanted-to-unload-it-bad-why-huffpost-made-sense-for-buzzfeed-and-verizon-media-group/">the Buzzfeed-HuffPost deal</a> &#8212; I asked Guru if VMG’s recent financial performance made our company more attractive to Verizon, and if we have proven the bet that we were trying to make. This, by the way, is the sort of question that is pretty easy to write down, but slightly harder to ask when you are talking to someone who could terminate you at will. Anyway, Guru said “completely” in response. The VMG CEO summarized the Verizon CEO as saying that the media business is “core” to Verizon, and that our parent company “will continue to invest in the media business while we continue to deliver on our promise.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">So sign up for Extra Crunch</a>.</li>
<li>Guru said VMG won’t exchange revenue for credibility when it comes to promoting e-commerce across its platform: “At no point will we trade dollar value in a transaction for trust; there’s no way. [&#8230;] The editorial team keeps me honest,” he said, adding that he stays out of changes that might upset journalistic balance. That was good to hear.</li>
<li>And finally, are there <strong>new media products</strong> that VMG may want to emulate, or buy? Guru was generally bullish on personalization, but declined to dish that VMG is about to buy Substack or anything like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and I asked if VMG is going to sell, or otherwise divest, any other media properties in the wake of the HuffPost-BuzzFeed decision. Guru said that the Verizon CEO said that the broader company is “fully committed” to the media business, and that that won’t be “built upon divestment.” Instead, he said, it will be built “upon investing and growing,” adding that there are “no plans to sell any additional properties.” As I like my health insurance, that was nice to hear.</p>
<p>I understand that the above is not a standard sort of Exchange entry, but one thing that I will always try to do is take the conversations that come my way thanks to my job, and bring them to you.</p>
<p>Now, back to venture capital.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>GameStop was your entire Twitter feed this week but there is other stuff you need to know. Alfred, a US-based fintech <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/01/171628-u-s-fintech-albert-raises-100-million-through-series-c-funding-round-led-by-general-atlantic/">raised $100 million</a> on Tuesday, to pick an example. The company fuses digital intelligence and humans to help users manage their financial lives. Neat.</p>
<p>And adding to our recent data-focused coverage of 2020 venture data &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">dive into the African VC market</a> &#8212; investing group Work-Bench <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/the-state-of-enterprise-tech-in-nyc-2h-2020-funding-report">put together a look</a> at how NYC’s enterprise tech scene performed in the second half of last year. This is the exact sort of data I would parse for you during a more regular week. But since we had <em>this</em> week, you have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Sticking to data, <a href="https://www.hallothere.com/">Hallo</a>, a startup that helps companies recruit more diverse candidates, dropped a sheaf of data in its “<a href="https://medium.com/halloapp/startups-raised-over-12-billion-in-q4-2020-only-40-were-led-by-black-founders-694d39ab866c">Black Founder Funding Q4 2020</a>” report. Read it. If you don’t have time, I’ll give you the headline stat that both caught my eye and depressed my heart<em>: “Hallo&#8217;s research found that out of the 1,537 companies analyzed [in Q4 2020], 40 were led by Black founders.” </em></p>
<p>And this week I got to yammer with Microsoft after it <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q2/press-release-webcast">reported earnings</a>. Saving most of that for a later date, two things were clear: The cloud world still has oodles of growth ahead of it, which is good news for a large chunk of the startup software market. And if you wanted more data on Teams’ growth to better understand why Salesforce bought Slack, wait another quarter.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>Closing out, in August of 2014 I came up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/free-startup-idea-burritocannon/">the idea for a burrito cannon food delivery service</a>. You would push a button in an app, and it would deliver a burrito to your office sans the need for you to make choices. Then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/yo-guys-postmates-built-burritocannon-for-me/">Postmates actually built a burrito cannon into its app</a>, which was both hilarious and fun.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021, and Postmates is now part of Uber. And it is <a href="https://postmates.com/blog/can-jerry-rice-catch-a-100-yard-burrito"><em>back</em> with the return of the burrito cannon</a>:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qs9zZVptIwM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>I did not anticipate that my lazy, stupid idea would help get an NFL star, over a half decade later, to sprint down a field as an industrial-scale potato cannon shot a Mexican delight in his direction. But it’s 2021 and this is where we are.</p>
<p>Evidence, I think, that <em>all</em> my startup ideas are brilliant,</p>
